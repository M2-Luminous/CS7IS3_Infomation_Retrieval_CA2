On behalf of the regional party committee, people's congress standing committee, people's government, and committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I extend my heartfelt regards and holiday greetings to the peasants, herdsmen, workers, intellectuals, and comrades of all nationalities across Tibet; PLA commanders and fighters stationed in Tibet; officers and men as well as political and law officers of Tibet People's Armed Police Corps; patriots from of all nationalities and circles; and all of you here! Meanwhile, I would like to express my warm greetings to Tibetan people outside Tibet and my heartfelt gratitude and best wishes to people at home and abroad who have shown their concern, support, and offered assistance in Tibet's socialist modernization drive! Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line in 1993, Tibet earnestly followed the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress and the fourth enlarged plenary session of the fourth regional party committee and always made economic construction its central task to launch a profound antiseparatist struggle and the work for a stable situation. Tibet closely adhered to the goal of establishing a socialist market economic structure and seized the opportunity to deepen reform and open wider to the outside world. With a united struggle and the unremitting efforts of the party, government, army, police, people, all nationalities, and all walks of life in the region, Tibet has further developed the economy, stablized its social situation, unified all nationalities, and made new progress in various social undertakings. Tibet's economy has particularly displayed a momentum for sustained, rapid, and healthy development: Tibet achieved 3.65 billion yuan in total output value of goods and services, up 8.1 percent over the previous year in terms of comparable prices; this includes 1.77 billion yuan achieved by primary industry, up 4.9 percent; 530 million yuan by secondary industry, up 16.6 percent; and 1.35 billion yuan by tertiary industry, up 9.5 percent. Tibet saw its sixth bumper harvest in agriculture and steady economic growth in agricultural and pastoral areas, with per capita net income of 515 yuan for peasants and herdsmen. Industrial and transport enterprises improved their efficiency and basically achieved simultaneous growth in production, sales, and economic returns. Tibet's foreign trade thrived and tourism maintained good momentun for development -- a substantial step forward in opening up. The construction of infrastructure, focusing on energy resources, transportation, and telecommunications, proceeded smoothly. Localities improved their economic strengthen and collected 149 million yuan in revenue. Urban and rural markets were brisk, commodity prices were basically stable, and people continued to improve their living standards. New progress was also made in science, technology, education, culture, public health, sports, and other social undertakings. All of these encourages us to march forward in the new year with full confidence. The year 1994 is a crucial year for Tibet to continue the establishment of a socialist market economy as well as an important year to maintain good momentum for economic development. This year, Tibet should make reform, development, and stability its main theme in various kinds of work and comprehensively implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the fifth enlarged plenary session of the 4th regional party committee, and the regional economic work conference. Tibet should firmly adhere to the central work of economic construction and strive to advance the establishment of a socialist market economy, the work of stabilizing the situation, and the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. Reform is the driving force of economic development. In reforming Tibet's economic system, we should adhere to the criterion of whether it will develop productive forces, seize the opportune time, promote reform as a whole, stress the main points, and keep our reform framework and structure in line with those of the state. Taking Tibet's actual situation into consideration, we should be firm in action, flexible in policies, and stable in process. This year, Tibet's reform is arduous because it requires greater efforts, wider range, and better quality. Therefore, we must adhere to investigation and study, extensively solicit opinions, and seek perfection through scientific ways in making reform policies and make sure that we have well-conceived plans, meticulous organization, and earnest practice. Reform measures involving the immediate interests of the people must go through assessment, coordination, experimentation, and other effective ways. Reform will surely touch or break old systems, economic relations, and the structure of interests, and will produce new contradictions, problems, and difficulties. Party committees and people's governments at various levels should work diligently and initiate and implement various important reform measures in a down-to-earth manner on the one hand; people of all nationalities and circles should, one the other hand, attach importance to the overall situation, take overall and long-term interests into consideration, consciously support and engage in the cause of reform, and make sure that Tibet will make breakthrough progress in various reforms this year through the concerted efforts of all sectors and all walks of life across the region. Development is the last word. It is the common aspiration of all nationalities as well as our central work for maintaining sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and developin Tibet's economy as soon as possible. Therefore, we should continue to broaden our minds for economic development, strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, make greater efforts to restructure the economy, and achieve the integration of rapid development and higher economic efficiency. This year's economic work should center on increasing the income of peasants and herdsmen and vigorously developing the economy in the agricultural and pastoral areas, while stepping up the pace of reform; increase enterprises' economic returns as a whole with the focus on further changing state enterprises' operating mechanisms; actively create new factors for economic growth under the guidance of industrial policies; and continue to implement the strategy of revitalizing Tibet with science and education with a view to improving labor quality and the level of productive forces. We should concentrate our efforts on economic development and make sure that Tibet's economy grows at a rate of 8 percent this year. The maintenance of social stability is the prerequisite for smooth progress in reform, opening up, and economic development. We must bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's dictum that "stability is of overriding importance;" correctly understand and handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability; and correctly understand and handle contradictions of the two different natures. Splittist activities are the major factor undermining Tibet's social and political situation; and they pose the gravest obstacle to the region's reform and development. Therefore, we must always adhere to the principle of grasping two links at the same time, resolutely cracking down, according to the law, on hostile elements who try to split the motherland and stir up trouble to the detriment of stability, while continuing to strike swiftly and severely in accordance with the law, at serious criminal offenders and economic criminals who disrupt and interfere with reform, development, and social stability. Meanwhile, under the circumstances of expediting reform and opening up and of changing to the new system from the old, and in the process of establishing a socialist market economy, there will certainly be changes cropping up in social contradictions and new features in the contradictions among the people. We must pay strict attention to contradictions among the people in the new era, and familiarize ourselves with the policy, strategy, and correct methods for handling contradictions among them. Leading cadres at all levels should set a good example in intensifying investigation and study, improving work style, putting the interests of the people above anything else, and overcoming bureaucratism, formalism, and other unhealthy practices. They should go down to the grass roots, mingle with the masses, and work on the frontline of production to solve problems on the spot. They should visit problem spots to understand public feelings, localities with newly emerging things and changes to sum up experiences, and backward areas to open up a new situation in work. In a nutshell, they should deliver the kind concern of the party and the government to every household. At present, particular attention must be paid to helping poverty-stricken peasants and herdsmen, workers of deficit-ridden enterprises, retirees, and various categories of recipients of government aid solve practical problems and do everything possible to provide arrangements for their production and everyday life. Only by so doing will the people support the policies of the party and the government even more, give us greater trust, and take the initiative to help and coordinate with us in handling various social contradictions and problems and will they join us in consolidating and developing the excellent situation characterized by stability and unity in Tibet. Comrades, friends: Accelerating reform, promoting reform, and ensuring stability are the three major tasks of Tibet's work in 1994, whose accomplishment is dependent upon joint struggle by all party, government, army, and armed police organizations and the people of all nationalities and in all circles throughout the region. We must rally more closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleur, grasp the overall situation in the light of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, seize the historic opportunity, heighten our spirit, and advance courageously in unity to greet the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region with outstanding achievements. In conclusion, once again may all of you as well as the people of all nationalities and in all circles across Tibet have a happy new year!
