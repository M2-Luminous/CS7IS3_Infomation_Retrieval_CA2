FR940622-0-00078 FR940622-0-00011 §1003.105 Exclusion from participation in Medicare and State health care programs. (a) (1) Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the following persons may be subject, in lieu of or in addition to any penalty or assessment, to an exclusion from participation in Medicare for a period of time determined under §1003.107. The OIG will also direct each appropriate State agency to exclude the person from each health care program for the same period of time_ (i) Any person who is subject to a penalty or assessment under §1003.102 (a) or (b)(1) through (b)(4). (ii) Any responsible physician who_ (A) Knowingly violates section 1867 of the Act or §489.24 of this title on or after December 22, 1987, but before July 1, 1990; (B) Knowingly and willfully, or negligently, violates section 1867 of the Act or §489.24 of this title on or after July 1, 1990 but before May 1, 1991; or (C) Commits a gross and flagrant, or repeated, violation of section 1867 of the Act or §489.24 of this title on or after May 1, 1991. For purposes of this section, a gross and flagrant violation is one that presents an imminent danger to the health, safety or well-being of the individual who seeks emergency examination and treatment or places that individual unnecessarily in a high-risk situation. (2) Nothing in this section will be construed to limit the Department's authority to impose an exclusion without imposing a penalty. (b)(1) With respect to determinations under §1003.102 (b)(2) or (b)(3), or with respect to violations occurring on or after December 22, 1987 and before July 1, 1990 under §1003.105(a)(1)(ii), a physician may not be excluded if the OIG determines that he or she is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community. (2)(i) With respect to any exclusion based on liability for a penalty or assessment under §1003.102 (a), (b)(1), or (b)(4), the OIG will consider an application from a State agency for a waiver if the person is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community. With respect to any exclusion imposed under §1003.105(a)(1)(ii), the OIG will consider an application from a State agency for a waiver if the physician's exclusion from the State health care program would deny beneficiaries access to medical care or would otherwise cause hardship to beneficiaries. (ii) If a waiver is granted, it is applicable only to the State health care program for which the State requested the waiver. (iii) If the OIG subsequently obtains information that the basis for a waiver no longer exists, or the State agency submits evidence that the basis for the waiver no longer exists, the waiver will cease and the person will be excluded from the State health care program for the remainder of the period that the person is excluded from Medicare. (iv) The OIG notifies the State agency whether its request for a waiver has been granted or denied. (v) The decision to deny a waiver is not subject to administrative or judicial review. (3) For purposes of this section, the definitions contained in §1001.2 of this chapter for ``sole community physician'' and ``sole source of essential specialized services in a community'' apply. (c) When the Inspector General proposes to exclude a nursing facility from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, he or she will, at the same time he or she notifies the respondent, notify the appropriate State licensing authority, the State Office of Aging, the long-term care ombudsman, and the State Medicaid agency of the Inspector General's intention to exclude the facility. 7. Section 1003.106 is amended by adding a heading to paragraph (a), adding paragraph (a)(4), and revising the introductory text of paragraph (b) to read as follows: §1003.106 Determinations regarding the amount of the penalty and assessment.
