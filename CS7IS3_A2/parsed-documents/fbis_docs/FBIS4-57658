Elvia Moreno filed this report: [Moreno] Good afternoon. Signing a piece of paper does not guarantee the fulfillment of peace and reconciliation accords in Chiapas as long as there is not a process of change and public action to change the attitude toward Indians and end discrimination against Indians, Bishop Samuel Ruiz said. Interviewed at the Mexico City International Airport, the bishop said that after the peace accords are signed, all sectors must be fully conscious of the new situation. This should be reflected in a profound change in the relationship between society, government, and the country's Indian peoples. Here is some of what Bishop Ruiz said. [Begin Ruiz recording] The situation has not changed much, nor will it change by signing a piece of paper. Only joint efforts that we must all undertake will generate change. We must change our attitude toward Indians. We must end discrimination against Indians, which occurs even here in the capital, where we find Indians on the streets. No one knows why they sell chewing gum on the streets [words indistinct] their community. We must all be fully aware of this situation so we can change this relationship in society. The proposals and the Indians' answers will soon be discussed. [end recording] [Moreno] The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas said, however, that Indians have noted certain modifications that may lead toward a different Mexico, even though it may not be perfect. Bishop Samuel Ruiz said today's Mexico is not the same as that of 31 December of last year, although it may not yet be ideal. This is the end of my report. Good afternoon. [Announcer] Upon arriving in Chiapas State, Bishop Samuel Ruiz reported that the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] had sent him a communique, which he hopes contains specific answers from the EZLN on their determination to attain peace. Maricarmen Camacho filed the following report. [Camacho] Peace Mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz said he had been notified that an EZLN communique had been sent to him. He voiced his hope that this communique contains the EZLN's response on a date for signing the peace agreement. The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas made these comments in his first news conference in Chiapas State since his visit to Rome: [Begin Ruiz recording] Yesterday, I was called and told the EZLN had issued a communique. [Words indistinct] I will let you know what it is all about once I find out. I imagine it deals with the EZLN response to the government proposal. I imagine this will be a counterproposal, not to oppose but to change some points. [end recording] [Camacho] Bishop Ruiz added that he will disclose the contents of the EZLN communique this afternoon or tomorrow. He also indicated that he will reveal the contents of a letter from Pope John Paul II to the diocese, expressing the latter's views on Bishop Ruiz's work as peace mediator in Chiapas.
