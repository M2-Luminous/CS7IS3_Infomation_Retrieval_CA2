FR940426-1-00045 FR940426-1-00006 Meaning of Terms Revisions in Parts 6, 8, 10 and 11 ATF is proposing to add the terms ``ATF officer'' and ``Director'' to the definitions in 27 CFR 6.11, 8.11, 10.11, and 11.11 to correspond to the terms in the proposed administrative provisions in §§6.5, 8.5, 10.5, and 11.5, discussed above. ATF is proposing to define the term ``brand'' in 27 CFR 6.11, since a number of dollar limitations on things of value which may lawfully be given to retailers is on a ``per brand'' basis. The definition proposed is drawn from ATF Ruling 81&hyph;1, Q.B. 1981&hyph;2, page 27, but ATF has narrowed the proposed definition to exclude changes in the color or design of the label. ATF is proposing adding the term ``Regional director (compliance)'' to the definitions in 27 CFR 6.11, 8.11 and 10.11 to correspond to the term in the proposed administrative provisions. The petitioners believe that the definition of ``retailer'' should be revised in 27 CFR parts 6 and 8. The current provision excludes wholesalers who make incidental retail sales representing less than 5 percent of their sales during the preceding two months. The petitioners state that a supplier cannot know whether the wholesaler's retail sales are within the 5 percent limitation and suggest eliminating that standard. The petitioners also believe that the definition of ``retailer'' should be clarified in order to ensure that this definition is consistent with §6.2 which defines the territorial extent of part 6 of the regulations. ATF believes that removal of the 5 percent limitation would make the definition too broad. For example, without the percent limitations, a wholesaler who makes a single sale to a consumer is deemed to be a retailer. Also, the petitioners' proposed definition would exclude, as a retailer, someone within the United States who makes sales for consumption outside of the United States; i.e., a duty free shop. The FAA Act itself does not allow this type of exception to the territorial coverage of the law. Therefore, ATF does not agree with this proposal. For the same reasons, ATF does not agree with the proposed amendment to the definition of ``retailer establishment.'' ATF is proposing to change the term ``retailer establishment'' in 27 CFR 6.11 to ``retail establishment'', since that is the term used in 27 CFR part 6 regulations. The term ``retail establishment'' in 27 CFR 8.11 will be removed because the term is not used in 27 CFR part 8 regulations. Part 6_``Tied-House'' Sections 6.25 Through 6.33, Interest in Retail Licensee The petitioners state that these sections of the regulations provide identical treatment concerning an interest of an industry member in a license with respect to a retailer's premises (§§6.25&hyph;6.27) and in real or personal property owned, occupied, or used by the retailer in the conduct of the business (§§6.31&hyph;6.33). The petitioners feel that combining the provisions, which they believe parallel each other (§§6.25 and 6.31; 6.26 and 6.32; and 6.27 and 6.33), will enhance the simplicity and clarity of the rules. Further, the petitioners recommend clarifying changes to existing regulations to ensure that there is no misunderstanding that a violation of the FAA Act does not occur merely upon a finding of the existence of the means to induce. The petitioners believe that the wording of several existing regulations describing various means to induce results in industry confusion since such sections are written in terms describing ``prohibited means to induce.'' The petitioners believe that the term ``prohibited'' should be deleted from such sections in order to avoid any contention or confusion that this provision, read separately from §6.21, allows for finding a violation of the FAA Act without also establishing that the means to induce results in exclusion. While the petitioners recognize that these sections are subject to the general application provisions of §6.21, which states that these means to induce are unlawful only if they result in exclusion, they believe such a change will help reduce the possibility of industry confusion on this issue. The same request was made concerning §§6.31, 6.41, 6.51, 6.61, 6.65 and 6.71, which all contain similar language. ATF does not object to revising the language in §§6.25, 6.31, 6.41, 6.51, 6.61, 6.65 and 6.71. ATF proposes to adopt this suggestion but would replace the word ``inducement,'' with ``means to induce,'' in order to correspond with the wording of the FAA Act. Conforming changes were also made to the language in §§6.27 and 6.33. ATF does not believe that the provisions of §§6.25 through 6.33 should be combined in the various ways proposed by the petitioners. From a structural point of view, merging §§6.25 through 6.33 fundamentally alters the organization of subpart C of part 6. Subpart C is divided into topics (with titles) which parallel sections 105(b)(1) through (7) of the FAA Act. The proposed merger of the corresponding sections will mean that the regulations applicable to an interest in retail property under section 105(b)(2) will be contained in a group of the regulations categorized under an interest in a retail license under section 105(b)(1). ATF believes that it may be confusing for a person or industry representative relying on the part 6 regulations to look under the regulations on a retail license for a regulation relating to an interest in retail property.
