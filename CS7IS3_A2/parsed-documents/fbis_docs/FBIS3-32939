The draft bill has also been discussed with senior representatives of the president elect, who also received it favorably. Gabaldon said in his report that it will not be possible to administer the IVSS properly with a financial deficit of almost one billion bolivares monthly, due to inadequate income to cover the basic expenditures of the institute. The president of the IVSS proposed six urgently needed measures to the president: 1) Seek passage of a Law on Public Credit, under which the national government will cancel its debt to the IVSS of more than 8.5 billion bolivares. 2) Pass appropriate legislation to restore the technical reserves of the IVSS which are more than 300 billion bolivares short, due to mistakes made in the past. 3) Provide by decree for total coverage of all employees of the national government. 4) Seek a harmonious agreement between employers and workers to raise social security contributions within the next 30 days in such a way that this increase will be insignificant for those with the least resources. 5) Raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 60 for women. 6) Make changes in the percentages relating to each social security fund to make them adequate under present circumstances and separate the various funds, with different administrations and accounting systems. Gabaldon said that when he became president of the IVSS, the institute was in a state of total collapse in the areas of administration, operations, and finance, notwithstanding the intense effort made by the Committee on Restructuring, which was established under special legislation. He said that the results of this work became known through a draft social security bill which has still not been introduced in Congress for debate. He pointed out that, notwithstanding the advances made in terms of decentralization, through harmonious cooperation with several state governments, the financial deficit will continue and become intolerable if significant action is not taken. The president of the IVSS said that the following actions have already been taken recently: - Improvements in the quality of IVSS employees. - Introduction of strict controls over bidding, purchasing, and payments. - Revision of general procedures. - Introduction of a system of automatic payments through the banks. - A total change in the system and control of surveillance of property belonging to the IVSS. - A substantial improvement in the processes of daily collections and receipts. - A substantial reduction in debts owed to suppliers and a considerable improvement in the system of payments. - Elimination of the use of blank payrolls. - Payment of pensions to workers. - A substantial improvement in making payments to hospitals and centers of ambulatory health care. - Raising the minimum IVSS pension to 9,000 bolivares. - Making up one year of arrearages of unemployment payments; these obligations are now being paid on time. - Study of an independent social security management system to improve the Pension Fund. - Elimination of per diem allowances, unnecessary travel within and outside the country, and unjustified overtime payments, including the elimination of chauffeurs and escorts for the president of the IVSS, members of the Board of Directors, and directors of the institute. - Beginning the process of appraisal and sale of unnecessary IVSS assets. - Beginning the system of self-administration of hospitals under which they will present their own bills and collect contributions from workers not insured and from private persons or groups holding insurance policies. Gabaldon pointed out that there is still a long way to go, but we have seen the light at the end of the tunnel through which we have been traveling.
