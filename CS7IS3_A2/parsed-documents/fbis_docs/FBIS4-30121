They try to impose their values and initiatives on small nations but strongly object to views from small countries or groups of small countries in the Third World. The United States is a major power that adopts such an attitude. Washington's opposition to the proposal to establish the East Asian Economic Caucus [EAEC] is proof of how a major power deprecates and tries to push aside any proposal from the Third World, in this case ASEAN. The United States has acted "elusively" by prevailing over Japan, another major power and economic giant. In fact, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has already sensed the American reaction. For him, Malaysia is prepared to face the U.S. opposition. The prime minister said he had gotten information about Washington's stance, although it had been announced [as published] to the Japanese Government. Malaysia may ask Japan or China for cooperation. Beijing's cooperation is important for the EAEC's success. China's interests were apparent in the U.S. action extending China's MFN [most favored nation] status for another year early this month despite human rights violations there. Washington is powerless to impose its wishes on China because it realizes that China has great economic power. The volume of trade between the two nations is estimated at RM [Malaysian ringgit] 100 billion. Assuming the U.S. presidency January last year, Bill Clinton pledged to establish closer relations with Asia, which absorbs 60 percent of Washington's total exports. A few months later, Clinton was however mired in various regional problems, mainly over the implementation of his campaign promise to fight for human rights and establish Western standards in a region which he fails to understand. In addition to facing problems over his policy toward China, Clinton also made a major error that hurt Malaysia. He convened the first summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC], which was made up of 15 members (now 17 members), including ASEAN, in Seattle by the end of last year without taking into account the views of other member nations. The prime minister, who foresaw that APEC would be monopolized by major powers, was reluctant to attend it. Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating tried to exploit the matter by describing Dr. Mahathir as a "recalcitrant." Clinton, who realized his error during the APEC summit, later adopted a wait-and-see policy toward the Malaysian-mooted EAEC idea. However, the United States is undertaking a campaign to persuade APEC members not to support the EAEC idea while adopting the wait-and-see policy. Besides the United States, Australia is also trying hard to foil the establishment of the EAEC. During a press conference in Manila last Monday, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans openly said that the EAEC may undermine cooperation among nations in the region. He warned that any regional trade group which excludes the United States will only pose a great danger. Evans claimed that the EAEC would not pose a threat if it became just a consultative forum within APEC. Once again, a major power has tried to prove that the idea of a group of developing nations was unacceptable to developed nations. We are not surprised over Evans' remarks or the latest U.S. opposition to the EAEC. The two nations have adopted a deprecatory attitude toward the idea; however, in the beginning they did not openly show their opposition. The United States is now claiming that it is trying to understand the problems of Asian nations. U.S. officials admitted that Washington's policy toward Asia faced problems last year but said that its relations with the region had returned to a correct path. However, we feel that the United States and its allies have failed to fulfill their promises. Their opposition to the EAEC shows their distrust of Asian nations. Their opposition also shows their power and is not in the interests of the world community.
