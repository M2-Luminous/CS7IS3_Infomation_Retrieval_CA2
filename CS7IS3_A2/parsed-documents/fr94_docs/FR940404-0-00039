FR940404-0-00039 FR940404-0-00015 North Carolina is not authorized for the February 21, 1991, (56 FR 7134), Boilers and Industrial Furnaces Rule, (BIF). Therefore, authorization for the Technical Amendments and the Administrative Stay for BIF promulgated July 17, 1991, (56 FR 32688) Checklist 94; August 27, 1991, (56 FR 42504) Checklist 96; and September 5, 1991, (56 FR 43874) Checklist 98, will be deferred until the State is granted authorization for the Boilers and Industrial Furnace Rule. C. Decision I conclude that North Carolina's application for these program revisions meet all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, North Carolina is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. North Carolina now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitations of its program revision application, and its previously approved authorities. North Carolina also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under section 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability of certain Federal regulations in favor of North Carolina's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
