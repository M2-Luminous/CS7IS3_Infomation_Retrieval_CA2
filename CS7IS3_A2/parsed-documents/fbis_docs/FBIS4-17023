Our reporter Anatolyy Polonskyy comments on this issue. [Polonskyy] Representatives of the mass media were asked to cover the declaration signing ceremony. My personal viewpoint is that the authors of this document wished to demonstrate the importance and significance of their work, which had been carried out by them in the name of the interparty and interethnic accord, which is the basis of the course aimed at the socioeconomic revival of the Crimea. Of course, the signing of the declaration was called an event of historical importance. Certainly, to leave the economic crisis, to be revived, the Crimea today requires peace and accord. We cannot help but to agree with the majority of the declaration's provisions. Who can oppose the provision stating that the principle of creation and not destruction should be the basis for practical activities, or that interparty relations should be based not on our differences but on similarities? However, this declaration remains a declaration if one says one thing but does the opposite. In the Crimea, all the political forces favor peace and accord, no party calls for violating laws, and they all support the inviolable friendship among the Crimean peoples. How can the existence of [words indistinct] openly anti-Ukrainian slogans and appeals on the square in front of the legislature and the residence of the president be explained? These slogans and appeals are so insulting to the national Ukrainian dignity [words indistinct], said Oleksandr Fedorenko, representative of the Crimean section of the Ukrainian Republican Party, that he could not bring himself to sign this declaration. The actions on the square are supporting President Yuriy Meshkov, Oleksandr Fedorenko said. The question arises whether the president indulges the organizers of this action or whether this is just his policy. The more [words indistinct] near the president's residence, the fewer tourists (?will come) to the Crimea, representative of the Democratic Party of the Crimea Mykhaylo (Mareyev) added in support of Fedorenko. Really, [words indistinct] to go to rest in the Crimea where interethnic hostility is flaring up near the legislature. Given this situation, can the declaration on some sort of accord be signed? At first, this accord should be reached and only later -- reported on. This is the reason why in addition to the Crimean section of the Ukrainian Republican Party, the declaration was not signed by the Crimean Civil Congress. The signature of the Crimean Tatars mejlis is also absent under the text of the declaration. Its representative was present in the assembly hall as an observer. The Communist Party of the Crimea refused even to observe this ceremony. So, was it really worth [words indistinct] with the signing of the declaration when there is no actual interparty and interethnic accord?
