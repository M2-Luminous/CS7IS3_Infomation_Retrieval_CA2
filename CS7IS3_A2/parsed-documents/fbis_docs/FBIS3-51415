This resolution approved the procedure to determine the ceiling for presidential campaign spending. The IFE General Council had appointed three of its magistrates to establish the amount that would constitute the ceiling for presidential campaign spending. The Federal Electoral Tribunal, however, decided that this procedure transfers the IFE General Council's decisionmaking power to the magistrates. Therefore, the Federal Electoral Tribunal, as explained by its president Jose Luis de la Peza, decided that the IFE General Council should issue a new resolution before 31 January.
