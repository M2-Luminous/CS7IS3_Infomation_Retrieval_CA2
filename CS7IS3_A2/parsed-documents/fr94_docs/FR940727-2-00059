FR940727-2-00059 FR940727-2-00028 10. Medical Evaluation and Treatment •Train medical response personnel specifically to assess and manage patients exposed to chemical agents stored at the nearby military depot. •Decontaminate all exposed patients as described above. •Provide medical treatment (during or after contamination), according to accepted treatment modalities, to patients exposed to nerve or mustard agents. If antidotes to nerve agents are used in the field by civilian medical responders as designated in State or local disaster plans, CDC recommends using single-dose, pre-armed autoinjectors, unless a higher level of medical response has already been integrated into EMS operations. Additional information on the effects of chemical warfare agents and accepted medical protocols for caring for patients exposed to mustard or nerve agents is available (5&hyph;14). IV. Recommendations for Hospital Preparedness 1. Primary Receiving Hospitals A primary receiving hospital is a hospital that is designated by State or local disaster plans to provide initial medical care to the civilian population in the event of a chemical warfare agent release. Such hospitals must have established protocols detailing evaluation, decontamination, and treatment procedures for patients exposed to chemical warfare agents. •Include evaluation, treatment, and decontamination protocols in the hospitals' disaster plans. •Include chemical warfare agent scenarios in disaster drills for hospitals that have been designated in State or local disaster plans to receive patients exposed to chemical warfare agents. 2. Triage Considerations •Do not allow patients exposed to a chemical warfare agent to enter the emergency department without adequate evaluation and decontamination. Signs of mustard agent exposure, in particular, may require 24&hyph;48 hours before they become clinically evident. •Train medical staff designated by the hospital disaster plan to perform triage during an emergency related to chemical warfare agents to recognize the physical signs and symptoms of patients who have been exposed to such agents. •Base modifications to patient triage procedures on the extent of patient contamination, the type of chemical warfare agent to which the patient has been exposed, the patient's clinical status, and the possibility of additional traumatic injuries. Priorities for medical treatment of patients should be determined by the most appropriately trained and experienced medical professional. 3. Security •Address issues related to emergency department security during disasters in the hospital disaster plan. •Restrict access to the hospital to prevent contaminated patients from entering the hospital. During a chemical agent release, security personnel should direct all patients to enter the hospital only through the triage area. 4. Decontamination •Decontaminate all persons who may have been contaminated with a chemical warfare agent. Proper decontamination prevents secondary contamination and chemical injury to medical and rescue personnel. Acceptable decontamination guidelines for persons exposed to chemical warfare agents are published by FEMA and DA (3,4). •Have decontamination substances readily available. Suitable decontamination substances include soap, water, and 5% hypochlorite. •In the hospital disaster plan, detail a method for catching contaminated runoff from patients whether decontamination is done inside or outside the hospital.
