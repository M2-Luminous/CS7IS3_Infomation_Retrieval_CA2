FR940412-2-00011 FR940412-2-00006 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: Survey of Income and Program Participation &hyph; 1992 Panel Waves 9 and 10. Form Number(s): SIPP&hyph;12900. Agency Approval Number: 0607&hyph;0723. Type of Request: Revision of a currently approved collection. Burden: 42,000 hours. Number of Respondents: 42,000. Avg Hours Per Response: 30 minutes. Needs and Uses: The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is a longitudinal, demographic, household survey in which the Census Bureau interviews sample households in waves occurring every 4 months over a 21/2 year period. The survey is molded around a central ``core'' of labor force and income questions that remain fixed during each wave of a panel. The core is periodically supplemented with questions designed to answer specific needs. These supplemental questions are referred to as ``topical modules.'' As part of our transition plans for SIPP from paper to an automated questionnaire, the Census Bureau is requesting an extension of the 1992 Panel in order to conduct 2 additional waves of interviews. The topical modules for Wave 9 include the following: 1) Work Schedule, 2) Child Care, 3) Child Support Agreements, 4) Support for Nonhousehold Members, 5) Functional Limitations and Disabilities&hyph;Adults, 6) Utilization of Health Care Services&hyph;Adults, 7) Functional Limitations and Disabilities&hyph;Children, 8) Utilization of Health Care Services&hyph;Children, and 9) Children's Well&hyph;Being. Wave 9 interviews will be conducted from October 1994 through January 1995. Wave 10 interviews will have no topical modules and will be conducted from February 1995 through May 1995. Affected Public: Individuals or households. Frequency: Waves 9 and 10 will be conducted once during the panel. Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313.
