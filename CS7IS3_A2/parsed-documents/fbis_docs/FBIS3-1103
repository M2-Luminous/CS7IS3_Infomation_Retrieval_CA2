The mission came within the framework of the implementation of the Arusha peace agreements and met the requests for President Mwinyi's intervention made by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and the president of the Republic. During his visit, Minister Rwegasira held talks with the main political forces of the country, forces which are to take part in the transitional institutions. He met the president of the Republic, the two prime ministers, RPF officials, and representatives of the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND], the Republican Democratic Movement, the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the two Liberal Party [PL] factions. Rwegasira said before his departure that the only remaining obstacle to setting up the transitional institutions lay with the PL party, especially in the lack of coordination by the two factions on how to distribute their ministerial portfolios. On behalf of the facilitator, President Mwinyi, Minister Rwegasira urged all the parties involved to assume their responsibilities in the implementation of the Arusha peace accord. Before leaving Kigali, Rwegasira met with the political parties due to take part in the broad-based transitional government, as well as diplomats accredited in Kigali. The Office of the President, the MRND, and the Mugenzi faction of the PL were not represented [words indistinct] at that meeting.
