Here is Jozo Curic with a report from New York: [Curic] Croatia is ready to continue peaceful dialogue with the Serbs in UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] areas, Minister Granic told UN Secretary General Ghali and UN Security Council President Merimee in New York today. He mentioned the principle of local autonomy in those UNPA's where Serbs were in the majority before the war. Croatia wants the issue of the occupied areas to be resolved in line with UN Resolution 871. The UNPA's are an integral part of Croatia, Dr. Granic said. According to some UN sources Croatia will ask for a more active UNPROFOR mandate, including the use of ultimatum. This would mean the implementation of the resolutions that provide for the control of borders, for disarmament, the control of roads, measures to restore confidence, and the economic recovery of these areas. Minister Granic informed his hosts about the Croat-Muslim outline agreement on a federation and the preliminary agreement on a loose confederation of Croatia and the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.
