[Cico] Mr. President, what was the aim of your visit to Turkey? [Berisha] I visited Turkey at the invitation of President Demirel. The main goal of my visit was to encourage and implement the further development of political, economic, and overall friendly relations between our two countries, as well to discuss regional problems. I can say that relations between Albania and Turkey are proceeding well and developing quickly. These relations are such because first, there exists a sound and solid foundation for these relations, based on the powerful blood ties existing between Albania and Turkey, as well as on historical and cultural ties. In two years relations at the political level have assumed new dimensions and developed very well. Similarly, relations in technology and other fields are developing very well, quickly, and in a friendly spirit. On the other hand, economic cooperation and relations leave room for strengthening. When I say economic cooperation, I should stress here that over the last two years, Turkey has given Albania considerable economic assistance, more than 35 million [currency not specified] in humanitarian and other aid. However, there is a lot of room for more economic cooperation. Regarding this, I insisted to both President Demirel and Prime Minister Ciller, as well as in today's meeting with investors in Istanbul, that Turkish investment is very welcome and will play a great role in bringing our two countries together. [Cico] Mr. President, do you think that the goals of this visit have been achieved? [Berisha] I think that they have been completely achieved. First, I should say that on a political level, the will is mutual and certain to develop relations further. Both sides are seeing with pleasure the rapid and harmonious development of these relations. In the same way, Albania and Turkey have the same views on the developments in the region. Both countries are making a real contribution to peace and stability on the Balkan peninsula. Economic issues and problems occupied a special place in our discussions. I particularly insisted that the Turkish Government, the president, and prime minister encourage Turkish investment in Albania. There exists a full judicial basis, and this we improved with the agreement on avoiding double taxation. That is, there exists a judicial basis between the two countries on the rapid development of economic relations. I can say that for Turkish investors, and this point I also stressed in today's meeting in Istanbul, there are many sectors in which they can invest and make large profits in Albania. I insisted on economic ties through investment, because this is precisely the relations that will weld and increasingly strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the two countries. We discussed the East-West corridor, which is a very powerful artery in the process of Balkan integration. We also discussed the possibility, or I insisted on the possibility, of soft credit on the part of the Turkish Government, so that Albania will be able to use it to set up its infrastructure. Prime Minister Ciller and President Demirel promised that they would study the possibility of finding a mechanism to create such credit. We also discussed the expanding and strengthening of air and naval ties. A new Tirana-Ankara airline will soon go into operation. They promised me that they would study the rapid establishment of naval ties. Thus, I think that another horizon is being opened in economic cooperation between our two countries, and I am very optimistic that this cooperation will have a future. [Cico] Mr. President, do you think that Turkish investment will come to Albania to the extent that it will reach the level of political relations, which you stressed are much better than economic ones? [Berisha] I hope that Turkish and other investment will come to Albania. I am optimistic that Albania is becoming an increasingly attractive country for foreign investors. Albania offers many advantages: an extremely favorable geographical position, excellent natural resources, a qualified labor force, a profitable labor market, and above all legislation based on freedom for the investor, the freedom of the individual, and the freedom of free enterprise. I think that all these factors, taken together with Albanian hospitality, in fact make Albania a small country geographically, not big from the geographic point of view, but a country with great chances for investment. I see with pleasure that this message is being increasingly clearly understood by Turkish, European, and world business and other circles. [Cico] After the meetings that you held with top-level Turkish officials, it was declared that Albania and Turkey maintain the same position concerning regional problems. Can you tell us something more concrete about this? [Berisha] First, I want to stress that Albania and Turkey are deeply interested in peace and stability in the region and have contributed and are contributing in this direction. I can say that Turkey has made a special contribution to the reconciliation between the Croats and Muslims. Months ago, the Turkish Government was engaged in and was one of the first to support the Washington Agreement on the creation of this [Bosnia-Herzegovina] federation. In this aspect, I am sure that the dispatch of Turkish troops to Bosnia will be a further contribution to the gradual stability of the region. I would like others to render their own contribution. We particularly expect the Russians to convince the Serbs to join the agreement, because the signing of the agreement by the Serbian side will really be a decisive and very important moment in establishing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In our talks, we devoted a special place to the solution of the Albanian question. Turkey, or I can say in Turkey, the dimension of this question is very clear. Of course, Albania and Turkey oppose the changing of borders through violence. However, I insist that the crisis in the Balkans cannot be solved without resolving the Kosova problem and without stability in Macedonia [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. In this aspect, Turkey supports Albania's efforts for a peaceful solution to this problem, just as as it is interested in Macedonian stability. I can say that we had a complete convergence of views and once again I want to thank my hospitable friends -- President Demirel and Prime Minister Ciller -- for the very warm and friendly reception that they extended to us. [Cico] Thank you.
