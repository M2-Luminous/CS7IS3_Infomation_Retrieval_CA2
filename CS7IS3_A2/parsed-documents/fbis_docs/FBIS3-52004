In this respect he pointed out that the democratic process reestablished in Bolivia in 1982, following a long period of military governments which came to power in successive coups d'etat, created an imperious need, which could not be postponed, for setting up new means of effectively channeling the will of the people at policymaking levels and in the institutional processes of leadership of the country. The minister of government said that this objective of converting the present, democratic and representative system into a new, participative and dynamic system aimed at the basic institutions of Bolivian society should be clearly expressed in the first place in the structure of municipal governments and then in the forms of representation in Parliament, through the election of deputies on separate lists, as projected in the Law on the Need for Reform of the Political Constitution of the State. He said that the recently promulgated Law on Majorities and Minorities as a standard for municipal elections has the same objective. In that way the rights of citizens will be legally guaranteed in the future, not only to vote but also to choose, preventing the possibility that their views, expressed through the ballot box, could be subject to later political negotiations, as has happened up to now. He noted that this plan for participation by the people, which has been formulated as a fundamental part of the program of government proposed to the country by the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement], seeks to establish a system of political participation which "goes beyond the political parties." As a result, he repeated, "It would be madness to say that we are allegedly trying to set up a program for long-term control of the government, as some opposition groups charge."
