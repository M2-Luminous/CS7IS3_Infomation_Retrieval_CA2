In fact, a devaluation risks to have consequences on the purchasing power of the people of Niger. It will therefore be necessary to mitigate the social cost of the action. With the very probable devaluation of the CFA franc, the uncertainty of the people of Niger is great, especially concerning the hike in prices and the significant fall in the purchasing power of workers which could cause obvious social upheavals with unpredictable consequences. To prevent such a situation, discussions began a long time ago at the Ministry of Finance and Plan to define and draw up relief measures capable of reducing the social cost of devaluation. To avoid inflation of prices of local products, the government hopes to take measures to avoid the increase in the prices of some local products. Concerning imported goods, the authorities are thinking of subsidizing the cost of essential commodities. Concerning the debt, it will especially be necessary to seek its cancellation or to have it reduced.

[Reporter] (?Presently), do we know what Nigeria's reactions will be following the devaluation of our currency? [Nasseba] Personally, this morning I followed [words indistinct] which came yesterday and we must now adopt an economic policy which will apparently or totally favor us. In other words, Nigeria will return to the system of daily rates -- I think it is 22 naira to $1 -- so negotiations must begin with that country to reach an understanding in order to limit increases to relatively acceptable levels. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Concerning state functionaries, can we expect any salary increase in order to favor purchasing power of workers? [Nasseba] Yes, but [words indistinct], unofficial according to the calculations made with the [words indistinct] proposed, a salary increase of almost 18 percent has been envisaged for the year 1994 and probably, concerning salary arrears, measures will be taken so that, at least, one or two months of arrears can be paid in an attempt to mitigate the initial shocks of the price hikes. At any rate, as a first step, there will be [words indistinct]. [end recording]
