He said: We are Egyptians and part of the Egyptian people. We are not a minority, do not consider ourselves a minority, and do not like others to call us a minority. The terms majority and minority indicate discrimination and segregation. This does not befit the sons of a single homeland, especially in beloved Egypt. The pope was commenting on a conference of Egyptians and foreigners which is being sponsored by a publication house. Meanwhile, [Egyptian writer] Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal has refused to attend the conference. He published an article explaining the reasons for not attending, saying that the Egyptian Copts are not a minority and it is wrong to view them from this standpoint. [passage omitted]
