Following an agreement with the Farmers Party of Slovakia [Rolnicka Strana Slovenska--RSS] on election coalition cooperation, the HZDS also counts on cooperation with the Slovak National Party [SNS], provided it passes the election threshold, as well as with the KDH [Christian Democratic Movement] and the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]. The HZDS is open to the option of cooperating with the Association of the Workers of Slovakia [Zdruzenie Robotnikov Slovenska], the Forum of Workers [Forum Robotnikov], the Christian Social Union [KSU], and with civic associations and interest groups in districts--such as the Union of Antifascist Fighters. The HZDS also considers possible cooperation with the New Slovakia movement. At a news conference today, it was said that an election program was currently being drafted. It should be ready in three weeks' time and be capable of addressing every single citizen and individual region of Slovakia. [passage omitted]
