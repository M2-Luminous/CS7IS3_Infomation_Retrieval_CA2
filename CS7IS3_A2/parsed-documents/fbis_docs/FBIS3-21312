Katyal] [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 24--India today formally conveyed to Washington its strong feelings and concern over the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton's references to Punjab in a letter to a Democratic Congressman. The Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, told the acting head of the U.S. Embassy, Mr. Kenneth Brill, that India could not but take a serious view of the contents of the letter, which were unacceptable and were seen as having a negative impact on bilateral relationship. Some of the points made by the Foreign Secretary were contained in the official reaction, given through the Foreign Office spokesman yesterday. Mr. Brill, it is learnt, wanted India not to take seriously either the fact of despatch of the letter or its contents. This, according to him, was part of the job of the public communications division of the White House, which replied to letters in the President's name, received from the public. India, it was clear, read a deeper meaning into the letter episode. Downplaying issue C. Raja Mohan reports from Washington: The reference to "Sikh rights" in the controversial letter written by Mr. Clinton does not imply that Washington is seeking special treatment for Sikhs in India, according to sources in the State Department. In an attempt to down play the significance of the letter, administration sources are suggesting that too much should not be read into it. They argue that the term "Sikh rights" must be understood as a broad reference to minority rights enshrined in the Indian Constitution. They point out that both the Indian and American Constitutions guarantee in a generic way the rights of all minorities. The sources assert that the United States does not support the creation of Khalistan. However, they are not ready to provide a satisfactory answer to the question why the term "minority rights" was not used in Mr. Clinton's letter expressing his desire for a "peaceful solution" in Punjab "that protests Sikh rights." The reference to the Indian Constitution and the rights granted by it appears to be a new formulation to take the sting off the American intervention in India's internal affairs. In its earlier clarification on Mr. Clinton's letter to the leading campaigner here for the secession of Kashmir, Dr. Ghulam Nabi Fai, the State Department suggested that the administration was only calling on the Indian Government to respect the human rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. The State Department sources suggest that the President is obliged to respond to the concerns expressed on human rights issues by Congressmen and the letter should be seen in that context. They note that Mr. Clinton had referred in his letter to the improvement of the ground reality in Punjab. They also suggest that the U.S. Government has repeatedly expressed its concerns on violations of human rights in Punjab to the Indian Government.
