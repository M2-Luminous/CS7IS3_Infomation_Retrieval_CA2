The guard was shot in the chest as he was driving from al- Sulaymaniyah to Irbil, and later underwent an operation, said the sources contacted by telephone from Cyprus. They did not give any information about the assailants. The attack came only two days after an AFP correspondent, German-born Lissy Schmidt, and her bodyguard were killed by unidentified gunmen in the al-Sulaymaniyah area close to the Iranian border. Since the start of the year the UN has reported 13 attacks against foreigners in Iraqi Kurdistan, which have left one person dead and seven wounded. One of the main Iraqi Kurdish groups, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), said earlier in a statement from Damascus that Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's regime had "promised a reward of 10,000 dollars to anyone killing a foreigner in Kurdistan."
