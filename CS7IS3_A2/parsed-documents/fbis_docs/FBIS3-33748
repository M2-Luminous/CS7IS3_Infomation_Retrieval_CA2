Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres are expected to meet in Cairo in 10 days to sign the agreement. Israeli sources said that the two sides are drafting the technical details of the agreement, which should begin to be implemented within the next two weeks. These sources added that the Davos draft agreement includes the following points: -- Israel's demands and security requirements will be guaranteed; -- Israel will control road junctions in the Gaza Strip; -- Only Israeli police will carry out searches at the border crossings. Palestinian police will be present at these crossings; -- The two sides will reach an understanding on the size of the Jericho area so that this matter will not constitute an obstacle in the talks. Israel will be flexible in this regard; -- The citizens of the self-rule area will be able to move freely to the al-Nabi Musa, near Jericho, and al-Maghtis, on the Jordan River, to perform religious rites only; -- The Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho will have access to the joint recreation area to be built between the Israelis and the Palestinians on the Dead Sea; -- The passages leading to these areas will remain under Israeli military control; -- Special passages for the self-rule residents to move about without restriction will be established. These passages will ultimately be linked to a highway linking Amman to the self-rule area across the King 'Abdallah Bridge. -- Israel will have the right to protest the entry of suspect Palestinians; and -- Special Israeli search rooms will be created at the border crossings. The Palestinian police will not be allowed in these search rooms.
