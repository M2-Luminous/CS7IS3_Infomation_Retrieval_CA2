FBIS3-46931 "dreas003__a94003" FBIS-EAS-94-003-A Document Type:Daily Report 5 January 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. Move on Semiconductor Accord Interpreted OW3012131493 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 29 Dec 93 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3012131493 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Article by correspondent Kazuichi Sekiguchi in Washington: "Putting Pressure on Japan To Get Pledges on Expanded Purchase"] [Text] There are two purposes for U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor calling for an emergency meeting under the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement. One is to request Japan to promise further expansion of its purchase of foreign semiconductors in 1994 and thereafter, and the other is to secure explanatory material to be given to the U.S. Congress and domestic industry in case the [foreign semiconductors'] average share of 20 percent [in the Japanese market] in 1993 is not achieved. Kantor has presented two conditions for implementing the agreement: (1) steady growth of the share, and (2) achievement of an average of 20 percent in the share in 1993. But these conditions are not going to be met. While it is necessary to raise the foreign products' share for the October-December period to 23.1 percent to meet the 20-percent target for the whole year, all Japanese corporations concerned have already placed their orders for the year, and "achievement of the target is hopeless" (according to an official of the U.S. industry). Upon hearing the U.S. Government announcement [on the emergency meeting], Procasini [name as published], managing director of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), issued a statement supporting such an emergency meeting. The Semiconductor Agreement is due to be revised next year. He apparently thinks "the United States can achieve more by extracting practical promises in the talks on such matters as raising the market share" than by just criticizing Japan. The U.S. Government -- going all out to get its way on trade policy as seen in getting the NAFTA approved -- is putting emphasis on obtaining agreements on priority topics in the economic consultations at the Japan-U.S. summit in February. Consequently, while it assumes a flexible stand on the question of setting objective criteria, it demands strict implementation in areas where there are agreements -- as in semiconductors, construction projects, and cellular phones. In other words, the United States is engaged in "two-pronged operations." Lawrence Summers, U.S. under secretary of the treasury, in a 28 December TV interview, put pressure on Japan, saying, "I hope they (Japan) will keep their word." Meanwhile, Trade Representative Kantor has not changed his hard-line position on the Semiconductor Agreement, hinting at the possibility of enforcing sanctions. But his real purpose is to include the semiconductors as a topic in the Japan-U.S. economic consultations in January and February -- before the summit -- and to force a political decision out of Japan and get the maximum possible concessions from it.
