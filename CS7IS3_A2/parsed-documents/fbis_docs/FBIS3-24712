The government issued a stern warning to all those who may want to cause ethnic and tribal problems that the government, in the interest of peace and the resolution of our devastating conflict, will spare no legal measures in preventing any such individuals from sabotaging the concrete steps being made towards peace. The government said it would take action against any narrow ethnic trend that would prefer to put tribal ambition over and above the national interest, especially when that ambition is not supported by the totality of the Liberian people. The government was reacting to newspaper reports of a statement said to have been filed by Mr. Melvin Nguaya and approved by Mr. Joseph Kononia, alleging to have been issued on behalf of Bong County citizens. The interim government noted that the statement issued threats and [word indistinct] to whip up ethnic-based frenzy in the safe haven that has been created by ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. Government noted that the statement has no motive but to create ethnic divisions among Liberians, especially at a time when every effort is being made by the interim government, ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States], and the international community to bring to a close the war in which the ethnic factor has been so prominent. A press statement issued yesterday said the interim government is indeed disappointed because at a time when ECOMOG has successfully created a safe haven in Monrovia and its environs and one which reflects the largest ethnic diversity ever, Mr. Kononia and official of government, and his collaborators will choose to use that same safe haven to fall back on base ethnic sentiments to promote a political personality. The interim government says it would prefer that Mr. Kononia and Mr. Nguaya use the safehaven -- that is Monrovia and environs -- more constructively to advance the cause of peace instead of pursuing narrow political goals based solely on ethnic division. Mr. Kononia and his like, the statement said, seem to have forgotten that Mr. Kuyon was elected by the interim government not because he is a Tele man and that one of his accomplishments made under the promotion of the IGNU [Interim Government of National Unity] was based on the fact he was Tele. The interim government believes that if individuals like Mr. Kononia and Mr. Nguaya are truly committed to the promotion of the political fortunes of Mr. Kuyon, they will do well to organize a political campaign at the appropriate time to promote Mr. Kuyon's candidacy for any elected high office in this country rather than make an ethnically based claim on a position to which the interim government had earlier appointed Mr. Kuyon in the first place. The release said they should also be reminded that the IGNU is currently actively preoccupied with working closely with ECOWAS and the international community to bring to an end such ethnic dissensions that are being manifested in the formation of the so-called Lofa Defense Force and now the Bong Resistance Movement. The government wishes to emphasize that no one should mistake its resolve to protect the with all the resources at its disposal the safe haven that has been created for our war-weary people in Monrovia and its environs. Meanwhile, the interim government has called on Mr. Kuyon to demonstrate his avowed statesmanship and love of country by ensuring that no ethnic-based organization uses his name or otherwise put him in complicity in an effort to sabotage the peace process and the national good. The statement concluded by saying that there is no more room in this country for tribally based politicians.
