Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel announced today that he wanted to convince his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev of NATO's position in their talks in Athens. Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed that everything had to be done to "include" Russia. Before flying to Athens for a meeting with his counterparts from Greece, Belgium, and Germany, Kozyrev gave an assurance that Russia would not allow anyone to divert it from the path of strategic partnership with the United States and the other Western countries because of the Bosnian crisis. Air strikes by NATO in Bosnia could, however, bring about the collapse of the peace process, Kozyrev warned. Kohl told the daily paper DIE WELT that he was glad there was now a joint decision by NATO and that U.S. President Bill Clinton had assumed "some kind of leadership role." There was now "another chance for an end to this terrible war in the Balkans and, above all, the horrific suffering of the population." Although the Bundeswehr cannot make available any troops of its own in the former Yugoslavia for historic reasons, he wanted to give logistical support outside that territory if it was necessary and Bonn was asked for it. Speaking on the private television station VOX, Kinkel said the deployment of German soldiers on AWACS aircraft is not affected by possible NATO air strikes against Serb positions in Bosnia. The stationing of Bundeswehr soldiers on NATO ship convoys in the Adriatic is also covered by the Constitution. The former Bundeswehr General Elmar Schmaehling had earlier warned in a DDP/ADN interview that the participation of German soldiers in AWACS reconnaissance flights in the event of a NATO air strike against Serb positions in Bosnia would violate the Constitution. The German Government would, after all, be taking part in "military attacks" outside NATO territory. This would be in contravention of Article 87a of the Basic Law, according to which German forces can only be deployed for defense purposes.
