Mohan] [Text] Phnom Penh -- Sensitive to the fact that rural development will be the key to winning the continuing long-term battle against the recalcitrant Khmer Rouge and their supporters, the Royal Government has allocated a large chunk of its national budget towards this end. The Royal Government's plans for rural development involve programmes wider than technical advances in agriculture alone. The five principal ministries and secretariats are currently involved in rural development and are collectively allocated some 25 percent of the national budget. Several contributing countries and agencies are also involved in rural development activities of various kinds, together with over 100 non-governmental organisations. "There are some 17 priority areas that are seen as being critical to rural development and the Royal Government attaches great importance to pursuing a coordinated programme approach to rural development and to making a major thrust towards bringing development to the more remote areas. The priority areas are in providing adequate training and training centres, documentation centres and workshops and the providing of adequate water supply for drinking, domestic use and irrigation," the report on National Programme to Rehabilitate and Develop Cambodia which was made available to THE CAMBODIA TIMES, said. In addition to this, it also intends to continue the repatriation programme with emphasis being placed on integration and employment and continuing with, if funds permit, accelerating the mine awareness and clearance campaigns. Other aspects of rural development include the implementation of a new integrated Family Food Production Programme for food security, repairing, rehabilitating and constructing rural roads, providing primary health care and fostering an expansion in rural credit. "The government also intends to establish Community and Women's Development Centres and provide informal training in addition to establishing small enterprises and income generating activities. It also plans to establish model villages, develop alternative energy sources and protect the environment and natural resources and encourage reforestation," the report said. To address these interconnected priorities, the Royal Government will pursue two parallel strategies. Firstly, it is seeking to improve the management of rural development programmes, primarily by supporting greater consultation and better coordination among the development partners. The principal objective is to strengthen the planning and delivery capacities and mechanisms of various agencies and organisations working in rural parts of the country which should be made effective in the short-term. Secondly, the government is seeking to improve and to increase the linkages between the design and implementation of development programmes, mainly by promoting participatory methodologies and an integrated approach to rural development. To pursue these strategies and its many programmes successfully, the government has identified two key policies to accelerate rural development. The second is to ensure a shift towards an integrated and more people orientated approach to rural development in order to reinforce sustainability through people participation and gender sensitivity. The report said that people's participation is crucial to the success of any rural initiative. In addition, rural development strategies must build people's confidence and expose them to new ideas and approaches consistent with a more open society, so that their participation becomes even more meaningful.
