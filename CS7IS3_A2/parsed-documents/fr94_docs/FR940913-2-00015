EFFECTIVE DATE: September 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary J. Jenkins or Katherine Johnson, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;1756 or (202) 482&hyph;4929, respectively. Amended Preliminary Determination In accordance with section 733(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), on July 28, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) made its preliminary determination that stainless steel bar (SSB) from Spain was being sold at less than fair value (59 FR 39740, August 4, 1994). On August 4, 1994, we disclosed the calculations performed in our preliminary determination to counsel for respondent Roldan, S.A. (Roldan), and petitioners, pursuant to their requests. On August 8, 1994, and August 11, 1994, we received submissions from Roldan and petitioners, respectively, alleging a ministerial error in the Department's preliminary determination calculation. Both parties alleged that the Department did not convert the unit prices for marine insurance expenses incurred on U.S. sales from Spanish pesetas to U.S. dollars for purposes of calculating its preliminary antidumping duty margins. The Department subsequently determined that a ministerial error did not occur when it performed its margin calculation. (For specific details of this allegation and our analysis, see Memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford dated August 15, 1994). On August 23, 1994, Roldan requested that the Department reconsider its decision that it did not make a ministerial error in its handling of marine insurance for the preliminary determination, and therefore correct the preliminary determination. We have reconsidered our earlier decision and now conclude that we made a ministerial error when calculating the preliminary margin. ( See memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford dated August 31, 1994). This error constitutes a significant ministerial error within the meaning of the Department's proposed regulation regarding preliminary determinations, in that its correction will result in a difference of no less than 5 absolute percentage points, i.e., between a dumping margin of 25.21 percent and a dumping margin of 1.92 percent. Therefore, we are amending Roldan's preliminary dumping margin. See section 353.15(g)(4)(ii) of the Department's proposed regulations (57 FR 1131, January 10, 1992). We have converted the unit prices for marine insurance expenses from Spanish pesetas to U.S. dollars for purposes of deducting the movement expense from U.S. price and for purposes of making the VAT adjustment. The corrected dumping margins are 1.92 percent for Roldan and 4.68 percent for ``all others.'' Suspension of Liquidation We are directing the Customs Service to correct our request to suspend liquidation in accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, for all entries of SSB from Spain for Roldan and for ``all others''. In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of SSB from Spain that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 4, 1994, the date of publication of our preliminary determination notice in the Federal Register . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the revised estimated preliminary dumping margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/producer/exporter 1Original margin (percent) 1Revised margin (percent) Roldan, S.A. 25.21 1.92 Acenor, S.A. 8.96 8.96 All others 17.89 4.68 Notification of International Trade Commission (ITC) In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our amended preliminary determination. This amended preliminary determination is published in accordance with Section 733(f) of the Act. Dated: September 2, 1994. Paul L. Joffe, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
