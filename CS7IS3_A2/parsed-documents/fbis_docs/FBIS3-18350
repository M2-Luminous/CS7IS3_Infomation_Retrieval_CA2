Nevertheless, Greece is attempting to justify its action by affirming that it conforms to European law, with reference to Article 224 of the Treaty of Rome, he continues. The reference is "rather unfortunate," he notes, since the article stipulates that consultations between member states must precede any action of this type. However, it is "crystal clear" that the European Union (EU) is powerless if one of the member states contravenes Article 224, for the treaty in question does not envision exclusion, or even punitive measures. For instance, notes de Chazournes, Athens' European partners cannot freeze structural funds granted to Greece even if, in the process, EU common foreign and security policy is jeopardized. This does not mean that Brussels, where the Greek move has been termed "irrational," easily accepts Greece's fait accompli, he adds. In fact, a written explanation has been demanded so that the Commission can review the blockade's legality. "There are few illusions in Paris on the European Council's margin of maneuver," de Chazournes comments. At most, 11 countries will simply "express their annoyance" with the present president of the EU. For good measure, he adds, the Greek ambassador was called in by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 18 February to provide an explanation.
