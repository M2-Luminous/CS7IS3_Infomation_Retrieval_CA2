The Slovak president met at noon with representatives from the Cultural-Social Association of Czechs and Slovaks in Poland. Miloslav Molitoris, secretary of the expatriate organization, which has been operating in Poland since 1947, briefed the Slovak president on the problems facing the some 25,000-strong community in Poland. At the moment, there are only two elementary schools in Poland where Slovak is the language of instruction -- in Nowa Biela and Jablonka. Slovak is taught in another 18 schools as a noncompulsory subject. Representatives from the Slovak organizations in Poland demanded that the teaching of Slovak at the high school in Nowy Targ, where Slovak was taught from 1933-39, be recommenced and also that financial assistance be provided to enhance education. Miloslav Molitoris praised the idea of opening the borders between Poland and Slovakia. According to him, "we want to have a border merely as an administrative line and not as a line that would divide us." He asked President Michal Kovac for help in obtaining Slovak priests from Slovak communities and also for the agreements from the former CSFR on good neighborliness and cultural cooperation -- which would make it possible to enrich the cultural lives of the ethnic Slovak citizens -- to be enshrined in the planned agreements with Poland. The representatives from the Slovak organizations in Poland -- the Cultural-Social Association of Czechs and Slovaks, Matica Slovenska [The Slovak Heritage Foundation], and the St. Vojtech Society -- pointed out in the discussion that the Polish Constitution does not guarantee ethnic rights for the Slovak community. It does not have representatives in parliament or the mass media; there are also few Slovak representatives in self-administrative institutions. There are problems with teaching Slovak, the bilingual designation of communities and Slovak institutions, and religious services in Slovak. At the same time, they also expressed an interest in the restoration of their Slovak citizenship, which they lost in 1946 when the northern regions of Slovakia were annexed to Poland. The representatives from the expatriate organizations also demanded that the Slovak minority be enshrined legally in the constitutional law and that the Helsinki agreements on human rights, minority rights, and reciprocal rights -- which the Poles in Slovakia enjoy -- be implemented.
