Li Peng said: Guangdong is at the forefront of reform and opening up, having made rapid progress in all fields of work since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. It is hoped that the people of Guangdong Province will achieve new and even greater success in the new year under the inspiration of the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Li Peng had toured Huizhou in February 1990. Under the guidance of the party's basic line, Huizhou City has made rapid progress in economic construction over the past four years, and it is now a thriving city. On the morning of 7 February, Premier Li Peng and Ding Guangen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, eagerly viewed an exhibition of Huizhou City's industrial goods. Color televisions, videocassette recorders, high-quality stereo equipment, facsimile printers, and telephones on display in the exhibition hall demonstrated Huizhou City's achievements in electronic industrial development in recent years. It is reported that the output value of Huizhou City's electronic industry currently totals 5.162 billion yuan annually, making this industry the mainstay of the city's industrial sector. Li Peng was very delighted to see the exhibits. As he viewed the exhibits, he questioned workers at the exhibition hall in detail about the products' functions, prices, and sales. He urged local cadres to build on their leading products, to develop more new products, and to tap foreign and domestic markets in light of their own special conditions. Aside from developing its economy in recent years, Huizhou city has paid attention to investment in educational services, which totaled 359 million yuan last year after increasing at an average annual rate of 31.9 percent. After visiting the exhibition, Li Peng also made a special trip to the No. 8 Huizhou City Middle School to visit the teachers and students there. When the teachers and students saw the premier, they swarmed around him to shake his hand. For his part, Li Peng warmly greeted them and offered season's greetings to the teachers who worked hard on the educational front. Huizhou city was heavily decorated and shrouded in a joyous atmosphere prior to the Spring Festival. Pots of kumquat, chrysanthemums, gladioli, daffodils, and tulips lined the streets, adding a spring touch to the winter of this southern city. Amid the hustle and bustle, Li Peng had cordial conversations and exchanged season's greetings with flower growers and city residents. Before his tour of Huizhou, Li Peng had inspected infrastructure and some new and high technology projects in Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, and Shenzhen from 28 January-5 February. He had held informal discussions with local leading party and government comrades. Li Peng said: The more we develop the economy, the more we should bear in mind the need to show concern for and help with the well-being of people in impoverished areas. The more we reform and open up, the more we should strengthen spiritual civilization and create a fine social environment for reform and development. Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee; Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin; and responsible comrades from relevant State Council departments accompanied Li Peng on his tour.
