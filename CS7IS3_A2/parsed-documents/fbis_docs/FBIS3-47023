However, this is mere gibberish that contains nothing new and is completely worthless. Therefore, commenting on the New Year news conference by Kim Yong-sam, the Democratic Party, a South Korean opposition party, said: Even while saying that he would pursue internationalization and opening up, he failed to elaborate on concrete measures and lapsed into rosy optimism. This is very worrisome. He merely repeated the policies he had announced before the conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations. During the news conference, traitor Kim Yong-sam said that he would continuously pursue change and reform and paid lip service to politics serving the convenience of people and clean politics. This is merely artifice to cheat the South Korean people and constitutes an intolerable mockery of people who demand new politics and new systems. Even during the election campaign for the puppet presidency, traitor Kim Yong-sam loudly babbled about clean politics and politics where no money is necessary. However, nothing has changed in South Korea. The reforms that the Kim Yong-sam ring have made were antipopular reforms which strengthened the puppet traitor's one-man dictatorship, deteriorated the economic crisis, and worsened people's livelihood. What the reforms gave South Korean people were bloody suppression using guns and bayonets and chronic hardships of life. The Kim Yong-sam ring, under the cloak of reform, exercised emergency arbitration power which the previous military dictators did not dare to invoke and brutally suppressed workers' labor disputes who called for the rights to existence. Worse still, they viciously cracked down on the righteous struggles of the South Korean people and students for independence, democracy, and reunification. The rascals, ignoring the people's demand calling for abolition of the fascist-like National Security Law and suppressive agencies, including the Agency for National Security Planning, have not reformed them and, worse still, have stepped up fascist suppression by wielding them. Again this time, traitor Kim Yong-sam vociferated that he would reorganize the law and systems. However this is nothing but a trick to further step up the fascist suppressive rule over the South Korean people. Traitor Kim Yong-sam's prattling about sharpening the international competitive edge by pressing ahead with the five-year plan for the new economy is also a shameless imposture. Due to the five-year plan for the new economy, the economy is in tatters as exports remain sluggish, the production rate continues to drop, and foreign debts increase, backfiring firms to go bankrupt. To make matters worse, farmers and agriculture lost ground and the catastrophic crisis in the South Korean economy has been deepened overall due to the Kim Yong-sam ring's rice market opening. Traitor Kim Yong-sam admitted that our economy is suffering from hardening of the arteries in various places. At such a time, how can the advertisement on enhancing international competitiveness and so on get through to anyone? What cannot be overlooked is that puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam came out with our nonexistent nuclear issue again this time. Speaking of our nuclear issue prattled about by traitor Kim Yong-sam, this is a byproduct of the antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers persistently pursued by the United States. It is the United States that came out with the suspicion of our nuclear development and which threatens us by actually bringing nuclear weapons onto the Korean peninsula. Therefore, the nuclear issue in our country is an issue that must be resolved through DPRK-U.S. talks, not an issue into which the South Korean puppets should poke their noses. As is known, in recent contacts, by displaying the spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation, the DPRK and the United States provided prospects for removing a series of obstacles in the way of DPRK-U.S. talks and fundamentally resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Not only all the fellow countrymen but also the world welcome this. However, traitor Kim Yong-sam presumptuously babbled about the nuclear issue of the North and provoked us. This is what only the vicious betrayer who does not care about the destiny of the country and the nation can do. Envious of the fact that opportunities had been provided for making progress in the DPRK-U.S. talks and that prospects had been provided for fundamentally resolving the nuclear issue, the puppet traitor made those absurd remarks in an insidious attempt to put a brake on this development at all costs and harm and crush [apsal] his fellow countrymen in collusion with international reactionaries. Babbling about the so-called provocation, traitor Kim Yong-sam also said that he would see to modernize the puppet armed forces and that it would be good for him not to comment on the Team Spirit joint military exercise because it was a sensitive issue. He made these remarks with the same intent. Facts show that traitor Kim Yong-sam has no will to realize reunification and intends to continuously pursue North-South confrontation this year. It is also proven that the civilian regime is so in appearance only and, in reality, is no different from any other preceding dictatorial regime. One has no reason to watch the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime or expect something from it. Traitor Kim Yong-sam must know what consequences his traitorous remarks and deeds harming his fellow countrymen will bring and act with discretion.
