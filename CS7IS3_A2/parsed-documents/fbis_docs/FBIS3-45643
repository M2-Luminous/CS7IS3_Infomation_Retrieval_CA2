The state-owned solely-funded limited company pattern will be a new organizational pattern in China's company system. As enterprises of public ownership are now being involved in the trial practice of the shareholding system, the restructuring of state- operated enterprises into state-owned solely-funded companies will change state-owned enterprises into legal persons observing the basic principle and the management system employed by companies. Following restructuring, the solely-funded limited companies will have certain fundamental characteristics including first, the independence of such enterprises of the sources of their capital and their being a legal person with their registered capital enabling them to enjoy their civil rights and shouldering their civil responsibilities. Second, the state is the only source of capital for a particular enterprise and it holds limited liability for the company to the extent defined by the amount of capital it offers. Third, management bodies involving state-owned assets have to base their trust on the board of directors which should be authorized to manage the company's assets and act in the interests of the company.
