President Sam Nujoma and SWAPO were insulted in the worst possible manner, and none of the thousands of explanations by SWAPO's public relations division is acceptable. Only a fanatical minority party support group still concern themselves with excuses from SWAPO headquarters. Namibians are not sorry that Mr. Mandela has dropped his plans to visit Namibian communities during a fund-raising attempt for the ANC's election campaign with SWAPO President Sam Nujoma and SWAPO Secretary General Moses Garoeb. Mr. Mandela unknowingly did Namibians a favor by canceling the visit. First, his presence would only have secured an audience for Mr. Garoeb in Oranjemund, and, second, under the current economic and social conditions, Namibians can ill afford to make funds available to a party such as the ANC, which already has millions at its disposal. Namibians believe that Mr. Mandela is aware of the fact that inhabitants of this country need the money more than the ANC does, and for this reason he decided not to visit the country. The motive for the cancellation could also be that Mr. Mandela has heard of SWAPO's three failed national fund-raising efforts and wanted to spare himself and SWAPO the disgrace. SWAPO's car competition in its newspaper, NAMIBIA TODAY, was canceled because of a lack of interest, while the newspaper eventually closed its doors for the same reason. For a while last year, it was propped up artificially with state funds and NEW ERA machinery. [passage omitted] Yesterday the ANC informed a South African news agency that Mr. Mandela's visit had been canceled, but a SWAPO spokesman Alfeus Naruseb reported that the visit would go ahead. It seems that SWAPO wanted to send a signal to Mr. Mandela that he should not cancel his visit before he has Mr. Naruseb's permission to do so. Mr. Nujoma explained yesterday that he was informed about the cancellation of the visit. According to him, Mr. Mandela telephoned him yesterday morning. But if Mr. Nujoma followed NBC [Namibian Broadcasting Corporation] news, he would have known that the South African news agency and the NBC knew a day before him that the visit had been canceled. This is a rude response from ANC ranks and an unequaled display of thanklessness. This insult comes after the organization received an amount of 1 million rand from the Namibian Government in the midst of the drought. It is an insult, to say the least. If SWAPO does not see it this way, then the party is more unobservant than expected.
