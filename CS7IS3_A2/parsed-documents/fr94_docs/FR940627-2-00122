FR940627-2-00122 FR940627-2-00049 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION Documents Containing Reporting or Recordkeeping Requirements: Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Review AGENCY: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). ACTION: Notice of the OMB review of information collection. SUMMARY: The NRC has recently submitted to the OMB for review the following proposal for the collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). 1. Type of submission, new, revision, or extension: Revision. 2. The title of the information collection: Proposed Rule, 10 CFR Part 54, ``Nuclear Power Plant License Renewal.'' 3. The form number if applicable: Not applicable. 4. How often collection is required: One-time submission with application for renewal of an operating license for a nuclear power plant and occasional collections for holders of renewed licenses. 5. Who will be required or requested to report: Commercial nuclear power plant licensees who wish to renew their operating licenses. 6. An estimate of the number of responses: As many as 100 licensees may take advantage of this provision over the next 30 years. It is anticipated that three or four responses will be received on average each year. 7. An estimate of the total number of hours needed to complete this requirement: The estimated burden on the licensee is being reduced from approximately 135,000 hours to 94,000 hours per license renewal. 8. An indication of whether Section 3504(h), Pub. L. 96&hyph;511 applies: Applicable. 9. Abstract: The license renewal rule (10 CFR Part 54) which was completed in December 1991, established procedures, criteria, and standards governing nuclear power plant license renewal, including information submittal and recordkeeping requirements. However, many of the details of the current rule are not clear with respect to requirements and procedures. The proposed rule amendment clarifies the requirements, eliminates unnecessary terminology, and simplifies the Integrated Plant Assessment to focus only on those passive, long-lived, nonredundant structures and components, whose functionality is not easily verified through performance or condition monitoring. Copies of the submittal can be inspected or obtained for a fee from the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Lower Level, Washington, DC 20037. Comments and questions should be directed by mail to the OMB reviewer: Troy Hiller, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, (3150&hyph;0155), NEOB&hyph;3019, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. Comments can also be submitted by telephone at (202) 395&hyph;3084. The NRC Clearance Officer is Brenda J. Shelton, (301) 415&hyph;7232. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 21st day of June, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Gerald F. Cranford, Designated Senior Official for Information Resources Management.
