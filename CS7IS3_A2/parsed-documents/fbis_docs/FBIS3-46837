The Ground Staff Office [GSO] of the GSDF, which has studied ways to shape a new defense policy in tune with the changes in the international situation, decided on 2 January to gradually reduce the 160 military bases to 99, beginning in 1996 by closing or integrating 61 military bases, or 38 percent of the total GSDF military bases. The scaleback plans for the military bases are designed to enhance the efficiency of the military bases across the country in parallel with cuts in the fixed number of GSDF personnel. The GSO, which has already established a principle of locating one military base in one prefecture, plans to close or integrate military bases in Kushiro, Hokkaido, Shinhatsuda in Niigata Prefecture and Tsujiura in Ibaraki Prefecture. The Defense Agency [DA], which plans to cut the fixed number of GSDF troops from 180,000 to less than 150,000 when it reviews the "Guidelines for the Defense Buildup Plan" which was established as Japan's basic defense policy during the Cold War era, has directed the GSO to study ways to shape a "desirable defense policy." While cuts in the GSDF troops are expected to cause an acute shortage of personnel at many military bases, the reduction of the defense budget is expected to force the GSDF to seek ways to enhance the efficiency of military bases, and the GSO has continued to work on the reorganization of GSDF units for more than six months. It has been pointed out that about one-third of the 160 GSDF military bases are manned by less than 500 troops, progress in upgrading their facilities remains sluggish, and the efficiency of their management and maintenance remains extremely poor. While sparsely populated areas near some military bases are impeding normal education for children of GSDF members assigned to the bases and hampering GSDF members from finding jobs after separation, residents in urban areas are increasingly demanding the closure of military bases. The GSO believes it is indispensable to shut down or integrate some military bases to resolve those problems. The GSO has already unveiled plans to close small military bases and to merge them into medium-sized military bases to be manned by more then 1,500 men in line with the principle of locating one military base in one prefecture while maintaining readiness for emergencies. Of 38 military bases in Hokkaido under command of the Northern Army to prepare for the "threat from the North," 26 bases in Wakanai, Nayoru, Shimabe and Rebun will remain intact, but 12 bases in Kushiro, Kuchian, and Kitageidei will be either closed or merged into other bases in light of the need to cope with emergencies. At the time of the founding the SDF in 1954, GSDF military bases numbered 102, but they have since continued to increase during the 1960s and the 1970s because of administrative needs to cope with sparsely populated areas and to send SDF members to disaster-hit areas. The GSO's plans to close or integrate the GSDF military bases are expected to draw a backlash from local governments, which have vigorously lobbied to induce military bases, and from legislators from constituencies where military bases subject to closing and integration are located.
