With respect to the foregoing, an attempt is made to investigate the possibility of developing a plasmid construction which contains the IL-1ra gene and is suitable for oriented mutagenesis and expression in prokaryotic systems. To this end, a mature IL-1ra gene is constructed with the help of a polymerase chain reaction (PTsR) using the mRNA[.sup].[/]cDNA hybrid as a template. The experimental procedure of constructing a primer and synthesizing the gene is described in detail. Two in vitro recombinations using the resulting mutant DNAs on the KpnI/Eco47III and Eco47III/HindIII sites with recloning into the pDR540 expressing vector which does not contain the KpnI site made it possible to eliminate mutations causing amino acid substitutions and produce a gene which precisely encodes the earlier described 152-link sequence of mature IL-1ra.
