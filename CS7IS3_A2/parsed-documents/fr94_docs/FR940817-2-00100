FR940817-2-00100 FR940817-2-00049 [OPP&hyph;00383; FRL&hyph;4874&hyph;2] Testing Guidelines for Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: This Notice announces the availability of the proposed Health Effects Test Guidelines for developmental toxicity and for reproductive and fertility effects and the start of a 60&hyph;day comment period. The documents were developed to amend and replace specific Agency guideline documents currently used for testing pesticides and toxic substances under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), respectively. DATES : Written comments, identified by the document control number OPP&hyph;00383, must be received on or before October 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the proposed guidelines are available at the address listed below for the Public Response and Program Resources Branch. By mail, submit three copies of written comments, identified with the docket control number ``OPP&hyph;00383'' to Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person, deliver comments to : Rm. 1132, CM#2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202. Information submitted as a comment concerning this document may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI). Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain CBI must be submitted for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132 at the Virginia address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan L. Makris, Health Effects Division (7509C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW, Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 816F, CM#2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202. Telephone: 703&hyph;305&hyph;5222. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The OPPTS Health Effects Test Guidelines for developmental toxicity (OPPTS 870.3700) will replace the Subdivision F Pesticide Assessment Guideline Section 83&hyph;3 (FIFRA) and 40 CFR 798.4900 (TSCA). The guideline for reproductive and fertility effects (OPPTS 870.3800) will replace the Subdivision F Pesticide Assessment Guideline Section 83&hyph;4, under FIFRA, and 40 CFR 798.4700, under TSCA. These revised guidelines were drafted by an inter-agency work group comprised of experts in the areas of developmental and reproductive toxicity. The proposed testing requirements incorporated into these developmental toxicity and reproductive and fertility effects guidelines were reviewed at a joint meeting of the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) and the Science Advisory Board (SAB) in December, 1993. The revised guidelines will significantly improve the Agency's ability to identify and characterize potential effects on the reproductive system and/or the developing fetus from exposure to chemicals. Availability of these revised guidelines will enhance the ability of pesticide registrants and industrial chemical manufacturers to plan, estimate costs of, and design studies that EPA currently requires for pesticides under 40 CFR Part 158 or may require by test rule or consent agreement for industrial chemicals. All interested parties are encouraged to submit comments on the proposed draft guidelines for developmental and reproductive toxicity studies. Specific comments should reference the document title, section number, and paragraph or subparagraph of the proposed guideline. Recommended technical or scientific changes/modifications should be supported by current scientific/technical knowledge and include supporting references. Comments on the proposed guidelines will be considered by the Agency and such modifications of the guidelines as are considered to be of scientific and technical merit will be considered for inclusion before the guidelines are published in a final form.
