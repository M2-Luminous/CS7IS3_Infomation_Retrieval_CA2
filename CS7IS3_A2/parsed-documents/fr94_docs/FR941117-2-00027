Take notice that on October 31, 1994, as supplemented on November 9, 1994, Entergy Services, Inc. (Entergy Services), as agent for Arkansas Power & Light Company, Gulf States Utilities Company, Louisiana Power & Light Company, Mississippi Power & Light Company, and New Orleans Public Service Inc. (collectively ``Entergy Operating Companies) filed a Network Service Tariff (``NST), including a pro forma network operating agreement, and service agreement, and a revised Transmission Service Tariff (``TST''), including pro forma service agreements for firm and non-firm services. Entergy Services states the filing is in response to the D.C. Circuit's remand in Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. vs. FERC, No 92&hyph;1461 (D.C. Cir. July 12, 1994), or prior Commission orders in Docket No. ER91&hyph;569. Entergy Services states the TST and NST are ``conforming proposals'' under the Commission's Transmission Pricing Policy Statement in Docket No. RM93&hyph;10. Entergy Services requests that the ``conforming'' NST and TST take effect on January 1, 1995. On October 31, 1994, as supplemented on November 9, 1994, Entergy Services also filed an alternative ``non-conforming'' transmission pricing proposal. Entergy Services requests that the non-conforming proposal supersede the conforming proposal, and go into effect after Commission review. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before December 2, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
