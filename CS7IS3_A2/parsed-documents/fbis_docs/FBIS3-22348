There, he met representatives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, World Bank, Agency for International Development, Department of Energy, and congressmen. Representatives of U.S. state bodies expressed their great interest in cooperation with Ukraine in the sphere of ecology and examined a package of proposals on steps to be taken as a matter of priority to improve the state of Ukraine's environment, presented by Yuriy Kostenko. Among them, in particular, were setting up some of the most up-to-date laboratories to monitor the radiological quality of water, organizing the disposal of toxic waste, making educational TV programs on ecology, and developing the MinPryrody [Environmental Protection Ministry] informational and educational center. The American side is planning to allocate $6 million to implement these projects. Commenting on this report, the MinPryrody press center added that ecological projects would be financed by the U.S. Agency for International Cooperation. It has long cooperated with Ukraine, and, in particular, will take part in privatization processes. This agency recently opened its headquarters in Kiev. It is this headquarters that will directly support various projects in Ukraine financially and methodologically.
