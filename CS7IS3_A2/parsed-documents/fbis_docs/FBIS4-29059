"Bright signs are certainly appearing," Fujii told a news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. He was referring to improvements for the first time in five years mentioned Friday in the Bank of Japan's quarterly "Tankan" survey of business confidence for May. But he refused otherwise to offer his assessment and outlook on the economy, saying, "overall assessment is done by the Bank of Japan and the Economic Planning Agency." "My job is to pin utmost efforts to put those bright signs on a steady path," Fujii said, particularly calling for early passage of the fiscal 1994 budget. The delayed budget for the current fiscal year that began April 1 is under deliberation at the House of Councillors after passing the House of Representatives last week. The government is now running with a stopgap budget. Concerning the yen's resurgence against the dollar these past few days, Fujii said the currency rate direction is a problem as he and Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno have been saying. "We are closely watching the currency rate movements from the standpoint of the economy," he said. He reiterated that Japan is in close contact with other Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations to cooperate in stemming "undesirable volatility" as the G-7 finance ministers and central bankers reaffirmed at their April meeting in Washington. Mieno told a House of Councillors Budget Committee meeting Monday that it looks like the economy has moved "one step" toward recovery but noted that various uncertainties prevent him from describing the economy as having gone "two or three steps forward." Economic Planning Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa told reporters after the Tuesday cabinet meeting, "I can't say yet the economy has turned around although I feel more optimistic." Both Mieno and Terasawa cited lingering concern over the yen's rise and sluggish corporate capital investment as the major factors for the cautiousness.
