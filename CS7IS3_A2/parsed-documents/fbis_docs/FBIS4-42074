Scharping said a certain cooperation could be conceivable, above all with those Free Democrats who voted for Johannes Rau. However, coalitions should only be considered following the Bundestag elections. But his criticism was not a signal for a red-green coalition, Scharping said. Antje Vollmer, the leading candidate of the Alliance 90/Greens in Hesse, sees good chances for a red-green government alliance following the Bundestag elections. She said the Greens had "offered themselves to the SPD as a reliable partner in the next government." [passage omitted]
