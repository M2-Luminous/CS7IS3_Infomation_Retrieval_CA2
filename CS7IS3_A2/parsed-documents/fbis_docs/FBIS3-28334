Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ordered Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to revise a previous tax plan announced by the premier last week, after leaders of the coalition parties asked the government on Monday to come up with a new plan, the official at the ministry's tax bureau said. But the ministry, he said, will "not change its policy to include tax cuts and hike in a single program." The official declined to comment on whether the new plan would call for a tax which limits revenue use to special purposes. Hosokawa told Fujii to draft a plan "as soon as possible," the official said. Hosokawa last week announced a "national welfare tax" similar to the consumption tax to offset income and corporate tax cuts, but the ruling coalition rejected the proposal. The ministry official later corrected his comments, saying the Prime Minister's Office contacted Fujii again to explain that Hosokawa told the coalition leaders he would have the Finance and Home Affairs Ministries "help" the coalition form a new tax plan. Hosokawa told Sakigake representative Hiroyuki Sonoda to reach a final decision on the tax plan at the coalition meeting, according to the Finance Ministry official.
