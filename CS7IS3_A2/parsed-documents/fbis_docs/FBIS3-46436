The ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY said the plan contains 50 cooperative items including the exchange of military leaders and experts, joint military maneuvers and training exercises as well as opportunities for Russian officers to visit NATO states for advanced studies in military academies there. The NATO delegation arrived in Moscow on Thursday [27 January] and both sides have held talks on how to find a solution to the crises in hot-spot areas amongst countries who are members of the commonwealth of independent states. The delegation said NATO will provide aid to Russian peacekeepers in these areas, but will not become directly involved in peacekeeping action by deploying forces. NATO maintains, however, that Russia's peacekeeping operations in the trouble areas of the former Soviet Union should be under the control of the United Nations.
