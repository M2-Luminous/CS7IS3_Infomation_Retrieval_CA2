This is an important legal basis for our country's legal administration of finance, as well as a vital step in strengthening the construction of a socialist legal system. Budgeting is one of the key means for a country to manage its social and economic affairs and implement macroscopic regulation and has a very important position in the whole country's political and economic life. As early as the initial period of our country's founding, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The state budget is a big issue which reflects the whole country's policies because it prescribes the scope and direction of government activities." Over the past 40 years or so, our country's budget administrative work has constantly improved and strengthened, whereas all the people strived to earn more and spend less, ensure the supply of funds for key construction projects, and promote the rapid development of the undertaking of building socialism. The achievement has been remarkable. However, we should also see that over a long period of time, we have not drawn up a basic law in budget administration, and there are a lot of problems in working out, examining and approving, implementing, revising, finally accounting, and supervising a budget. For example, the procedure for working out a budget is unclear, the rights and duties of budget administration are not defined, the procedure for examining and approving the budget are not strict, we are not conscientious in implementing the budget, and we are slack in budget supervision. As a result, budgets do not have the necessary legal solemnity, thus leading to the emergence of such phenomena as overspending and capital waste. The implementation of the "Budget Law" will definitely help overcome the above-mentioned problems, heighten the legal effect of budgets at all levels, and give full play to the various functions of a budget. Meanwhile, the "Budget Law" has an important bearing on ensuring the smooth implementation of financial and taxation reform, strengthening the State's macroscopic regulation, and promoting the healthy development of the socialist market economy. The "Budget Law" unequivocally prescribes the duties and competence of the budget administrations of people's congresses, governments, departments, and units at all levels. Thus, organs of power and executive organs at all levels are requested to handle their work in strict accordance with legal provisions to ensure the true implementation of the "Budget Law." People's congresses and their standing committees at all levels must, in light of the provisions of the "Budget Law," conscientiously exercise the power of examining and approving budgets and final accounts, the power of examining and approving budget revisions, the power of supervising budgets and final accounts, and other functions, thus making their budgets genuine indexes. Governments at all levels must work in strict accordance with the provisions of the "Budget Law" to conscientiously draft their budgets and final accounts and organize well budget implementation. On discovering any violation of the provisions of the "Budget Law," they should seriously handle it, conscientiously correct it, and thoroughly stop practices transgressing budget provisions to safeguard the legal solemnity of budgets. Financial departments at all levels and various departments and units must also exercise their functions and perform various duties undertaken by them in accordance with the law. With the implementation of the "Budget Law," the work of budget administration will advance to a new stage on a legalized, standardized, and scientific path, thus enabling the work of budgeting to make new contributions to the establishment and development of the socialist market economy.
