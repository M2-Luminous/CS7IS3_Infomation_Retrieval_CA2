I hope it is a good omen for the future of our relationship. "As you are aware, Romania positively appreciated the Partnership for Peace from the very beginning. "If you were to ask why did we like the Partnership for Peace, I would say that most and foremost for its fair, equal and non-discriminatory approach. "May I also stress that my country considers the Partnership for Peace as a preliminary stage to Romania's future membership to NATO's political and military structures. We also welcomed the Partnership as a new form of cooperation between NATO and the democratic states for the East of the alliance meant to enhance security and stability in Europe. "In joining the Partnership for Peace, we attach utmost importance to the pledge of the alliance that it is committed to the preservation of democratic societies of the partners, to their freedom from coercion and intimidation, and the maintenance of the principles of international law. "I reaffirm here and now, on this solemn occasion, my country's commitment to fulfill in good faith the obligations incumbent upon it by the UN Charter, and the principles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. We fully support the call of the recent Brussels summit to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, to respect existing borders and to settle disputes by peaceful means. Romania remains deeply committed to the Helsinki Final Act and all subsequent CSCE documents, as well as to the obligations undertaken in the field of disarmament and arms control. "The political statements, particularly President Clinton's statement, that NATO must address the concerns of those nations that lie between Russia and West Europe, for the security of those nations affects the security of America and the alliance as a whole, and the security mechanism agreed upon in Brussels represent to my country a major support and encouragement in its endeavors to strengthen its stability and security at a moment of turmoil in its vicinity, and, on a wider scale, a support for the consolidation of the Romanian democratic society. "By acceding today to the Partnership for Peace, Romania is undertaking another major step in the implementation of its fundamental political option of integration into Euro-Atlantic structures -- a goal that enjoys the consensus of major political parties and of the public opinion at large. "We are delighted to return to the world where Romania has always belonged. Our whole history, culture, traditions, political institutions have always been linked -- except for the Cold War time -- with the Western world. Integration into this world in every possible way is but a natural option for Romania. "We are deeply convinced that belonging to this world is the sole guarantee and the strongest incentive for the successful accomplishment of our national domestic targets of building a democratic society, with a market economy and full respect of human rights. "Now that we joined the Partnership for Peace, we plan to move ahead, and to move quickly. "Romanian civil and military experts are already working on the presentation document. In that respect, we have initiated informal consultations with military experts from NATO countries. "May I take the opportunity in order to invite a team of NATO experts to Bucharest to assist us in drafting the relevant documents. "A package of laws on the democratic reform of our armed forces (civilian control, transparency, elaboration of the new military doctrine) have been submitted for validation to the Romanian parliament."
