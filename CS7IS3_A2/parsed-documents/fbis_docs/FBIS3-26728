Li Lanqing pointed out: Customs operations are an important part of the country's macroeconomic regulation and control. A reform of the customs system must be implemented simultaneously with a reform of the country's overall economic structure to gradually establish a modern customs system with Chinese characteristics that is compatible with the socialist market economic system, that is supportive of China's opening up, that conforms to general international rules, and that is organically unified in terms of convenience and discipline, as well as in terms of restrictions and efficiency. He said: In reforming the customs system, we should pay attention to the force that we apply, and we should consider the ability of all to withstand this force. We must stop unhealthy practices and must promote integrity through reform; we must control what needs to be controlled and must assign tasks that need to be assigned. To achieve these two tasks, we must implement the auditing system as well as reform the customs declaration system and the system and style of customs management. Meanwhile, we must combine customs reform with the application of modern technological means to establish a modern and highly efficient customs system. Li Lanqing stressed: Customs officials' principal duty is to monitor and control import and export activities in accordance with the law, as well as to ensure the efficient implementation of state policies and laws concerning foreign economic activities and trade. Customs offices must strengthen their control over imports and exports, as well as strictly check and penalize illegal activities such as certification evasion, tax evasion, and tax cover-ups to safeguard the proper economic order. Li Lanqing said: Under the direct leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council, we have made progress in the current antismuggling struggle, but we must not relax it one bit. We must fully realize that the antismuggling struggle is a long-term and arduous task, and we must continue to strictly crack down on illegal smuggling activities. Customs offices must further bring into play their principal antismuggling departments, gather the support of local governments and their antismuggling leading groups, strengthen their cooperation with the relevant judicial and law-enforcement organs, exploit the role of the relevant press and propaganda departments, and spur the broad masses to do a good job in the comprehensive control of smuggling activities. Customs offices must resolutely implement the principle of "making arrests at sea, catching people in ports, investigating at customs checkpoints, exercising control of the market, and imposing heavy penalties" while undertaking antismuggling tasks. In particular, they must insist on imposing strict penalties and speed up investigations of major cases, and they must not replace punishment with fines. Customs offices must simultaneously undertake antismuggling and anticorruption tasks to ensure the healthy development of the country's economic construction. He asked customs offices to impose strict self-discipline, realistically strengthen their development, and systematically control their operations. Customs offices must establish clean administration and undertake reform measures to ensure the proper use of power and to prevent corruption from spreading. He said he hoped that in the new year, customs offices nationwide would continue to uphold the principle whereby tasks are focused on promotion and on strict controls to effectively safeguard the country's economy.
