The meeting later adopted, in principle, the draft additional regulations. The meeting maintained that, since they came into effect on 1 January 1987, the current regulations have played a significant role in safeguarding social order and social stability. However, with the development of the economy and the deepening of reform and opening up, many new situtions and new issues with regard to public order have appeared. Thus, the additional regulations are very essential for strengthening control over public offense; safeguarding public order, safety, and interests; and protecting citizens' legitimate rights and interests so that reform, opening up, and socialist modernization can proceed smoothly. The meeting adopted, in principle, the additional regulations (draft), which the State Council will submit to the National People's Congress Standing Committee after further revision.
