The Minag has approximately 150,000 such resources nationwide; approximately a sixth of which will be mothballed. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] In regard to tractors, for example, we must prepare approximately 8,000 for long-term storage, as well as a similar number of diverse transportation vehicles. There are also approximately 10,000 implements. [end recording] The decision to put away and preserve these resources, in addition to material limitations, was made based on the existence of more efficient forms of organization in Cuban agriculture such as the Basic Cooperative Production Units and the Youth Labor Army integrated farms. In this manner, the Minag's productive plans for 1994 are not compromised. The process of preservation and storage will be conducted by the enterprises which will result in a rational use of available resources and the reorganization and betterment of their technical assistance network. It was announced at the demonstration class on preservation held in Guantanamo that the Minag provincial office recommended stopping 40 percent of its machinery, half its transportation vehicles, and 30 percent of its implements. It is a matter of preservation now to conserve for the future.
