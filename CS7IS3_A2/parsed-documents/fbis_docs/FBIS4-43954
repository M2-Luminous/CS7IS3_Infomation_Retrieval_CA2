Yilmaz concluded his contacts in the United States and returned to Turkey. TRT correspondent Yavuz Yorulmaz reports from Washington: [Begin recording] [Yorulmaz] [passage omitted] In a news conference at the end of his contacts, Yilmaz said that public opinion and lobbies have gained importance in the United States in recent years. He said that Turkey should be more active with regard to lobbying activities. As two allied countries, Turkey and the United States have mutual responsibilities, Yilmaz pointed out. He noted that in pursuing these relations, Turkey takes into account world peace as well as the interests of the two countries. Yilmaz cited the Korean and Gulf wars as examples. Yilmaz remarked that linking the defense aid to Turkey does not conform with allied relations. [Yilmaz] Given the seriousness with which Turkey has treated its alliance relations with the United States and the sacrifices it has made to fulfill these relations, Turkey has the right to expect the same understanding and, if necessary, the same sacrifice from its U.S. allies at a time when it is facing certain temporary difficulties. [Yorulmaz] Pointing out that the Turkish people will react against conditional military aid, Yilmaz said: If the current government accepts this aid under these conditions, it will contradict the will of our people. Yilmaz remarked that the weight of Congress, public opinion, and lobbies is increasing in the United States, and Turkey should take this development into account in its relations with this country. He noted that anti-Turkish lobbies are currently emphasizing the human rights issue. Yilmaz reported that, during the talks, he expressed the view that terrorism and the human rights issue should not be confused with one another. The Cyprus problem was also raised during the talks, Yilmaz explained, adding that he stressed the importance of the United Nations acknowledging the conciliatory attitude of the Turkish Cypriot side. Pointing out that the Turkish economy is increasingly being damaged by the embargo imposed on Iraq, Yilmaz said that he conveyed to the U.S. Administration that this situation must be rectified without losing more time. He added: The only hopeful indication I received was that the U.S. Administration will support the UN procedure to renew the flow of oil in the oil pipeline. After his news conference, Yilmaz left the United States for Turkey. [end recording] The ANAP leader was received at Ankara's Esenboga Airport by party leaders and members.
