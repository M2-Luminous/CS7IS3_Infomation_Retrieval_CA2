This assertion was made by Pablo de Tavira, their director. There are currently two prisons of this type: the Number One Federal High Security Center in Almoloya, Mexico State, with 383 inmates (it has a capacity of 400), and the Number Two, in Guadalajara, Jalisco, with a population of 220 inmates. A few days ago, De Tavira held a press conference, something unusual, because during his three plus years as director of the Almoloya center, he has always refused to speak with reporters. At that conference, he charged that there were human rights organizations sponsored by drug traffickers in existence, and he claimed to have received threats. In an interview with PROCESO, he expanded upon his statements: [Cabildo] Are you worried about the threats that you have received? [De Tavira] The inmate here can threaten very easily. And he does so because it has always worked for him. "This chief is living on borrowed time," claims Rafael Caro Quintero, referring to me. [Cabildo] Did he do this personally? [De Tavira] There is no direct dealing with him; he tells this to others. But he shouts it in front of many people, to let me know: "This chief is living on borrowed time. He is a living dead man, because there are 500 people ready to kill him at any time." [Cabildo] How much do those threats worry you? [De Tavira] When stated by someone who has made criminal activity his life, they do worry me. But I think that I must be strong and face the risks. We must take care of ourselves, certainly, but we must be firm in our convictions. I believe that high security prisons are necessary, that these people deserve a change, and that society deserves respect. And society will be respected when those drug lords are really punished, as they deserve. We cannot let ourselves be overcome by fear, either, just because they could kill us. [Cabildo] What is happening at Almoloya? [De Tavira] The problem is concentrated among 20 percent of the population, consisting of the principal drug trafficking "capos" and their aides. They are trying, at all costs, to return to the traditional prison systems, and to establish self-government. The leading "capos" (Rafael Caro Quintero, Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, Javier Pardo Cardona, Oliverio Chavez Araujo, Fonseca Carrillo, "El Chapo" Guzman, and one of the Arellano Felix group) constitute only 2 percent. The other 18 percent are highly dangerous people. They are the executors, such as "Ceja Guera," or persons in some way connected with public administration who have later appeared implicated in illicit activities, as in the case of Gonzalez Trevino. They are people not so powerful as the "capos," but just as important for national security reasons. [Cabildo] Why have the maximum security prisons been created? [De Tavira] It all started with the problems experienced in Mexican prisons during 1985, which also coincided with Mexico's major drug trafficking problems. Very serious things began happening: The prison riots, such as those in Nayarit, Matamoros, Hermosillo, and Puebla, were bloody. For example, there was a monarchy in Matamoros, headed by Chavez Araujo; in the Northern Prison, by Caro Quintero; or in the Southern Prison, by Felix Gallardo. They were living like kings, and this exposed a sad reality: the prisons were in the inmates' hands, in many instances owing to self-government. With Sergio Garcia Ramirez, Alfonso Quiroz Cuaron, and Antonio Sanchez Galindo, who modernized the prison system with a great scientific emphasis, the Porfirian-style jails disappeared. This occurred during the 1970's. In the 1980's, however, Mexico's real prison situation deteriorated enormously. Crime became organized and highly dangerous, associated with the international drug traffic. And all this necessarily had repercussions on the prisons, which were neglected with respect to their capacity, because no more prisons were built. Another deciding factor in the deterioration was the benevolent attitude of the authorities, who thought that by granting concessions to the inmates they were keeping peace in the prisons. But this only contributed to self-government, and to giving the inmates a privileged status. And, according to many penologists, this is all right, because it keeps peace in the prisons. However, when power struggles began, with massacres among inmates, and we realized that there were all types of weapons in the prisons and that the vested interests were terrible, the creation of maximum security centers emerged as a priority requirement. [Cabildo] Who was the brains behind this type of prison? [De Tavira] It was not my invention; it was a necessity. To build high security centers in Mexico, a lengthy investigation was conducted, with many specialists participating. Later, the plan emerged creating the so-called Federal Closed Incarceration Center, and the first institution was the Almoloya center. It is located on the very same site where humanistic prison reform, very praiseworthy in its time, had appeared. [Cabildo] However, there are apparently problems at Almoloya, too. [De Tavira] What is happening at Almoloya, after three years and three months of work, is a natural reaction from those who had everything, and now are not allowed anything that could foster self-government. At Almoloya, the inmate must submit to a prison system diametrically opposed to the traditional one, and to a program of work that he must do every day, without excuses. The inmate may not remain in his cell; he must leave in the morning and return when he has finished his tasks. There is a very strict classification. Equals are kept with equals, so as to undermine them, to some extent. A thorough preliminary analysis is made of each inmate, including his record and connections with gangs, so as to assign him properly. Except for two suicides, there has not been a single problem. I realize that the Almoloya system may not be an easy one for the inmate, and it is not easy, because it is disciplinary. It is an institution that is punishing his social conduct. What is happening now is that the inmates who, at the outset, arrived rather impressed, have gradually become adapted. However, since the changes that they were expecting have not occurred, they are very angry with the Almoloya system, and are trying to damage it in some way. How will they damage it? Well, by discrediting it through certain nongovernmental organizations that have no representative status; or through their lawyers, who will do what they say, because they are paid, and paid very well. The drug traffickers' attorneys live like kings. Everyone is entitled to a defense, but the drug trafficker's lawyer is capable of anything. They are unscrupulous people, and it is they who are organizing the discreditation campaign. [Cabildo] Can you specify which nongovernmental human rights organizations are the ones participating in that campaign? [De Tavira] Initially, the financing comes from the upper echelon, with financial power. I am referring in particular to organizations comprised of ex-inmates, who become business agents for the prisoners in some way. They receive very good rewards through the lawyers, to exert some pressure on the authorities. [Cabildo] Could you cite exactly which organizations they are? [De Tavira] There is a single organization, the Inter-American Human Rights Committee in Defense of Prison Inmates (CIDH-DIP). There are others, for example, the Rebels; and still another, named for a youth whom they took out and tortured at the Northern Prison. There has been a proliferation of human rights organizations comprised of inmates or ex-inmates. In this particular case, those who sign the ads and appear at the press conferences are ex-inmates who were at other centers, and have never been in Almoloya, not even to visit. They are absolutely ignorant of the system operating at Almoloya. We have very strict control over visits, and none of those signing have been at Almoloya. Only family members of the inmates and their lawyers have access to the prison. So, who could possibly be conveying all these inmates' concerns outside? Well, it is the lawyers. They are the ones calling upon these associations and planning the campaigns through the drug traffickers' wives, who are heading the discreditation campaign. For example, there is Caro Quintero's wife, Mrs. Elenis de Caro; Felix Gallardo's daughters; Marcio Alvarez's daughters and wife; the wife of the Colombian, Pardo Cardona; and Don Neto's wife and daughters. They have been the ones leading the campaign, at press conferences organized at a luxury hotel, the Camino Real. They were later held at the office of one of the attorneys representing Caro Quintero, Felix, and Don Neto: namely, Efrain Garcia Ramirez. It is an honorable surname but, fortunately not related to Don Sergio Garcia Ramirez. I am not saying that Mr. Efrain Garcia Ramirez is not a trained man; he is. He was even my student, and an outstanding student. But I think that, in the legal profession, each individual is dedicated to, and defends whomever he wishes. He has decided to defend those people; I would not do so. Efrain's idea is that those only being indicted, that is, those who have not yet received their respective sentences, do not belong in Almoloya. However, the amendments to the Federal Code of Criminal Procedure and to the Regulations of Federal Centers leave his demands invalid. With those amendments, the legality of the permission to confine persons still under indictment in Almoloya has been settled. [passage omitted] The prison personnel are in charge of everything and, in return, high security is maintained. There is an attempt to prevent self-government, and to avoid all the problems that have caused serious trouble in our institutions. That is why the state spends so much money: 200 new pesos per day on each inmate. Now, they are trying to sabotage this system. But there can be no setback in the construction of maximum security prisons (it is about to begin on the one in Tamaulipas), if there is a desire to put an end to the self-government operating in the majority of the country's jails.
