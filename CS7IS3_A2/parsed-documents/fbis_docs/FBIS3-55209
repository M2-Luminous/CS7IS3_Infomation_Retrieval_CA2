Even without this the newspaper was unlawfully closed down for almost three months, and subscribers failed to receive a great deal of important, true information about a whole period in the life of Russia and the world. Surely we will not be left without a newspaper again, they ask worriedly. Although we fully share the undoubtedly just indignation of our journalist colleagues at the prevailing price chaos and bureaucratic chaos, we are nevertheless forced to say no to the collective protest action. We hold too dear the possibility -- recently infrequent -- of communicating with our readers, we have too much to say, we have too many lies to refute. For us, the SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA journalists, silence is a luxury we cannot afford. We have our own score to settle with the present authorities, and it too is not small. No one intends to compensate for the losses to readers and the journalists' collectives which were brought about by the unlawful closure of the newspaper, and subscriptions to our newspapers are being hindered and blocked in every way at the mail offices. Every conceivable and inconceivable obstacle is placed on the path of every issue of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA published. The situation is exacerbated many times by the fact that the editorial office's current account was unlawfully impounded literally until yesterday. Because of this we are not in a position to settle our accounts with our partners in the production and distribution of the newspaper in a timely fashion. In the face of this, to be published, to get through to the reader, having penetrated the cordon of obstacles, means to conquer.
