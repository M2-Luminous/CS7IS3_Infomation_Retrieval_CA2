[sentence as received] In his words, "corruption is corroding the state apparatus." Ilyukhin believes that the most corrupt body is the Goskomimushchestvo (the State Property Committee), and that "the dock has long been waiting for" its chairman, vice-premier Anatoliy Chubays. Ilyukhin said that at the beginning of the '80s, specialists estimate, 35 percent of stolen money was spent to bribe officials, now -- 50 percent and more. In 1993 150 major criminal organizations operated in Russia with more than 35,000 enterprises within their spheres of influence. 4,500 case of bribery were registered. Speaking about "financial subversion against Russia", Ilyukhin said that in 1993 4,300 crimes were disclosed in the banking system. All in all, 52,000 corruption-related crimes were registered last year. Cases against 1,500 officials were opened. In his opinion, "a totally criminalized economy may develop" in Russia. Ilyukhin also said that the security committee had prepared a draft law on fighting corruption. On May 11 it will be submitted to a plenary session of the State Duma. He noted that a new provision in the draft law is that a state official should sign a document on his income, real estate and personal property worth over 100 minimal salaries, bank deposits and securities, financial obligations, including those abroad. Referring to the Central Electoral Commission, Ilyukhin accused Russia's Choice faction and Yabloko faction that during the election campaign they used the money received from joint ventures in violation of the Russian president's decree. He said that Russia's Choice had received more than 300 million rubles from these joint ventures for holding the election campaign, and Yabloko -- more than 30 million rubles. Answering an Interfax question Ilyukhin said that at the next meeting the council of the State Duma will consider this issue and will obviously put it on the agenda of a plenary meeting. Ilyukhin believes that the legality of deputy mandates of the above mentioned factions "should become a subject for investigation by the mandate commission of the State Duma."
