FR940926-0-00055 FR940926-0-00011 Summary of Comments and Recommendations In the June 24, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. The public comment period ended on August 23, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment was published in ``The Honolulu Advertiser'' on July 16, 1993, ``The Maui News'' on July 21, 1993, and the ``Hawaii Tribune Herald on July 19, 1993. One letter of comment was received offering additional information on the distribution of one taxon. This information has been incorporated into this final rule. One phone call was received opposing the listing and raising the following issue: Issue: The control of feral ungulates is unnecessary and done using inhumane methods. Response: Several studies verify that feral ungulates damage native plants and habitats. Feral goats and pigs have been implicated in the damage of native vegetation ranging from lowland to subalpine areas (Mueller-Dombois and Spatz 1972; Spatz and Mueller-Dombois 1973, 1975; Scowcroft and Sakai 1983). Goat browsing damage has been observed on individuals of Asplenium fragile var. insulare (R. Shaw, in litt., 1993). Goats, sheep, axis deer, and/or pigs threaten all four taxa through habitat degradation. Recovery efforts for these four endangered taxa should include the control of feral ungulates, but this control should be done in the most humane way possible, consistent with the need to protect the habitat of these taxa. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists of endangered and threatened species. A species may be determined to be an endangered species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). The threats facing these four taxa are summarized in Table 1.
