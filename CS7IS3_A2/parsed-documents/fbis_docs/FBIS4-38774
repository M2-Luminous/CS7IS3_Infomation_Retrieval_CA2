The written protest was handed over to Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, who is now on an inspection tour in the Crimea. TASS has learnt that according to the document, over seven thousand naval officers and sailors, servicemen of the base's garrison, as well as their families will find themselves without means of subsistence and will have to leave their homes looking for new jobs and housing in case the base in Donuzlava is put under the Ukrainian command. Moreover, the protesters are sure the base and the settlment will inevitably fall into decay. During the Moscow talks on the Black Sea Fleet's division between Russia and Ukraine, the Donuzlava base was named among possible locations of the Ukrainan share of the disputed fleet.
