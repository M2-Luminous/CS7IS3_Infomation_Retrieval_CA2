The lawmakers were thus authorized to assumed their posts on 11 March. Tricel President Enrique Zurita Camps, who is also a Supreme Court member, delivered to the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, Gabriel Valdes and Jorge Molina, respectively, the official document with the proclamation of the citizens who were elected congressmen. Zurita Camps reported that neither of the two appeals filed on the election of senators or any of the 42 appeals filed on the election of deputies were granted. Consequently, the figures released by the Interior Ministry after the elections have not been substantially changed. [passage omitted]
