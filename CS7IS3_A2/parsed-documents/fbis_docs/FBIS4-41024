A very long move, at that: to Geneva, at the invitation and at the expense of the international nongovernmental organization Forum, thus giving rise to numerous rumors among his countrymen. Supporters regard Meshkov's trip as a visit by a political leader recognized in the West, while gossip-hungry cynics see it as a trip to open a Swiss bank account. Be that as it may, Meshkov left with an easy mind: According to surveys, even though the Crimeans will go to the polls, in the majority of cases they will not vote for Leonid Kravchuk but for Leonid Kuchma. Generally, it is foolish to deny that Meshkov is an extraordinary figure on the CIS political stage. Public calm on the peninsula -- as well as relations between Simferopol and Kiev -- largely depends on him. The Crimean president's trip to Moscow and the inviting of metropolitan economists to Crimea are seen as his most successful moves. Yevgeniy Saburov assumed office virtually painlessly, which is more than can be said for his Moscow team. The Crimean Supreme Soviet in particular has started to drop broad hints that the president, by betting on the Muscovites, has fallen hostage to cabinet politics not formulated in Crimea, and it has begun to challenge Meshkov's edict-issuing powers. True, the slogan "face to face with Russia" has not lost its attraction to the Crimeans. It is also significant that Kravchuk, who planned to visit the mutinous peninsula in the course of his election campaign, has not so far made up his mind. The friction between Simferopol and Kiev has brought dividends not only to Meshkov. Occasionally, he has acted too sharply, which in the absence of open support from Moscow only heightened passions in Kiev over Ukraine's territorial integrity and brought considerable political dividends to Kravchuk, custodian of the Constitution, both in the West and at home. If preelection polls reflect the situation adequately and the majority of Crimeans and other Ukrainian voters vote for Kuchma, even then Meshkov's problems will not diminish. Because so far, political demarches come off better with him than economic solutions. Kuchma for his part -- even though, judging by his election statements, he advocates a union with Russia, on the one hand, and Crimea's sovereignty within Ukraine's borders on the other -- will hardly put up with sluggish reform. Furthermore, in this event Meshkov will most likely also have to revise some of the decisions made. For example, it is not clear how a constitution revived by the Supreme Soviet, restoring the independent Crimean Republic, will fit into the concept of state structure a la Kuchma. Possibly, it was the uncertainty of the situation that forced Meshkov to leave his country at such a crucial moment. A month ago, during the Crimean president's trip to Cyprus, Kravchuk sanctioned an unexpected landing in Simferopol of top military brass and special task forces. This enabled Meshkov once more to show himself off as an independent leader. It is unlikely that anything like this will happen now (discounting Kravchuk's possible visit) but it is not ruled out that Kiev is provoking Meshkov to undertake another demarche.
