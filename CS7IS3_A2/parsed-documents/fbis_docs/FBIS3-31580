[Iliescu] Initially, I wish to emphasize that the relations between the two countries are very strong and are favored by the people of the two countries. In recent years, our relations have improved on the basis of mutual respect and trust. Despite all the changes that have taken place between Iran and Romania, relations have continued in a cohesive form and have been strengthened by suitable political circumstances, the will of the leaders to preserve traditional political and economic relations, and those leaders' interest in regional cooperation because of the distinctive characteristics of the two countries that have culminated in economic closeness. Those relations have been constantly expanding so that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the fourth greatest partner in economic exchanges with Romania, which shows the capabilities of the two countries for greater economic cooperation. Of course, there is also the possibility of upgrading the exchanges, which are currently at half a billion dollars annually. We believe that it would be appropriate to increase the exchanges because of the reciprocal recognition and relations between the two economic parties. Iran is the most important supplier of oil to Romania. A project is underway for the construction of a gas pipeline from Iran to Europe in which Romania is actively involved. It is hoped that the project will materialize soon. In the near future, a joint commission of the two projects will be set up in Bucharest. Only today a trade and commerce agreement was signed between Iran and Romania, which facilitates the increase in trade, and new plans for cooperation will be specified at the joint commission's session. We will support them and are very hopeful of the implementation of such projects. [RESALAT] Does your leanings toward the West, especially in the field of free trade and a market economy, mean that you will change your relations with those countries with which you have traditional ties, such as Iran? [Iliescu] On the contrary, I believe that the world is leaning toward the participation of countries in international exchanges and that we are witnessing a trend toward integrating national economies with international economies. [passage omitted] [RESALAT] Europe and the rest of the West have not been able to end the tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What is your assessment of the issue? Ostensibly, the United Nations treats the people of Europe--including the Bosnian Muslims--very unjustly. Why is that? [Iliescu] The tragedy that the people of the former Yugoslavia have been faced with, especially the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has also affected Romania because it is a neighbor of Yugoslavia. In the past we have had very cordial relations. [passage omitted] We believe that this conflict can be resolved by the international community as the continuation of war and bloodshed can only deepen the catastrophe in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course, steps have been taken in this direction. In the Geneva talks the basic conditions were discussed and an understanding was achieved. Therefore, constant efforts should be made until a solution is reached. We are confident that logic will be victorious, since the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina have lived together for centuries. It is not a mere ethnic conflict, as a large number of people in Bosnia- Herzegovina are Serbs and Croats who accepted Islam during the Ottoman empire. [passage omitted on historical details] [RESALAT] How are your relations with Russia, especially on economic issues? What is your opinion on the statements made by Zhirinovskiy? He has threatened Russia's neighbors. What do you think about this? [Iliescu] We are following the developments in Russia very carefully, as it is a major country in out region. We are neighbors and we should maintain our relations with Russia. We have had both positive and negative relations throughout history, and it is to our benefit that democratic forces should triumph in Russia so internal stability may be ensured and it can play a positive role in the world. Unfortunately, there have been problems in the republics of the former Soviet Union, especially economic disarray that has had a negative impact on the lives of the people. This has resulted in the emergence of extremists such as Zhirinovskiy, who are considered very dangerous. With such forces coming into power, not only Russian reforms but the stability of the region, Europe, and the world are in danger. We are interested in having good relations with Russia. We want to expand such relations with Russia and Ukraine on the basis of respect and safeguarding reciprocal interests. We want our relations to be based on mutual respect and the preservation of the interests of both sides. [passage omitted] As president of Romania, I wish to congratulate the Iranian nation on its auspicious celebrations of victory over the shah's regime and hope that you are successful in consolidating society and every department of your country. The people of Romania welcomed the struggles of the people of Iran and interpreted them as the wishes of the Iranian nation.
