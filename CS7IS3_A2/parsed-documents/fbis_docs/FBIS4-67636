Only fund-holding by family doctors has produced any marked -- if selective -- benefits, according to research by the King's Fund health policy institute. This has led to two-tier health care in some parts of the country. The institute commissioned seven research projects over the period 1990-93, covering various aspects of introduction in 1991 of self-governing hospital trusts, fund-holding and the contracting system between trusts and health authorities or fund-holders. A report drawing together the research results says that while the changes have put in place systems for improving performance, and while there is potential for exploiting them, there is yet only limited evidence of any gains. Claims that trusts have led to greater efficiency are difficult to substantiate because the first trusts were already the more efficient units, the report says. The degree of patient choice of hospital has always been low and the changes "do not appear to have affected this situation". Services for elderly people have shown no improvement in terms of choice, accessibility, communication or quality, with patients covered by the research having waited longer for treatment in 1992 than in 1990. Introduction of medical audit has offered a chance to improve the quality of care by highlighting and reviewing good and bad practice, the report says. But research at four hospitals showed that it was interpreted too narrowly and was dominated by senior doctors, excluding other health professionals. While the report says that fund-holding general practitioners have achieved benefits for their patients, and that fund-holding is one of the few parts of the changes having the planned effect on competitive efficiency, it warns that this may be at the expense of equity of treatment. "The evidence suggests that a two-tier service has developed in places, almost by default." Although it is argued that all patients will eventually benefit, "it is hard to see how this could come about without some expansion in funding to finance across-the-board improvements in services". Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the National Health Service, welcomed the report but said that the changes had not yet been fully implemented, with re-structuring of health authorities, the Department of Health and the NHS management executive still to come. "The reality for patients is that the NHS has reduced waiting times, increased the level of treatment and enabled significant improvements in the quality of care provided," Sir Duncan said.
