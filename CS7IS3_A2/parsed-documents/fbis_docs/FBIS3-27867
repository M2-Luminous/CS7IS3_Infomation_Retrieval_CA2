The officials said the request will be made by party leader Yohei Kono at his meeting with Hosokawa on Wednesday afternoon. The program, adopted at the party's special panel to combat the recession, partly reflects a proposal made by Michio Watanabe, a senior member of the party and former foreign minister, they said. His 20 trillion yen proposal incorporated income and local tax cuts totaling about 10 trillion yen, they said. But the LDP will only request an "early implementation of sharp tax cuts," they said. The officials said the LDP program also calls for a substantial reduction or a freeze of the land value tax.
