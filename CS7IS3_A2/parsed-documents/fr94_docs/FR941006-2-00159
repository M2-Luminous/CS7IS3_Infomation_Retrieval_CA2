FR941006-2-00159 FR941006-2-00113 Thursday October 6, 1994 Part II State Justice Institute Grant Guideline; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 193␣/␣Thursday, October 6, 1994␣/␣Notices STATE JUSTICE INSTITUTE Grant Guideline AGENCY: State Justice Institute. ACTION: Final grant guideline. SUMMARY: This Guideline sets forth the administrative, programmatic, and financial requirements attendant to Fiscal Year 1995 State Justice Institute grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David I. Tevelin, Executive Director, or Richard Van Duizend, Deputy Director, State Justice Institute, 1650 King St. (Suite 600), Alexandria, VA 22314, (703) 684&hyph;6100. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the State Justice Institute Act of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 10701, et seq ., as amended, the Institute is authorized to award grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to State and local courts, nonprofit organizations, and others for the purpose of improving the administration of justice in the State courts of the United States. Approximately $111/2 million is available for award in FY 1995. Changes in the Final Guideline On August 22, 1994, the Institute published its proposed FY 1995 Grant Guideline in the Federal Register for public comment. 59 FR 43160. Comment was specifically requested on whether SJI should continue to require each applicant for a judicial education scholarship to submit a concurrence signed by the chief justice of the applicant's State (see section II.B.2.b.v.). The only comment received on this issue was from a State court administrator who emphasized the administrative importance of the chief justice's concurrence. The concurrence requirement is, accordingly, retained in the Final Guideline. The Guideline also has been amended to better assure that sufficient scholarship funds are available each quarter. In addition, the Final Guideline solicits applications from courts and other organizations interested in participating as downlink (receiving) sites for the National Town Hall Meeting on Improving Public Confidence in the Courts scheduled for October 1995 (see section II.B.2.a.ii.). The Institute recently awarded a grant to the National Center for State Courts and the American Judicature Society to convene this videoconference. Interested jurisdictions must submit an application to the National Center for State Courts addressing the criteria set forth in section II.B.2.a.ii. no later than February 15, 1995. In FY 1994, the Institute required each grantee to submit its final product on a diskette in ASCII. The Final FY 1995 Guideline requires grantees to provide only a one-page abstract summarizing the grant product in ASCII. See section VII.C.6. In response to comments, the audit requirements in the Final Guideline have also been changed to make OMB Circular A&hyph;133 applicable to SJI grantees under the same terms and conditions (including applicability thresholds) that would apply to Federal grantees. In addition, several technical clarifications and corrections have been made in the Final Guideline.
