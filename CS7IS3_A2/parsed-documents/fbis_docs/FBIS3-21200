However, this technology is still in large part dependent on empirical factors, hence a scientific approach is difficult. This is because the plasma states and surface reactions are extremely complicated and there are not many means to analyze them. Even though our understanding is insufficient, plasma can be generated relatively easily and a very active state can be produced. However, various equipment using different methods has been introduced, adding to the confusion. Nevertheless, it seems the appropriate time to start discussions and studies for the ultrafine fabrication of 0.25 �m and below. This report reviews the items required for etching equipment for 256M DRAMs and beyond. High-Density Plasma Source Most active discussions about etching equipment are related to the plasma source. Previously, a low-pressure, high-density plasma source always referred to ECR plasma. Now, a variety of plasma sources, including helicon-wave and inductive-discharge (Figures 1 and 2) have been developed and introduced in the market. Helicon-wave plasma and inductive-discharge plasma use the RF frequency band at around 10 MHz and do not require a ferromagnetic field, so they can be implemented with compact size and simplified design. On the other hand, they have problems controlling the discharge state due to insufficient understanding of the mechanism of plasma generation. It has also been pointed out that their large-surface electric fields and plasma potentials sputter or etch the walls, influencing the etching characteristic of substrates. On the other hand, with ECR plasma, progress has been made in the analysis of the plasma state and elucidation of the discharge mechanism, and optimization of the plasma state is very advanced. However, the use of microwave and ferromagnetic fields makes the equipment large and complicated. Another problem is the production of abnormal etched shapes on the gate electrodes, as shown in Figure 3, which occurs when electric charge is accumulated on the wafer because the capture rates of electrons and ions with respect to the field are different, such as in the case of the presence of a ferromagnetic field on the wafer.[.sup]1[/] Therefore, with ECR plasma, reduction of the magnetic field on the wafer electrode and size reduction are important topics to be considered. Figure 1. Helicon-Wave Plasma Source (mfd. Plasma Figure 2. Inductive Discharge Plasma Source (mfd. by Figure 3. Abnormally Etched Shapes in Poly-Si As seen above, each plasma source has its merits and demerits. Nevertheless, when the equipment for manufacturing 256M and later DRAMs is considered, the trends of increasing the number of chambers and clustering are necessary, together with increasing wafer size. Further, a compact, simplified plasma source is necessary on actual mass-production lines. This means that size reduction is a necessary condition for ECR plasma sources to survive. This topic should be studied along with the decrease of applied frequency.[.sup]2[/] On the other hand, with helicon-wave plasmas and inductive-discharge plasmas, the optimization of plasma and optimization of hardware would be important issues in the future. As described above, a variety of plasma sources have been developed and currently low-pressure, high-density plasmas have become the leaders in the etching process. However, it is becoming clear that high-density plasma is not always beneficial, as some problems have emerged due to the high density. Not all the active species in plasma contribute to the etching reaction; some of them produce the main reaction and others inhibit it. For example, polymerization in the etching of oxide film is determined by the ratio between the CF[.sup]2[/] radicals and F atoms in fluorocarbon plasma. The CF[.sup]2[/] radicals are the precursor of polymerization and F atoms function to inhibit polymerization. Therefore, to achieve highly selective oxide-film etching, the F/CF[.sup]2[/] radical-density ratio in the plasma should be low. However, in low-pressure, high-density plasmas, such as ECR plasma, helicon-wave plasma and inductive-discharge plasma, high electron temperatures and the occurrence of highly dissociative reactions tend to make polymerization inadequate due to a low CF[.sup]2[/] radical density. This poses problems such as a low etching selectivity with respect to silicon wafers.[.sup]3[/] To solve these problems while maintaining the benefits of low-pressure, high-density plasma, it is important to control the electron temperature and dissociative reaction in plasma. Controlling the generation of active species by pulse-modulated plasma was recently proposed as a method to solve these problems.[.sup]4[/] In manufacturing 256M and later DRAMs, it is desirable that these problems be solved at the plasma source. Regardless, the mixed presence of a variety of plasma sources is not favorable for users, because this situation will require much effort in equipment selection and process development. A valuable future topic would be to identify the optimum plasma state for each type of material and develop a standardized plasma source that can achieve that state. Role of the Chamber Wall Although chamber wall material and chamber size are very important factors relating to plasma, they have not been studied sufficiently. Wall material and wall potential states (grounding, floating) have a great effect on the plasma's potential distribution and charged particle decay times. As they vary, the electron loss probability on the wall surface, the electron temperature in plasma, plasma potential, and floating potential are also varied so the ion impact state onto the wall is also varied. In addition, as the reactivities of active species (radicals, ions) are variable depending on the wall materials, as shown in Figure 4, their loss and adsorption probabilities are also varied which varies the percentage of active species existing in the plasma.[.sup]5[/] This is why it is said that the reproducibility of plasma processes is largely affected by the wall. Therefore, the selection of wall material and its electric state are also important themes for equipment implementation. Figure 4. Variation of Radical Density Depending on Wall Chamber size is also important. Chamber size increases when the size of the wafer is increased, and the increase in chamber size means a relative increase in the volume of plasma with respect to the wall, providing the benefits of reduced electron loss and lower plasma potential and electron temperature. Therefore, the optimization of chamber size is also an important topic to be considered. Exhaust System The exhaust system is noteworthy from the viewpoint of controlling the residence time of reaction products as well as controlling the degree of etching vacuum. Since the gas flow varies the residence time of reaction products and thereby the etching characteristic as shown in Figure 5.[.sup]6[/] Exhaust system design is an important element in the design of etching equipment. Equipment design must take conductance into full consideration, as well as the exhaust rate of the turbo-molecular pump. Figure 5. Variation of Etching Characteristic Depending on Multi-Chamber Equipment Microfabrication and the multi-layer structure of devices are making the etching process increasingly complicated. As a result, it has sometimes become necessary to apply pre- and post-processing to etching, use processes for etching layered film with several gas systems, or process several large-size wafers simultaneously. An increase in the number of chambers is indispensable to achieve these. In addition, as continuous processing in vacuum is essential to process reproducibility, the implementation of equipment as standardized cluster tools is also necessary. This is an important subject which could lead to the standardization of etching equipment. Conclusion In the above I reviewed the points concerning etching equipment expected for use for 256M DRAMs and later. The extremely stringent accuracy requirements for etching have made it necessary to conduct an advanced study of the equipment. This requires an approach to the plasma process aimed at achieving optimum cost efficiency and expected characteristics. Equipment standardization has also become an important topic. These requirements are extremely severe for equipment manufacturers, and I hope our research will contribute to their efforts. References 1.
