Five zones are established in the Gulf of Mexico EEZ and Florida's waters off Citrus and Hernando Counties for the separation of shrimp trawling and stone crab trapping. The zones are as shown in Appendix A of this part, Figure 3. Although Zone II is entirely within Florida's waters, it is included in this paragraph and Appendix A of this part, Figure 3, for the convenience of fishermen. Restrictions that apply to Zone II and those parts of the other zones that are in Florida's waters are contained in Rule 46&hyph;38.001, Florida Administrative Code.
