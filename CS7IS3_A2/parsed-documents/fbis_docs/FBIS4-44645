Flight tests for the Mica and Apache will be stepped up in 1994. The Rafale's impressive array of weapons--gun, rocketry, bombs, and missiles of all sorts--will make it one of the most formidable fighter aircraft of its generation for all air-to-air and air-to-surface missions (see AIR & COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No. 1360 and 1408). The Rafale will be able to neutralize a 1,000-square-meter area using submunitions dropped by Matra's Belouga missile, or destroy an airfield landing strip by studding it with 40-square-meter craters using Thomson Brandt Armements' (TBA) BAP 100 antirunway bombs. It will also be able to use the Exocet AM-39 to attack a ship 50 to 70 km away. Aerospatiale's Exocet will be able to scuttle small ships and put regular or escort destroyers out of commission (as was done in the Falklands). Moreover, Rafale will have two, very effective laser-guided weapons, fireable using Thomson-CSF's Atlis target-designation optronics pod, for the attack of local, hardened ground targets (concrete shelters, bridges...) and even ships. One is the AS30L, which proved itself in the Gulf. Aerospatiale's big, air-to-surface missile can be fired from a distance of 12 km, carrying 240 kg that will impact at the speed of 450 m/s. The other is Matra's BGL bomb, which can be dropped from over 7 km away while flying 1,000 km/h. BGL bombs--with laser-guided "kits"--come in three versions: 250 kg, 450 kg, 1,000 kg. Rafale will also be equipped with the air-to-surface standoff Apache that Matra is developing with Aerospatiale. The Apache is a cruise, "stealth" missile for both day and night attack of various targets (airfield runways, command centers, tank clusters, and so on) from a distance of 150 km. It weighs 1.2 metric tons and carries 750 kg of various submunitions (antirunway, antitank, mine, etc.), including the Kriss antirunway rocket being developed by TBA. Apache flight tests began last 4 November when an inert mockup was fired from a CEV Mirage 2000-N. They continued with tests of piloted missiles, then trials of missiles propelled by the Microturbo turbojet, whose final flight tests will take place next July. According to Jean-Paul Genest, technical director of Matra Defense, "the first launches of complete missiles are scheduled for late 1994 or early 1995." The propelled and guided Apache will fly in ground followance mode using altimetric and topographic resetting, then will be correlation guided to its terminus using Thomson-CSF's Prometheus radar homing head. Prometheus will be tested in advance on an airborne flight aboard a Mirage 2000. The Landes Test Center (CEL) is simultaneously testing the Kriss submunition. A 900-m-long, 40-m-wide concrete runway has also been built in Biscarosse, and will serve as a target during Apache test overflights beginning in late 1994 and Kriss jettisoning tests in 1995. The program's "main event" will be a complete Apache flight that will end with the dropping of 10 submunitions, including one or two Kriss(s) (with real explosive charges), on the runway. It is scheduled for 1996. At the same time engineers will be working to adapt the missile to the Rafale (two Apaches under the wings) and Mirage 2000-D (one under the fuselage), and to the Luftwaffe's Tornado (two Apaches under the fuselage) in accordance with the 1992 contract signed with the MAW (Matra-DASA) consortium. The Apache's first flight under the Tornado is scheduled for mid-1996, and its start-of-service date for 1997-98. But France would like to persuade Germany to move that up to 1996, so that industrial production of the Apache coincides with its scheduled introduction on the Mirage 2000-5. Rafale will have two types of Matra missiles for air-to-air missions. The infrared-guided Magic 2 can engage all sectors, even frontally, without precise sighting during short-range (up to 30 km) aerial combat. More important, the first multitarget and dual-mode (infrared and electromagnetic) air-to-air Mica missile will be able to perform all aerial defense missions up to 80 km. The Mica will be the primary competitor of the Russian R-77 and American AMRAAM missiles (see AIR & COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No 1451) Magic 2 and Mica Rafale will be the 17th aircraft to carry Magic 2, which has been in production for the last several years to equip numerous foreign and French airplanes including the Mirage 2000. The 90-kg missile will be mounted on the wingtips of both French Rafale versions (Navy and Air Force). Jean-Paul Genest says the first Magic 2 launches with real missiles will take place in 1995. In contrast, the Dassault airplane will be able to carry up to eight 100-kg Micas on its wingtips and under the fuselage and wings. The Navy will start with only the electromagnetic version (with a Dassault Electronique AD4A radar homing head) mounted under the wings or fuselage, and Magic 2s on the wingtips. Work to adapt the Mica for mounting on Rafale's wingtips will begin in 1995. But Mica reached an important milestone last July when it successfully completed its first multitarget launch demonstration. A Mica with a radar homing head was fired from a Mirage 2000 against a patrol of two subsonic C22L target-missiles at CEL. Another multitarget engagement is slated for this year, says Genest. Two electromagnetic Micas will engage two Aerospatiale target-missiles in a more complex scenario involving electronic countermeasures. Genest also announced multitarget launches for infrared Micas, scheduled in 1995-96. The infrared Micas will feature Matra-SAT's infrared imaging homing head, whose final version (type B) has just been delivered after prior airborne flight tests. According to Genest, "Matra will be ready to fire the first infrared-guided Mica in late 1994." Technically, says the company, there is an 18-month to two-year lapse between the two Mica versions (radar and infrared), and Mica's development program has been rescheduled for completion at the same time as the Rafale. Consequently, most Mica flight tests will take place in 1994-95, with a few additional adaptation or assessment launches in 1996-97. Mica's industrialization is being prepared at the same time, at the Celles Saint-Denis factory (Sologne) where Matra will install the Mica production line in mid-1994. Mass production of 50 electromagnetic missiles a month will begin in late 1995, with production of the infrared Mica kicking off 18 to 24 months later, around the middle or end of 1997. Genest says that should mean that an EM Mica will go into service by the end of 1996 or early 1997, first aboard French or export Mirage 2000s, notably Taiwan's. Taiwan was the first foreign Mica customer, and has ordered 960 of the missiles for its 60 Mirage 2000-5s. Moreover, the Mica is competing against the AMRAAM in Sweden to arm the JAS-39/Gripen (see AIR & COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No. 1458). And Matra will complete research on how to adapt the Mica to "European" F-16s (Dutch, Belgian, Norwegian, and Danish) in 1994.
