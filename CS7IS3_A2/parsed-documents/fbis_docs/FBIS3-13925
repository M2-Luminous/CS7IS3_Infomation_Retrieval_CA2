The Commission is to present its findings to the PLO Executive Committee as soon as possible." The message was signed by "Yasir 'Arafat, President of the State of Palestine." Attorney Hashim Salman al-Qawasimi was appointed chairman of the commission of inquiry. He was named along with five lawyers, three physicians, two clergymen, and two public figures; all Hebron residents who represent the large families in the city. "I was surprised by the appointment," al-Qawasimi said last week. "No one called me from Tunis, and no one in the territories has spoken to me about setting up the committee." Al-Qawasimi, 50, had worked for 17 years for the Civil Administration judicial system in the West Bank. In his last duty he was president of the Ramallah District Court. He has engaged in private practice since 1985 and is not politically affiliated with any camp. "Being a judicial investigator, I take orders from no one, nor am I subject to any element," he said. "This is a professional, not a political committee, and its job is finding the truth." Last Friday, a day after they received the letter of appointment, the members of the committee convened and established working procedures. The five lawyers were tasked with collecting evidence and eye-witness testimonies. The three physicians were to collect medical evidence. The remaining three committee members were to collect evidence linked with the cave itself. The committee wishes to end its work in two weeks, at the most. To this end, they are assisted by Hebron attorneys who collect testimonies of eye witnesses and the wounded. The Hebron committee has managed to obtain testimonies from several Israelis. "We received written testimonies which were legally obtained. I will not say whether they were from civilians or servicemen," al-Qawasimi said. Last weekend, al-Qawasimi drafted a letter addressed to the military governor of Hebron, asking for permission to question Army soldiers and officers. He is about to send a copy of the letter to the defense minister. "We have to question anyone who witnessed the massacre, including Israelis. If we are allowed to question Israelis, it would be a precedent and will serve as basis for future cooperation," al-Qawasimi said. [Shaqed] Why not cooperate with the Israeli commission of inquiry? [Al-Qawasimi] Our committee has no authority to judge those responsible; we cannot judge those who govern us. Thus, cooperation with the Israeli commission will never be on an equal basis. Also, if we ask for their cooperation, they would not agree." [end al-Qawasimi] Fayiz Qapishah, a committee member considered a representative of the families of the wounded, does not rule out cooperation with the Israeli commission. "I am willing to testify before the Israeli committee, provided that my remarks are publicized. In the end, we want to find the truth." Last week, the members of the committee did not listen to Qol Yisra'el in Arabic which carried live the Shamgar commission deliberations with simultaneous translation. Only after the Israeli committee members toured Hebron last Wednesday did those siding with cooperating with it win the upper hand. One of the offers raised was to officially ask Israel to cooperate with the commission. This way the Hebron committee hopes to obtain material which is in the hands of Israel, such as the videotapes of the cave cameras. Other voices were heard as well, however. "The Israeli committee represents the side that committed the murders. It was established to whitewash the Israeli administration," said 'Ali al-Qawasimi, who is considered the Hebron Fatah leader. "Whether we trust the Shamgar committee will be determined in lieu of its conclusions." One of the central questions the Hebron committee wishes to determine is whether Barukh Goldstein operated alone or was aided by others. Many eyewitnesses told the committee that IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers also shot at the worshipers. One of them said that one of the soldiers was standing next to Goldstein and handed him magazines. As a rule, the residents of Hebron find it hard to believe that Goldstein managed to kill and injure so many worshipers with only 111 bullets. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid al-Ashhab, the head of the committee's medical team, said: "Most of the people were shot in the back, but some were shot in the side of their body, which indicates that some of the fire came from a different direction. In the X-Ray pictures we identified metal of other objects that do not look like slugs. Perhaps it was shrapnel. This may indicate that the murderer also threw hand grenades." Another member of the committee, former Hebron Mayor Mustafa 'Abd-al-Nabi al-Natshah, tried to sound more careful: "Our evidence indicate that the murderer threw two hand grenades. I would say there is a 90-percent probability that he used hand grenades. Also, we cannot yet clearly determine that he acted alone. This will only become apparent at the end of the investigation." Another issue the committee wants to determine is the precise number of casualties of the massacre and the shooting outside the Cave of the Patriarchs. Until this day, two weeks after the massacre, there no final figure. The IDF determined that 29 were killed and some 50 were wounded in the incident. The residents of Hebron say that 32 were killed and some 200 were wounded in the massacre. "We collect all the evidence. We receive evidence from the hospitals, such as death certificates, if there are any. We obtained documents from the mukhtar, and visited the homes of the dead," Attorney 'Abd-al-Ghani al-'Awawi said. "The same procedure applies to the wounded." The East Jerusalem Waqf handed over to the committee a file of its correspondence with the Defense Ministry containing hundreds of complaints about abuse of Muslim worshipers by Jewish settlers in the Cave of the Patriarchs. Attorney al-'Awawi said that the committee will examine testimonies and the security arrangements and procedures in the cave. "We question the guards and the other workers, and anyone who was in touch with the Israeli authorities on issue pertaining to the cave." There is almost not a single committee members whose clan or close family does not have a casualty of the Hebron massacre. The daily reality of Hebron adds tension to the already tense inquiry. The committee members move between hospitals, mourning families, houses of the wounded and eye witnesses. Being under curfew, movement around Hebron includes undergoing checks at IDF roadblocks or the chance of encountering a violent clash. Since the murder, support for the PLO reached an unprecedented low in Hebron. The street is not too anxious to cooperate with a committee associated with Fatah. In the middle of last week, the committee attempted to shake off any marker that would associate it with Fatah or any other organization. Until last Tuesday, the committee sat in the Academics Association building. On Wednesday, it moved to offices hired for its purposes. Attorney Husayn al-Shayukhi, one of 'Arafat's associates in Hebron, was not pleased with the establishment of the committee: "'Arafat's advisers misled him by advising to establish a Hebron commission of inquiry. The Cave of the Patriarchs is sacred to all Arabs and Muslims, not only the Hebron residents. Therefore, there was a need to establish an international committee; or at least an Arab or Muslim committee. If this was impossible, a committee that includes members from throughout the territories should have been set up. It should have included representatives of all movements, including the Islamic. And, in general, a committee should not have been established at all because it lacks authority." Last week, before the PLO committee was set up, another Palestinian committee began investigating the incident. It was appointed by the Supreme Muslim Council in Jerusalem. It is headed by the Hebron religious court judge Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Muktasib. It includes notables identified with the PLO opposition, such as Shaykh Taysir Bayyud al-Tamimi, and Dr. 'Aziz Duwayk, both of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], and 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Natshah, who is considered affiliated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. This committee is conducting an investigation of its own. Being part of the religious establishment, its members approached the Civil Administration, through the East Jerusalem Waqf, asking for permission to enter the Cave of the Patriarchs. The have been rejected so far. Shaykh al-Tamimi, who is normally in charge of the cave, fears that Israel is using the massacre to change the complex. "We have testimonies that Israel has brought building materials into the cave. We will not agree to any changes in the complex, certainly not to erecting walls inside the cave." Another committee set up in Hebron is made of family members of the murdered. European and Arab organizations and institutions have announced their willingness to financially support the victims' families. Israel also announced it will compensate them. The families are afraid that the some of the money will be lost on its way to Hebron. They decided that any contribution made will be presented only through the families' committee, or through the Hebron charity foundation, controlled by Hamas. The family members are not interested in any of the commissions of inquiry. "We paid the price," they say, "and the committees will not bring our loved ones back." The Hebron youths also showed no interest in the work of the committees. "Revenge -- this is the conclusion of our commission of inquiry. Nothing but revenge."
