No instrument of equivalent scientific value to the foreign instruments, for the purposes for which the instruments are intended to be used, is being manufactured in the United States. Reasons: These are compatible accessories for instruments previously imported for the use of the applicants. In each case, the instrument and accessory were made by the same manufacturer. The National Institutes of Health advises that the accessories are pertinent to the intended uses and that it knows of no comparable domestic accessories. We know of no domestic accessories which can be readily adapted to the previously imported instruments. Pamela Woods, Acting Director, Statutory Import Programs Staff.
