For six months he failed to appear at Kuntsevskiy Rayon Court in the city of Moscow, where legal action to defend the honor and dignity of the State Duma deputy and leader of the Russian All-National Union is in progress against O. Kalugin and the newspaper IZVESTIYA. On Tuesday 15 February the defendant appeared before the court. During the hearing he basically confirmed that his action was prompted by political motives: He had to discredit Baburin. Addressing the court, Sergey Baburin reminded those present that "Kalugin's slanderous statements were reproduced by dozens and dozens of mass media sources, to be relished and publicly commented on by his political opponents." But he has not yet received any apology for the offending article.
