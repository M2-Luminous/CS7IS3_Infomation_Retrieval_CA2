"No such transformation of shares will be permitted until a relevant policy is worked out," said a spokesman of the China Securities Regulatory Committee (CSRC) at a press conference here today. Stocks issued by Chinese firms fall into two categories: A shares for domestic investors and B shares for overseas investors. The two kinds of shares are traded at different markets and follow different trading rules. The CSRC spokesman said that the board of "Dazhong" Taxi Company obviously has little knowledge about state securities policies. He said that opening "A" shares to foreigners means both the sell-out of state property rights and the merger of the two kinds of shares, which is something "under serious consideration of the authorities," and if so, requires amendment of the current laws and regulations on stock market monitoring. "A grassroots company has no right to make the decision without state permission," the spokesman said. He said that a tentative distribution plan for the 5.5 billion yuan worth of nationwide stocks to be issued for 1994 has been made. Timing of the issuance will be flexible and will depend upon the conditions of enterprises as well as the capacity of the stock market to absorb the new stocks, he said. According to the spokesman, it is very likely that part of the stock issuance will be postponed until next year.
