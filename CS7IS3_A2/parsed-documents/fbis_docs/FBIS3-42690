THE ARSON The rapid development of the Ossetian-Ingush armed conflict resembled a tightly wound spring suddenly coming loose. Without the understanding who had wound this spring, and how, it is impossible to discern the pattern of interests behind this chain of events. Therefore, we have to apologize to the reader for a detour in the narrative and bring him back to the testimony and documents that will allow him on his own to find cause-and-effect connections between seemingly random events and the historic underpinnings under the continuing "cold war" between the two republics; we will begin with the testimony of Oktyabrskoye village resident Bashir Buzurtanov. There are hundreds of such, or similar, tales. My, Bashir Buzurtanov's, family had lived in Sholkhi for generations. My grandfather and father are buried in Sholkhi (now Oktyabrskoye). When my father returned from exile, he was not permitted to settle in his native village. He had a dream of buying out his house, but the new owners refused. He died still carrying this heartache. In July 1990, in carrying out his will, I bought a house in Sholkhi; all of my father's savings went into this. And on 2 August, burning torches were thrown into my yard. These are sticks with a kerosene-soaked rag wrapped around one end. At the time, the house was still occupied by the Ossetian Dzanagov, who sold me the house; he was the one who extinguished the fire. The gloomy Dzanagovs begged me to take my money back; otherwise, Ossetian informals had promised to kill them for selling the house to an Ingush. The informals told them that there was some decree to this effect. I refused to take the money. On the same night, at 0200, the house was doused with kerosene and a torch was thrown in. My wife and I, together with the elderly Dzanagovs, put out the fire. Other neighbors wanted to help, but they were afraid of the bosses and the informals. Rural Soviet Chairman Totrov came, upbraided the Dzanagovs, and then talked to me. He advised me immediately to leave the territory of the NO ASSR [North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]. I went to Petr Dzhusoyev, the first secretary of the CPSU raykom [rayon committee]. He said that Ingush do not have the right to complain against Ossetians. He demanded that I leave the house that I had bought and settle in Nazran. The Dzanagovs and the Buzurtanovs probably could get along after all, but the informals were correct: There had been a decree. And not even one--three. The first one during Khrushchev's thaw, when in order to correct "excesses of the personality cult," the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored. Anticipating a mass return of Ingush to their homeland, the NO ASSR Council of Ministers by a secret circular (No. 063) as early as in 1956 prohibited organizations and private individuals to sell houses or rent apartment space to Ingush. Nevertheless, Ingush still brought houses, got residence permits, and settled in. Naturally, not without some greasing of palms. The NO ASSR leadership, fearing that despite everything the Ingush would strike root in their former homeland, decided to close all the loopholes. It had always had access to the all-Union government, and in 1982 the USSR Council of Ministers issued a decree (No. 183) "On Limiting Issuance of Residence Permits in Prigorodnyy Rayon of the North Ossetian ASSR." This unclassified decree did not mention "persons of Ingush origin," but everybody knew to whom the limitation on issuance of residence permits applied. Nevertheless, Ingush continued to buy houses, build new ones, and pay bribes for this, albeit in greater amounts than before. Perestroyka and the democratic trends that developed in connection with it brought new distress to republic leaders, who were aware that, having set root, the Ingush would want to legalize their status--among other things so that they would not have to pay horrendous tributes. In 1989 the Congress of USSR People's Deputies adopted a declaration "On Recognizing as Illegal and Criminal All Acts Against People Who Have Been Subjected to Forced Resettlement." A return of Prigorodnyy Rayon was not a too distant future. The declaration elicited a sharply negative reaction among both informals and the NO ASSR leadership. Former enemies joined ranks. University professor Galazov, who took an anti-Ingush position, became a secretary of the CPSU raykom, and then the republic leader. Under him the propaganda apparatus kicked in at full power and eventually implanted in society's consciousness a deeply negative attitude toward the Ingush as a people. He was unexpectedly helped by the disintegration of the communist ideology, with its decorative taboo on ethnic intolerance. This made the former leader of the Communist Party free to later speak of the Ingush people as a snake that had snuggled into the bosom of the Ossetian people. On 14 September 1990, the NO ASSR Supreme Soviet adopted a third decree banning--this time on the territory of the entire republic--buying and selling of residential housing and other structures into private ownership. The protest of the procurator general of Russia was ignored. But in Moscow, RSFSR Supreme Soviet commissions already were at work, which found the Ingush population's demand to return Prigorodnyy Rayon in its pre-1944 borders to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR to be well founded. Then it so happened that a fight over a vegetable garden broke out between Ossetians and Ingush in Kurtat village. On 19 April 1991 a state of emergency was imposed not only in this village, but in the entire Prigorodnyy Rayon, as well as in Vladikavkaz. A week later, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet, under B.N. Yeltsin's leadership, almost unanimously did pass the law "On Rehabilitation of the Peoples Subjected to Repression," with Articles 3 and 6 envisaging the return of the old status to the territories. As Ossetians had feared, the impatient Ingush leaders immediately began to demand that the law be implemented and that the state of emergency be lifted. The Moscow authorities remained silent, as if they had forgotten about the just-adopted law. The North Ossetian press filled up with articles justifying the deportation of Vaynakhs by Stalin. Zaur Dzarakhokhov, the chief of the North Ossetian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] press center, mockingly suggested that the Ingush should announce a collection of money and erect in Nazran a monument to the father of all peoples, Stalin, for sending Ingush far away from the front lines and thus giving them the "opportunity to preserve the genetic stock of the nation." It is of course the simplest explanation--that the anti-Ingush attitude of the Ossetian society is merely the result of massive government propaganda. While not diminishing at all the influence of the propaganda apparatus and the force of its impact, it should be noted that the inhabitants of North Ossetia, despite the 70-year-long uninterrupted tradition of trusting Soviet power, in the end would be able to separate obvious lies from the truth. On two conditions: that they would have an independent source of information and that there would not exist objective reasons for them to fear the Ingush. One would assume that among such unconscious feelings, locked in the back of their mind, is an old guilt complex. The barbarity of Stalin and Beria was not only in mobilizing 3,000 Ossetians--among many members of other ethnic groups in the Caucasus--to participate in driving out the neighboring people, but also in encouraging them, and sometimes even forcing them, to take over other peoples' homes, with beds still warm, food still on the stove, and unmilked cows in the barn. No matter how politicians and journalists may have exerted themselves later in trying to justify the deed, it is impossible to fool a healthy sense of morality among the people. The only thing that may lighten the burden is a reciprocal and greater fault of the neighbors. But these are emotional-psychological reasons for fear. There are other, more conscious ones. The fertile lands of Prigorodnyy Rayon always fed Vladikavkaz and will continue feeding it, no matter who lives there--Ingush, Ossetians, or Russians. Such are the laws of economic geography. The density of population there, however, according to the republic statistics, is already high--127 persons per square kilometer--and will steadily increase through the natural growth of Ingush population (15.6 per 1,000 of population, as compared to 6.4 among Ossetians). They even came up with a term for it--aggressive birth rate--which has replaced military aggression. Youth under the working age comprised 37.3 percent of the Ingush population (among Ossetians, 26.7 percent, respectively). Demographers say that no matter what, after a certain number of years, Ossetians will end up an ethnic minority in this region, and then the Ingush farm market in Vladikavkaz will become a political factor. More than a year later, on 4 June 1992, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet made the following step--it adopted the law "On Forming the Ingush Republic as a Component of the Russian Federation." What remained was to determine the republic borders and elect a parliament. V. Tishkov, the former chairman of the State Committee on Nationalities, was inclined to hold elections to the Ingush Republic parliament among other places on the territory of Prigorodnyy Rayon in North Ossetia, in the places of compact habitation of Ingush. The Ossetian representative flatly refused even to discuss this proposal. On 26 October 1992, after a number of meetings of the presidium of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, where the Ossetian-Ingush--no, not a conflict yet--question was discussed, a proposal was made for a joint commission with the participation of Ossetian and Ingush representatives to draft a decision. For the Ossetian side to sit down at the negotiation table would mean to recognize the existence of the problem. To refuse to further participate in the discussion meant an open conflict with the government, the Supreme Soviet, and the president, who had signed the laws under dispute. For the Vladikavkaz leadership a diplomatic failure was fraught not only with the danger of losing their political face. A scandal replete with accusations of corruption was brewing in the republic parliament. A certain top official sent a daughter abroad; another was being linked to sales of valuable metals abroad and the vanished hard currency proceeds. A good shake-up could turn public opinion around. It is quite possible that by that time the Ossetian leadership had made a decision to get a decisive hold of Prigorodnyy Rayon at any cost. Now it was possible to achieve only by squeezing Ingush out of its boundaries and setting a strict military border between the two republics. In this coagulated atmosphere of fear and mistrust toward one another, any torch thrown over a fence, any new street killing, held the danger of an explosion. Which is precisely what happened. FROM THE IZVESTIYA FILE. What Kind of Legacy Do We Refuse To Reject? Top secret. To the people's commissar for national security, Comrade L.P. Beria I hereby report that loading of Chechens and Ingush due for resettlement began by 0500 on 23 February 1944. Altogether, accepted for convoy and dispatched were 180 trains, 65 railcars in each, carrying a total of 493,269 resettlers. On average 2,740 persons per train. Travel time by train is between nine and 23 days--16 days on average. While on route, 56 persons were born, 285 delivered to medical facilities for treatment, and 1,272 died.... [Signed] Chief of the convoy troops of the USSR NKVD [People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs], Major General (Bochkov) State Defense Committee To Comrade I.V. Stalin 26 February 1944 In connection with the resettlement of Chechens and Ingush..., to transfer to: ....North Ossetian ASSR--Achalukskiy, Nazranovskiy, and Psedakhskiy Rayons within their existing borders, as well as Prigorodnyy Rayon, with the exception of its southern high-altitude part, and a part of Sunzhenskiy Rayon. ....The initial plan was to transfer two rayons--Psedakhskiy and Malgobekskiy--to the Kabardino-Balkar ASSR. However, it was found expedient to transfer Psedakhskiy Rayon to North Ossetia, especially considering that after the planned resettlement of Balkars, who occupy the territory of about 500,000 hectares, Kabardins will get the vacated lands. [Signed] L. Beria Later on, as it follows from the Supreme Soviet presidium's decree "On Liquidating the Chechen-Ingush ASSR...." dated 7 March 1944, it was found expedient also to transfer both Psedakhskiy and Malgobekskiy Rayons to North Ossetia, and on top of that, to grant the request of the Soviet of People's Commissars and the VKP(b) [All-Union Communist (Bolshevik) party] oblast committee of this republic to transfer to it the city of Mozdok in Stavropol Kray, together with adjacent population centers, as well as Kurpskiy Rayon of Kabardino-Balkaria. "Thanks to continuous support of the bolshevik party and Comrade Stalin personally....the territory of our republic has increased by up to 50 percent," said the North Ossetian BKP(b) obkom's secretary, I.D. Kulov, in one of his reports. From the decree of the presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet (not to be published in the press) dated 16 July 1956 "Taking into account the fact that there is no further need to continue existing restrictions in the legal status of Chechens, Ingush, and Karachay and their family members currently residing in restricted settlement areas, the presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet resolves: 1. To remove from restricted settlement records and free from under administrative oversight. 2. To stipulate that removal of restricted settlement provisions regarding the persons enumerated in Article 1 of this decree does not entail returning to them the property confiscated during the eviction, and that they do not have a right to return to locales from which they had been evicted." Special file. Top secret. From the memorandum of the Committee for State Security under the USSR Council of Ministers to the CPSU Central Committee, 1 April 1957 (No. 682-E). In violation of the USSR Supreme Soviet presidium's decree dated 16 July 1956, individuals of Ingush origin formerly subject to restricted settlement provisions in unorganized manner and en masse have returned to old areas of habitation.... In reporting the above, the Committee for State Security believes it expedient to instruct the RSFSR Council of Ministers to take urgent steps with respect to factors causing an unhealthy situation in North Ossetian ASSR. [Signed] I. Serov, chairman of the Committee for State Security under the USSR Council of Ministers. Undoubtedly, the KGB chief, concerned over exacerbation of the political situation in North Ossetia, could not fail to be aware of the fact that the ban on Chechens and Ingush returning to their homeland had been lifted three months prior to that. On one and the same day (9 January 1957) and under an almost identical heading ("On the Restoration of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR...."), one expanding the other, two decrees--an all-Union and a Russian one--were issued that were in sharp conflict to each other. The first repeals as no longer in effect the decree "On Liquidating the Chechen-Ingush ASSR....", and hence restores the republic's borders as of February 1944. The second--the Russian--decree, in the list of rayons being returned to Chechen-Ingush Republic, does not mention Prigorodnyy Rayon, which makes the republic's restoration within the old borders impossible and return of the Ingush to their homeland quite questionable. Issa Magomedovich Kostoyev, an experienced legal scholar, has shoveled through piles of paper in archives trying to find at least some serious--even by the standards of those times--legislative act formalizing Prigorodnyy Rayon as part of North Ossetia. He could not find anything! Moreover, until 1978, in the Chechen-Ingush Republic Constitution Prigorodnyy Rayon was listed as its component, and only after 1978 did North Ossetia include it in its Constitution. If we approach this matter from a strictly legal standpoint and take as the basis the only competent document in this entire chain of decrees--the decree "On the Restoration of Chechen-Ingush Republic," which repealed the repressive acts, Prigorodnyy Rayon all these years has been and remains a part of Ingushetia. Unless, of course, following the example of North Ossetia, we take as the sole basis the Stalin-Beria decree on the deportation of the population and the liquidation of the republic. "The USSR Supreme Soviet declaration 'On Recognizing as Illegitimate and Criminal Repressive Acts Against Peoples Subjected to Forced Resettlement and Ensuring Their Rights,'" adopted with applause by the Congress of USSR People's Deputies on 14 November 1989, and the law "On Rehabilitation of the Peoples Subjected to Repression," dated 26 April 1991 and signed by the Chairman of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet B.N. Yeltsin, do not leave any doubt in this respect. They once and again unconditionally affirm that "all acts of all-Union, republic, and local organs with respect to peoples subjected to repressions, with the exception of the acts restoring their rights, shall be considered null and void." Nevertheless, the fate of the new law "On Rehabilitation...." was dramatic; its first opponent was the CPSU leadership. From the open letter of Idris Bazorkin, people's writer of Chechen-Ingushetia, a delegate of the First Congress of USSR writers, to the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee M.S. Gorbachev (June 1991): I joined the party as a candidate in 1942, when the Germans were bombing the Groznyy oil fields. I was a military correspondent and believed in the power of the party. I received my party membership card on 24 February 1944. The last party membership card in the no-longer existing Chechen-Ingush Republic. On that day, my people had already been en route for a day, evicted from their own home, some of them executed on the spot. Finally, on 26 April 1991, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet passed a law "On Rehabilitation of the Peoples Subjected to Repressions." This edict, aimed at blocking the RSFSR Law "On Rehabilitation of the Peoples Subjected to Repressions" and aimed at provoking interethnic conflicts, was the last straw. I return to you my party membership card, since I consider it impossible for an honest man to be a member of the party of enemies of the people. Idris Bazorkin, the most significant Ingush writer, lived to see the August of 1991; he lived through a revival of hope and another crash of it: The law "On Forming the Ingush Republic as a Component Part of the Russian Federation," signed by the Russian Federation president on 4 June 1992, proclaimed the new state entity on paper: without territory, without borders, without a capital, without administrative and economic structures and ties. It does mention "the interests of the Cossacks and the possibility of expanding their self-rule" and establishes a transition period until March 1994. The writer did not live that long. On the second day of the Chechen-Ingush conflict, the 82-year-old novelist was taken from his Vladikavkaz apartment; his entire family also found itself held hostage. Later, under public pressure, Bazorkin was let go to live in Nazran. The loss of his home and archives (the apartment is occupied, the fate of the archives is unknown), and most importantly, the tragedy of his people, undermined the writer's health--Idris Bazorkin died in the spring of 1993.
