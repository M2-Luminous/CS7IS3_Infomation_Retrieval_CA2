More specifically, the environmentalists are worried about the situation at the chemical plant Mayak in the Chelyabinsk Region of the Urals. According to the Social-Ecology Union, Mayak produces daily up to 100 Mn [million] curie [Ci] of radioactive waste and dumps more than 1 Mn Ci into the lakes Karachai and Staroye Boloto. The two lakes are responsible for the contamination of the region's underground waters. Mayak operates in a zone of high seismic activity where earthquakes of up to 7 points on the Richter scale can take place, at the same time a number of man-made lakes with a total of some 400 cu m [cubic meters] of liquid radioactive waste in them have been dug out in the main flow of the Tech River. The large amount of radioctive waste in the Chelyabinsk Region explains why there are 60 percent more cases of children's leukemia in Chelyabinsk-65 and Chelyabinsk-70, where Mayak operates, than in other industrial centers. The Social-Ecology Union feels the region must be declared an ecological disaster zone.
