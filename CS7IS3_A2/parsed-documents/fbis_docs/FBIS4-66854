Regarding their commitment to disarmament and to nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the participants of the fourth Rio Group-EU ministerial meeting expressed their complete agreement in condemning every form of nuclear testing. The Sao Paulo Declaration, which was approved by 13 foreign ministers of the Rio Group and representatives of the EU member countries, states: ``The ministers (of the Rio Group and the EU) agree on proposing the signing of a multilateral treaty that would impose a total ban on nuclear tests and would be fully verifiable.'' In the Sao Paulo Declaration, the Rio Group and the EU also expressed their total condemnation of terrorism. The declaration states: ``The ministers...condemn without reservations -- as an unjustifiable crime -- every act of terrorism, irrespective of who perpetrates them, where, or why, because acts of terrorism endanger and claim the lives of human beings. They also undermine human dignity and are a threat to democracy and to a state of law.'' The ministerial meeting between the Rio Group and the EU is the fourth since bilateral talks were institutionalized by the Rome Declaration (1990). The meeting, which is being held at the Latin American Parliament (Parlatino) building in the city of Sao Paulo, is scheduled to close on 23 April but the final declaration was released today. In addition to condemning nuclear tests, the Rio Group-EU ministers praised the ``recent progress made in consolidating the regime for a total ban on nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean as established in the Tlatelolco Treaty.'' The declaration also expressed support for the Convention Banning the Development, Production, Storage, and Use of Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction, and revealed their resolve to adopt specific measures to fully implement the Convention on Biological Weapons. The Rio Group and the EU also voiced their desire to cooperate to give openness to international arms trade. The latter point was specifically requested by Andean countries like Colombia, which has been affected by arms trafficking financed by narcotrafficking and terrorist organizations. The two blocs' representatives agreed to promote a UN Registry of Conventional Weapons with a view to effectively controlling arms possession around the world. In the Sao Paulo Declaration, which consists of 19 points focusing on economic and political issues, the Rio Group and the EU reaffirm their respect for democracy and the principles of free trade. The Rio Group and the EU also have agreed to define a new model of bilateral relations in which the Latin American countries would have greater participation in various international issues such as world security and the reform of the UN Charter. The Latin American countries also expressed their concern about the social, environmental, and labor conditions some European nations are starting to impose on their trade with developing countries. The continuation and expansion of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which expires this year and regulates trade between the EU and Latin American countries, was another request made by the Rio Group that was included in the final declaration. The Sao Paulo meeting was attended by all of the foreign ministers of the Rio Group -- which consists of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Attending the meeting as observers were the ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and Guatemala, representing the Caribbean and Central America, respectively. The EU was represented by the foreign ministers of Spain and Portugal; Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, who is vice president of the EU; deputy ministers; and deputy ministers of the other members of the ``Group of 12'' (Denmark, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and France).
