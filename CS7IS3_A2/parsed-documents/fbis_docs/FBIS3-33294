Jobim termed the president's launching of a ticket with [Finance] Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso as the presidential candidate and Deputy Antonio Britto (PMDB-RS) -- former social security minister -- as his running mate most untimely. Jobim did not hide his annoyance with the president's position because all his efforts to lobby for the FSE in Congress -- and especially the PMDB (which vies with the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] for the same portion of the electorate) -- are centered on keeping support for the FSE separate from Cardoso's possible candidacy. He said: It was not the right moment to talk about that. From a strategic standpoint, the president ought to have realized that he should avoid referring to candidacies now. During the first round of voting on the FSE, Jobim denounced the actions of Education Minister Murilio Hingel's advisers, who nearly sank the agreement worked out between Cardoso and the PMDB, the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and the PSDB. Jobim stated: Parties also have to decide whether they are interested in the country's situation or how they will fare in the election. Jobim will not modify the text passed in the first round of voting last week. He commented that he intends to have the original FSE text voted through. He thus will propose rejecting the amendments introduced to the plan. The deadline for submitting amendments to the FSE, which would entail some modifications to the text approved in the first round, expired on 17 February. Jobim said: There may be negotiations between parties, but we are very well disposed. The majority of the 31 amendments introduced changes in the articles that deal with appropriations for education, housing, and health care. Jobim believes there is no need to modify the original text because Congress will be able to define new percentages to be appropriated for education when it votes on the law that will regulate the use of the FSE. He expects that the second round of voting on the FSE will take place on 23 February. He said: This is an odd struggle because congressmen may decide that afterward and they may even appropriate a considerably higher amount for education. Jobim believes the FSE may be enacted at the end of the month if its text is not amended. He also agrees that the constitutional revision will have been concluded by 30 May. According to Jobim, there are enough proposals to establish an agenda for the constitutional revision; "only the political will of political parties is needed."
