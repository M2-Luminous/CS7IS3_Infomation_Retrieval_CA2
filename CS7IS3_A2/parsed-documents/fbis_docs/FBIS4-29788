Kakizawa said he revealed his plan for the U.S. visit to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in a meeting after the regular cabinet session and Hata approved it. But his U.S. visit depends on what happens in the Diet, Kakizawa told reporters. Japan and U.S. officials have said they hope to reach an agreement in the talks on setting up a new bilateral trade framework before the Naples summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations in July. Hata and U.S. President Bill Clinton are scheduled to meet in Naples. Kakizawa is tentatively scheduled to leave for the U.S. on Friday [24 June] evening and return to Tokyo on Monday. The two sides are considering a West Coast city such as Los Angeles or San Francisco as the venue of the Kakizawa-Kantor meeting, government sources said. Kantor has strongly requested a meeting with Kakizawa, the sources said. Japan and the U.S. have also considered a meeting between Kakizawa and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, but gave up on that as it was too difficult to arrange, they said.
