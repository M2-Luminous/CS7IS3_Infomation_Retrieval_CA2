FR940725-0-00089 FR940725-0-00013 Response: Section 1915(c)(4) of the Act prohibits the Secretary from placing durational limits on respite care as long as the waiver retains cost-neutrality as required under section 1915(c)(2)(D). The issues raised by the commenters regarding our formerly proposed limits on institutional respite care are now moot. Section 1915(c)(1) of the Act specifically excludes room and board as a covered waiver service. However, an exception with regard to respite care was included under regulations based on the text of section 1915(c)(4)(B) of the Act, the legislative history of OBRA '81 that amended the Act to include the home and community-based waiver program, and the fundamental nature of respite care services. In discussing the services that could be included under section 1915(c) waiver programs, the Congress explained in H. Rept. No. 208, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 966 (1981) that respite care services were provided on a short-term basis to individuals unable to care for themselves and designed to fill-in for the absence of care or the ``need for relief for those persons normally providing such care.'' The Congress indicated that such services can be offered in ``the home of an individual or an approved facility such as a hospital, nursing home, foster home, or community-residential facility.'' Because of the Congress' discussion of certain institutional facilities as locations for the provision of respite care, and the fact that room and board costs are a core aspect of the costs of respite care services offered in these facilities, we believe that the Congress intended to allow for payment of room and board costs as part of the costs of respite care services. Based in part on the cited language from the Conference Report, we have decided to limit institutional respite care to States which limit the facilities authorized to provide such care to (1) Medicaid-certified hospitals and nursing homes, and (2) foster homes and community-residential facilities that meet State standards as specified in an approved waiver. Payment for room and board costs as part of the costs of respite care services can be authorized only for care provided in these facilities. Section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act requires that a State maintain the overall cost-neutrality of its waiver program. Significant increases in respite care, particularly institutional respite care because it is generally costly, could jeopardize the cost-neutrality of a waiver program. A State that wishes to revise its limit on the number of hours or days of respite care in a previously approved waiver program must submit an amendment to its currently operating waiver. The amendment must specify the revised limits and revise the cost-neutrality formula to allow for the increased costs attributable to the revised respite care limits. 2. Provisions of the Final Rule We are not including in these final regulations any limits on the duration of respite care. However, the State must continue to show cost-neutrality in its waiver program. Because of the changes in the law, the proposed revision to ยง440.180(b)(7) that contained limits on respite care has been deleted. We will consider timely comments on this deletion.
