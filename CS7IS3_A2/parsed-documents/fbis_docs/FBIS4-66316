This world-renowned scholar, China People's Political Consultative Committee member and concurrently China Branch Director of the International Fuzzy Systems Association (IFSA), expounded on the history of fuzzy mathematics theory and applications in China and on the bright prospects for applications of fuzzy logic in the S&T of the coming century. One of the specific benchmarks he brought up was his research team's development of the world's second prototype computer built with fuzzy inference engine discrete components; Dr. Wang's team achieved a 50 percent increase in speed [from 10 million inferences per second to 15 million inferences per second] and a reduction of 90 percent in the machine's physical volume compared to the world's first such prototype, developed by Japanese Professor Takeshi Yamakawa and announced on [11 July] 1987 [details in JPRS-CST-88-014, 25 Jul 88 pp 116-117 and in JPRS-CST-90-027, 29 Oct 90 pp 13-14]. Dr. Wang also mentioned China's world-class research on fuzzy control of inverted pendulums [details in JPRS-CST-92-012, 18 Jun 92 p 53]. Finally, he stressed the value of knowledge engineering in future development of a variety of disciplines, including weather forecasting, seismology, industry (especially metallurgy), home electronics, economic planning, management, transport, banking and finance, and education.
