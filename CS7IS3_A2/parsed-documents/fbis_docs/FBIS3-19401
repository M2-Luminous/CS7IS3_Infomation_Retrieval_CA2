At 11 percent, it has reached an alarming level in the European Union. There are hardly any signs that this tendency will reverse once the current recession is overcome. In the United States, where the economy has been growing again in the past two years, a number of new jobs have been created but expectations have not been fulfilled as far as the quantity and, above all, quality is concerned. Developments in the labor market will in the future no longer primarily be determined by the economic ups and downs but by structural factors that are difficult to eliminate. This is one of the reasons that the United States organized a conference of the seven major industrialized nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, and Canada -- in Detroit on Monday [14 March] and Tuesday, which was exclusively devoted to this topic. The responsible finance, economics, and labor ministers discussed the causes of the problem in four working groups, seeking a solution to the problem. Quick successes were not to be expected. Yet German Ministers Waigel, Rexrodt, and Bluem got the impression after exchanging views with their counterparts over a day and a half that the trip to Detroit was useful. One of the concerns the Germans wanted to discuss in the automobile capital was removed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in his opening speech: "Let us start by acknowledging the fundamental reality that private enterprise, not government action, is the engine of growth in the economic sector and in the creation of new jobs." Thus, he made it clear from the beginning that the conference was not designed -- or at least only to a very limited extent -- to persuade the visitors to adopt programs to boost the economy, which in the past only led to straw fires before elections. Clinton believes that the tasks the state must fulfill offer the enterprises the required preconditions for growth and preparing the population for a working life in the new environment of the global competitive economy. How the tasks are to be defined and how they can be fulfilled was one of the most important subjects of discussion in Detroit. Difficulties arose quickly in this respect because the economic and social realities in the United States and Europe are completely different. In the United States, over 35 million new jobs were created in the past 20 years -- many of which required high qualification and were well paid, but many of which offered employment for workers with low qualifications at low wages. Generally, real incomes in the United States have not risen during this period. The difference between high-income earners and have-nots has increased dramatically and does not only threaten "the economic strength of the United States but also the social structures of our democratic society." (Clinton) In Europe, the enterprises postponed restructuring measures for a long time. This had the effect that the real incomes of those who had jobs continued to increase considerably, but that overall employment declined. Social peace was preserved because the unemployed and short-time workers received relatively high social benefits. In view of these different developments, are we only faced with a choice "between poverty in the United States and unemployment in Europe," as economic scientist Barry Bosworth from the Brookings Institution in Washington asked ironically? U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich considers this a wrong alternative: "We must combine the education and training systems that exist in Europe and Japan with the dynamic mobility and flexibility that exists in the United States," he suggested. Yet there is the danger that not the good but the bad aspects are exchanged.
