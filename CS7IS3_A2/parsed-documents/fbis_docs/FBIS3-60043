The buying and selling usually takes place in night clubs open to young people. The sides usually firmly conspire but the business is almost completely open in some places. Prices naturally vary from product to product. A marijuana cigarette can already be bought for 200 forints, approximately one gram of amphetamine ("speed") costs 5,000 forints, a gram of LSD is between 600 and 1,000 forints, and heroin addicts can get their daily dosage for as little as 500 forints. Cocaine is the most expensive drug, one dose is between 12,000 and 13,000 forints at the moment. Major Bela Harman, head of the Budapest Police Headquarters [BRFK] Youth Protection Section, said that, since it is against the law, there are not any records on drug users in Budapest. However, it is certain that the drug users are almost all young people. Officers of his section have been visiting the infamous entertainment places of the inner districts for two years and, as we learned from Lieutenant Zoltan Kurucz, a permanent member of the force, a drug user group is discovered almost every month. The BRFK's biggest catch this year was 15 kilograms of marijuana and a 30-piece LSD stamp collection, and one month ago, a whole Mexican wild hemp plantation was found in Budakalasz. The lines from the latest drug case in Budapest led the youth protection officers from a well known notorious club to the Ujpalota blocks of flats. The procedure has been going on for a little more than two weeks now. During the investigation, the police confiscated almost 400 grams of hemp derivatives. According to estimates, some 20 tons of drugs crossed the country in 1993, and some 200 kilograms of this was confiscated by the Hungarian police. According to a youth protection officer of one of the foundations, we still cannot talk about a drug mafia in Hungary. In Sandor Farago's view, it might still be possible to achieve with adequate means--and a much broader preventive work--that Hungary is preserved as a relatively calm island in the center of Europe.
