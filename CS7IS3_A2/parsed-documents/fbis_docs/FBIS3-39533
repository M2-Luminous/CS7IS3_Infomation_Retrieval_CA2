The issue is currently being discussed by the White House National Security Council and a decision could be made by the end of the week. Reliable sources say that Skopjean President Kiro Gligorov unofficially assured the State Department that he will make a vague statement promising to begin immediate negotiations with his government and the parliament to cancel Skopje's flag if the United States proceeds in establishing diplomatic relations and Greece agrees to continue dialogue under the auspices of Cyrus Vance. The State Department believes that diplomatic relations should be established by 1 March, arguing that the political cost for Greece would be less if this happened now rather than later. At the same time, the Americans do not want the exchange of ambassadors to coincide with the Greek prime minister's visit to the United States, which is scheduled for 22 April. U.S. diplomats are also arguing that the crisis in Bosnia and the possibility of air raids makes it necessary to handle immediately any pending issues in U.S.-Skopjean relations. The United States has noted the nationalistic upsurge that has been going on in Greece during the last few days but believes that it will not turn into tangible, harsh measures against Skopje in the economic relations sector.
