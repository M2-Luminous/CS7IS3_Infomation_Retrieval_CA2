Abu-al-Sa'ud Sultan, head of the Egyptian-Russian trade section at the General Federation of Egyptian Trade Chambers, said the new company, which belongs to the private sector, will work to make a success of barter deals between Egypt and the Russian Federation and the CIS, with a population of 300 million. Most Egyptian companies lost the former Soviet market after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Sultan said the company will work to conclude many trade agreements with the Russians to restore part of this important market and raise Egyptian exports to their old figure of 1 billion Egyptian pounds. He noted that current exports to the Russian market are 25 percent of the old figure, while Egyptian imports from Russia stand at 1 billion pounds. [passage omitted]
