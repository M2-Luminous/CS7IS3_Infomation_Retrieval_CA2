The two sides, together with two bishops, two top army officers and the representatives of the UN and Organisation of African Unity will seek to bring the landlocked East African state "back from the brink," said UN special representative Ahmedou Ould Abdallah. The two sides would not split up before settling the problem of who should succeed president Melchior Ndadaye, assassinated in a failed military coup on October 21, Ould-Abdallah added. Political and tribal violence flared in the capital after the government sacked five members of the constitutional commission Saturday. The commission is expected to rule on the legitimacy of Ntaryamira's designation as president on 13 Janaury. The opposition, led by Sylvie Kinigi, is contesting the nomination by the national assembly. Ntaryamira, the former agriculture minister, comes from the same majority Hutu tribe as the assassinated president. Burundi's army, and until recently its top political posts, are dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe.
