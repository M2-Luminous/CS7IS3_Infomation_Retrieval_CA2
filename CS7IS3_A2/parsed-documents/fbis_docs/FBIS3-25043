Reacting on Monday [7 February] to the reported shambolic situation at the NPKF's [Orange] Free State training camp, Gen Rogers said those involved in the reported ill-discipline and those in command should be condemned in the strongest terms. "A question which needs to be answered is where the force commander, Brigadier (Gabriel) Ramushwana, was during the events described." Gen Rogers said discipline was an essential factor in any military or police force and especially so in one which had been tasked to keep the peace in the run-up to the April election. "Members must be placed under some existing form of military or police discipline code as time does not allow a new code to be drawn up."
