In an opinion poll conducted recently by the first national poll administrator, more than 75 percent of those interviewed, said since the Council comprises representatives of the parties to the Cotonou Accord, the Council must resolve the issue. Some of the respondents pointed out that under the Cotonou Accord, the Council of State is nonfactional and must make the appointments. At the Cotonou meeting in July last year, the four ministries -- finance, foreign affairs, justice, and defense -- were not allocated due to disagreement by the parties. At a subsequent meeting in Monrovia this February, the parties could still not resolve the issue but agreed that the UN representative to Liberia, Trevor Gordon-Somers, seek the opinion of the OAU, ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States], and the UN secretary general, to advise him on what to do before consulting the parties on the issue. On an ELBC Radio program, "Hot Line", Ambassador Somers admitted that the issue of the four ministries was unresolved. Offering his personal opinion, Mr. Somers said if the Council of State was indeed imminent, the ministries issue should be (?left for it).
