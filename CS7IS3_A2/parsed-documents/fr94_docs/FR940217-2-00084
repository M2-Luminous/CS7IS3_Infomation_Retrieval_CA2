The POO describes proposed expansion of LTM mining operations in Humboldt County, approximately 34 miles east of Winnemucca, Nevada. A total of approximately 55 million tons of ore and 370 million tons of barren (nongold-bearing) rock may be excavated during the 15 year mine life. Total surface disturbance for all mine facilities would be about 2251 acres. Existing key production facilities would include the mine pits, barren rock piles, ore crushing, conveying, grinding, and oxidation circuits, heap leach pads and solution ponds, gold extraction and refining equipment, and tailings disposal facilities. Nonprocessing ancillary facilities to support the mining activities include administration, laboratory, warehouse, maintenance shop buildings, fuel, oil, reagent and water storage facilities and other small structures required for operations. This EIS will address the issues of geology, minerals, soils, water resources, vegetation, wildlife, grazing management, air quality, aesthetic resources, cultural resources, paleontological resources, land use, access, recreation, social and economic values related to expansion. Federal, state, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the BLM's decision on the POO are invited to participate in the scoping process. The Authorized Officer will respond to public input and comment as part of the final EIS. The decision regarding the proposal will be recorded as a Record of Decision, which is subject to appeal under 43 CFR part 4. Dated: February 7, 1994. Ron Wenker, District Manager, Winnemucca.
