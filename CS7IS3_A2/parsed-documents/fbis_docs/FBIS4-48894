China is developing a socialist market economy and we fully respect the development path Mongolia has chosen. Today we will sign a treaty on Sino-Mongolian friendly and cooperative relations. This is an event of great significance in the history of Sino-Mongolian relations. China is willing to maintain friendly and neighborly relations with all its neighbors, including Mongolia.

As for some minor problems, the two countries can resolve them in a friendly manner on the principle of mutual respect. He added: "We attach great importance to Premier Li Peng's visit to Mongolia. The visit is a continuation of the increase of contacts between the leaders of the two countries, and has great significance for the development of Mongolian-Chinese relations. It is especially significant that a treaty on Sino-Mongolian friendly and cooperative relations will be signed during your visit. The treaty will not only reflect the relationship that has existed between China and Mongolia, but also will lay a legal foundation for the relationship between the two countries in the next century. I am satisfied with the continuing development of Sino-Mongolian relations and hope these relations will continue to develop -- this is also the wish of the Mongolian people." Orchirbat said: The Mongolian Government and people congratulate China for the achievements it has made in carrying out reform and opening up and in improving the Chinese people's living standards. Mongolia supports China's foreign policy, especially its advocation to build a new international political and economic order. China exerts important influence on world affairs; therefore, China's foreign policy has great significance for preserving regional and world peace and stability. Developing Mongolian-Chinese and Mongolian-Russian relations is the primary task of Mongolia's foreign policy; so, we are glad to see that Mongolia has maintained friendly relations with these two great neighbors.
