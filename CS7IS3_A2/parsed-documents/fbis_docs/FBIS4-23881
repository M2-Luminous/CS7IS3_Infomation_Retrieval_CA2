The attack on the Milles Collines hotel by extremist gunmen from the Hutu majority came hours after the mainly Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front launched a commando raid and brought some 400 people out of a church where hundreds of people have been killed by Hutus. The UN spokesman, Major Jean-Guy Plante, said he could not give any casualties from the raid on the hotel, but said it was "probably murderous". Both the hotel and the church are on territory in the embattled capital held by Hutu pro-government troops and militia forces. In the Tutsi raid on the church, other rebel forces started firing to create a diversion, and 180 wounded civilians and soldiers, believed to have been hurt in the ensuing fighting, were admitted to a Red Cross hospital. Two UN officers, one from Bangladesh and the other from Uruguay, were hurt in what was believed to have been a grenade or mine explosion Friday about 20 kilometres (12 miles) north-west of Kigali during a reconnaissance mission on the road to the town of Ruhengeri, UN military sources said. No further details were immediately available and it was unclear who was responsible for the explosion. Fighting erupted despite a shaky two-day-old ceasefire between rebel and government forces.
