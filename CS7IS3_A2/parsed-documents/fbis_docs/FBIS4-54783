At the same time Poland supports the process of linking the East and West through an expansion of the existing security structures, that is the European Union, the Western European Union and NATO. In Poland's opinion integration with the European communities may ensure this country conditions for lasting development. Poland will also aim at close cooperation with the U.S. and the Far East countries. The priorities also cover conditions to be created for free contacts of individuals. The Council of Ministers adopted a resolution on the Polish military contingent in the U.N. Disengagement Observance Forces (UNDOF) in Syria and amendments to the resolution on the Polish military contingent in the U.N. special missions.
