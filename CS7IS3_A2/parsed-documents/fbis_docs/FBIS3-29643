The coincident indicator, which represents the current state of the economy, was well below the 50 percent line for the third straight month at 25.0 percent, following a preliminary reading of 20 percent in the previous two months. The leading indicator, which projects economic conditions a few months ahead, was at 36.4 percent, below the 50 percent line for the eighth month in a row. Preliminary figures were 41.7 percent for November and 33.3 percent for October. The index for raw material inventories was down 2.2 percent, falling to the negative side for the first time in two months with the rise in electrical machinery and chemical-related goods shipments. Machinery orders slipped to the minus side for the first time in two months. The Nikkei commodity index was up 0.7 percent, showing positive growth for the first time in 10 months due to the smaller drop in nonferrous metal prices. The rest of the components in the leading indicator remained on the minus side. In the coincident indicator, the only change was that the department store sales index was flat compared with the negative side it was on in November. This was attributed mainly to a smaller decline in sales of menswear. Electricity consumption and the index for commercial sales continued on an uptrend. The rest of the components such as industrial production, were on the minus side. The lagging indicator for December was zero percent, unchanged from the preliminary zero percent the previous month. An official at the EPA said that although the general picture is sluggish, some signs in the individual components point to hopes of a slight recovery. He noted that among the leading indicator components, employment is picking up in the construction industry due to the demand in public works, and that the floor space of new constructions shows a slight increase. The housing sector could begin to pick up now that the government has decided to ease housing loan terms in its economic package, the official said. "I think the figures for January will be better, perhaps even reaching the 50 percent level," he said. "But there's really no knowing what will happen with the possibility of the yen gaining ground," he said, referring to the Japanese currency whose rise could dampen economic recovery.
