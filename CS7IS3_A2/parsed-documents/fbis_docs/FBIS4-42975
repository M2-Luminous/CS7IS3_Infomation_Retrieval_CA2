Denktas said that from the beginning, UN officials, who are preoccupied with petty issues, have been trying to deny the Turkish Cypriots their interests, as well as some of their requests, based on psychological reasons. Denktas received Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's assistant special envoy in Cyprus, this afternoon and discussed the latest developments concerning the CBM package. In a statement after the meeting, which lasted approximately one and one-half hours, Denktas said that he conveyed to Feissel information concerning the text of the Vienna agreements, which the Turkish Cypriot side sent to the UN Secretariat General with a view to incorporating it into the 21 March document. The president explained that the Turkish Cypriot side went a long way and made significant concessions in order to reach an agreement and showed great flexibility with the aim of concretizing the rights and freedoms promised to the Turkish Cypriots. Despite this, Denktas remarked, nothing has been achieved, and the Turkish Cypriot side is continuously being presented with new demands. Pointing out that Greek Cypriot Administration leader Kliridhis' real concern is to avoid any additions to the 21 March document, Denktas noted that the UN officials are acting in line with the wishes of the Greek Cypriot leader. The president stressed that the Turkish Cypriot side does not intend to succumb to all the demands of the United Nations, reiterating that all the negative developments stem from the fact that the United Nations recognizes the Greek Cypriot side as the legitimate government of Cyprus. Denktas added that not only is the United Nations making continuous demands on the Turkish Cypriot side, it is also unjustly holding the Turkish Cypriot side responsible for any problems. In reply to a question, Denktas explained that Feissel will relay the information he received from the Turkish Cypriot side to New York and that a report may be submitted to the UN Security Council. Feissel, in turn, refrained from answering any questions after the meeting, merely saying that he will convey the requests of the Turkish Cypriot side to the UN secretary general. Feissel remarked that the issue of access to Maras [Varosha] was also discussed during the meeting, which he described as a continuation of yesterday's talks.
