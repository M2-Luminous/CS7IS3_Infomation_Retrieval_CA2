FR940706-0-00011 FR940706-0-00001 Order of appearance: In §283.15(f) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that FNS would have the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the QC claim against the State and that the State agency would have the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the facts upon which it bases its appeal. Comment: The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter argued that contrary to the intent of Congress, the proposed rule shifted the burden of proof to the States. The commenter suggested that this section be modified to require that FNS, and not the States, bear the burden of proving its error-rate penalty claim against the State. This burden of proof would be required for all factual matters put in issue. Response: The Department has considered this comment and has determined that a revision to this provision is unnecessary. The Department, however, wishes to reiterate that it has the ultimate burden of persuasion, by a preponderance of the evidence, of the QC error rate claim against the State throughout the appeals process. Nothing in the NPRM or this final rule changes that burden. However, if the Department makes a prima facia case, the burden of going forward with the evidence upon which the State bases its appeal shifts to the State agency. The State must prove any evidence offered to meet this burden of going forward by a preponderance. It is well settled that a fact can never be proven by something less than a preponderance of the evidence. This section has been renumbered in the final rulemaking as §283.15(g). Objections: In §283.15(h) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that at the hearing any party may object to a ruling by the ALJ and that any objection not made to the ALJ could not be raised if there were a subsequent review by the Judicial Officer. Comment: The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that there appeared to be some confusion of intent between the preamble and the regulatory language. The commenter questioned if it was the intent of the Department to limit materials presented to the Judicial Officer. Response: The Department has considered this comment and wishes to clarify that the review by the Judicial Officer shall be based on decisions rendered by the ALJ. The ALJ must have been provided the opportunity to render a decision on an issue before that issue can be appealed to the Judicial Officer. If a party to the appeal fails to raise an objection to the ALJ, that objection cannot be raised with the Judicial Officer since the ALJ had not rendered a decision on that objection. This section has been renumbered in the final rulemaking as §283.15(j). Official Records or documents: In §283.15(j) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that official government records or documents could be admitted into evidence without the production of the person who prepared the document. The party could either submit the officially published document or a certified copy of the document. The Department's Office of General Counsel would prepare the certification for FNS and other Departmental records. Comment: The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter noted that this procedure was too cumbersome since it apparently would require that States go to the USDA General Counsel to certify each and every FNS document, including policy statements. Response: The Department has considered this comment and wishes to clarify that State agencies would only be required to request that the USDA General Counsel certify FNS documents if such documents are not officially published documents. The Department also wishes to clarify that official records or documents may include official State government records or documents. In similar fashion, for unpublished State documents, any necessary certification would be provided by State personnel having the legal authority to make such certification. This section has been renumbered in the final rulemaking as §283.15(l).
