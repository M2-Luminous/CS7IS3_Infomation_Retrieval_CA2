The Caribbean delegates include Yves Renard, executive director of the Caribbean Natural Resource Institute (CANARI), who served as regional representative on the IUCN council, and David Smith, executive director of the Jamaica Conservation Development Trust. Lynn Holowesko, of the Bahamas National Trust, and representatives of several other governmental agencies and non- governmental organisations in the Caribbean are also listed to attend the meeting. They will be joined by other leading experts on the environment and development from around the world, to discuss the major environmental issues of the time, a statement from CANARI said. The theme for the January 18-26 meeting is "Caring for the Earth and Its People." Participants will address issues such as the implementation of the convention of biological diversity, the formulation of policies on the sustainable utilisation of living natural resources, and the incorporation of environmental care in human ethics, CANARI added. They will also explore "the Caribbean experiences and its approaches to conservation, natural resource management and sustainble development." Every three years, members of the IUCN get together to set the policy and direction that the union will follow over the next three years.
