Barberousse pointed out that Panamanian authorities recently seized at Coco Solo Pier, Colon, two vessels bound for Port-au-Prince. More than 1,000 kg of cocaine were found in the vessels' holds, thus revealing a criminal connection. As for the sanctions adopted by the OAS against the Raul Cedras military regime and the Panamanian Government's compliance with those sanctions, the Haitian charge d'affaires said he had received no official notification whatsoever. The diplomat added: "If this is the Panamanian Government's position, the embassy approves of it with satisfaction, because that is the kind of attitude the international community is taking to solve the Haitian crisis." Questioned on the imminent military invasion of his country, just as happened in Panama, Barberousse emphasized that the official position of Jean-Bertand Aristide's government's is not to support a military incursion in Haiti, but he understands the Panamanians' position on the issue. The Haitian official also said that now is not the time for a military invasion but for the implementation of peaceful measures to settle disputes. That is the path that the international community is taking, thereby coinciding with the interests of the constitutional government. Barberousse said: "What we really want is for the Haitian military to leave power, and that is what we are aiming for through the implementation of sanctions, which, we hope, will become more effective every day." As for Panama, he reported that the Haitian Embassy this week sent a note to the Panamanian Foreign Ministry requesting a meeting with the foreign minister to discuss the implementation of sanctions and the cooperation the Panamanian Government has offered Haitians so far.
