Now, when we are undertaking economic reform, we still must insist on taking the socialist path and upholding the lofty ideals of communism. The younger generation, in particular, must grasp this point. The question, however, is: What is socialism, and how should we build socialism? We have a lot of experience and lessons, the most important of which is to be clear on this question" (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Vol 3, p. 116; hereafter only the page number is noted when quoting passages from the Selected Works, Vol 3). Regarding this question, what important and new thinking did Comrade Deng Xiaoping advance? Some preliminary studies of this question will be made in this article. Of course, unlike ordinary textbooks, Deng Xiaoping's works do not offer any general definition or explanation. Deng Xiaoping's purpose does not lie in finding a generally applicable formula, but in solving real problems, including real problems in China's socialist construction. He said: "Marxism must be a Marxism that integrates with China's real conditions, and socialism must be a socialism that fits in with China's real conditions and has Chinese characteristics" (p. 63). However, we must deliberate on one question: What new substance did Deng Xiaoping's expositions on socialism contribute to Marxist scientific socialism? Aiming at solving real problems, Deng Xiaoping summed up China's historical experience in socialism, and also touched the historical experience of international socialism, thus advancing a series of new Marxist theses. Marxist socialist theories are an evergreen that should develop along with practice and be constantly enriched. Deng Xiaoping made important contributions in this respect. Four issues will be dealt with in the following passages: 1) The development of productive forces; 2) The primary stage of socialism; 3) Reform -- liberation of productive forces; and 4) The socialist market economy. I. Development of Productive Forces Deng Xiaoping said in 1986: "The first principle of socialism is to develop production, and the second is to achieve common prosperity" (p. 172). He reaffirmed this point in the important remarks made during his inspection of the South in the spring of 1992. He said: "The essence of socialism is to liberate and develop productive forces, abolish exploitation, eliminate polarization, and ultimately achieve common prosperity" (p. 373). Deng Xiaoping persistently stressed that concerning the question of understanding what socialism is, we must give first place to the development of productive forces, and he made this point repeatedly for many years. "The fundamental task of the stage of socialism is to develop productive forces" (p. 63). "The primary task of socialism is to develop productive forces and gradually improve the people's material and cultural living standard" (p. 116). His thesis on liberating productive forces through reform under socialist conditions is linked to the requirements for developing productive forces. To counter the fallacies uttered by the "Gang of Four" counterrevolutionary clique during the "Cultural Revolution -- such as "We prefer impoverished socialism to affluent capitalism" -- Deng Xiaoping asserted with his enlightening voice that poverty is not socialism. He stressed this point not only because he wanted to refute the "Gang of Four," but also to counter the shortcomings that had existed in our party's guiding ideology for a long time. He said: "If we say that we have weaknesses following the founding of our country, they are a certain neglect of the development of productive forces" (p. 63). Hence, he also said: "We are told by 20 years of experience, from 1958 to 1978: Poverty is not socialism, and socialism must eliminate poverty. We cannot describe ourselves as fulfilling socialist requirements if productive forces are not developed and the people's living standards are not improved" (p. 116). We also can see from our history that the thinking of "worrying about inequality rather than scarcity" has a longstanding and profound effect. Agrarian revolutions in the feudal age always and could only set their goal of struggle on implementing egalitarian measures. This sort of egalitarianism is also a kind of impoverished socialism, which played a progressive role in history, but is absolutely harmful to modern life. Of course, putting the development of productive forces in the first place is not to say that socialism refers only to the development of productive forces. Deng Xiaoping said: "Socialism differs from capitalism precisely in its characteristic of seeking common prosperity and averting polarization. The fortune created belongs first to the State and second, to the people, and it will not lead to the emergence of new bourgeoisie" (p. 123). As far as socialism is concerned, neither public ownership nor the system of distribution according to work is nonessential. He said: "Public ownership as the main part and common prosperity are the cardinal principles of socialism which we must uphold" (p. 111). He also said: "A new bourgeoisie will never emerge in our development process because our principle of distribution is that of distribution according to work" (p. 255). Some people have asked the question: Is socialism aimed at the public ownership system or at the development of productive forces? One answer to this question is that only public ownership is set as the goal from which we can never deviate on the track of socialism. Another is that in order to attach importance to the development of productive forces, we must treat it as the end, and public ownership merely as the means. In my view, raising and answering these questions in this way is inappropriate. If we talk about the ultimate aim of socialism, it is neither public ownership nor the development of productive forces, but rather the general improvement of the material and cultural living standards of society as a whole and of the people (until we can enter communism), which -- in Deng Xiaoping's popular language -- is called common prosperity. He mentioned on many occasions that common affluence is the goal. For example: "The goal of socialism is precisely to help all the people achieve common prosperity, but not to make them polarized" (pp. 110-111). In order to achieve common prosperity, it is necessary to develop productive forces and to have public ownership. If public ownership is forsaken, only a tiny minority of people will get rich, even if productive forces are developed, thus giving rise to polarization. If productive forces are not developed, however, it will lead only to common poverty, even if there is public ownership. Before the rise of Marxism, every form of utopian socialism advocated public ownership. We should say that the ideal of socialism is always linked to the demand for public ownership, and the so-called socialism does not exist if public ownership is forsaken. However, past socialist thought gave consideration to public ownership on the basis of low productive forces, and almost all of them called for impoverished socialism. The characteristic of Marxist scientific socialism lies precisely in building public ownership on the basis of highly developed productive forces, which are even higher than those of a capitalist society. Marx and Engels said as early as the Communist Manifesto: After realizing their own political rule, the proletariat must try as quickly as possible to increase the total volume of productive forces. Deng Xiaoping also said: "Marxism pays the greatest attention to developing productive forces" (p. 63). Therefore, paying attention to developing productive forces and eradicating the worship of impoverished public ownership and socialism is completely in line with Marxist tenets. On the issue of developing productive forces, Deng Xiaoping did not repeat the views of the founders of Marxism, but enriched Marxism with new things. He set out the idea of treating the development of productive forces as the center, while the development of public ownership and the system of distribution according to work must be subordinate to the demand for the development of productive forces. Deng Xiaoping said: "Comrade Mao Zedong was the greatest leader, and the Chinese Revolution was successful under his leadership, but he had a major weakness: He neglected the development of productive forces. I am not saying that he did not want to develop productive forces, but that the method was not correct. For example, he did not handle things according to the law of social and economic development when dealing with the `Great Leap Forward' and people's communes" (p. 116). Here was revealed the reason Mao Zedong and our party had, in the past, a certain neglect for the development of productive forces. We can cite many remarks by Mao Zedong and other leading comrades to indicate that they were very eager to develop productive forces, but owing to the adoption of an inappropriate method, the outcome was that, in reality, they neglected or overlooked the development of productive forces. Only when we handle things in accordance with the law of social and economic development can productive forces be truly developed. Here, questions in the following two respects are involved: On the one hand, the development of productive forces has its own law. The broad masses' political initiative, set off by the emergence of the socialist system, can play an important role in social development. However, it cannot be transformed into modernized productive forces if we do not work through scientific technology. Hence, Deng Xiaoping emphatically pointed out, as early as 1975, that scientific technology was a productive force. He said later that it should be considered the primary force. No doubt, the effect of politics on productive forces is displayed in rousing the masses' enthusiasm, but it lies mainly in inspiring people to strive to master scientific technology. When carrying out the "Great Leap Forward" movement in 1958, we believed that direct reliance on the masses' political initiative and on rousing their enthusiasm could lead to a great leap in industrial and agricultural productive forces, but the result was contrary to our wishes. As a matter of fact, the movement gave first place to politics rather than to the development of productive forces, and in consequence, we could not fulfill the goal of developing productive forces, but only distorted the role of politics. On the other hand lies question concerning the relationship between developing social productive forces and developing production relations. Regarding the relationship between the two, Deng Xiaoping laid stress on the leading position of productive forces. This was a breakthrough in the erroneous viewpoint prevalent in the international community and in our country for decades. According to this viewpoint, since production relations of socialist public ownership are advanced and superior, they should remain unchanged, having once taken shape, and social productive forces can be constantly improved by relying on them, and if there is no progress in the development of productive forces, we must make production relations of public ownership more "advanced." As proved by historical practice, this viewpoint does not conform to reality and is unfavorable to the development of socialism. Stalin once believed that production relations and productive forces in a socialist society entirely fit in with each other, thus denying the occurrence of the problem of improving production relations. Mao Zedong did not agree with Stalin's rigid idea, but he still could not solve this problem. When exploring ways to solve this problem, he tried to promote productive forces with a more advanced form of socialist production relations, as displayed, at least, in the policy decision of setting up rural people's communes, whereas the so-called advanced state referred to "being large-sized and collective." As proved by facts, however, people's communes were seen only as advanced in form, but could not really play a part in promoting productive forces. We should give first place to the development of productive forces after establishing socialist production relations in a preliminary way. The socialist public ownership and its corresponding system of distribution according to work are advanced, generally speaking, but the extent to which public ownership applies and what is the concrete form to be taken must be decided in accordance with the state of development of productive forces. That is, the concrete form of socialist production relations must be changed in line with the development of productive forces and with the demand for developing productive forces. Whether or not various concrete forms are appropriate cannot be judged by the criterion of being large and collective, but depends on whether or not the development of social productive forces is promoted. In summing up historical experience, Deng Xiaoping courageously set out the viewpoint of giving first place to the development of productive forces. This is a creative viewpoint in line with Marxism. He emphatically illustrated this viewpoint when the rural restructuring started. In 1980, several provinces began to transform the people's commune system into the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, and they achieved results. Many provinces, howver, had not done the same thing or had just began to carry out this kind of reform. In remarks on the rural policy issue in late May 1980, he said: "Some comrades worry whether or not this way of doing things will affect the collective economy. In my opinion, this worry is unnecessary. Our overall orientation is to develop the collective economy.... We can be sure that as long as our production, our rural social division of labor, and our commodity market have developed, low-level collectivization will develop into high-level collectivization, and those parts of the collective economy that are not consolidated will be consolidated. The key is to develop productive forces, and we must create conditions in this respect for the further development of collectivization" (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping (1975-1982)," p. 275). That is to say, under the socialist system, the development of productive forces can bring about progress in production relations. We will only take a wrong path if we break away from the development of productive forces and pursue "advanced" public ownership according to abstract criteria and believe that productive forces can be developed in this way. Under China's historical conditions, setting out such prinicples as giving first place to productive forces, suiting the development of socialist production relations to the demand for the development of productive forces, and displaying the superiority of socialism in the development of productive forces, has a very important meaning. Although these principles may not be suitable only to China and may be universally applicable, Deng Xiaoping did not set out these principles in general terms, but applied them to practice while closely linking them with China's real conditions. He not only urged people to unswervingly treat the development of productive forces as the work focus of the entire party and country, but also put forward a series of important questions related to the development of productive forces and of the socialist system based on China's national condition of being still at the primary stage of socialism. II. The Primary Stage of Socialism The 13th party congress held in October 1987 treated the thesis that our country was still at the primary stage of socialism as the starting point for giving consideration to every problem. Deng Xiaoping told foreign visitors two months before the meeting: "Our 13th party congress is going to clarify at what stage China's socialism is, which is the primary stage. Socialism itself is the primary stage of communism, whereas we -- China -- are at the primary stage of socialism, which is an undeveloped stage. Everything must proceed from such actual conditions, and we must work out plans according to these actual conditions" (p. 252). Over the years, people generally considered a socialist society as the brief transition period, which could be transformed into a communist society soon, thus there was no need to divide a socialist society into several stages. As shown by historical practice, this view was erroneous. According to the original idea of Marx and Engels, a socialist society was born after going through a revolution in a country with a high degree of capitalist development. In such a country, whether or not a socialist society should be divided into primary and advanced stages still warrants consideration. As for countries like China, where original economic development was very backward, it is impossible for socialism to be a rather short historical period; moreover, China must proceed from the primary stage. Therefore, the CPC does not set out the scientific concept of the primary stage of socialism in a general sense, but proceeds from China's concrete conditions. Mao Zedong and the leaders of his generation once were affected by the unrealistic impetuosity of a rapid transition from socialism to communism. They also took into account the idea that China's socialism would last for a long time, and Mao Zedong even suggested that socialism would have a developed stage and an undeveloped stage. Overall, however, they failed to consider China's problems by proceeding from the actual conditions of the primary stage of socialism. Deng Xiaoping said: "China did not only endure sufferings in this decade (note: refers to the "Cultural Revolution"), before that, from the latter half of 1957 on, we committed "leftist" mistakes. Overall, it refers precisely to shutting the door against the outside world, taking class struggle as the key link in domestic affairs, neglecting the development of productive forces, and making policies that overstepped the primary stage of socialism" (p. 269). A series of new principles and policies implemented following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, held in December 1978, were set out, taking an object lesson from the past mistake of overstepping the primary stage of socialism. In Deng Xiaoping's view, to help China realize the four modernizations, we should notice, at least, the two characteristics, that is, having a poor foundation to start with, and having a large population, but not many plows. In 1979, when discussing the point of a poor foundation, he said: We achieved great success in economic construction after our country's founding, but because our foundation is poor, China now is still one of the very poor countries in the world, and China's overall scientific and technological level trails that of advanced countries in the world by 20 to 30 years. Regarding the point that China's socialist construction is conducted on the basis of poverty and backwardness, Mao Zedong and leaders of his generation also noticed this. Mao Zedong used "poverty and blankness" to summarize this situation. However, they often underestimated the difficulty in socialist construction under such circumstances, and sometimes they even considered that the foundation of "poverty and blankness" was more favorable to drawing the newest and most beautiful picture. Commenting on the "Great Leap Forward" in the "Review of Certain Major Decisions and Events" in 1958, Comrade Bo Yibo said that at that time, people believed that "in a large country like ours, in which the economy and culture were very backward, it seemed that as long as we waged an arduous struggle for three years or more, we could fulfill the task of socialist construction and begin to shift to communism." He also said: "The one-sided viewpoint of treating 'poverty and blankness' as our country's merit also played a certain role in underestimating the difficulty in putting an end to our country's backward face once and for all" (see p. 720 of the book). It is unrealistic to believe that we can act freely and draw the newest and most beautiful picture of socialism on the foundation of "poverty and blankness." If there is a newest and most beautiful picture of socialism, it is definitely linked to the extremely high productive forces of socialism. We cannot talk about the newest and the most beautiful picture when socialist productive forces are still very backward. Moreover, we should not decide what kind of principles and policies to implement based on the general concepts of socialism. The importance of the theory of the primary stage of socialism lies precisely in the way it clearly points out that every principle and policy we implement must be in line with the actual conditions at the primary stage of socialism, and never can we adhere rigidly to the general form of socialism or make judgments purely in accordance with the abstract criteria of socialism. In the democratic revolution, Mao Zedong found a correct Chinese revolutionary path in accordance with China's concrete conditions. For people who adhere rigidly to the general formula of Marxism, this path is absurd. Indeed, if we are divorced from concrete conditions and raise a general question on the proletarian-led democratic revolution, that is, asking whether the revolution should be city- or village-based, such a question is unanswerable, or we can reply only that the revolution should be city-based. Under China's concrete historical conditions, however, the only correct path for a proletarian party is to go to the villages and mobilize the vast numbers of peasants to carry out armed struggle and to encircle the cities from the rural areas. The same is true for socialist construction. As we are carrying out socialist construction on the foundation of "poverty and blankness," we must admit that we are now at the primary stage of socialism. In this way, we must pay closer attention to the development of productive forces, and in order to develop productive forces, we must implement a series of principles and policies in line with the primary stage of socialism. Deng Xiaoping said: "Do not stick to the hard and fast rules. In the past, we were steeped in hard and fast rules; now we have to make a breakthrough" (p. 261). The hard and fast rules mentioned here include the general formula of socialism in the book. Breaking through the hard and fast rules refers precisely to integrating the general principles of Marxist socialism with China's actual conditions at the primary stage of socialism and to smashing the trammels of the general formula. Deng Xiaoping dared to break through the hard and fast rules and found the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which -- just as Mao Zedong dared to break through the hard and fast rules and found the victorious path of the Chinese democratic revolution -- requires great theoretical courage. It is difficult to make decisions on many problems if we are fettered by hard and fast rules. Starting from 1978, the people's commune system was transformed into the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output. "At the time when we proposed implementation of the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, many people were against it, asking if the household contract responsibility system could be regarded as socialism" (p. 367). If we are divorced from concrete historical conditions and ask, without proceeding from actual conditions, whether people's communes, in which all production means are publicly owned, or the household contract responsibility system should regarded as socialism, then it is really difficult to answer such a question. As proved by historical experience, it seems that the commune ownership (later the ownership was divided into three levels on the basis of teams) had very strong flavor of socialism, but it could not enhance the social productive forces in the countryside and improve peasants' living standard, whereas the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output (plus the system of unified management, combined with independent management), opens up broad development prospects for socialist villages in our country. As early as 1978, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We must allow some localities, some enterprises, and some workers and peasants -- owing to their hard work and great achievements -- to earn more income and lead a better life." He said: "This is a major policy that can affect and give an impetus to our national economy" (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping (1975-1982), p. 142). Later, he repeatedly talked about this idea. In February 1984, for example, he said: "We must let some localities get rich first; egalitarianism will not work. This is a major policy which everyone must consider" (p. 52). In the last decade or so, we really did it and achieved very good results. Viewed from an abstract sense, it seems very odd to put forward such a major policy. Socialism aims at achieving common prosperity; does this contradict the idea of letting some localities and some people get rich first? However, if viewed from the actual conditions at the primary stage of socialism, this policy is entirely understandable and essential. China is so large and various localities are so widely different from each other, if all localities and people were to advance at the same pace, such egalitarianism would only sink us into poverty. Allowing various economies of non-public ownership to exist, but with the public ownership at the core, is also an extremely important major policy. Deng Xiaoping said: "We allow the development of the individual economy and also the development of Sino-foreign joint ventures and solely foreign-invested enterprises, but socialist public ownership remains the main body" (p. 110). Concerning the question of foreign investment, he said: "The socialist economic foundation is very large, and will not be rocked by intakes of tens and hundreds of billions in foreign capital. Taking in foreign capital definitely can serve as an important supplement to our socialist construction, which in today's view, can be described as indispensable" (p. 65). In light of this viewpoint and also according to the concrete historical situations of the areas of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, he set out the unprecedented idea of "one country, two systems." He said: "Socialism must be the main body of China, but some areas in our country, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan, are allowed to practice capitalism" (p. 59). "Socialism is socialism in a region with a population of 1 billion. This is a prerequisite without which things will not work. Under such a prerequisite, we can allow alongside us the practice of capitalism in small areas and within a small scope. We believe that the authorized existence of capitalism within a small scope is even more advantageous to the development of socialism" (p. 103). We cannot adhere to the book formula on how to construct socialism. It seems that this is a very clear argument, but it will be a major breakthrough when we grasp this point in practice. Just like the idea of encircling the cities from the rural areas put forward by Mao Zedong in those days, dogmatists will reckon Deng Xiaoping's viewpoints as absurd arguments that depart from the classics and rebel against orthodoxy. Deng Xiaoping stressed that Marxism must be developed and that we could never treat it as dogma. He said: "In the past, we scored a victory in the revolution by encircling the cities from the rural areas. This point is not covered by the books on Marxism-Leninism. Now, we still uphold Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Here, we have some parts of inheritance and some parts of development. To be precise, what we mean by socialist construction is to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, and only in this way can we truly uphold Marxism" (p. 191). What was said in the books written by Marx and Engels was only a envisaged idea of the future socialist system. Since they summed up the reasonable elements of the desired socialist pictures depicted by generations of advanced figures, and in particular, studied the rise of capitalism and its development history, and pointed out that the capitalist system was doomed, so their envisaged idea of the socialist system was scientific in nature. However, their envisaged idea could only sketch a broad outline of the socialist system. Lenin had preliminary practice of socialism, but it was still impossible to set out relatively systematic views on socialist construction. Deng Xiaoping said: "The socialist system is not equivalent to the concrete practice of socialist construction" (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping (1975-1982), p. 214). If we copy indiscriminately the concept of a fully developed socialist system, even if this is a completely correct concept, instead of exploring the long process of socialist construction, we definitely can say that nothing will be accomplished. Our modernization proceeds on the track of socialism, but we cannot adhere rigidly to the basic concepts of the socialist system and treat them as a current program of action. In light of our national conditions, we must be good at taking various measures that are favorable to the development of social productive forces; otherwise it will be impossible to develop our socialism. We differentiate capitalism from socialism according to abstract criteria, thus suffering too many losses. We once believed that as we were practicing socialism, anything that emerged in capitalist society should be rejected. It was in this spirit that the once- popular slogan of "fostering proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" was advanced. Deng Xiaoping said: "In today's view, this old slogan is one-sided and not very accurate. Without carrying out investigation and analyzing the situation in an all- round manner, certain comrades even criticize some of our current reforms, which contribute to the development of production and the socialist cause as if they are capitalist. This practice is incorrect" (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping (1975-1982), p. 298). III. Reform -- Liberation of Productive Forces A socialist society can never be full-grown and perfect at birth; in the process of its growth and development, it is bound to undergo various changes in its economic, political, and social systems, just like all other kinds of social formation experienced in human history. In no matter what country, no slave, feudal, or capitalist society was unalterable from beginning to end. After noticing that certain malpractices have arisen in the society ruled by them, the ruling class in the society of class exploitation needs to make some changes in certain aspects in its economic, political, and social system and to take resolute actions to bring about these changes, which are called reform. In the society of class exploitation, the difference between revolution and reform lies in the fact that revolution is started by the class of the ruled, while reform is started by the ruling class. If the revolution is successful, it will result in a transformation from one kind of social formation to another, whereas reform, generally speaking, means changes within the same type of social formation. (There have been cases in human history when reform led to changes in social formations. For example, a slave society was transformed into a feudal society, and a feudal society was transformed into a capitalist society. This is because although the two initial social formations were different, both were, after all, societies with the class exploitation system.) When the United States was undergoing the severe economic crisis from 1929 on, the "New Deal" implemented by President Franklin Roosevelt was precisely a relatively important reform in the development history of capitalism. Once the implementation of Roosevelt's "New Deal" was begun, it caught public attention from all over the world. Different sorts of comments were made at that time, and some people even believed that Roosevelt had transformed capitalism into socialism. In reality, however, what Roosevelt implemented was merely a kind of reform within the limits of the capitalist system. This kind of reform really helped capitalism to bring its unused vitality into play to get over the crisis. During the 300-400 years following the rise of capitalism in the world, various countries underwent numerous self-reforms to varying degrees. This phase of history merits review. (to be continued)
