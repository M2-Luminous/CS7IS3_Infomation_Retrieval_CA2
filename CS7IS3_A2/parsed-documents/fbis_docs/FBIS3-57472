Figures that have just been published show that at the end of his first year Clinton has outstripped even such a revered President as Ronald Reagan. There is no doubt that the number of those who approve of Clinton's activities in the White House will increase following his well-judged and passionate speech which met with applause, ovations, or whistles of approval on at least 63 occasions. Clinton thanked Congress for all the achievements of the first year of his presidency, which make a rather impressive picture. It was on the legislators -- the people who who almost wrecked his budget (it was passed by one vote), all but consigned to oblivion the program to change the tax system and reduce the state debt, and furiously resisted restrictions on the use of weapons (the Brady law) -- that the President bestowed his special thanks, his final sentence sounding amazingly convincing: "Not once did I use my presidential veto," Clinton said, meaning that the combination of firmness and compromises that characterizes the administration made extreme measures unnecessary. Economic growth, which some perspicacious experts predicted back in the final months of Bush's presidency, is now a statistical fact. Clinton pointed to production growth, the increasing number of jobs, the low interest rate, and increased consumer confidence. "For the first time since Harry Truman we will have had three consecutive deficit-free years and the dollar will have stayed where it is," the President said, prompting the one of the longest ovations. Clinton stressed that all this was achieved without raising taxes for the vast majority of the population, and, above all, without placing an extra burden on the backbone of society -- the middle class. "Only the very rich, only 1.2 percent of the population, will pay higher taxes; no one else, and that is a fact," the President said. Noting that many politicians in Washington had recommended him to continue the policy of cutting defense expenditure this year, Clinton said that he had rejected that approach: In the new budget for fiscal 1994-1995 the U.S. armed forces will not receive any less money than in the previous year. Addressing not so much the legislators as the ordinary people who put him in the White House, Clinton mapped out a tough schedule for the next campaign, on which he is certainly pinning the future of his presidency -- a statewide health program.
