"The bloc stood out during the election campaign against combining parliamentary work with that in government structures," Yakovenko, member of the State Duma (lower house), explained. "We ran for the State Duma for parliamentary work rather than for joining the cabinet," he stressed. The group regards as its main task "the drafting and adoption of bills to change the mechanism of carrying economic reforms peacefully". Yakovenko noted that the elections corroborated the mechanism's inefficiency. The group now numbers 30 people, but it will possibly be boosted by independents. The temporary council includes Grigoriy Yavlinskiy (group chairman), Yakovenko, Vyacheslav Shestakovskiy, Vladimir Sheynis, Anatoliy Golov and Vladimir Lukin. Group representatives are now working on all committees engaged in organising the State Duma's work. According to Yakovenko, the status of legislator is among the main topics of ongoing discussions. The group suggests free rather than imperative mandate of lawmaker. Yakovenko said that the imperative mandate presupposes that a lawmaker is to vote strictly in compliance with a decision of a group he represents. He added that "such an approach is fraught with turning a legislator into a puppet". Speaking about a possibility of setting up a democratic coalition, Yakovenko noted that "democratic groups will most probably cooperate to counter revenge-seeking forces". He did not preclude "temporary cooperation" with Russia's Choice and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord as well as with communists and the Agrarian Party. Yakovenko confirmed that the group nominated Lukin for the post of State Duma speaker.
