Timiryazev; UDC 633.111.1''324'':631.526.32] [Abstract] Zvezda [Star] is the first winter wheat of its type obtained at the Timiryazev Agriculture Academy by distant hybridization using graduated crosses F[.sub]1[/] [Triticum durum (Kharkov 46) x Agropyron glaucum] x T. aestivum F[.sub]1[/] (Mironovskaya 808 x Lyutestsens 329). Since 1992, it has been regionalized in the Moscow Oblast. It is of the variety lutescens. Its spike is cylindrical and of average length and compactness. Its glume is oval with weakly pronounced venation. Its teeth are short and straight, and its grain is oval with a medium stria. The variety has not yet been studied genetically. According to unpublished data, it is a hexaploid form. Zvezda is distinguished by its potentially high productivity. Experiments performed by researchers at the Timiryazev Agriculture Academy and state tests have established Zvezda yields of 8.5-8.7 metric tons/hectare in the Kiev Oblast and Lithuania. In comparative tests conducted in 1987-1991 in the Moscow Oblast, Zvezda yields averaged 5.04 metric tons/hectare over the 5-year period as opposed to an average yield of 4.43 metric tons/hectare for the standard Zarya wheat. In commercial tests conducted in 1990, Zvezda again outperformed Zarya (6.16 versus 2.36 metric tons/hectare). Zvezda's main advantage over standard varieties is its high (albeit not 100 percent) resistance to damping-off. Zvezda is also distinguished from standard wheat varieties from the standpoint of its growth and development rate, which is very close to that of wheat grass. Under favorable conditions, the central part of its spike has up to 6-8 caryopses in each spikelet, which is 35-40 percent higher than in Zarya and Mironovskaya 808. Given this grain content in each spike, 1,000 grains naturally weigh less than in standard varieties and amount to 35-37 g. According to data from the All-Russian State Commission on Agricultural Crop Variety Testing, Zvezda's frost resistance may be characterized as average. Field observations in the extreme winters of 1984-85 and 1986-87 indicate that it possesses higher-than-average frost resistance, however. These contradictory frost resistance data are due, above all, to the biological peculiarities of the variety. Tests have shown Zvezda to be particularly susceptible to diseases when given high doses of nitrogen fertilizers, especially late in the season. Herbicides and retardants also appear to reduce Zvezda's immunity significantly. Its grain possesses good bread-baking properties. Its gluten quality and a number of other indicators make it perhaps superior to even Mironovskaya 808. Table 1.
