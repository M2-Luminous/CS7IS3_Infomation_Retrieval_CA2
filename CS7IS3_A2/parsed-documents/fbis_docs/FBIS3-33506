Beyond the difference of approach toward the maritime vindication subject, the chiefs of Condepa [Conscience of the Fatherland], Carlos Palenque; the ADN [Nationalist Democratic Action], Jorge Landivar; and MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left], Hugo Carvajal, maintained that Chile has caused Bolivia's isolation from the sea and has historically denied it any possibility to a sovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean. According to Foreign Ministry sources consulted by an international news agency, Sanchez de Losada is studying the possibility of attending the presidential inauguration in Chile on 11 March. On that day, Chilean President Patricio Aylwin will pass the presidency to Eduardo Frei, who won the last general elections. LA RAZON learned last night that the national government has practically rejected the possibility that President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada will attend the ceremony, although the reason for not doing so was not explained.
