Such certificates will stimulate Finnish investments in the Russian economy, the Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari told the press after his talks with President Boris Yeltsin. According to Yeltsin, the talks were very fruitful for the simple reason that they offered many concrete venues to Russian-Finnish relations at a new level. Among other things the two sides discussed the speedy adoption of legislation for the protection of investments, the prevention of dual taxation and several others matters that should stimulate economic relations. Yeltsin also said that several new big projects were discussed with the Finnish president, in particular the construction of the Yamburg-Germany gas pipeline in North Russia with a branch to Finland. Ahtisaari is going to discuss the matter with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin later on Wednesday, Yeltsin announced. Yeltsin said that the Russian debt to Finland is small and ways of regulating it were discussed. He stressed that Russia and Finland have no political problems. Answering a question from Interfax after the Kremlin talks the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev called them very successful, fruitful and dynamic. He said they went far beyond bilateral relations. Kozyrev was satisfied that the Finnish side confirmed the need for establishing the post of a human rights commissioner for Baltic countries similar to the one existing in the framework of the CSCE. He said this is especially important in view of the upcoming meeting of Baltic foreign ministers in Tallinn. "Until recently the debate on the matter was very difficult, he said, and I even thought of not going to Tallinn." Kozyrev said that Russian-Finnish relations, the absence of any territorial problems between the two sides can become a good example for Baltic countries, Latvia and Estonia in particular, so that they would not lay any territorial claims to Russia. "We cannot retreat from the principles or essence of CSCE decisions and make territorial claims to each other. This would be tantamount to opening Pandora's box", the foreign minister said. To prevent these matters from becoming an obstacle for the world community they should simply never be raised again. Kozyrev said he did not think Finnish mediation is necessary in Russian-Estonian talks. "We do not need mediators, but we always accept friendly help", he said. "We do not demand privileges for the Russian-speaking community in Baltic countries. We demand equality. It is not a Russian question, it is a question of human rights and morality", Kozyrev said.
