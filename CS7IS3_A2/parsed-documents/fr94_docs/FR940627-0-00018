FR940627-0-00018 FR940627-0-00007 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;07&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8935; AD 94&hyph;12&hyph;07] Airworthiness Directives: Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;58T Series Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;58T series helicopters, that currently requires a one-time inspection of the engine drive shaft assembly (drive shaft assembly) for cracks and loose balance weights. This amendment requires initial and repetitive visual and florescent penetrant inspections of the drive shaft assembly for cracks and improperly installed rivets. This amendment is prompted by three reported incidents of loose or missing drive shaft assembly balance weights and two reported incidents of fatigue cracks on the drive shaft assembly near the balance weight rivet hole. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the drive shaft assembly, loss of power to the rotor system, and a subsequent forced landing of the helicopter. DATES: Effective August 1, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Sikorsky Aircraft Division, United Technologies Corporation, North Main Street, Stratford, Connecticut 06601. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Terry Fahr, Aerospace Engineer, Boston Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803, telephone (617) 238&hyph;7155, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 90&hyph;10&hyph;02, Amendment 39&hyph;6590 (55 FR 18305, May 2, 1990), which is applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;58T series helicopters, was published in the Federal Register on August 31, 1993 (58 FR 45859). That action proposed to require initial and repetitive visual and florescent penetrant inspections of the engine drive shaft assembly for cracks and loose balance weights, and replacement as necessary. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed, except for editorial changes. The FAA estimates that 58 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 18 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $57,420. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
