Interior Minister Abdallah Kallel will officially announce the results at a news conference this afternoon. As a reminder, the turnout at these elections was unparalleled with more than 90 percent of voters, men, and women, taking part in the vote in the 25 electoral districts. The presidential elections were marked by an absolute popular plebiscite for President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali; the percentage of the vote for President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali exeeded 99 percent and this rate reached 100 percent in Tataouine. As for the legislative elections, the lists of the Democratic Constitutional Rally won in all districts with an extremely high percentage of votes, but these results will assuredly lead to the entry of the other parties into the chamber of deputies for the first time in the history of Tunisia due to the amendment to the electoral code, which guarantees the presence of these parties in parliament.
