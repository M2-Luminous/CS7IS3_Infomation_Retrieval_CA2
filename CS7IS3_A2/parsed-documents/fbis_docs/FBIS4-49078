The pledge follows the central government's call to encourage all economic sectors to contribute more to China's development, while letting the public sector play a leading role. Private and collectively-run science and technology firms have flourished as the country is switching from a planned economy to market-oriented reforms. "They can respond quickly and flexibly to the market needs, said Wang Zhigruo, Executive Secretary General of the China Association for Science and Technology. The wider the market opens, the more these firms can contribute to technological development "because they are intrinsically market-oriented," Wang pointed out yesterday at an ongoing three-day meeting sponsored by the China Non-State Science and Technology Entrepreneurs Association. These enterprises aim to introduce their research products to the market "as soon as possible," he added. The practice of combining capital, talent, resources, equipment and technology in the non-State science firms is setting an example for science and technological development throughout the country, according to Wang. These private and collectively-run enterprises are expected to attract more foreign capital and technology in the future, which will speed their technical progress and help them occupy the international market. Most of the capital will support scientific research and the development of new products, the meeting was told. The Stone Group, a well-known collectively-owned computer firm in Beijing, last year listed its shares in the Hong Kong stock market. "This will not only help them accumulate development funds but will also help transform their business management," Wang told the meeting. Another prominent non-State science firm, the Beida Fang Zheng Group, a leader in digital Chinese word-processing and typesetting systems, has seen its products widely accepted by Chinese publishers worldwide. There are now 45,000 private and collectively-run science enterprises in China, employing a workforce of 1.2 million, Wang said. The industrial and trade volume of these enterprises last year topped 50 billion yuan ($5.7 billion). More than 100 of the firms own assets valued at more than 100 million yuan ($11.5 million) each. Most of these enterprises deal with technology-intensive industries including chemicals, telecommunication, computers, building materials, medicine and environmental protection technology.
