What is the main topic of conversation in today's China? Economics. China's economy has been developing by leaps and bounds since late 1978 when the government decided to shift the focus of its work on to economic construction. Today, as the situation develops and the world changes, new content has been added to the old topic. What exactly is the new content? Firstly, following 15 years of practice and exploration, China's economic structural reform is finally proceeding under a clear objective model -- the socialist market economic structure. The recent decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China outlines a blueprint for the new structure. The basic framework of the blueprint consists of the following five links: -- A modern enterprise system based mainly on public ownership, and which allows the common development of diverse economic sectors and complies with the requirements of a market economy; -- A unified national market system which is linked to the international market and which allows free exchange of various factors such as commodities and productive forces; -- A macro-economic control system centered on economic and legal means and necessary administrative measures; -- An income distribution system based mainly on the principle of "to each according to his work", and which gives priority to efficiency while taking fairness into account; and -- A multi-tiered social security system under which essential daily necessities are provided to both urban and rural residents. This year, efforts will be made to increase the dynamics of reform in these areas, press ahead with overall reform and record breakthroughs in key areas. If certain factors in past reforms were as analogically unclear, as if we were "groping forward by feeling for stones to cross a river", then today we have a clear view of the "opposite bank" and, indeed, have already boarded a "ferry boat". Secondly, further invigorating enterprises, controlling the balance between aggregate supply and demand and implementing industrial policies have brought about even brighter prospects for us to launch the national economy into an orbit of sustained, rapid and healthy development. The fact that reform is also revolutionary and capable of liberating productive forces has long been borne out in practice. However, during the many years of economic development, we have frequently faced threats and interference from various factors such as "overheating", imbalance, inflation, chaos and major fluctuations. In 1993, China was once again subjected to such threats as its economy entered a second year of rapid growth. Fortunately, a series of banking control measures resolutely adopted by the government almost immediately proved effective. Only then did we appropriately cool the overheated economy, overcome chaotic phenomenon and steadily bring about a second consecutive year with a 13 percent rise in economic growth. The total volume of imports and exports and the amount of introduced foreign capital continued to increase by a large margin. These experiences alone prove that so long as correct macro-control measures are adopted to constantly maintain a balance, it is possible to avoid major fluctuations and wide-ranging readjustments that given situations demand. Experts predict that in order to ensure favorable conditions for the adoption of many important reform measures, it is appropriate to fix the economic growth rate at around 9 percent. Thirdly, since the end of the world pattern characterized by bipolar political and military confrontation, the economy has played an increasingly remarkable role in international relationships. Although hegemonism and power politics continue to exist, a multi- polar pattern taken shape against a background of a contest of economic strength is developing, and the principle of placing priority on the economy has become a inevitable development trend in international exchanges. At a time when many parts of the world are in the grips of economic recession, a dynamic Asia, especially a China developing at the fastest pace, has attracted extensive attention from the international community, and has become the target in the shift in the strategic focus of international economics. Numerous countries have expressed great interest in China's vast market and attractive investment environment, and one after another have readjusted their policies toward China. A new "China craze" has emerged. The recent Sino-US Summit held during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference in Seattle reaffirmed the importance of developing bilateral relations [on] the basis of the three joint communiques, and the necessity to take the lead in restoring high- level contacts, as a welcoming move. The summit is expected to improve the cool Sino-US relationship, and proceed to bring about a turn in world peace development. Developing economic exchanges is essential for both sides, and is in no way dependent upon only one side. Such exchanges should be based on equality and mutual benefit, and not considered as a favor from one side to the other. The foundation for exchanges and cooperation is common interest, not identical ideological and social systems. Therefore, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and guaranteeing equality and mutual benefit and non-interference in each other's internal affairs are vitally important to improving the relationship. We wish that friendship and cooperation between China and various countries around the world will develop smoothly and with greater results on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in the coming new year.
