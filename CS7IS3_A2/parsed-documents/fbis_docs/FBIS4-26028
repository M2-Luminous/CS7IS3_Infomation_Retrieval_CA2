FBIS4-26028 "drchi117_e_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 Southeast Asia & Pacific Australia Appoints Senior Representative to Shanghai Australia Appoints Senior Representative to Shanghai OW1706073494 Beijing XINHUA in English 0711 GMT 17 Jun 94 OW1706073494 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Canberra, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The Australian Trade Commission (Austrade), the government trade arms, has appointed Martin Walsh senior trade commissioner to Shanghai, China's largest industrial and financial center. Walsh said today that as Shanghai is increasingly taking on the role of China's financial and industrial hub, "Austrade is now expanding its services in Shanghai." This is in line with the government initiative to help Australian business get better access to the tremendous development now going on in the east China region, he said in a statement. Walsh, who will take up his position on July 15, has been manager of Austrade's east Asia regional support office in Sydney since 1993. Speaking fluent mandarin Chinese and with an extensive background in Chinese business culture, Walsh was posted as Austrade trade commissioner in south China from 1985 to 1988 and as trade development director at the Australian Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei from 1989 to 1992. He said that "Shanghai itself is growing rapidly" and he would focus on its Pudong Economic Development Zone. "We are focusing strongly on the new Pudong finance and industrial development area on the opposite bank of the Huangpu River to the Bund," he added. He said that "this will be a massive commercial center." Australia has shifted its trade focus to Asia in recent years in a hope of taking advantage of booming economies in the Asian region to give an impetus to the country's economy. Trade and economic ties between China and Australia have increased in the past years as the thriving economic growth in China, especially in east China, has lured more Australian business. Australia's investment in China has reached to 1.25 billion U.S. dollars in terms of contracted value by the end of last year, making it the 9th largest foreign investor in China.
