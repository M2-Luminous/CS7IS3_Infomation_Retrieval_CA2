It conducts its political line by staying in parliamentary opposition to the power structures that exist in Ukraine. This is why the Rukh has found itself under steady political pressure from official institutions, as well as from pro-presidential and pro-imperial media. This is evidenced by cases of assaults on local Rukh organizations and the use of violence against its members, which has become systematic since the election campaign started. The Rukh's Chernivtsi local organization was attacked twice over the past several weeks. The premises of Rukh's local organization based in Ternopol was demolished on Christmas Eve. The children of several leaders of Rukh's department in Odessa were beaten up. Unidentified attackers broke into the house of the Rukh organization in Kirovograd Oblast; and on 15 January, there was an attempt to break into an apartment belonging to Les Tanyuk, member of the Rukh Central Command. Colonel Serhiy Budko, the organization's legislative candidate, was beaten up in broad daylight on 17 January. Similar cases are reported from practically all parts of Ukraine. Still unknown is the fate of Mykola Perevoznyy, Rukh leader in the town of Kotelvy, Poltava Oblast. About two months ago, "the relevant agencies" detained him without pressing any charges. All inquiries filed by his wife and the Rukh's local department remained unanswered. Zoya Kovalenko, a Rukh activist in the town, thinks that Mykola Perevoznyy was persecuted for his critical newspaper articles revealing abuses on the part of local government officials. One of those people, Hryhoriy Kostenko, a militia department chief, has already been registered as a candidate for people's deputy. Roman Dyakovych, Rukh's legislative candidate who works in Khmelnik hospital, could lose his job at any time because of his political convictions. He was previously reinstated in his position by a court decision. There is also evidence that people are intimidated and pressured to withdraw their signatures collected in support of Roman Dyakovych. On the night of 16 January, the premises of Rukh Secretariat were subjected to an armed attack. On that same night, Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, member of the Secretariat and cochairman of the NRU election headquarters, was reported missing. His whereabouts are still unknown. Ukrainian Television delayed broadcasting information about his disappearance. Law enforcement agencies ignored demands by the Rukh and Boychyshyn's family, and were slow to initiate an investigation of the case. The unprecedented disappearance of one of the NRU leaders and all the above mentioned actions have a heavy political tinge and are directly connected with the election race in Ukraine. There are certain influential political circles in our state which actively oppose electing Rukh representatives to the legislature. With the election around the corner, they resort to terror, trying to demoralize the democratic forces and intimidate their supporters, which makes the political situation in Ukraine even more unstable. The Ukrainian Popular Movement reaffirms its resolve to continue fighting for an independent and democratic Ukraine, prosperity of its people, and their social protection in spite of all repressions. In connection with the Boychyshyn case and other incidents, Rukh's Central Command instructed its leader to resume his participation in Supreme Council sessions. The nomenklatura majority in the parliament greeted Chornovil with catcalls and laughter. The electorate put forward Lubomyra Boychyshyn as a candidate for the legislature, who will run in the district of her missing husband. By extending this kind of support to a bedridden woman, Lvov residents displayed their resolve to fight for the electoral victory of pro-reform forces in spite of the flagrant pressure and political terror.
