"We look forward to the beginning of these inspections as soon as possible," said Mike McCurry, spokesman for the State Department, at a regular news briefing. The IAEA, a U.N. organization based in Vienna, announced today that the DPRK has accepted the inspection activities requested by the IAEA in its seven declared nuclear facilities. The inspectors will take certain measures, such as reloading of cameras and changing of seals to facilitate future verification, the IAEA said in a statement. The aim of those inspection activities is to verify that the nuclear material in the facilities has not been diverted since their earlier inspections, the statement said. "It is a necessary step for the IAEA to be able to reassure the international community that there has been no diversion of nuclear material from that facility," McCurry said. The spokesman also said that "satisfactory completion of the inspection at the earliest possible date and resumption of the North-South dialogue on de-nuclearization will pave the way for the next round of U.S.-North Korea talks." A meeting between the U.S. and the DPRK is likely to be held in New York this week, McCurry added.
