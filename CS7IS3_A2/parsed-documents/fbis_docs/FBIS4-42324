Lower Pension"] [Text] Rome -- You are under 61 and nonetheless want to quit work because you have contributed for the necessary number of years. OK, go ahead, but know that you will have a reduced pension. And the earlier you retire before pensionable age, the greater the cut. This is one proposal in the anti-deficit package which the Treasury technicians are studying with a view to the 1995 budget. Other measures under study, largely concentrated on social security, include postponing the revaluation of pensions from November to January and a one percentage point increase in employees' and self-employed persons' contributions. But the package also contains a ceiling on redundancy fund payments and a cut in disability compensation payments to people above a minimum income. With these measures the government wants to run for cover in the fight against the deficit. Even now, next year's deficit, according to the Public Accounting Office's latest estimates, could be pointing toward 180 trillion lire, if we include the 13 trillion for financing the renewal of public contracts and all the unexpected expenditures, not the least of which is the 800 billion in medical taxes to be paid back to taxpayers. Only yesterday National Alliance Secretary Gianfranco Fini stated that the 85,000 lire decree [which recently imposed a 85,000 lire health tax across the board] would have to be allowed to lapse. Overall, the maneuver which the Treasury technicians intend proposing involves at least 35 trillion lire. The aim is to block the 1995 need to 145 trillion. And here the first problem arises, because the initial objective was not 145 but 128 trillion, and it is not clear what the government will do to achieve its target of halting the growth of indebtedness as a proportion of gross domestic product. The second question is how it will succeed in finding these 35 trillion lire. The menu of proposals is still under study, but the Accounting Office has already prepared a list of measures. The heart of the proposals involves drastic surgery of the social security system. The starting point is the INPS' [National Agency for Social Security] need for up to an estimated 84-85 trillion lire next year, not taking into account the Constitutional Court ruling on reversibility pensions for surviving dependents, which could cost the state as much as 8 trillion. In its document, the Accounting Office warns in peremptory tones that "a reform of the pensions system which will achieve a containment of expenses immediately or in the short term and which can safeguard the existing level of benefits is practically impossible." What should be done then? The Treasury technicians are moving along two lines. The first aims at obtaining immediate reductions in expenditures. The suggested measures are essentially three: First, the Accounting Office is suggesting a "ceiling" on ordinary redundancy fund payments in the amount "currently provided for by the extraordinary interventions." It then goes on to propose "unifying contribution rates for the Employees' Pension Fund at 35.50 percent." And finally, it proposes increasing employees' and self-employed persons' contributions by one percentage point. This final point is expected to bring in 3,600 billion lire of additional income. The second line of anti-deficit measures provides for "suitable interventions to confront, structurally and at the financial level, the greater demands of the pensioner sector." As shown earlier, the Treasury technicians are considering postponing "the coming into effect of the pension revaluation from 1 November to 1 January of each year." This would produce cost savings of 1,500 billion lire. The second point of attack consists of retirement pensions in the private sector. The idea is to "reduce the pension amount in proportion to the number of years in which the person takes retirement prior to old age pension age." This measure, if approved, would produce savings of some 600-700 billion a year in the coming year. How would this cut work? Let us take a worker aged 56. Even if he has paid 35 years of contributions, his pension would be cut by 10 percent, by two percentage points for every year he falls short of the present pension age (61 for men).
