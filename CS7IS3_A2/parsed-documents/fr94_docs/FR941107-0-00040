ACTION: Public Land Order. SUMMARY: This order partially revokes the Presidential Proclamation of March 21, 1917, insofar as it affects 375.74 acres of public land withdrawn for classification purposes. The withdrawal is no longer needed, and the revocation is needed to permit disposal of the land. This action will open the land to surface entry and nonmetalliferous mining, unless closed by overlapping withdrawals or temporary segregations of record. The land has been and will remain open to metalliferous mining and mineral leasing. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Mezes, BLM Arizona State Office, P.O. Box 16563, Phoenix, Arizona 85011, 602&hyph;650&hyph;0509. By virtue of the authority vested in the Secretary of the Interior by section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1714 (1988) as amended, it is ordered as follows: 1. The Presidential Proclamation of March 21, 1917, which withdrew land for classification purposes, is hereby revoked insofar as it affects the following described land: Gila and Salt River Meridian T. 1 N., R. 15 E., Sec. 31, lots 1 to 4, inclusive, N1/2NE1/4, and E1/2W1/2. The area described contains 375.74 acres in Gila County. 2. At 10 a.m. on December 7, 1994, the land will be opened to settlement, location, sale, or entry under the public land laws, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record, and the requirements of applicable law. All valid applications received at or prior to 10 a.m. on December 7, 1994, shall be considered as simultaneously filed at that time. Those received thereafter shall be considered in the order of filing. 3. At 10 a.m. on December 7, 1994, the land will be opened to location and entry under the United States nonmetalliferous mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record, and the requirements of applicable law. Appropriation of any of the land described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts. Dated: October 21, 1994. Bob Armstrong, Assistant Secretary of the Interior. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27422; Filed 11&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;32&hyph;P
