This notwithstanding, while viewing that it is difficult to find a breakthrough in South-North economic cooperation for the time being, the business circles seem to take a wait-and-see attitude for the present as before. This is because of the prevailing view that a hasty reaction is a taboo under the circumstances in which a change might occur in the South-North Korean relations at any time as have been thus far. But, on the basis of their judgment that nothing will go amiss in conducting the trade based on the processing-on-commission or an indirect trade through third countries with North Korea, which have been planned to be realized this year, the business circles have decided to study again their plan to conduct trade with North Korea, which they have decided to put into action for the time being. In particular, Lucky Goldstar, Samsung, and Daewoo Groups, which have been more active than any other enterprise in the South-North economic cooperation, have already begun studying the possibility of investing in North Korea after the summit talks are realized, while viewing that there is a higher possibility than ever before that the South-North summit talks will be realized. Lucky Goldstar Group, which has engaged in more trade with North Korea than any other business group in the country, has decided to resume its trade based on the processing-on-commission with North Korea at an early date, which it has so far held back. The group will push for trade based on the processing on commission worth $3.5 million, as it already planned at the beginning of the year. It will ship raw and subsidiary materials worth $200,000, for whose permission it applied to the government on 11 June. Chang Kyong-hwan, manager of the North Korea Team of Lucky Goldstar Corporation stated: "While its wage level is very low, North Korea's level of sewing and simple assembling technique is considerably high. The trade based on the processing-on-commission is very profitable from the viewpoint of an enterprise." Samsung Group has taken a big interest in investing in North Korea's social overhead capital-related facilities, such as repairing and expanding of the facilities at Chongjin Port. The group is going to indirectly help North Korea solve the shortage of consumer goods by building electronics appliances, sweaters, and food stuff factories if circumstances permit, while actively utilizing this as an opportunity to advance into the North. Daewoo Group has a mind to push afresh for the construction of the Nampo Estate--whose idea was discussed when its chairman Kim U-chung visited North Korea--thereby reaching an advantageous ground in an advance into the North ahead of any other business group. The group is going to push for the development of a zinc mine-- which occupies the largest portion in the items imported by the businesses from North Korea--and a joint fishery project at the same time. A project to develop Mt. Kumgang, on which an agreement was reached when Chong Chu-yong, honorary chairman of Hyundai Group, visited North Korea in 1989, has remained in the doldrums as a result that the South-North relations have become tense. But, on the basis of its judgment that in case the South-North summit talks come true, there is the high possibility that such a project will be discussed in earnest, the group has begun reexamining the idea of pushing for the project. Hyundai has been reported to prepare a foothold for its transactions with North Korea through small-scale investments, including the building of a cotton textile plant. Other business groups have also begun reexamining their investment plans which they have delayed putting into force. Sunkyung Group has been interested in establishing sewing and fishery product processing plants; Ssangyong Group in establishing joint-venture footwear, and fishery product processing plants; Kolon Group in a dye processing works; and Kumho Group in building a tire plant. One official concerned of the Federation of Korean Industries said: "Because the South-North economic cooperation issue has so far been too politically subjected to political issues, it has been difficult to push ahead with such projects on a consistent basis. The almost prevailing view of the working-level employees of the business groups is that it is necessary to push for economic cooperation--aside from political questions--so that we may not be outmaneuvered by Japan in terms of an advance into the North."
