Referring to an agreement with the Ukrainian party, he refused to enumerate the issues on which the parties had failed to agree. "We keep our word if we give it. Unfortunately, this cannot be said about some members of the Ukrainian delegation," he remarked mentioning the leakage of information on unsettled issues in Kiev. Commenting on possible introduction of direct presidential rule in Crimea, the diplomat suggested that the Crimean problem could not be solved just by administrative measures. "It is possible to dismiss the Crimean parliament unwilling to cede to the pressure exercised by Kiev and thus to gain political capital before the presidential elections. However, this will not resolve the Crimean problems," the diplomat underlined. He said that the Russian Foreign Ministry and other Russian organizations were receiving more and more letters from Russians living in Ukraine. They were complaining about the arbitrary rule exercised by the local authorities which were carrying out forceful "Ukranization," the diplomat stressed. He said that this was not in conformity with democratic principles and values in fidelity to which Kiev had sworn. In an interview with Interfax a former Soviet human rights' activist, now the head of the department for international humanitarian and cultural cooperation at the Russian Foreign Ministry Vyacheslav Bakhmin has said that the introduction of presidential rule in Crimea can freeze the situation at best, even though that is hardly likely. In his opinion extraordinary regulations will not resolve the problems of Crimea. They should be resolved at the political level through a dialogue and mutual concessions. From a diplomatic point of view Crimea constitutes an internal problem of Ukraine and Russia's active interference would be counter-productive, Bakhmin said. The diplomat believes that the idea of holding a referendum on separation from Ukraine in Crimea has not future. In principle CSCE permits such a possibility, but the example of Karabakh shows how the principle works in real life politics. It works poorly causing much bloodshed. In Bakhmin's opinion the introduction of dual citizenship can hardly resolve all Crimean problems. "Dual citizenship can change the psychological condition of a man but it can hardly influence his actual position, he said. An agreement on dual citizenship implies the principle of effective citizenship, i.e. the citizenship of the country in which the person lives at the moment. The other citizenship "sleeps" meanwhile. It "wakes up" when the person moves to the country of his second citizenship." The diplomat is convinced that problems similar to the Crimean one and related to the rights of nations or big groups of people can be resolved only on the basis of respect for human rights not just the rights of nations. The rights of nations are secondary compared to human rights, Bakhmin stressed.
