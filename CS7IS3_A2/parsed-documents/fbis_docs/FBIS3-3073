Wang Chaoyang, the city's top agricultural official, said that since the new water-saving method was adopted, the average production of the city's 34,700 ha [hectare] of rice farms has increased from 7,500 kg to 9,750 kg per ha. The water consumption for each ha of rice farm has dropped from some 27,000 to 15,000 cubic meters, the official said. What is specially important about the new method, said the official, is that without it, nearly half of the city's rice-growing land would have been simply left wild for lack of water. He said that each year the city has 2.4 million cubic meters of water available for its rice farms, while some four to five million cubic meters would be needed if the new method had not been adopted. Experiments with the new method started in 1989, after a severe drought struck the area in the previous year and caused a large decrease in rice production, Wang recalled. The water-saving method begins with the growing of rice seedlings. They are grown on dry nursery beds, rather than in the water as the old method requires. The official said the new method grows seedlings with stronger roots and also saves labor. There is also a change in the method of raking. Instead of raking after watering, rice fields are now raked while they are dry. The new raking method can save 1,200 cubic meters of water on each ha of rice field. Besides, this makes the soil loose and warm, so that seedlings can grow faster, he said. Another major change is the method of irrigation. Instead of keeping the land in water all the time, watering is done every six days and only after the land has dried up. While saving water, the new method also saves the consumption of electricity and fuel, thus making rice growing more profitable for farmers, the official added.
