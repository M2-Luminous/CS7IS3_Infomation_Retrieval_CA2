His resignation seems to be the result of a series of disagreements with elements of the radical wing of the ruling Alliance for Democracy in Mali [ADEMA]. Djibril Mboj has the details: [Begin Mboj recording] At the beginning of the week, a local newspaper was already wondering whether Abdoulaye Sekou Sow had run out breath. On 12 April 1993, 62-year-old Sekou Sow, who has a raucous voice and a nonchalant gait, was entrusted with the weighty task of getting the country out of the crisis -- the persistent economic crisis -- and more especially the school crisis, which has been almost a permanent fixture in Mali for more than three years and which led to the resignation of the first government of the Third Republic. He very quickly distinguished himself as a man of dialogue who favors consensus. He was able to contain certain excesses and even found compromise solutions. Unfortunately, the demands by schoolchildren and workers continued to be more pressing, especially after the devaluation of the CFA franc. Furthermore, Abdoulaye Sekou Sow is reported to have felt abandoned by his own supporters because the support he expected to get from the majority ADEMA party was not forthcoming. Added to this was the 48-hour strike notice by schoolchildren, who set up roadblocks and burned car tires. All these issues exasperated the affable sexagenarian, who showed courage, abnegation, and the desire to do a good job during the 10 months he spent as head of the government. If his resignation is accepted by the head of state, there will be a cabinet reshuffle, the fourth since Alpha Oumar Konare became president of Mali. [end recording]
