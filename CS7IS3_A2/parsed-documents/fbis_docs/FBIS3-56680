The arrogance of urban teenage louts and losers has taken parliament by storm. The seats in the hall are occupied by standard-issue street riff-raff who have somewhat outgrown the romantic age of hooliganism for its own sake. There are some doubts whether the street "barons" should be represented in the lower chamber of the new parliament. However, the voters, having sent the "delegates of the lower depths" to parliament, have perhaps thereby expressed their attitude to the Russian parliamentary system. Zhirinovskiy's lieutenants, who will act as catalysts in the State Duma, will, as is clear from the behavior of deputies of the extreme left and extreme right "wings" of various parliamentary factions, be augmented by representatives of a moribund caste of the Soviet people. They may be dubbed social constructivists. These deputies, who as a rule are of the age of vague anti-liberal convictions (I stipulate for the last time not anti-liberal as regards the LDPR), inscribe nightly -- until cockcrow -- in grubby, thick exercise books, in their uneven, old woman's hand, global plans for the revamping of Russia. In the blessed times of perestroyka, efforts were made to prevent their getting within firing distance of the USSR. They laid siege to the theoretical and political journals in accordance with all the rules governing the art of war, bent on seeing the fruits of their lucubrations published. They ransacked the classical tomes of Marxism and found there words and expressions unused at party congresses and sought to impart their discoveries to the world. This author, who worked during those years on a sociopolitical journal, would take cowardly refuge in the mazy corridors of the editorial office from the abundant drivel spouted by the transformers of society on the pretext of a "summons from the leadership." The names of certain of my clients now adorn the pages of PRAVDA, to which in better times they were denied access by the militia. Now the social constructivists will try to test out their crazy, hare-brained schemes on the country. Of course, their action won't go beyond empty parliamentary rhetoric, but they will be able to stymie some fruitful work. It is no wonder that the instinct of self-preservation is quite unerringly forcing the representatives of Russia's Choice to fight for leading positions on the financial and economic committees. From the emotional standpoint, the refusal of Russia's Choice representatives to negotiate with the Communists, the agrarians, and the LDPR is understandable. One can understand Russia's Choice's action in human terms, but not politically. The alarm bell tolled too loudly during the elections, and too little time is allocated the liberals to implement their economic program. If the program is to be implemented they have to be real politicians for a while and play the most diverse, sometimes unpleasant, political games with their ideological opponents. Political fastidiousness could cost dear. Is it necessary to beat one's breast and shout in advance that it is impossible to cooperate with the "Communists"? It is not difficult to see (and if the democrats have not noticed this they will always remain a minority in the State Duma) that at the present political stage the extreme left-wingers and extreme right-wingers are still, as it were, getting accustomed to one another again, they are having to work out a new code of relations -- they can no longer play according to the rules of the National Salvation Front of blessed memory. The LDPR plays without rules -- that's why it is a party of the street. The Communists and agrarians by their very nature need rules of the game. And one can and must cooperate with them on particular questions of legislation where there should in principle be no antagonism. Nationalities policy and the protection of the rights of the Russian-speaking population could be such an area of contact -- otherwise the democrats will be unable to seize the initiative here and it will be impossible for anyone to prove that it was Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev rather than Komsomol member Dima Rogozin who really helped the Russians living in the former Soviet Union. Is there any point in frightening oneself yet again? Fear can become chronic if you don't get rid of it promptly and start engaging in normal work and normal politics.
