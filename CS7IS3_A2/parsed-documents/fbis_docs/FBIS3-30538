Apostolovski: "Two Hundred Million Dinars for Reviving Production"] [Text] If we are to believe the words of Momir Pavlicevic, republican minister for industry, at yesterday's meeting with managers of large industrial concerns in Belgrade, Serbian factories can count on some 200 million new dinars (German marks) in "heavy" financial support as early as next week. The meeting was held in the capital's Chamber of Commerce. The minister said that talks between the government, its expert team, and banks were drawing to a close, and that the "plan for reviving production would be finished and ready for implementation" by Monday. The plan envisages establishing a fund, half of which -- 100 million dinars -- would be secured from the banks' foreign currency reserves, while another 50 million would come from the reserves of companies that will have to put it onto the market, Minister Pavlicevic said. The remaining 50 million will be secured from advance payment for the companies' products that are being manufactured. Yesterday, several assessments of the funds needed to revive production in the mainly idle factories were made. Rade Borojevic from the city Chamber [of Commerce] said that 208 million German marks [DM] were needed for this endeavor, and that these funds would be invested in 13 companies. The economy has only 24 percent of these funds. Rade Kolakovic, assistant manager of Beobanka, estimated that during the first three months, some DM500 million should be secured to help 60 companies. He warned that even five or six former Yugoslavias would not be enough to satisfy the industrial and labor capacities, and asked which criteria would be applied in dividing the sweet 200 million cake [as published]. The managers of Belgrade industry agreed on one thing yesterday: Economy and production must be put on the agenda and they must receive the funds. We must have the money by the end of next week in order to revive the production, said IMT [expansion unknown] manager Ljubomir Stevanovic. "Not a single pensioner, policeman, or civil servant (who has received the money) will be buying a tractor or combine harvester, but bread and milk. Why wait, if we get the loans, we should reopen Rekord [not further specified] as well. We also have a shortage of tires. This can be solved by freeing the merchant banks," said Stevanovic [as published]. According to him, the social situation in the factories is highly inflammable, and the workers are exhausted. He said that the majority of Belgrade factories had not even paid out half of the December salaries. In terms of production, we have lost two months, warned Slobodan Maric, manager of the Zemun-based Zmaj plant. Talking about the current problems that the companies face, Milan Samardzic, manager of the Industry of Metal Products from Zemun, said that the net revenue of his factory equaled the electricity bill, and was smaller then the funds needed for the monthly public transport tickets of his workers. He asked who had allowed the GSP [expansion unknown] to reintroduce social policy in companies. In response to the managers' many questions, Minister Pavlicevic stressed that the program's priority task was to create real resources for filling the budget, that is, reviving production. He said that the "budget must be leveled out by May." Last year, 98 percent of money issued into circulation went into the budget. This will not be repeated this year. We shall invest in companies that have a short production cycle, and those that manufacture finished products. In this way we will also revive the associated companies, said the minister. According to him, the price of public utilities will be decreased next week, because the government has calculated that prices are not based on the population's real wages.
