Members of the Cabinet have been meeting in expert groups to prepare their programmatic statement. Our correspondent Michal Tvarozek asked Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik which were the most important areas, especially in the economy, that the government wants to accelerate. [Begin recording] [Moravcik] The most fundamental problem is putting together the economic program. The largest group of experts is working precisely on this program. We will probably have to revise some measures proposed by the previous government in preparing the budget. We will have to revise these measures to make them more realistic. We will have to do everything possible to reach agreement with the international institutions, particularly the IMF and the World Bank. In other areas, the most complicated situation has arisen in health and education. [passage omitted] [Tvarozek] Presumably the first version of the government's program will serve also as a consultative document for, let us say, employers, trade unions, all those who have a say as far as the government's statement is concerned. [Moravcik] Certainly we have to do this. We have to respect the general agreement. The general agreement is for us a very important document, and we would like to have observations of all involved parties when working on the first version of the statement. [Tvarozek] In one hour, you are going to attend the extraordinary session of the government. It is possible that the agenda will center precisely on the conclusions reached by these expert groups. [Moravcik] This session should not deal with specific problems. We will discuss where we stand, what we ought to do next in terms of next week's work, and we will clarify which are the main problems that have arisen when working on these materials. [Tvarozek] Let us assume that the National Council will not agree with your policy statement. What will happen if it is not approved? [Moravcik] I hope it will be approved. [end recording]
