FR941213-2-00003 FR941213-2-00002 [Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;4] Availability of Determination of Nonregulated Status for Virus Resistant Squash AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: We are advising the public of our determination that a genetically engineered, virus resistant yellow crookneck squash line designated ZW&hyph;20 squash is no longer considered a regulated article under our regulations governing the introduction of certain genetically engineered organisms. Our determination is based on our evaluation of data submitted by the Upjohn Company in its petition for a determination of the regulatory status of ZW&hyph;20 squash, an analysis of other scientific data, and our review of comments received from the public regarding the Upjohn petition. This notice also announces the availability of the written determination document and its associated environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact. EFFECTIVE DATES: December 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: The determination, an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, the petition, and all written comments received regarding the petition may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect those documents are requested to call in advance of visiting at (202) 690&hyph;2817. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. James White, Chief, Plants Branch, Biotechnology Permits, BBEP, APHIS, USDA, P.O. Drawer 810, Riverdale, MD 20738. The telephone number for the agency contact will change when agency offices in Hyattsville, MD, move to Riverdale, MD, during January. Telephone: (301) 436&hyph;7612 (Hyattsville); (301) 734&hyph;7612 (Riverdale). To obtain a copy of the Upjohn determination or the accompanying environmental documents, contact Ms. Kay Peterson at (301) 436&hyph;7601 (Hyattsville) or (301) 734&hyph;7601 (Riverdale). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On July 13, 1992, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) received a petition from the Upjohn Company (Upjohn) and its subsidiary, Asgrow Seed Company, of Kalamazoo, MI, seeking a determination that the ZW&hyph;20 virus resistant squash line no longer be considered a regulated article under APHIS' regulations in 7 CFR part 340. On September 4, 1992, APHIS announced the receipt of the Upjohn petition in the Federal Register (57 FR 40632&hyph;40633, Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;1) and announced its intent to issue an interpretive ruling that the ZW&hyph;20 virus resistant squash does not present a plant pest risk and, therefore, would no longer be considered a regulated article. That notice also requested comments on APHIS' proposed interpretive ruling. After considering the 17 comments submitted during the 45-day comment period, of which 7 were in support of the petition and 10 in opposition, APHIS determined that it was in the public interest to reopen the comment period to seek additional comment on several scientific and technical issues raised by the commenters. The commenters expressed concerns in three major areas: (1) Will the introduction of the two viral coat protein genes increase the likelihood of the creation of new plant viruses; (2) could the introduction of two virus resistance genes cause squash to become a weed; and (3) would the virus resistance genes move to wild squash relatives and would this have a detrimental impact on these wild plants? A notice was published in the Federal Register on March 22, 1993 (58 FR 15323, Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;2), to reopen the comment period for an additional 60 days. Twelve comments were received, of which 10 were in support and 2 were in opposition. The same major areas of concern expressed during the first comment period were again reflected in the two comments in opposition to the petition, with the addition of a statement that an environmental impact statement should be prepared in connection with commercial scale growth of the ZW&hyph;20 squash. Since the date of the original submission of Upjohn's petition, APHIS has formalized, under a ``Petition for Determination of Nonregulated Status'' ( See 58 FR 17044&hyph;17059, Docket No. 92&hyph;156&hyph;2), the interpretive ruling procedure that was in place when the original petition for the ZW&hyph;20 squash was submitted. On May 23, 1994, APHIS published a third notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 26619&hyph;26620, Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;3) to announce the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and preliminary finding of no significant impact (FONSI) related to the proposed determination of nonregulated status for the ZW&hyph;20 squash, a public meeting in Washington, DC, on July 21, 1994, and a 45-day comment period ending July 7, 1994. The notice included the text of the preliminary FONSI that had been prepared by APHIS.
