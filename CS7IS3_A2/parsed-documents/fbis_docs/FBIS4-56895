I will read passages of this interview, which was published today on pages 4 and 5. It says that medical control will begin on 16 May in Havana City and that it will gradually be extended throughout the country. The objective is to increase the level of satisfaction as guarantees are strengthened to distribute the medicines the people need; to reduce the number of medicines not readily available; and to systematically prevent the embezzlement, for increased profit which occurs with this type of product. The success of this plan will depend to a large extent on the cooperation and understanding of our doctors, on those responsible for administration, and on pharmaceutical experts. Some provinces that began to develop initiatives in this area have implemented most of the measures adopted in Havana City, with positive results even when experiencing greater shortages than in the capital. One of the first measures seeks to fight speculation and hoarding, in an effort to tighten relations between the community and drug stores. Approximately 30 medicines can therefore be purchased at the drug store nearest the individual's residence by presenting the ration book for identification of the family group. Medicines will not be sold through preestablished quotas, but in an individual manner, based on availability of these medicines. A list of residences will be required, to register all possible consumers. The pharmacies will sell various products such as boric acid, camphorated pomade, aspirin, (pasta lazar), magnesium sulfate, and (citrogal), among others. The links that will be established between family groups and their neighborhood drug stores do not exclude the purchase of prescribed medicines from other pharmacies, taking into account that each doctor or dentist must have his name officially registered in the drug store near his workplace. This means that the health units will also be linked to the neighborhood drug stores where patients will be able to acquire the medications indicated by the emergency service or by consultation. The same goes for those already discharged from the hospital, but who need to continue their treatment. In Havana City especially, pediatric doctors, surgeons, and others will have one intrahospital pharmacy for the purchase of the medications prescribed by the emergency service. The 73 medicines sold today through cards, for the treatment of chronically ill people who require lengthy treatment, will be purchased from special drug stores through the appropriate health field. Current medical prescription models will be changed. The old ones must be presented at the pharmacy, together with the new prescription, to obtain the prescribed medicine. Medical prescriptions for the purchase of antibiotics and other medications will have a time limit. If the medicines are not purchased within that period of time, the validity of the prescription is automatically canceled and will thus require a new medical examination.
