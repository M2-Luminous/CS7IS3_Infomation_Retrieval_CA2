FR940406-2-00004 FR940406-2-00001 C. Implement Group Risk Plan FCIC is implementing a program of insurance that is based on the average yield of an area, not upon individual yield coverage as is offered under the traditional APH program. The area coverage is called the Group Risk Plan (GRP) by FCIC. GRP was introduced as a pilot program for the 1993 crop year for soybeans in 96 counties. It was expanded for the 1994 crop year to include seven additional crops encompassing, 1,872 county crop programs (one crop in one county) in 27 states. Crops now included under GRP are barley (three states), corn (17 states), cotton (seven states), forage (two states), grain sorghum (four states), peanuts (four states), soybeans (24 states), and wheat (eight states). The GRP is intended to protect the insured person against the financial consequences of a disaster that strikes all or nearly all farmers in an area. It sets an expected county yield for each year based on historical yields, adjusted for any trends. Whenever the actual county average yield for the year is less than the expected county yield by a predetermined amount, an indemnity is paid. The principal differences of the GRP compared to traditional individual coverage area: •Coverage is based on a trend projected yield, which probably will exceed the average yield of all farmers insured under individual yield coverage is there is a positive trend in yields for the area. •Higher coverage levels (deductibles are as low as 10 percent) at affordable premium rates can be sold. Thus, in the proper circumstances, GRP will offer risk protection that may be better than the individual coverage, and may do so at a lower cost. GRP has characteristics that make it unsuitable for managing the adverse financial consequences of crop loss in certain circumstances. A farmer's yield each year must change in the same direction and by about the same amount as the county yield if it is to be fully effective coverage for the individual. For example, if the county's yield decreases by 25 percent from the expected yield for that year, the farmer's yield also should decline by about 25 percent from the yield he or she would have expected. In financial market terms, the ``beta'' or the farmer's yields and the county yields should be near 1.00. Adequate data are a limitation to further significant expansion of GRP. The concept as presently developed uses many years (30 or more) of county yields. These data are routinely available only for counties in which the crop has been grown in commercially significant quantities. Weather data and crop growth models may permit expansion into counties in which the historical yield data are not available, but research is needed to develop and test these approaches. Further, acceptance of GRP by bankers as collateral for loans is yet to be determined. Significant expansion of GRP is not anticipated until its contributions to agricultural risk management can be measured. No estimates of savings can be attributed to GRP because customer acceptance is not known. Customer acceptance of the soybean GRP for the 1993 crop year was limited. Fewer than 500 policies (of nearly 700,000 total for the crop insurance program) were sold. Even if the plan improves the actuarial soundness of crop insurance, the present volume of business is not sufficient to make any noticeable difference in program results.
