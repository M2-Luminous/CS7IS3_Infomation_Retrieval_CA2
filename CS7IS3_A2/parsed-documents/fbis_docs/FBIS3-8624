[Kulender] Mr. Delic, the talks concern the principles of military organization in the future federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. What were the concrete decisions reached so far? [Delic] On 11 and 12 March, I had a meeting with General Roso in the Dalmacija villa here in Split, from where I am speaking, in the presence of General Galvin. One of the aims of the meeting was to create conditions for organizing a joint army of the future Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. During a constructive discussion over these past two days we found solutions to all problems linked, above all, to a transitional period. Namely, [word indistinct] was to first fully examine whether the Zagreb agreement of 23 February this year was implemented in its entirety. We came to a conclusion that a great deal has been done and that the work is nearly completed. The aim here was to create conditions for the overcoming of certain problems and the setting up of initially a shared and then a united command of the future federation, in accordance with the constitutional [word indistinct], which are expected to be passed and which will be signed by these three representatives, in our case by Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency. In any case there were not too many controversial issues. Details of this agreement are being prepared. We are expecting to sign it any minute now, after which a joint press conference will be held. [Kulender] What was the general atmosphere during the talks? The information media have been optimistic. [Delic] One should say that the talks, even compared to the Zagreb talks on the cease-fire agreement, were even more constructive and the atmosphere was more relaxed. Every issue was examined from the aspect of the interests of both sides and above all in the interest of the future federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. I can say that, starting with the welcoming ceremony and all the honors bestowed on the representative and commander of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army by the state authorities, i.e., the army of the Republic of Croatia, an atmosphere was created for conducting the talks in the most natural and best possible way and this is exactly what happened. [Kulender] The talks were also attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton's special military envoy, General John Galvin. [Delic] Yes, he was present. His presence was extremely important because he is a man with a rich military experience who made appropriate suggestions regarding the organization and functioning of such an important institution as the army. It is certain that this is a form of guarantee, a fact that gives backing to this agreement to be signed. [Kulender] Mr. Delic, thank you for this conversation. In case we failed to ask you something you would wish to comment on, please go ahead. [Delic] There is not much to add, but it should be said that this agreement covers many issues of vital importance to the army. All these issues certainly cannot be enumerated and commented in such a brief conversation. In any case, my best regards to your listeners, and I could say that we have established the dynamics for the further elaboration of this document because we shall not remain on the present text--we shall elaborate in the near future and come up with concrete solutions that should be implemented in the field as was the case with the implementation of the Zagreb agreement. [Kulender] Thank you, Mr. Delic.
