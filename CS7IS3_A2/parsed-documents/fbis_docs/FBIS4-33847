Gen. Corado offered the Army's cooperation in this regard, although this institution is not responsible for public security. The self-styled Domingo Monterrosa Command this week issued an anonymous message making death threats against several officials, including Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos Mauricio Molina Fonseca. Nationalist Republican Alliance Deputy Carmen Calderon de Escalon also received a death threat on the phone. Corado said that these actions will have to be neutralized so that these threats do not materialize. [Begin recording] [Corado] We condemn actions of this type because they are not compatible with the current political situation in El Salvador. There is now total freedom to demonstrate and participate politically, and, as a result, violence will not be tolerated. Logically, we must take these threats seriously, with the responsibility to prevent them from materializing, because the truth is that these threats harm our country. [Parada] Is the Army willing to help investigate [words indistinct]? [Corado] Yes. We have always said that, although public security is not our main responsibility, we are always in touch with the Public Security Ministry and, previously, with the National Police and National Civilian Police to use our resources to begin joint action with them designed to counter these threats. [Parada] In statements to the media, Corado also referred to the current problems demobilized Army members are facing in the process of reintegration. Corado noted that the process is slow. Consequently, he urged former soldiers to be patient. [Corado] The truth is that the reintegration process is a very long one. We have already said that the political will and the commitment to comply are there. However, former soldiers must be somewhat patient because this is a slow process. For instance, in order to award land, the government must buy, measure, and determine who can settle in those properties. This is a very complicated process that does not occur overnight, but it will be accomplished. There is a moral commitment to former Army members to provide them with all the benefits granted by the agreements, and we have never opposed their receiving these benefits. We must only bear in mind that it is a long process and that they must be patient. [Parada] They insist that over 18,000 demobilized members are entitled to receive compensation. [Corado] All those covered by the legislative decree issued for this purpose will be compensated; that is, those who can prove they meet the requirements will receive the benefits. [end recording]
