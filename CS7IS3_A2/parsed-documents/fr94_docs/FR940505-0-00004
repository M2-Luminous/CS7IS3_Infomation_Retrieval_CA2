FR940505-0-00004 FR940505-0-00001 III. Administrative Statements Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion The NRC has determined that this regulation is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this rule are exempt from the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3518(c)(1)). Regulatory Analysis The EAJA provides that individuals and businesses that meet certain net worth and other requirements and prevail over the NRC in an adversary adjudication in which the NRC's position is not substantially justified may be awarded fees and expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding. Recent events, most notably the NRC's publication of a final rule implementing the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act and actions thereunder, suggest that it is necessary for the NRC to adopt procedures to govern the receipt and determination of applications for EAJA fees. The procedures adopted mirror in important respects the model rule promulgated by the ACUS. The NRC has fulfilled the statutorily mandated process of consultation between the Chairman of the ACUS and the agency with respect to EAJA implementing procedures. See 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(1). The Commission believes that the procedures adopted are preferable to other procedural requirements that might be imposed. The foregoing discussion constitutes the regulatory analysis for this final rule. Regulatory Flexibility Certification In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that if promulgated, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule merely will establish a procedural framework for the submission and determination of applications for fees and expenses incurred in participating in NRC adjudications and will not itself impose significant economic benefits or burdens. Backfit Analysis The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this rule, because these amendments do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 12 Adversary adjudications, Award, Equal Access to Justice Act, Final disposition, Net worth, Party. For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 553, the NRC is adopting a new 10 CFR part 12. 1.
