The Duma members are still in thought. Doctor of Juridical Sciences M. Mityukov, deputy chairman of the State Duma, did not conceal the fact: "I need to ponder it. I am not yet ready to give a response." Gennadiy Burbulis was more candid: "I support the proposal. There is no point holding elections for their own sake. Society needs to develop a good structure over this time." For whom, in fact, is a consensus at the highest levels an advantage? For many. For some, because all the possible nightmares, settling of scores, and squabbles which would inevitably be unleashed with a sudden change of power, recede into hazy oblivion. For others, it gives time to resolve their many personal problems. There is no doubt that the majority of deputies will be privately and publicly in favor of extending their term of office. The only people to be unhappy will be the leaders of parties and movements who have already publicly stated that they will put themselves forward as presidential and parliamentary candidates. Konstantin Borovoy will patently curse. Rutskoy will stigmatize the proposal. Zhirinovskiy will convene another news conference, and Baburin has already come out unequivocally against it: "The deputies are being bought off. The authorities are evading their responsibility."
