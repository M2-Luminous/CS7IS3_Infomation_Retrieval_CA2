Soldiers claim that they found ammunitions in the organization's trucks. Thierry Mauricet, the president of the organization, is worried; he questioned Edouard Balladur when he met him at the Humagora international meeting of those participing in humanitarian actions, which is currently taking place at the Palais des Congres in Paris. Listen to this dialogue between the two men recorded by Pascal Misrai: [Begin recording] [Mauricet] [words indistinct] Premiere Urgence. I am in charge of the issue, and I know that France is exerting pressure to obtain their release, but has not been successful yet. [Balladur] Yes, for the time being. We have received assurances that their lives are not threatened, but we cannot be satisfied with this. France is the most active country in Yugoslavia, and I believe we cannot ask less than respect for those ensuring humanitarian aid. This is the minimum we are demanding. [Mauricet] The current hardening of Serb behavior, the latest detentions of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] blue helmets are worrying me. What do you intend to do? Is it possible to stop the escalation? [Balladur] We hope so, in any case we are attempting to stop it by trying to obtain coherent international action by all large countries. I thank you for what you are doing. Believe me, no one is forgetting the fate of your 11 friends. [end recording]
