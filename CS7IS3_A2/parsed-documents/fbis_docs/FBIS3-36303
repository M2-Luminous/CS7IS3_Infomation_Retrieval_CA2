Ten other agreemnts were also signed. The framework agreement binds the two sides to build relations as friendly nations and not to participate in any blocs or alliances aimed against each other. It also provides for bilateral consultations and appropriate measures if one of the sides' interests or security is threatened. Speaking before flying to Tbilisi, Yeltsin said the question of the Russian parliament ratifying the treaty would be delayed until a comprehensive solution to the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia was found. Opponents of the treaty, many of them Russian deputies, have attacked some of its clauses saying the two sides will sign further agreements to help Georgia set up its own army and supply it with Russian-made weapons, military hardware and technologies. Other agreements signed by Russia's First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets and Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia are on trade and economic cooperation for 1994; free trade; the status of Russian border guards deployed in Georgia; international roadway communications; cooperation in areas of science and technology and communications; regulation of resettlement processes and the protection of resettlers' rights; early warning and elimination of emergency situations; and a protocol on financing Russian border troops deployed in Georgia. Cooperation agreements on cultural links, science and education were signed by Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Aleksandr Chikvaidze. Earlier in the day, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Chief of Staff of the Georgian Defense Ministry Guram Nikolaishvili signed a protocol of intent providing for the establishment of three Russian army bases in Georgia.
