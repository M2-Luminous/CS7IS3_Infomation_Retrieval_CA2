Washington may put higher tariffs on Japanese imports in line with a telecommunications clause of the trade act, said the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who declined to be named. But the steps will eventually hurt U.S. manufacturers, the official said, by preventing their access to Japanese products. The U.S. telecommunications clause allows the government to impose retaliatory tariffs in fields other than telecommunications, such as on autos and auto parts. Higher tariffs on Japanese-made auto components, for example, are more likely to affect the U.S. auto industry, increasing unemployment in the country, he said. Japan will bring the case to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if the U.S. takes retaliatory steps, said the official. Washington has complained that sales in Japan of mobile phones developed by Motorola Inc. of the U.S. have been markedly smaller than those made by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
