Situated on a scenic bank of the River Taedong, the Gold Lane with a floor space of 14,300 square metres is a gymnasium of mass sports and cultural amusement. It has 40 modern bowling alleys, amusement rooms, sauna bathrooms, a restaurant, a shop and other service facilities. It is available for international games. The gymnasium is associated with ardent patriotic devotion of traders and industrialists under the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon). Going round it, President Kim Il-song expressed deep satisfaction over the fact that builders constructed the modern bowling gymnasium splendidly in a short time.
