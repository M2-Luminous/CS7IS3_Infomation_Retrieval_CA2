In the first ballot, parties with links to President Gnassingbe Togolese People's Assembly [Rally] (RPT) won a total of 35 seats while 22 went to the opposition, according to provisional results published by the National Electoral Commission (CEN) in Lome. Still at stake are 24 seats in 12 constituencies which are expected to be closely fought for by the two main opposition parties, the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) of Yao Agboyibor, and the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD) led by Edem Kodjo, a former minister and secretary general of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). A stiff competition is also expected between the RPT and the New Forces Coordination (CFN) of Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh. A head-on collision between parties in the opposition grouping and pro-Eyadema parties is also inevitable in 11 constituencies.
