Since the early moments of the massacre, Jordan -- king and government -- acted in a manner showing that it is the major party concerned with this affairs. The language used by King Husayn indicated that he is the person most directly concerned with what happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque. The Royal Court thus declared a three-day mourning period and his majesty donated 100,000 dinars to the victims of the massacre. The king also immediately instructed the Jordanian delegation in Washington to inform the U.S. Administration of the suspension of the negotiations -- without consulting the PLO. His majesty also received appeals from Hebron residents asking him to come to their rescue. These appeals are a political yardstick showing that Jordan is the party to which the people inside the territories turn in times of hardship. The Jordanian Government, led by Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, has translated the political significance of the steps taken by King Husayn into concrete action. It has asserted, through a show of mourning and by sponsoring licensed demonstrations and marches, that it was deeply affected by what happened in Hebron. For the first time in its history, the Jordanian Government has been the leader in a state of "protest" against what is happening inside the occupied territories. These "panoramic" steps raised controversy among Palestinian community leaders. Some observers even went as far as to say that Jordan has reopened the traditional competition between Amman and the PLO over Palestinian representation. This war of representation did not end with the decision issued by the 1974 Rabat summit, which asserted that the PLO is the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. On many occasions, King Husayn voiced reservations about this decision when it has not facilitated the mission of the Palestinians to acquire their legitimate rights as the Arabs had thought.
