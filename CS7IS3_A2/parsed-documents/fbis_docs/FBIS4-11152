This was announced on Saturday by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to the 215 Cuban emigrants who are participating in "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference. Robaina also mentioned five additional decisions made by the government in an attempt to make more flexible the relations with a large number of emigrants, excluding the sector described as "aggressive." However, participants at the conference who were asked to comment on this today said that the six measures announced by Robaina are not enough. The decisions announced by Robaina are: -- The creation of a special department for emigrants within the Foreign Ministry. -- The lowering, from five to one year, the time between visits of emigrants who left the country "legally" and who wish to return to visit their family. -- The elimination of the order that during the emigrants visit to the country they must stay in a hotel for Cubans residing abroad. -- Allowing a "small" group of Cuban youths who reside abroad to attend the university in Cuba. -- To put out a magazine for emigrants. -- To give continuity to the contact the government resumed with the emigrants through this conference. It was not clear whether among the Cubans who left the country "legally" the government is including those who left the country for a short visit abroad and once there decided to stay. Meanwhile, even though the required five-year term between visits for those who left the country "legally" has been lowered to one year, the request for a visa continues to be obligatory. In the hallways of the Comodoro Hotel where those attending the conference are staying, the comments on the decisions announced was less than enthusiastic. "It is all right...for starters," a businessman with commercial ties to Cuba said. Another participant, who is visiting the island for the first time since 1989, described the decisions as "a little less than nothing." A third participant described the decisions as "candy in the middle of a party that should have better prizes at the end." Attending the conference are well-known Cuban emigrants most of whom reside in the United States and who peacefully and "constructively" oppose the Castro government, and others who openly support the system. In private, several of the opposers expressed their concern regarding an eventual "return with empty hands" to Miami and other U.S. cities where groups of active anti-Castro emigrants have accused them of being "traitors" because they went to Cuba.
