"In the morning, the deputies continued to discuss the situation regarding the implementation of the socioeconomic plan for the first six months of 1994 and the socioeconomic tasks for the last six months of the year. The morning session was directed by National Assembly Vice Chairman Nguyen Ha Phan. "In financial and monetary matters, all those who spoke expressed their concern about the status of budget revenue and expenditure. Some deputies suggested that we should carry on the policy of promoting increased savings among the people by increasing the interest rate for savings accounts and encouraging enterprises to increase production in order to generate new sources of revenue." Many deputies raised the question of how to vigorously shift agricultural production to the manufacture of marketable products. Others called for economic development in mountainous areas. They asked the state to take practical measures in terms of capital, market, and transportation. "In terms of capital construction, many deputies called for a review of the 1994 program for capital construction and those projects which are still left unfinished from past years." Some deputies observed that "the present accounting system in our country is only suited to the subsidy-based economic management system because it does not take into account profits or losses. It must, therefore, be revised to suit the market system." In addition to the observations about improving cultural and artistic activities, "many deputies continued to raise the warning about a failure to resolve several social ills such as opium smoking, drug addiction, prostitution, and about the danger of many video and movie films being illicitly imported and many books dating back from the old regime being reprinted." They also expressed worries about the degradation of public health and the education system and about the shortage of Level-1 and level-2 school teachers and medical personnel for mountainous regions. They pointed out that "It is the desire of the people to see the government strictly maintain law and order, positively carry out thrift, fight corruption and smuggling, and take stern actions against those who take advantage of the renovation policy in enriching themselves illegitimately or working against national order and discipline." This afternoon, the National Assembly continued to work under the direction of Chairman Nong Duc Manh. Various cabinet members answered questions raised by deputies. They included: -- Mr. Do Quoc San, minister of state and head of the State Planning Commission, who answered a question about the implementation of Project 327 on covering bare hills with greenery. -- "Mr. Ho Te, minister of finance, who answered a question about the situation regarding budget revenue and expenditure. He explained various measures aimed at promoting increased revenue during the final months of the year such as guarding against tax collection shortfalls, seeking local and foreign loans, and economizing on spending in order to balance revenue and expenditure." -- "Mr. Hoang Duc Nghi, minister and head of the Nationalities and Mountain Region Committee, who answered questions about the supply of essential commodities to mountain regions, and about the outcome of an opium control program." -- Mr. Nguyen Quang Ha, minister of agriculture, who answered a question about the outcome of the implementation of Prime Minister's Directive 525 and Program 327 on the delivery of forests and forest land [to local peasants for management]. "Tomorrow, the National Assembly will continue work at the Conference Hall."
