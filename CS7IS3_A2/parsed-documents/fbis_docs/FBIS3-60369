The buoy is expected to automatically carry out precise measurements in the middle of the ocean for a period of up to a year at a time, using the spectrophotometry technique. Buoys of this type could eventually form a worldwide ocean-monitoring network, under the aegis of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) programme. Studying levels of carbon dioxide absorption by the oceans is a sine qua non for a serious investigation of the Earth's climate. Atmospheric studies, which show a 25% increase in CO2 concentrations, and the theoretical models which describe absorption of the gas by the oceans do not together fully account for the total estimated volumes of carbon dioxide released into the environment since the start of the Industrial Revolution. The discrepancy in the two sets of figures could well be due to the speed of CO2 absorption into the oceans.
