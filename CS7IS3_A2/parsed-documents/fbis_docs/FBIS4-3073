The Chinese Communist Party's newspaper makes these remarks in commenting on today's rejection of the appeal by Xi Yang, a correspondent of the Hong Kong-based newspaper MING PAO, against a 12-year sentence for spying. Xi was arrested last October and charged with espionage on state banking secrets. His accomplice, Tian Ye, an official of the People's Bank of China, was sentenced to 15 years behind bars. The PEOPLE'S DAILY says: "The punishment of criminals and the protection of the freedom of news coverage are two totally different things," adding: "whoever steals state secrets will get punished." "The Chinese Government protects the freedom of news coverage but not the freedom of stealing state secrets," the newspaper says. If criminals in such cases are not punished severely according to the law, it says, China will suffer great damage in its reform and opening to the outside and in its economic construction. In the past decade, China had always welcomed correspondents from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as well as from foreign countries to do news coverage in China, and offered help for their legitimate reporting, it says. Most correspondents from overseas abide by Chinese law, and only one case, i.e. Xi Yang's case, of spying on state secrets was discovered last year, it says. More than 1,000 Hong Kong reporters came to the mainland to do news reporting last year. The paper labels Tian as "a thief in the family," saying that he cannot be tolerated as he revealed state secrets and caused great damage to the country and the Chinese people. It warns other officials that China's reform and opening to the outside world poses a severe test to their loyalty.
