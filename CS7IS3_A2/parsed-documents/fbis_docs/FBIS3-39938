Speaking on French state radio, Leotard said he personally backed resumption of tests "at the right time," either in 1995, 1996 or 1997. Leotard said that the question of resuming tests would arise only after the presidentials because President Francois Mitterrand, who has exclusive powers to order tests, wanted to stand by a moratorium observed by all the United Nations Security Council members, except China. The defence minister said France's nuclear deterrent would be "perfectly effective until the year 2010" and would not be hurt by the lack of testing. On Wednesday, speaking after publication of a government white paper on defence policy for the next 20 years, Leotard said tests were necessary both to modernise nuclear weapons and to develop a capacity to simulate tests in the laboratory. The aim of simulation is to obviate the need for field tests altogether.
