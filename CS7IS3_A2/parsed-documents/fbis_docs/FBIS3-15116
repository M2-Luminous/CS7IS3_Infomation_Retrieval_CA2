Galaktika and Mayak Radio Stations File a Suit"] [Text] It is an open secret that the LDPR's [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] overwhelming success in the Federal Assembly elections was largely predetermined by Vladimir Zhiriovskiy's clever use of the press, far outracing his competitors in penetrating the electric mass media. The issue of the origin of funds that enabled Mr. Zhirinovskiy's to address his fellow countrymen so often has been discussed at all levels by all persons concerned. New information, however, forces a different approach to the question of the LDPR's hypothetical financial power. Apparently at least part of the LDPR's campaign was financed by counterfeit payment orders issued on behalf of organizations which were not going to contest the elections. On 6 December the LDPR sent payment order 28 for 26 million rubles through Progressbank to the Galaktika radio station, which is the prime contractor of the Ostankino TV and radio company's Publitsist studio, in payment for "LDPR's election campaign transmissions in the Novaya Volna program from 1 December to 12 December 1993." According to Vladimir Lugovinov, general director of the Publitsist studio, the "payment order" was to cover expenses of three hours of air time made available to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to conduct his election campaign. At the same time, a letter came to the Mayak radio station accounts department signed by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy asking to make air time available; somewhat later, payment order 78/93, for 10,719,737 rubles as of 6 December, came from Progressbank. The LPDR leader received 69 minutes of air time. In spite of the "payment orders," no money came to the radio companies' accounts. Their representatives asked Progressbank to explain the delay in the money transfer. On 24 January V.G. Znayko, chairman of Progressbank's governing board, said that payment orders 28 of 1 December 1993 and 78/93 of the same date were not found among the bank's documents. Radio company representatives tried to contact the LDPR's member who conducted talks on allocating air time available to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. No coherent answer was received. The victim organizations intend to go to court.
