Washington Unhappy Over Plans To Restore Armenian Atomic Electric Power Station"] [Excerpts] Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan received U.S. Ambassador to Yerevan Harry Gilmore the other day. A laconic official communique to this effect said that the sides discussed a number of problems of an economic nature, including questions related to deliveries to the republic of American humanitarian aid in the shape of seed grain, and the resumed startup of the Armenian nuclear electric power station [AES]. These problems are of paramount importance for the republic's life while their solution is running into considerable difficulties. Back on 21 March, THE NEW YORK TIMES accused Russia of the fact that Moscow was to blame for the delay in bringing to Armenia nearly 2,000 tonnes of seed grain, the funds to buy which had been provided to Yerevan by the United States. Under an American-Russian agreement signed two years ago, humanitarian freight transit is not subject to customs duties; this time, however, Russian customs demanded the payment of 30 percent of the freight's cost, or $750,000 in customs duties. Moscow seems to be ready to move the grain from Saratov where it is stuck, but the customs structures remain stubborn -- while neither the United States nor Armenia intend to bow to their demand because this would create the dangerous precedent of turning a humanitarian action into a routine trade deal. Incidentally, the grain was bought by Armenia with American money in Russia which in itself has made the Russian side a considerable profit, and its stubborn desire to get additional dividends appears as not very seemly, to put it mildly. Some local analysts suppose in this connection that Russia is thus trying to put political pressure on Yerevan and Washington. Whether this is the case is hard to say but Congressman Richard Lehman, a Democrat, has already put a bill before the House of Representatives under which the United States is to cut all aid to countries obstructing the delivery of American humanitarian aid to its destination. [passage omitted] While Washington is trying to give Yerevan the necessary help in grain supplies, the American side's attitude to the Armenian Government's intention to revive the AES is directly the opposite. Ambassador Gilmore told Prime Minister Bagratyan that in the United States there are many opponents of restarting the station. According to the ambassador, their stance is explained both by not knowing the real energy supply situation in the republic, and the fears that the Armenian side may not be able to ensure the reliable physical protection for the facility. This apparently means that the men in Washington do not intend to help finance the restoration work. In the meantime, according to specialists' estimates, the latter would cost $70 million, signifying that the project cannot do without foreign aid anyway. Under the recently signed Armenian-Russian treaty, Moscow will help Yerevan restore the AES, but this assistance will be mainly of a technical nature. It is up to the republic's government to solve the main questions of financing. It is with this objective that Sepuh Tashdzhyan, the state minister in charge of the power engineering sphere, has gone on a foreign tour to visit England and Italy. There is a hope that people in Europe will treat Armenia's request with understanding. Tashdzhyan will also visit the United States where he, as an American citizen and specialist in the field of oil and gas production, has many connections in corresponding circles. Whereas the Americans would hardly give money for the restoration of the AES, in the United States it would in all likelihood still be possible to get funds for the program of prospecting for oil and gas fields in Armenia. Indeed, if commercial deposits of oil and gas are discovered, this would spur the movement against restarting the AES in the republic and alter the authorities' intentions in this question.
