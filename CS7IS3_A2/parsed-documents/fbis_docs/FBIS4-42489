Yet, what is certain is that they will not be the last ones who -- whether guilty or not -- will be put on the "list." A list in the Interior Ministry that is getting longer and longer. The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] is sending an officer to Vienna once every two to three months. In his luggage, this man has the most recent names or, in some cases, only bits and pieces of information of people suspected of having served the Stasi as informers in Austria. This is where the Austrian State Protection officers come in. They have to clarify whether the suspects deliberately supplied an foreign power with information, maybe even in return for cash. Or, whether they were simply tricked by a professional agent, made friends with him, and unwittingly passed on information in a friendly conversation in a bar or restaurant. Yet, a high-ranking State Protection officer has said that things might be even worse: "We know of cases of unsuspecting citizens who were even put on the Stasi payroll. This could happen when agents who are under pressure to provide results simply embellished their reports to headquarters about their private meeting with people in bars and restaurants -- and put the rewards for the alleged hot `source' in their own pocket."
