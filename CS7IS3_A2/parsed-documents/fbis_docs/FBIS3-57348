Constantin Gamsakhurdia, son of the former Georgian president who died in early January in as yet unexplained circumstances, does not mince his words: In his opinion, his father, whom he does not suspect of having committed suicide, was the victim of a conspiracy. Passing through Paris, he affirmed to us: "It is a typically Communist method to cast doubts on the circumstances of my father's death and on his death itself: Information is filtered to soothe emotions. If the Georgian population had immediately been informed about my father's death, it would have come out into the streets to display its grief. Constantin Gamsakhurdia agrees with the idea, put forward by his mother and endorsed by Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, for an international commission to investigate Zviad Gamsakhurdia's death, but he thinks it will be difficult to find witnesses: "Those who know how my father died are partisans. What will be done to them after they give their testimony?"
