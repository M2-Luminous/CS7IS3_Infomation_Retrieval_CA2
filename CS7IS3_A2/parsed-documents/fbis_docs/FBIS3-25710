This is the first concrete result of peace talks, which began on Tuesday [22 February] in Bangui in the Central African Republic. Talks are continuing today. The rebel movement, the National Awakening Committee for Peace and Democracy [Comite de Sursaut National pour la Paix et la Democratie -- CSNPD] is calling for a referendum on setting up a federal state in Chad. Moise Kette explained the request: [Begin Kette recording] We will be examining the second condition, relating to the organization of a referendum on the form of the state. The unitary state has exacerbated the tensions between the different communities to such an extent that we feel that, in order to preserve the very unity of Chad, it has become important to reconsider the form of the state. If the people vote, the CSNPD will respect their verdict. We are not going to impose federalism by decree, but we think that the people are sovereign and that they have to be consulted. If we do this, it is in the interest of the Chadian people. Some people think that federalism means secession. Far from it, we see it rather as a form of management; we have to try to adapt, the least we can do is to try. If, in the long term, we find that federalism is not appropriate, then we can return to the unitary model. [end recording]
