Why did you pursue such an agreement? [Sanguinetti] First, we felt the country may have become entrapped in an ironclad option between an already obsolete neo-conservative concept and a populist concept of the collective type which could push the country backwards. We felt the pressing need to propose another option, an option that in Uruguay has traditionally been called Battlism and in other countries social democracy or social liberalism. The only way to save the country from having to decide between those dangerous options -- and when I say dangerous I am not talking about people but about the consequences of their ideas -- was to offer the country the option Uruguayans really want, that is, a market economy as free as possible with the state orientating and compensating. We felt the PGP was very close to these ideas. Second, we felt our two movements were merely returning to our common roots. I entered the political field in 1953, when I was 17, together with Selmar Michelini and Manuel Flores Mora [reference unknown]. Batlla was already in politics at that time. Third, we considered it essential to try to put together a coalition capable of governing. That decision meant we needed to unite with other groups. We went out looking for our old friends and possible associates to embark together in this beautiful enterprise of forming a new government to welcome the beginning of the new century. Fourth, we felt then -- just as we feel today -- that the election is not yet decided in Uruguay, or in Brazil, because the idea of the demise of world Marxism has yet to percolate down to the local parties that follow that ideology. They are against history, but they are a reality nonetheless. Fifth, we considered it essential to show to the country that we had the capacity to unite, to agree. We wanted to stop the endless political stories of divisions, splits, or attacks. We want change. We want to face the challenge of involving most Uruguayans in the belief that it is possible to improve our standards of living and our democratic coexistence day by day, without haste, without pause, and without hypocritical or destructive urgency. [passage omitted] [BUSQUEDA] What are, in your opinion, our national priorities? [Sanguinetti] Without defining which points are more important than others, we think it is essential to implement an education reform to review the content of our education and to prepare our youngsters for life in a more technical world. Uruguay's future competitiveness depends on what we do now in that field. It is also very important to recover our exporting capacity in order to sustain genuine growth. Improvements in this area depend on improved competitiveness. We must propose a scheme of harmonious development and avoid having to choose between the false options of either production or services. I recall in the past, we were confronted with the false dilemma between agricultural or industrial development. It the area of social development it is essential to implement integration policies aimed at reducing inequalities and marginalization. We must reform the social security system with the double purpose of assuring pensioners who live in continuous insecurity and creating a more just and lest expensive system. These four priorities are conditioned to the insertion of the country into the international and regional markets. [BUSQUEDA] How do you see the issue of social security reform? [Sanguinetti] For some years demographic trends have shown that today we are living longer and better, which is excellent and welcomed. But this, naturally, affects the social security system, which has become a real burden on our economy. During my administration we had two unsuccessful reform bills. During this administration, one reform attempt failed and another was partially successful and was included in the 1992 budget. There were other efforts to modify the Constitution to include the indexation concept, which was financed with the fiscal adjustment for which we all voted. But we cannot continue to discuss the issue forever. Pensioners deserve tranquility. We must be able to tell them the debate has ended because the system's future has been consolidated. Workers should have the option of joining public or private systems, as in other countries. The state cannot just look the other way. We will not advance by believing the problem will be solved by adjusting collection rates and reducing evasion. These are important factors but they are not enough. We can continue the very unfair system of ceilings. Naturally, a reform of this type requires political and social maturity, a serene discussion, without verbal terrorism, and without populist complexes. [BUSQUEDA] Is this part of the social pact that you propose? [Sanguinetti] It could be a very significant part of it. I, however, think a social pact should go beyond this topic. We must avoid sterile and tiring confrontations among workers, managers, and the state. We must agree and progress past the points that have been agreed everywhere else in the world. [BUSQUEDA] What for instance? [Sanguinetti] On increased productivity, for example, which is essential if we are to continue to maintain our companies and the country's competitiveness. Without it, we would be risking jobs, not just our salaries. This does not mean we will condition everything to productivity, but we cannot ignore the concept. [BUSQUEDA] Broad Front candidate Tavare Vazquez dismissed your proposal of a "social pact" as an attempt to silence the workers. What is you opinion on the matter? [Sanguinetti] We regret it. He says it is time to confront, respectfully, but confront nonetheless. He insists that we should not have state policies. I really regret that. I do not know if Vazquez made this statement during a discussion with his fellow party member Danilo Astori, who proposed something similar, or if he is arguing with us. The conclusion, however, is the same and it is very discouraging. The culture of confrontation has only produced problems for the country and losses for the workers. The workers can improve their situation with prosperity, and prosperity requires peace and investments. [BUSQUEDA] It is said -- inside and outside the government -- that the trade deficit is not important, that what counts is the surplus in the balance of payments. What is your opinion of this? [Sanguinetti] During the previous administration exports grew by more than 70 percent, since when levels have remained unchanged. The previous administration pursued an outward-looking model, whereas this administration follows an inward-looking policy. A country may have a trade deficit for a few years, but it is impossible to sustain this situation forever. A country must export to maintain its capacity to import. To believe we can continue to import indefinitely without increasing our exports would lead us to a most risky situation. We already saw this during the times of the "Exchange Rate Table" in Uruguay and Argentina back in 1981 and 1982. We therefore have experience of this. I consider the following essential: Does anyone believe the ability to import is not linked to the ability to export? We want an open system that promotes imports, but this in turn means fostering exports. If not it will be unsustainable over time. [BUSQUEDA] Do you believe this situation will end in a major devaluation like it did in 1982? [Sanguinetti] One must be very mindful of verbal terrorism. Yet those who placed the country in jeopardy should provide you with the answer. These are the same experts who categorically denied there was an exchange lag last year and now they talk about it as if it were the most natural thing in the world. They say, of course, that it is unimportant. In the past, it was nonexistent and now it is unimportant. This is a totally arbitrary answer because they contend that it can be sustained indefinitely without proving how. To explain why reserves are high is a logical contradiction, it is tantamount to begging the question. We already know reserves are plentiful, the important thing is to prevent them from disappearing if the government loses credibility. [BUSQUEDA] The thing is that for the time being there is no pressure on the dollar.... [Sanguinetti] ...Thank God.... [BUSQUEDA] ...and another fact is that the trade balance only measures goods rather than other exports like tourism. Do you take this fact into account? [Sanguinetti] Of course, but those have always been taken into account. That is nothing new. The main thing is that the balance of payments, as a whole, is already registering problems. It is common knowledge that the inflow of foreign capital, which was prompted by the decline in interest rates in the United States, has been checked following their upturn. This is the very fundamental difference between the balance of trade and the balance of payments. Goods cannot be created overnight. Businesses require time and organization. Capital can be invested and withdrawn from financial placements in a matter of seconds; it is very volatile. The wind changes direction and it is gone. It is not I who says so -- I am not an expert -- Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo has brought attention to this issue with great concern. [passage omitted] [BUSQUEDA] What do you intend to do to come to grips with the "exchange lag" about which exporters complain? Will you devalue the peso, increase tariffs, or implement tax refunds? [Sanguinetti] One cannot view the issue in black and white; either a "major devaluation" or "no devaluation at all." The exchange rate policy, the tariff policy, and the policy on tax refunds are three elements; there are others that can be combined with them. The most important thing is to try to recover competitiveness. This is my overriding concern for the future. How will this be achieved? This is what we will have to see at the appropriate time. Here the presence of experts is fundamental. One cannot address the issue of the recovery of our competitiveness by implementing an isolated measure -- not even a major devaluation will achieve this objective if it sparks a spiral of rising wages and prices. [BUSQUEDA] In short, what will your exchange rate policy be like? [Sanguinetti] It will be basically realistic. This will be the fundamental parameter. The exchange rate cannot be used to excess for political reasons. Every time we did that over the last 40 or 50 years the result was not positive. [BUSQUEDA] If you governed now, would you devalue the peso? [Sanguinetti] That is a question that should be exclusively and strictly put to he who steers the economic policy. [BUSQUEDA] And how about March 1995? [Sanguinetti] Nobody can in all seriousness speak about that nine months in advance. That decision depends on fundamental international factors, interest rates, neighboring countries, many things. Nobody can in all seriousness anticipate what will happen.The terrible thing is that the colossal inflation in dollars that we have has caused everybody to talk about this issue. This reveals a very important shortcoming in the current policy. [BUSQUEDA] Your economic team includes, among others, well-known members of the economic team of your presidency: Ricardo Zerbino, Ariel Davrieux, Ricardo Pascale, and Luis Mosca, for example. If you win the elections, will you use that same team as of 1995? [Sanguinetti] In the council, without a doubt, because they have been advising the party on these important matters without interruption since 1993. The disposition of the teams will depend on the circumstances at that time. Younger people who have emerged must also be heard. People from the PGP, for example, are very valuable and will surely have interesting contributions. [passage omitted] [BUSQUEDA] You have said the Broad Front is your adversary, which provoked a rebuke from the National Party because it seems you will exclude them from the election confrontation. What can you say about this? [Sanguinetti] Regrettably this is the sum of incomplete information plus inexact interpretations. We respect everyone equally and insist that the election has not yet been defined. For about two years now the Broad Front has led the polls without interruption in Montevideo, with the Colorado Party closing every day and the National Party continuing to drop behind. In other words, fair or not, the Colorado Party is the only party in a position to defeat the Broad Front. Things may change tomorrow, but this is how matters are, and have been for some time now. At the national level matters are not the same, but nobody can dispute the fact that the Colorado Party is the only organization with a chance of defeating the Broad Front. This is a dispassionate and measurable fact. [passage omitted] [BUSQUEDA] It seems you are making Tabare Vazquez, the Broad Front candidate, out as "dangerous." Is that so? [Sanguinetti] In no way.I really respect him. He had not occupied an important public post and yet he won the Montevideo mayoral elections and maintains his popularity. He is an extraordinary man. He merits all my respect as a veteran politician who knows how difficult it can be. I disagree with many of his ideas and I disagree with the Broad Front as a political party. But that is normal in the democratic debate. I greatly respect and have a lot of affection for [Broad Front Leader] General Liber Seregni, but this does not mean that I cannot continue to disagree with the Broad Front. [BUSQUEDA] But you gave more importance to the confrontation with Mayor Vazquez: When he spoke of establishing a "collectivist" society, you criticized him very harshly.... [Sanguinetti] ...it is generally said that all ideas are respectable, but this is not so. Individuals rather than ideas should be respected. There are loathsome ideas like racism, which must be combated. There are despicable ideas like collectivism, which advocates the abolition of private property. Thus my considered opinion is that one must fight against it. [BUSQUEDA] You have one dispute with the Broad Front and another with the current administration, which cropped up recently, during the election campaign. Government officials have compared the economic results under your administration with the present economic achievements and conclude that they fared better than you. What do you have to say about that? [Sanguinetti] I neither encouraged that comparison nor think it is relevant because the important thing is the future. Yet if one wants to look at objective economic indicators--as government officials claim to do--we have a clear conscience. During the four years 1985 to 1989, the GDP grew by 20.7 percent whereas during four years under a Blanco Party administration the GDP grew by 13 percent. While this is not bad, it is much less than under our administration. Exports in dollar and volume terms rose by 73 percent during my administration while now they are stagnant. This is a most serious situation because it has led to an all-time record defcit of $700 million annually. This proves the driving force behind the country's economic growth, namely the modern sector that exports and purchases technology, has ground to a halt. Salaries -- something basic -- increased by 30 percent in real terms under the previous administration. I repeat -- in real terms. I am not speaking in dollar terms as is done now. We are all aware that this is misleading when there is a 20-percent annual dollar inflation. During President Luis Alberto Lacalle's tenure, salaries have risen by just 3 percent in real terms. This is a very significant difference, which shows the fundamental contrast between adjustment with growth -- as done during the previous administration -- and a merely financial adjustment as is done now. I think that these are overwhelming figures, which by the way are all official. [passage omitted] [BUSQUEDA] Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas has said that you are telling "lies," that you are engaged in "cheap demagogy." Have you any comments on that? [Sanguinetti] I would like to believe that it was just said in a fit of temper. [passage omitted] [BUSQUEDA] Another subject that led to estrangement between you and the current administration is the policy on the Armed Forces. President Lacalle has hinted that not "everybody" helped when he faced problems in this area, obviously alluding to you. What is your opinion of it? [Sanguinetti] I acknowledge, much to my sorrow, that we had a difference of opinion on that issue. This should never have happened. Unfortunately, our differences began during the period between the two administrations when the president wanted to appoint a Navy commander in chief who did not have the rank of rear admiral, but was a ship-of-the-line captain. He completely overlooked the four rear admirals on active service. I am not crazy about the criterion of appointing the most senior in military matters. He could have chosen the first, the second, or the fourth, but he should not have outflanked them all, especially when it was obvious he was trying to nominate somebody very close him politically. That was the starting-point of our differences. We never wanted to make them public until they went beyond what was reasonable. As a result of the interpellation proposed by United Batlleism Senator Carlos Cigliutti, the Defense Minister Mariano Brito fell as he acknowledged that a general had engaged in telephone espionage in a case involving his colleagues. These events did not entail a confrontation between the military and civilian powers, but rather infighting within the Armed Forces sparked by those whom this administration favored with a post within the government. Moreover, the one responsible for this espionage, General Mario Aguerrondo, presently enjoys a remunerative job -- paid in dollars -- abroad. This has caused great damage to the general climate within the Army. It is really most regrettable and I hope we will be able to overcome it. [BUSQUEDA] Do you not believe the situation improved with the appointment of [Army] Commander in Chief Daniel Garcia? [Sanguinetti] I take his good intention and honest purposes for granted. Unfortunately, his methods have sometimes led to internal debates and questioning. This is not good because the Armed Forces need unity and we should all help to promote this unity. We will never build anything by fanning the flames of controversy. The reason for our success in the transition period was to a large extent that we always strived for unity and professionalism. [BUSQUEDA] The Batllist Forum has said that during this administration the Armed Forces have been "stripped of their professionalism" and "made to become partisan." If you won the elections what would you do to revert this situation? [Sanguinetti] Our administration is a good example of how it ought to be done. The first general I had to promote was General [Juan M.] Rebollo, the son of a Blanco Party minister, and one of the last was Lieutenant General Garcia, when nobody expected this promotion. We decided on it simply by rigorously analyzing his professional merits. Any government that seeks to preserve the Army's unity will act the same way. [BUSQUEDA] Do you feel hostility towards the president? [Sanguinetti] By no means. Dr. Lacalle is the president of the Republic and I have no right to feel hostility toward him. We may have some differences of opinion, but I have had -- and will always have -- the greatest of respect for him both as a person and on account of the high post he holds.
