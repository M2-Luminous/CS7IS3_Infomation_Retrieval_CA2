FR940830-1-00073 FR940830-1-00012 NASS and FARS data from 1988&hyph;1992 were utilized for this report. Based on an analysis of those data, the report estimated that each year there are 147 fatalities in which occupants are ejected through rear hatches, tailgates and other back doors. The data also showed that approximately 95 percent of the victims were not secured by seat belts and that approximately 10 percent of those victims were children under 10 years of age. In towaway crashes, rollovers accounted for 35 percent of left front door openings, 40 percent of right front door openings, and 42 percent of back door openings. Also, the data showed that the most common damage associated with door openings was damage to the latch and striker assemblies. This was true for 60 percent of opened left front doors, 50 percent of opened right front doors, and 71 percent of opened back doors. Three comments were received in response to NHTSA's January 1994 notice. The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA) stated that the report showed a low rate of passenger ejection through back doors, and contended that the data again demonstrate that the most effective means of preventing back door ejections is through the proper use of safety belts. AAMA encouraged NHTSA's efforts in promoting the use of safety belts. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) agreed that a high percentage of vehicle ejections occur because of lack of use or improper use of safety belts. Nevertheless, Advocates believes that back doors are opening at an unacceptable rate. To address this problem, Advocates suggested that NHTSA should take multiple actions. That organization stated that NHTSA should look at the fundamental character of latch/striker designs in addition to increasing latch/striker strength. Further, Advocates stated that NHTSA should address the current roof strength and side impact standards as they relate to latch/striker integrity. Finally, Advocates stated that because rear seat belts in some vehicles are insufficient to assure ready availability to occupants, NHTSA should address that issue as well as evaluate how rear seats themselves are attached in MPVs. A comment was also submitted by Mr. Nicholas Perrone of Perrone Forensic Consulting, Inc., and Mssrs. Clarence Ditlow and Ray Gold of the Center for Auto Safety. They stated that the sum of injuries and fatalities from back door ejections would approach 1,000 per year. They attached two case studies of back door ejections. These commenters suggested that the Standard No. 206 test be changed, that the standard be extended to back doors, that laminated glass should be used for all fixed windows, that side and roof strength for vehicles with high centers of gravity should be improved, and that back door structures have dynamic integrity.
