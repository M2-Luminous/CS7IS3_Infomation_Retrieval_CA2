A Foreign Ministry statement called on the international community, represented by the Security Council, to act quickly to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia to enable this nation, which is being subjected to brutal aggression from many sources that have more manpower and armaments, to defend itself according to its right under the UN charter and international law. As part of Egypt's efforts to prompt the international community to recognize its moral responsibilities and halt this brutal series of massacres in which scores of Muslim civilians die every day, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa held telephone contacts with the UN secretary general, a number of foreign ministers from OAU and European Union countries, and the United States to discuss ways of confronting this hostile escalation against the Bosnian people. Proceeding from its moral obligation to stand by the Bosnian Muslim nation in its struggle against the forces of oppression and evil that aim to destroy it, Egypt urged the international community to reconsider the policies adopted to deal with the continuing aggression against the Bosnian people. These heinous massacres perpetrated by the Serb and Croat butchers all over Bosnia and this continuous and escalated bombardment of the nation, the arming of which is banned by international community resolutions and that has been robbed of its legitimate right to self-defense, confirmed the failure of these policies. Furthermore, these acts provide evidence that the talks held in a number of European capitals to find a solution to this tragedy have been a waste of time and will not make the international community support the Bosnian nation in the sovereignty of its territories and its right to life in peace and security. We say once again that the human conscience is urged to act swiftly to save the Bosnian nation from the Serb and Croat massacres and the inaction of most of the world's governments that are contended with watching the violation of all ethical and human values in Bosnia. Human conscience is also urged to watch how the Serb and Croat butchers flagrantly challenge Security Council resolutions. The latest brutal rocket shelling of Sarajevo came a few hours after the Security Council's strongly worded statement threatening economic sanctions against Croatia unless it withdraws its forces and military ammunition from central and south Bosnia within two weeks. It is the practical, military response of Serb and Croat murderers to the Security Council statement that called for respecting Bosnia's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity as a member state of the United Nations and that warned against acts of ethnic cleansing against civilians in that country. It is a response full of arrogance, haughtiness, and disdain for UN resolutions. Human history stresses the need to confront such expansionist, hostile ambitions against nations and to act quickly to contain these racist conflicts. If the Bosnian nation's fate is to suffer these brutal massacres while the world debates how to end this tragedy, the least that can be done is for the Security Council to move swiftly to lift the arms embargo so that the Bosnian nation, in accordance with its legitimate right to self-defense, can defend its land, honor, and right to a free and dignified life.
