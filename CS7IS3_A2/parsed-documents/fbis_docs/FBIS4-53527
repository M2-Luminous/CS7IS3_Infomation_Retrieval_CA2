FBIS4-53527 "dreas098_c_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 17 May 1994 North Korea SKNDF Denounces Japan's Possession of Plutonium SKNDF Denounces Japan's Possession of Plutonium SK2005002594 (Clandestine) Voice of National Salvation in Korean to South Korea 0300 GMT 17 May 94 SK2005002594 (Clandestine) Voice of National Salvation Korean BFN [Text] The South Korea National Democratic Front [SKNDF] Central Committee issued on 14 May a statement concerning the discovery of 70 kilograms of plutonium, which is enough to manufacture nine nuclear bombs, at a plutonium plant in Japan. The full text of the statement is as follows: Seventy kilograms of plutonium, enough for manufacturing nine nuclear bombs, has recently been discovered in Japan's plutonium plant for developing [words indistinct] nuclear fuel. All countries of the world as well as the international community are now greatly concerned about and angry with the detection of the large amount of plutonium warding off international surveillance in Japan that claims to be a model in accepting so-called international nuclear inspections. The discovery of as much as 70 kilograms of plutonium is vivid proof showing that Japan has secretly produced and stockpiled a huge amount of plutonium while accelerating its nuclear armament under the cloak of peaceful nuclear development, and has actually used the accumulated plutonium for military purposes. At the same time, it clearly proves that the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] surveillance system is, in nature, not aimed at the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, but no more than a means of pressure and aggression that enables nuclear states, including the United States, to realize their ambition to dominate nonnuclear states. In order to turn the attention of Asia and the rest of the countries concerned about Japan's nuclear armament to North Korea, the Japanese authorities are playing the role of shock brigade drumming up the United States' anti-North Korea nuclear commotion. They are accelerating their full-fledged nuclear armament behind the curtain of the (?commotion) over the so-called suspicion of North Korea's nuclear development. In fact, there have been open attempts in Japan to politicize and legalize Japan's nuclear armament while opposing and distorting the peace law that prohibits the possession of nuclear weapons. Even absurd remarks stressing the unnecessariness of the three principles for denuclearization are heard. Japan began the full-fledged development of nuclear weapons in the 1950s and has now become an unquestionable nuclear power [myongsil sangbuhan heak taeguk] with fissionable nuclear materials, the technology for manufacturing them, and the means of nuclear transportation. Japan has strongly pushed ahead with the ambitious plan to secure highly-condensed uranium and plutonium and has accumulated 26 tonnes of plutonium. The amount of plutonium stockpiled by Japan will reach some 100 tonnes in the early 21st century. Japan is now building a nuclear waste reprocessing plant to extract plutonium from the enormous amount of spent nuclear fuel used by 38 reactors being in operation at the Nikaimura nuclear complex. The plant, which will be completed soon, will produce eight tonnes of plutonium a year. This means that Japan will obtain enough plutonium to manufacture more than 1,000 [word indistinct] nuclear bombs a day. Japan's ambition to secure a huge amount of plutonium is well shown by the fact that it abruptly began in April to operate Monju, a fast-breeding reactor installed in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, running counter to the worldwide trend of opposing fast-breeding reactors. In addition, Japan succeeded in the test firing of the homemade long-range No. 1 F-2 Rocket early this year to pave the way for its possession of strategic nuclear missiles. Japan's nuclear armament and its attempt to become a nuclear power belong to today's reality, not to tomorrow's [word indistinct]. The discovery of the concealed 70 kilograms of plutonium is indeed a proof of Japan's frenzy in nuclear development. The SKNDF Central Committee sternly punishes and denounces, along with the peace-loving popular masses of the world, the Japanese authorities' maneuver to produce, stockpile, and secretly bring in the awful nuclear weapons that will drop on our nation and mankind, with the tacit permission from the United States and the IAEA. At the same time, in the name of the nation, the SKNDF Central Committee sternly protests the nation-selling Kim Yong-sam group that is pushing ahead with its full-pledged nuclear weapon development in collusion with the Japanese reactionary authorities, behind the curtain of the U.S. anti-North Korea nuclear commotion to destroy North Korea, where the fellow countrymen live. The Japanese nuclear armament (?threatens) peace in Asia and the world. Japan's maneuver to become a nuclear power is increasing the nuclear war danger on the Korean peninsula. Despite these facts, the United States and the IAEA are maneuvering to pressure North Korea by fabricating and amplifying the suspicion over the fictitious nuclear development of North Korea, while ignoring Japan's nuclear armament, whose true nature has been revealed. This is a significant infringement upon the international justice, peace, and impartiality. We expect that governments, political parties, and organizations of countries in the world as well as international organizations, which love justice and peace and pursue common prosperity and development, will deter Japan's ambition of nuclear armament and will even more broadly organize and round off the struggle to establish a new order for controlling nuclear development based on international impartiality. The SKNDF will continue to strongly wage the antiwar and antinuclear peace movement to cope with Japan's nuclear armament maneuver that threatens the Korean peninsula, Asia, and (?the whole world) and with the anti-North Korea nuclear commotion by the United States and international reactionary forces [kukche pandong seryok] aimed at making the Korean peninsula the victim of a nuclear war.
