General Kat Liebenberg stated yesterday in Pretoria that the Defense Forces are apolitical and do not belong to either the National Party, the Conservative Party or any other party or movement. During a spectacular parade at Voortrekkerhoogte of a brigade of soldiers belonging to the four separate Defense Force services, with several overflights, parachute jumps and a canon salute, Gen. Liebenberg handed over the command of the South African Defense Forces (SADF) to Lieutenant General Georg Meiring. "The structure and culture of the Defense Forces do not allow for such dissension," said Gen. Liebenberg. The parade was attended by, among others, General Constand Viljoen, a former head of the Defense Forces and currently one of the leaders of the Afrikaner National Front (AVF). Yesterday, the AVF called on its supporters to fight to achieve self-determination. Following the parade, Gen. Viljoen said that he hoped that South Africa would never reach the point where the SADF is given the task to take action against the right wingers. Gen. Liebenberg asked politicians and the media to respect and uphold the apolitical character of the SADF as an institution and the soldier in uniform for their own sake and that of the country's. He warned organizations, institutions and individuals who are striving to chip away at and besmirch the SADF that they may yet have to rely on those forces for their protection and security, their own survival and the orderly survival of the country. In addition, he also warned that the SADF and the defense industries have already been cut to the bone by far reaching cuts and rationalization. "If more cuts are implemented, then the nerves will be bared to the core, with disastrous consequences." He also pleaded that standards must be maintained within the SADF and that the SADF must always hang on to its professional nature. "The situation cannot be allowed where someone who exercises command over the lives of soldiers would not be adequately trained or adequately qualified or lack the necessary experience and military knowledge." Gen. Lieberberg also pleaded for the maintenance of part-time forces. "Whatever changes may occur in the new system, the part-time forces may never be allowed to become the stepchildren of the Defense Forces," he said. The parade was also attended by other politicians. Mr. Kobie Coetsee, minister of defense, was present as well as Mr. Hernus Kriel, minister of law and order, who initially sat next to Gen. Viljoen before taking his place on the front honor seats.
