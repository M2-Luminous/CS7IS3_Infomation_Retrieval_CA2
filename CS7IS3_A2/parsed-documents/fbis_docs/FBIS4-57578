The meeting was opened at the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) headquarters. In their initial speeches, the Cairns Group ministers confirmed their countries' willingness to play a significant role in the agricultural reform required by the international trade system. The ministers also confirmed the task of monitoring compliance with the GATT agreements reached during the Uruguay Round, which recently ended, marked by controversy over the issue of agriculture, as countries of efficient production were pitted against the developed nations, which subsidize the production of agricultural commodities. [passage omitted] The opening session was inaugurated by Pedro Saravia, the Uruguayan livestock, agriculture, and fishing minister; Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan; and ALADI Secretary General Antonio Antunes, a Brazilian citizen. Antunes welcomed the participating delegations. He acknowledged the significance of the Uruguay Round of the GATT talks in achieving fairer and more stable trade standards. The ALADI secretary said: "The Latin American integration process is based on the fact that this region must competitively and dynamically join the world. To this effect, the multilateral trade system must be more honest." Antunes noted that the subregional systems "are playing a leading role in the current Latin American integration process and, with their own profiles and programs, are also contributing to a freer and more credible multilateral trade system." Antunes emphasized: "The implementation and extent of the modest and difficult process of agricultural reform agreed upon in the Uruguay Round will only become apparent at the beginning of the 21st century." In conclusion, Antunes said: "The Cairns Group's role and joint negotiating actions will therefore be extremely significant for our countries and for slowly and gradually opening the gates to a market without barriers and without discrimination." [passage omitted] The Cairns Group understands that its intermediary role in the agricultural negotiations to reconcile the U.S. and European Union positions has not been fully completed.
