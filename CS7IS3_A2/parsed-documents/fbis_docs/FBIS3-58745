Butrus-Ghali was speaking to members of Parliament and the Senate and later addressed a packed Great Church in The Hague. The offer to send a reinforced battalion in addition to the 1,840 Netherlands soldiers who are already deployed in the former Yugoslavia was "highly valued" by the United Nations, Butrus-Ghali said. Dutch support to mine clearance operations in Mozambique--the Netherlands is to send some 10 mine clearance experts--was also especially welcome. The secretary general regretfully noted that some countries were starting to show "symptoms of fatigue" where contributions to UN peace operations were concerned. "I am not certain whether I will obtain enough troops for peace operations," he said. "Nor am I certain of financial contributions. Some countries say that the costs and risks are too high." In a confidential speech to members of Parliament and the Senate, Butrus-Ghali said he could not impose peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina if the warring parties continued to refuse to end the hostilities. The order to launch air attacks on Bosnian Serb positions was a matter for the UN member states themselves. Borrow Butrus-Ghali, who is on a three-day visit to the Netherlands, added that he could only "borrow" military resources from the UN member states. The decision to launch air attacks was not his first responsibility, he said. NATO has spoken in favor of air attacks, but so far Butrus-Ghali has received no request to carry them out. Prince Willem-Alexander, virtually the entire cabinet, MP's, the military top brass, and many prominent Dutch persons attended the secretary general's speech in the Great Church. Butrus-Ghali is a former international law professor in Egypt, his country of birth. He called for breathing new life into international law so that it would be possible to react appropriately to the great challenges of the post-Cold War period. He referred to the great role the Netherlands has long played in this respect. It was not for nothing that The Hague houses the UN International Court of Justice, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and the International War Crimes Tribunal.
