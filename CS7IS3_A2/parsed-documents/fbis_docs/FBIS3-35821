Next Few Months Will Tell Whether It Will Prove Possible To Continue This Route"] [Text] The Russian State Committee for Statistics [Goskomstat] has announced the main statistics for the country's socioeconomic position in 1993. They indicate that the general slump has not been halted, but is slowing down and gradually assuming a structured nature. The decline has been stopped in some important areas, but there is no growth as yet and the stabilization is hardly reliable. Growth has begun in some spheres, but the precrisis high has by no means been attained as yet. Enigmatic and Not So Enigmatic Figures GDP dropped 12 percent on last year's level when it in turn fell 19 percent. In other words, the decline has slowed, but it is still considerable. At the same time the structure of GDP use has improved in some respects. The proportion of spending on final national consumption rose from 53.6 percent of total GDP use in 1992 to 57.8 percent in 1993. Spending on domestic consumption totaled 40.5 percent of GDP against 35.9 percent in 1992. The proportion of gross accumulation of fixed capital, along with the proportion of net exports (minus imports) remained virtually unchanged. What has changed, how has consumption risen? The growth in material working capital dropped dramatically from 11.6 percent of GDP in 1992 to 5.3 percent in 1993. In the main this is attributable to the dramatic reduction in material working capital within production stocks. The reduction in stocks at certain enterprises may have been excessive. But this process is by and large beneficial. Remember that in the early eighties economists spoke with growing disquiet of the excessive growth of stocks. At that time economic growth was in actual fact a sham: The entire growth in social production was used to increase stocks that were lying idle. Now the process has been reversed: The real decline in social consumption is less than the slump in production -- owing to the reduction in stocks. That is to a considerable extent the reason for what at first glance seem enigmatic figures. Thus, notwithstanding the slump in production, the population's real monetary income was 9 percent up on the previous year. Admittedly, that is still only 57 percent of the 1991 level, since there was a sharp decline of almost 50 percent in 1992. But nonetheless recovery has begun. Total commodity turnover was 102 percent of the 1992 level and 99 percent of the 1991 figures. Total exports were 101.4 percent and 84 percent of the 1992 and 1991 levels respectively. At the same time exports were 16 billion [rubles] ahead of imports (it is hard to remember anything like that happening in our history). And here are some more figures. The number of people with income below the minimum subsistence level in December 1993 was 3.7 percent up on December 1992, totaling 39.6 million, or over one-fourth of the entire population. The consolidated consumer price index rose 9.4-fold in 1993 as opposed to 26-fold in 1992, and has thus risen 245-fold in two years. If you remember that the index also rose 2.6-fold in 1991, in three years there has been more than a 600-fold rise. At the same time in December the average wage was 130,000 rubles [R], an 8.1-fold increase last year and a 109-fold increase in the past two years -- less than one-half the price rises since liberalization. By the end of the year over 24,000 kolkhozes and sovkhozes (95 percent of the total) had reregistered. One-third of them decided to retain their former status. Moreover, 11,500 varying companies, around 300 open-type joint-stock companies, 400 enterprise subsidiary farms, and 2,000 agricultural cooperatives have been set up based on kolkhozes and sovkhozes. Some 87,000 private farms have appeared in a year: As of 1 January 1994 there were 270,000 of them in Russia (with an average land area of 42 hectares per farm). Agricultural production in the public sector is on the decline, but it is on the increase in the individual sector and this is making it possible to slow down or halt entirely the slump in the production of certain foodstuffs. Coupled with the sharp increase in the population's horticultural and truck garden activity, the urban population included, this ensured a noticeable increase in consumption of all basic foodstuffs, apart from fish products, in 1993. The 1991 level has been regained and even exceeded in a number of areas. All this is particularly impressive if you bear in mind that imports of grain (and meat and sugar) were cut drastically in 1993 for the first time in many years and at the same time reliable grain stocks were set up before the new harvest. There can be no recurrence today of the situation in early 1992, when the population's grain supply was directly dependent on the arrival of the latest grain shipments from the United States. Nevertheless, agriculture is in an extremely grave position. Prices of agricultural equipment, fuel, and fertilizers are rising far more rapidly than prices of agricultural produce. The profitability of crop farming produce dropped from 211 percent in 1992 to 92 percent in 1993 and thus remains extraordinarily high. The profitability of livestock produce, which dropped from 42 to 15 percent respectively, could have been deemed adequate had it not been shored up by subsidies. Wool production was unprofitable even with subsidies, which promoted a reduction in the sheep and goat herd. There was an unequivocal deterioration in the state of trade and the consumer market. In 1992 the retail trade's foodstuff availability coefficient was around 50 percent and the nonfood commodity availability coefficient 70 percent (an immeasurable improvement on the empty stores of 1991) and in 1993 the figures were 60-70 and 80-90 percent respectively. All efficiency indicators were considerably higher in private trade than in state trading outlets. After the slump of 1991-1992 consumption of nonfood commodities rose once again. As for the market in technical and production output, one conclusion from the Goskomstat report is simply worth citing: "In 1993 there was no problem with shortages of resources. The main condition determining enterprise and organization procurement was their effective demand." Will Industry Be Able To Restructure Itself? Foreign trade results are extremely conflicting. The sizeable surplus balance of trade represents an undoubted success, but it has cost us too dear and is hardly a long-term phenomenon. It is only the reduction in grain imports, which provided $1 billion out of a total surplus of $16 billion, that is undoubtedly beneficial and effective for the country. The reduction -- by 50 percent -- in imports of machinery and equipment, providing a "saving" of around $7 billion, and medicine (by almost 75 percent compared with the previous year) is not at all beneficial. The already backward export structure deteriorated still further. We are buying fewer machines and equipment, but on the other hand exports of crude oil, petroleum products, gas, coal, iron ore, ammonia, cast iron, and aluminum, in other words nonreproducible natural resources that involve a low degree of processing and correspondingly low revenue rose considerably. The worst thing is that last year average export prices of Russian oil, petroleum products, gas, coal, iron ore, cast iron, and aluminum fell. While the extraction and transportation costs of all these commodities are rising rapidly. In many cases it was still profitable for enterpries to export these products only because of the drastically low ruble rate of exchange and what were until recently low transportation costs. Now transportation rates are close to real expenditure on transportation and the ruble rate of exchange, although still very low, has nonetheless fallen considerably slower than prices on the domestic market have risen. In effect although the artificial export incentives have survived, they are appreciably weaker and the profitability of exporting aluminum ingots, round timber, and coal is already in question. Oil exports will also be in jeopardy in the future. The question in effect is whether Russian industry will be able to restructure itself to export primarily machinery and equipment and other commodities with a high degree of processing before the favorable, but short-lived market situation disappears and thus maintain an active trade balance. Our only salvation lies in boosting the competitiveness of Russian goods. Regrettably, the industrial lobby and the government, which is obviously succumbing to pressure from the former, are still taking a different direction. The Russian market is being closed to foreign commodities by incredibly high duties. Thus the population is being made to pay for the monopolism and the backwardness of Russian industry, and that industry is doomed to lag forever behind its rivals. If it does not learn to withstand foreign competition at home, much less will it have a chance of conquering these rivals on other countries' bleak markets. Response to Critics of Monetarism This example is just one of many that make one think about the choice of course now being made deep within the government. Primarily the choice of an economic policy in its most general form. The main position that has been repeatedly stated over the last few years by government leaders is this: We will operate not only by monetarist methods. This should be investigated more carefully since I think that both the supporters of this policy and its critics are guilty of inaccuracies. When it said that there are microeconomic instruments as well as monetarist macroeconomic instruments, this idea is for some reason put forward as a reproof to the monetarists. But no one can after all claim that macroeconomic levers, above all setting state finances to rights, are not necessary. I think that few people would also dare to say that microeconomic actions can be successful without setting the microeconomy to rights. Everyone realises that both are necessary. But it is not those countless sectoral department officials who have done nothing to streamline the microeconomic structure who are presented as being to blame for the economy's hitherto untreated ills, but those who are making abortive attempts to bring about macroeconomic stabilization. It is the finance minister's business to watch over the state budget and other departments should deal with each enterprises. However, critics of monetarism in the sectoral lobby are sincerely convinced that they are right. Many of them think that the Finance Ministry's "miserliness" is to blame for everything: If it were to give us state money to our heart's content, we would sort everything out. One can perhaps thank fate that the state purse is no longer big enough for everyone to take their fill -- otherwise spendthrift production units would continue ad infinitum. No, activity at microeconomic level can be successful not despite but only on the basis of monetarist policy. If commitment to the old habits persists, what the premier said -- "not only by monetarist methods" -- may indeed entail a return to the long since compromised administration by decree. With a competent market approach it is quite possible to combine the two avenues in the state's economic activity. On the one hand, a return to regulating prices and rates of exchange, to ceilings and quotas, and broadening subsidies and preferential loans will do no good. On the other, the state can help step up enterprises' market activity. Nonmonetarist activity by the state is a possibility. But on one condition: Provided that it does not contravene, but rests on monetarist policy, and utilizes its fruits. Only when the means of arriving at this kind of combination have been found, when people have ceased reducing the task to the slowing down of financial stabilization, will one be able to believe that our state is indeed committed to the reform course.
