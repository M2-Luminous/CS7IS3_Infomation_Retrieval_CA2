The high-ranking officer said the GN, the Navy, and the Army have beefed up security in Casdualito, the Venezuelan town bordering Colombia, in anticipation of a new guerrilla attack. "We are absolutely sure they will carry out future attacks against our installations and we are ready for that," he asserted. Artuza Delgado said the civilian population of the southwest region of Venezuela can rest assured the Armed Forces will safeguard their physical safety and will protect their properties. Meanwhile, the GN commander reported that this Venezuelan force had not arrested the Brazilian gold prospectors and also denied entering the Brazilian territorial space. The general remarked the Venezuelan Armed Forces respect the borders and are perfectly aware of their location. He added that in the last operation conducted in the area bordering Brazil, Venezuelan military authorities destroyed 88 "gold prospecting" camps and 11 rafts used by the illegal miners. The officer concluded that "the illegal Brazilian miners, who profit from the illegal exploitation of our land, want to create friction at the international level so as to weaken the work being done at the border."
