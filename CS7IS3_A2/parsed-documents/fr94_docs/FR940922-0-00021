FR940922-0-00021 FR940922-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 20 RIN 1018&hyph;AA24 Migratory Bird Hunting: Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations on Certain Federal Indian Reservations and Ceded Lands for the 1994&hyph;95 Late Season AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule prescribes special late season migratory bird hunting regulations for certain tribes on Federal Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands and ceded lands. This is in response to tribal requests for Service recognition of their authority to regulate hunting under established guidelines. This rule is necessary to allow establishment of season bag limits and, thus, harvest at levels compatible with populations and habitat conditions. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule takes effect on September 24, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments received on the tribal proposals and special hunting regulations are available for public inspection during normal business hours in Room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA. Communications regarding the documents should be sent to: Director (FWS/MBMO), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 634 ARLSQ, 1849 C St., NW, Washington, DC 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Keith A. Morehouse, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, 634 ARLSQ, 1849 C St., NW, Washington, DC 20240 (703/358&hyph;1714). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1918 (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703 et seq. ), authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior, having due regard for the zones of temperature and for the distribution, abundance, economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of flight of migratory game birds, to determine when, to what extent, and by what means such birds or any part, nest or egg thereof may be taken, hunted, captured, killed, possessed, sold, purchased, shipped, carried, exported or transported. In the August 16, 1994 Federal Register (59 FR 42017), the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposed special migratory bird hunting regulations for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season for certain Indian tribes, under the guidelines described in the June 4, 1985, Federal Register (50 FR 23467). The guidelines were developed in response to tribal requests for Service recognition of their reserved hunting rights, and for some tribes, recognition of their authority to regulate hunting by both tribal members and nonmembers on their reservations. The guidelines include possibilities for: (1) On-reservation hunting by both tribal members and nonmembers, with hunting by nontribal members on some reservations to take place within Federal frameworks but on dates different from those selected by the surrounding State(s); (2) on-reservation hunting by tribal members only, outside of usual Federal frameworks for season dates and length, and for daily bag and possession limits; and (3) off-reservation hunting by tribal members on ceded lands, outside of usual framework dates and season length, with some added flexibility in daily bag and possession limits. In all cases, the regulations established under the guidelines would have to be consistent with the March 10&hyph;September 1 closed season mandated by the 1916 Convention on the Protection of Migratory Birds Between the U.S. and Great Britain (for Canada). Tribes that desired special hunting regulations in the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season were requested in the April 7, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 16762) to submit a proposal that included details on: (1) requested season dates and other regulations to be observed; (2) harvest anticipated under the requested regulations; (3) methods that will be employed to measure or monitor harvest; (4) steps that will be taken to limit level of harvest, where it could be shown that failure to limit such harvest would impact seriously on the migratory bird resource; and (5) tribal capabilities to establish and enforce migratory bird hunting regulations. No action is required if a tribe wishes to observe the hunting regulations that are established by the State(s) in which an Indian reservation is located. The guidelines have been used successfully since the 1985&hyph;86 hunting season, and they were made final beginning with the 1988&hyph;89 hunting season (August 18, 1988; 53 FR 31612).
