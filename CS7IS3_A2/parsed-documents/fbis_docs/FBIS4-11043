[Cavallo] The point is that the current consumption boom [preceding word in English] will not be permanent. Later it will return to more moderate levels. A 4 percent consumption growth rate in a country with a 1.3 percent population growth rate represents a 2.6 percent consumption growth rate per capita per year. This trend remains unchanged, even though it is more moderate. I have never talked about reducing consumption. [Velazquez] In this case, what brackets of the population will have to begin moderating their consumption rate? [Cavallo] The middle income bracket, and especially the high income bracket, was the one that has benefited greatly from this wealth effect. Those who earn 500 or 600 pesos are not included in this bracket. These people consume all they earn. The middle and high income brackets of the population went overboard in recent years. Therefore, these brackets will have to become more austere. [Velazquez] Isn't there a risk of this formula being recessive? [Cavallo] Not at all. Those who say it is necessary to devalue are the ones who cause a recession. Nevertheless, they are mistaken from one end to the other. It would never occur to us to cause this type of consumption reduction. This formula is neither necessary nor appropriate. It is a Pyrrhic solution to increase exports by causing a recession. [Velazquez] Are you planning to levy new taxes on consumption goods? [Cavallo] No. We are duly collecting the existing consumption taxes like IVA [value added tax], income taxes, and the independent employers' and employees' contributions. These revenues are more than enough to finance public spending. [Velazquez] I wanted to know if you actually are planning to levy new taxes on consumption goods in order to discourage consumption... [Cavallo] Well now, these taxes already are acting as an encouragement for savings. For example, if you are securing a loan for consumption [goods] you will be paying IVA on the interest rate. Nevertheless, if the loan is for investment in a company, you can include this tax in the IVA on sales. There is already a number of elements in the tax structure, taxing consumption and not taxing investments and savings. These fiscal incentives are becoming increasingly significant in taxpayers' decisions. They did not have a real impact when taxes were not paid. [Velazquez] What other measures are you planning to take to increase savings and discourage consumption? [Cavallo] We are not thinking in terms of new packages, but in improving the implementation of measures we already have announced. [Velazquez] What measures? [Cavallo] Everything concerning the fiscal pact's implementation. For example, the deregulation of professional fees; the privatization of the electric system, the fresh water system, and the sewers; the privatization of provincial banks; the transfer of pension funds to the federal government; the final removal of gross income and keeping a single tax for retailers; and the deregulation of construction standards, among other measures. [Velazquez] How will you convince the banks to direct their loans toward investments? [Cavallo] We have to make sure there will not be any instrumental bottlenecks for intermediary services in short- and long-term loans. Short-term loans actually are very costly for banks because they have to be assessed and implemented many times. Mid- and long-term loans are assessed once, have good guarantees, are collected automatically, and do not have to be constantly rewritten. The operational costs for long-term loans are lower than loans for consumption [goods]. [Velazquez] And why are the banks not warning about this point? [Cavallo] I believe the "economics" of mid- and long-term loans still are not duly taken into account by the banks because they attach great importance to the risk of unbacked loans. Stability by itself is reducing this risk for the banks. And we will see if we can do something to further reduce this risk and facilitate the extension of deadlines for the repayment of loans. [Velazquez] What are you thinking of to achieve this goal? [Cavallo] Well now (Cavallo ponders), I cannot name a given mechanism now, but my people are studying experiences from other countries to find ways of reducing the risk of unbacked mid- and long-term loans, especially mortgage loans and similar loans.
