He added: The Chinese side hopes that the new airport can be completed by 1 July 1997 so that Chris Patten can return to London by plane from the new Chek Lap Kok airport at Lantau. When meeting with the 60-plus representatives of the alumni association of Hong Kong's Pui Kiu Middle School at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse today, Lu said: The Airport Committee meeting was held a few days ago. The Chinese side hopes that the financial arrangements for the new airport can be settled at an early date. Lu pointed out: "We have repeatedly made clear that the new airport will belong to the special administrative region [SAR] government after 1997, that the central government will never take any money from Hong Kong, that the SAR does not have to hand over any taxes to the central government, and that it is completely independent financially." Lu stressed: In arguing with the British side, the Chinese side is arguing for the Hong Kong people. The increase in the SAR's financial reserves from HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars] at the start of the Sino-British talks to HK$25 billion is the result of the Chinese Government's haggling with the British side. This is in addition to the Land Fund, which is estimated to be HK$100 billion by 1997. Beijing has thus created a fairly good condition for the future SAR government and laid a fairly solid financial foundation. Therefore, if the airport's debts far exceed the financial reserves left for the SAR government, is it not the case that the SAR government will get nothing in the future? How can it get along then? Lu said this was not a numbers ploy. Lu said: We hope to resolve the airport financial arrangements at an early date and then discuss the draft regulations for the Airport Corporation. There are a lot of issues, such as who will administer the airport and how? According to the provisions of the memorandum, the airport will be administered by the Airport Authority which, as a legal person, has independent management rights. But this right must be subject to certain checks. It should not be outside the supervision of the SAR government, which must be responsible to the Hong Kong taxpayers. Lu said: After 1997, the Hong Kong people will run Hong Kong. The work of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] and the Preparatory Committee is all aimed at the joint participation of Hong Kong people. They provide assistance to Hong Kong people to realize the future administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people. He said: Deng Xiaoping has said to us on several occasions that it is absolutely necessary to believe that Hong Kong people can run Hong Kong well. At the meeting, some people raised the question of high property prices in Hong Kong. Lu replied: The PWC economic sub-group is discussing this issue. It should be resolved properly but it should not lead to a slump in property prices. If a large quantity of land is supplied now, many buildings will just be completed in 1997 and this will affect the SAR government. Before 1997 this issue is handled by the British Hong Kong Government. Lu said: The Chinese Government hopes to avoid great fluctuations in property prices in Hong Kong before 1997. It is hoped the issue can be solved properly so that the people's livelihood and Hong Kong's status as an international financial center will not be affected by high property prices and that the SAR government will not be greatly affected. As for the transition of civil servants, Lu reaffirmed that the PWC did not ask civil servants to make known their positions. The Basic Law has stipulated the transition of civil servants. With the exception of 20 or so senior officials who should be nominated by the SAR chief executive and appointed by the central government, other civil servants may continue to serve the SAR government. Lu said: The British Hong Kong Government wants to select the principal officials of the future SAR government before 1997. This is impossible because this is tantamount to selecting principal officials in place of the SAR chief executive and violates the principle of Hong Kong people's autonomy. At the meeting, some members who are indigenous residents of the New Territories raised the question of the amendment to the New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill. According to a Hong Kong Government official, after comprehensive amendment, the bill does not violate the Basic Law. Lu said that it is necessary to read this bill clearly. If the amended bill approved by the Legislative Council contradicts the Basic Law, it will be proclaimed null and void after 1997. Lu said: The Chinese side is still striving to cooperate with the British side but what is more important is to focus our attention on the Hong Kong people. If there is no cooperation, work in the transition period will be more difficult, but the Chinese side is confident a stable transition can be achieved by relying on Hong Kong people. Liao Hui, director of the State Council's Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, who attended the meeting with Lu Ping, spoke highly of the contributions made by the Pui Kiu Middle School in training talented people for Hong Kong. The visiting delegation of overseas alumni of Pui Kiu Middle School is headed by Chang Hua-feng and Ling Wen-cheng.
