The three have outrightly rejected hegemonism and have given expression to their shared perception of an international order based on respect for sovereign equality of all states, non-intervention, peaceful co-existence, peaceful settlement of disputes. With one voice Benazir, Li Peng and Kim Il-song denounced the political and economic domination of the developing countries by the big powers, and asked them to live and let others live. In fact, the above-named countries have been subjected to punitive diplomacy and blackmail by the US for the simple reason that they have embarked upon a path of independent economic development. Pakistan has been accused of having made the Islamic bomb, and DPRK a Marxist bomb while China has been charged with supplying 400-metre-range M-11 missiles to Pakistan. Pakistan has offered to conclude the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] together with India. The DPRK has proposed the establishment of nuclear-weapons-free zone in the Korean peninsula, meaning the removal of 1000 nuclear and lethal weapons from there by the US. Further, it has to remove 48000 troops from South Korea, another 45000 troops from Japan and warships from the Korean waters. This Washington is not prepared to do and insists on Pyongyong's unconditional submission to the inspection by the so-called IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] team of North Korea's two suspected nuclear sites. The row had taken a serious turn, with President Clinton threatening to bomb Pyongyong's nuclear installations. Benazir has sought to defuse the tension by lending support to the ongoing negotiations between the US and the DPRK at the United Nations, and pleading that non-proliferation should not be made a pretext for blocking the acquisition of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Apparently, Pakistan's role has had some sobering influence on the adversaries. Both Pakistan and China have categorically denied the M-11 missile deal amidst Washington's refrain that Beijing had made the delivery to its neighbour. China has made it clear that it gives weapons for the recipient country's self-defiance [as published] only and not to create imbalance in South Asia. There is nothing clandestine about Pakistan-China arms transfer which began, it may be recalled, after the US stopped military assistance to Islamabad after the Sino-Soviet border agreement in 1963. In December 1989 the two neighbours reached an agreement for cooperation in the production of arms and ammunition. Pakistan has to do something about its defence since Rajiv Gandhi did not respond to Benazir's proposal for a mutual balanced reduction of forces. Nor to her predecessor government's offer of no-war pact. India is ever after a deadlier weapons such as Agni, Prithvi, Akash missiles in addition to four rocket launchers given to it by Russia. Benazir has been mobilising world opinion in favour of a judicious settlement of Kashmir where insurgency might spill over into neighbouring countries, triggering off a regional war in which Afghanistan and Iran may be embroiled at some stage similar to Muslim Ummah's involvement against Russians in Afghanistan. In the '60s and '70s, the People's Republic of China unreservedly back the solution of Kashmir problem on the basis of the UN-sponsored plebiscite. The Chinese President Jiang Zemin particularly mentioned that the Kashmir dispute was the main obstacle to the normalisation of relations between India and Pakistan. At the same time the Chinese leaders avoided taking sides presumably because any partisan attitude on their part would deprive them of whatever influence they might bring to bear upon India by quiet diplomacy. Any offer of mediation by Beijing would not be acceptable to India which insists on bilateral negotiations. Astute diplomats as they are, the Chinese denied assuming any such role. It is by some semblance of even-handedness and nonpartisanship that Beijing can exercise a moderating influence on India. Certainly, China will never allow India to invade Pakistan, especially when the Soviet Union is no longer there to neutralise Beijing. Kim Il-song has maintained his government's support to the settlement of Kashmir dispute on the basis of the will of the people expressed through an impartial referendum, a position adopted in consultation with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1976. Unlike China, the DPRK has no unresolved disputes with India and does not have to toe a cautious line. Therefore, Pyongyang's partisanship would not complicate the matter but add to the moral weight of Pakistan's stand. Alone among the UN members Pakistan has stood by China on human rights issue as proclaimed by Benazir that her government shares Beijing's perception on that score. The United States has left no stone unturned in making pariah of China on the suppression of the West-inspired subversion at Tiananmen Square in June 1989. Day in and day out, the Western media keep playing up the so-called Tibetan separatism in a bid to fuel insurgency in China's Himalayan province while the British governor of the crown colony of Hong Kong is busy sowing the dragon's seed there which he calls representatives assembly. It is ridiculous -- nay mischievous -- to plant a state within state on the eve of the lapse of Britain's paramountcy in the region. Similarly, the Western powers have been arming Taiwan, a part of mainland China, to teeth so that that entity may resist reunion with the parent country. Pakistan's Prime Minister has strongly opposed the Western designs on China's territorial integrity and endorsed its inalienable sovereign right to Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan, a gesture that was appreciated by the Chinese government and people. Pakistani leader underlined the need for strengthening that United Nations in order to enable it to contribute to the establishment of an international order based on justice. The nonaligned nations could effectively resist the hegemonistic and exploitative role of the big powers that impedes the emergence of global egalitarianism. But the NAM [Nonaligned Movement] has been stuck by paralysis in the post-cold war years. The December 15 GATT document is discriminatory against the developing countries as it imposes an unequal trade regime on them all. More galling is the pusillanimous submission on the part of NAM which had been crying hoarse for market access in the developed world. India's half-hearted call for G-15 Summit to address the GATT met with equally half-hearted response. The summit could never meet. Nor was Narasimha Rao serious about countering the domineering North with whose multinationals he has been hobnobbing. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, India has been placating the imperialist-zionist lobby for a permanent seat in the Security Council. Whither NAM? In this context the meeting of the leaders of Pakistan, China and the DPRK has been particularly significant in that they have been resisting attempted subjugation from armed plutocratic powers. At this critical juncture Kim Il-song's advice aimed at South-South cooperation is significant. The great Korean leader argues that Asia is blessed with immense natural resources, manpower, technical know-how and experience. Given meaningful cooperation, all these could be turned to good account. The People's Republic of China and the DPRK are living examples of development through self- reliance. Pakistan has forged multiple economic, trade and technological links with the both and has been expanding the cooperation. Benazir has laid stress on energy, agriculture and irrigation where Chinese assistance is urgently required. She has invited the Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in Pakistan where the government's economic reforms and new financing modes will facilitate joint ventures in collaboration with local investors. Five accords were signed: (1) bilateral cooperation in science and technology, (2) transport, (3) twinning of Punjab and Xian provinces, (4) border trade agreement which raised the volume of such trade to 2 million Yuan, and (5) an 80-million-yuan soft loan to Pakistan. China has helped Pakistan set up heavy mechanical complex, heavy forge foundry and aircraft rebuild factory. It is about time that attention was paid to light industry in private sector on the basis of joint ventures. This was agreed at a meeting of the 6-member Chinese delegation led by Zeng Xianlin, Minister for Light Industry and Pakistan's Minister of Production, Islam Nabi, at Islamabad in September '91. The Chinese official opined that light industry could be established with small capital and fetch foreign exchange which in turn could be invested in defence sector. Among the areas identified for the purpose are the manufacturing of electrical fans, air-conditioners, electrical equipments, auto-bicycles, elevators, hand-operated deep well pumps and food processing. In addition to making Pakistan self-sufficient in engineering goods, the industry will create jobs. Some of these products could be exported to China, thereby reducing Pakistan's trade deficit. In 1991, China exported goods to Pakistan amounting to US$598 million while Pakistan's export was mere US$89.2 million. The balance is more or less the same at present. Improved communication links and exchange of visits by businessmen can promote trade via land route. It is a good news to the traders that both the governments have decided to repair and develop Karakoram Highway into an all-weather road. Similarly, there exists great potential in promoting cooperation with the DPRK in trade and development. Already, Pyongyong has extended technical assistance in establishing hydro-power station in Azad Kashmir. It has offered to assist Pakistan in seismic-proof pre-fabricated housing, manufacture of generators and mining equipment. North Korea's long-standing offer to construct underground railway system to solve the nation's chronic mass transit problem must still be open if only we could avail of it. The DPRK will also buy chemical products from Pakistan. These are examples of mutually advantageous economic and technical cooperation in bilateral relations among the states of the South. Pakistan, China and the DPRK have shown how states with differing political, social and economic systems, can work together in a rewarding fellowship.
