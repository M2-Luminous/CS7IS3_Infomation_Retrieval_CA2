In a wide-ranging interview during lunch at the Financial Times, Mr de Klerk stressed the importance of economic growth to meet the needs of what he called "a lost generation" of South Africans. But he also gave a sharp warning against any attempt to undermine the status of the Afrikaans language, saying it would drive many of his National Party supporters into the arms of the far right. A relaxed and good-humoured Mr de Klerk, showing no signs of strain after a gruelling election campaign made clear that he looked forward to contesting the presidency in the next election. The National Party, he said, had won support from about l million black voters in addition to over 3 million votes from whites, coloureds and Indians. He was determined to help make the coalition led by President Nelson Mandela work, he said, adding that the National Party would be able to claim a share of success when contesting the next election. The party accepted the need to tackle housing backlogs and improve health and educational facilities for black South Africa -- any difference with the ANC was "not about the needs of the people, but how you fund the programme." This in turn depended on sustained economic growth, partly through export promotion and encouraging foreign investment. He insisted that the Reconstruction and Development Programme drawn up by the ANC should be treated as the policy not of a single party, but of the government of national unity. "But we must be assured that we will not give way on the need for fiscal discipline", he said. How, Mr de Klerk was asked, could he reconcile support for the coalition government and the need for a watchdog opposition role? "I am on a learning curve on this," replied Mr de Klerk. But from discussions with leaders of coalition governments in Europe, he went on, it seemed there were two options. "You can either have a continuing argument in a coalition or you can do your homework initially... and agree in detail what joint policy will be, and then test everything that happens against this (agreement)" -- and this was the approach he had adopted. He accepted that there had been some hard bargaining over the composition of the cabinet, but welcomed the reappointment of Mr Derek Keys as finance minister as one of the critical portfolios, in addition to agriculture, constitutional affairs, as well as his own role as executive vice president. Asked whether the government of national unity could become "more or less permanent", Mr de Klerk replied: "Not necessarily in this form." "Power sharing", he went on, "should be a feature of the final constitution (to be drawn up by the country's National Assembly)" arguing, as he has done frequently in the past, that a party that gets 51 per cent of the vote should not get 100 per cent of the power. But he stressed that "there are other ways of achieving it than though an enforced coalition. One would be to give to the regions more powers, though not necessarily more functions," he said. "For certain types of important decisions the president might not be able to take them on his own, he must call in the premiers of the nine provinces". Alternatively, Mr de Klerk suggested, "the senate could more effectively represent minority interests, to control the power of the party with the majority." But he underlined the fact that "it is not about vetoes -- it is about effectively preventing the misuse of power to the detriment of language, religion, certain black minority groups". "I don't think we should have enforced coalitions," Mr de Klerk went on, "but when (the current system) falls away, we need to broaden the package of how to share power in other ways, through local government for example." "We have got to balance the situation between the fears of minorities and the democratic need to have real power which comes with being a majority (party)." "An enforced coalition", he continued, "will not wash, it won't work either. But I predict we are going to have coalitions any way." Turning to the role of post-apartheid South Africa, Mr de Klerk urged the international community "not to remove us from their agenda. They need us, they need to address the problems of Africa. We have a pivotal role to play -- but only if we are successful (at home) can we play that role (in Africa) to the full." "We need sustained dynamic economic growth," said Mr de Klerk. "We will be focusing on exports and developing the new markets that have become available to us, we have to get our productivity up, and develop the potential of tourism, with lots of jobs." Mr de Klerk was at his most passionate, however when he responded to questions about the future of Afrikaans. It was "very dangerous" he warned, to undermine the language, pointing as an example to the dropping of announcements in Afrikaans on board South African Airways. "It was the language issue which made the Afrikaner the force that they are today...if you want me to lose their support, rub them up the wrong way about the language. You will drive back into the arms of the far right." Mr de Klerk was reluctant to give reasons for the last minute decision of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, to take part in the election. "Realism took over," he said. "If Chief Buthelezi didn't come aboard we might have faced a very serious security situation". All parties, including Chief Buthelezi, realised this. Mr de Klerk dismissed reports in the South African press that he had struck a deal to secure Chief Buthelezi's participation, giving extra land to the former Kwazulu homeland within Natal. "At no time was I involved in any discussion on that issue that was election related" Turning to the need for land redistribution, Mr de Klerk said it was "at tremendously emotional issue with conflict potential" but it "can be managed in an orderly way." The government has "already identified vast tracts of land" which could be made available to people dispossessed during the apartheid era. But Mr de Klerk cautioned against expectations that South Africa could play a major role in Rwanda. First the country's security forces had successfully to conclude the integration of regular units and members of the ANC armed wing. South Africa also needed to help resolve disputes closer to home, he said, notably the war in Angola. Mr de Klerk was in London to deliver the Sunday Times Nobel Laureate lecture. The combination of a strong economy and a large middle class placed South Africa "qualitatively and quantitively in quite a different league from any other African society," he told the audience. "We will be able to break the cycle of Third World poverty and despair and we will ensure that many of our African neighbours share our success."
