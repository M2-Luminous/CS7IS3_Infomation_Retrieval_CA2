Cao Sy Kiem also made known that a USD 73 million-project aimed at computerising and automating Vietnam's banking industry from now towards 2000 had been approved. The fund, he added, would be taken from the state budget, foreign loans as well as the reserved capitals of the Vietnam State Bank. Over the past three years Vietnam has made great efforts to become integrated with the world banking system. About 2,600 assorted personal computers have been put into use in various state- run banks and commercial banks. Information networks have been formed and completed within each bank as well as from provincial- level banks to central bank. Moreover, various new professional techniques have been applied such as electronic money transfer, an interbank market, remote inspection and supervision, preventative information, foreign currency and precious stone businesses, and so on. Thanks to these changes, the payment time has been reduced considerably, thus the rate of circulation has also accelerated. This improved service has improved the business environment for the entire economy.
