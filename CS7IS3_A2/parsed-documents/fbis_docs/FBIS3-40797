Recently, several countries cracked down on illegal aliens carrying the green Algerian passport. Tens of arrests were followed by deportation to Algeria. This has become so widespread that in the past few days the border police was overwhelmed by an increasing number of deported Algerians. In November for instance, 26 Algerians were deported from France and returned to their native country. According to French security services, they were in an illegal situation. One month later, some 40 natives of the Maghreb were arrested and found to possess false identity papers. French authorities wanted to deport them to Algeria. However, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to receive them because, we were told, these individuals' citizenship was not established. It also seems that 20 of the 40 individuals that were to be deported to our country either had AIDS or were drug addicts. In Germany, over 40 Algerians suffered the same fate. Fifteen of them were deported earlier this week. The reason for this decision was the same as the one given by French authorities, i.e., they were in an illegal situation. Even Poland, the ideal country for most black-market traffickers, is cracking down on Algerians. Contrary to the other cases we just mentioned, Polish security services did not bother to check the identity of Algerian tourists. They just turned back the Air Algeria aircraft when it landed in Warsaw, without any explanation, we were told. Surprised by the new regulation that Belgian Embassy officials started applying recently, an Algerian assured us that to obtain a Belgian visa you must pay 165 French francs [Fr]. "As a businessman, I went to the embassy with a letter stating my mission, that is a perfectly legal recommendation. All the same, Belgian Embassy officials demanded payment in foreign currency. Knowing that this is quite illegal, I declined to do so. Then, they denied me a visa," this man told us. The most tragic case was that of the 10 or so Algerian "black-market traffickers" who were arrested by Libyan security services after going through the Debdeb border post with all their papers in order. According to these "black-market traffickers," the Libyan police took them to a police station, handcuffed and blindfolded. Then, the police confiscated their identity papers and their passports before releasing them. Some of the individuals involved testified that the police gave them back their papers only on condition that they spend on the local market any foreign currency they owned. In spite of all these humiliations, the rush to consulates is undescribable. The French consulate in Algiers illustrates rather well this situation. Yesterday, drastic means had to be used to disperse the huge crowd that had gathered at the main entrance. An impressive police contingent was deployed around the consulate, on Place des Martyrs. The security of the consulate was ensured by blue minitanks followed by Nissan vehicles carrying armed "ninjas." At times, when citizens attempted to cross the line, the police fired warning shots to frighten the most obstinate.
