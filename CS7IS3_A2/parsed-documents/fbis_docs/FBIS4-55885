She does not anticipate any private bank going bankrupt this year. She approves of the idea of allowing shares by all state-owned banks into public circulation soon. During a session of the "Club 500" attached to the editorial board of ZYCIE GOSPODARCZE yesterday, NBP Chairwoman Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz spoke in favor of a consolidation of the Polish banking system: "The point is not just about merging small private banks threatened by bankruptcies, with big ones, but also about mergers among big, state-owned banks, so that in a few years' time, when Poland joins the European Union, we have three to four large structures able to compete with huge Western banks" -- she explained. When Andrzej Topinski, chairman of General Savings Bank- National Bank noted that there are no incentives for such a consolidation, the NBP chairwoman replied: "Mergers among large, state-owned banks should be promoted by the Finance Ministry which exercises ownership supervision over them." According to Gronkiewicz-Waltz, privatization of the banks should take place with the participation of foreign strategic investors who contribute modern management techniques and technologies. Bankruptcies Not Very Likely According to the NBP chief, one of the reasons for the difficult situation of the banking system, was an overly liberal policy of granting licenses to banks in the 1990-91 period. Over 60 new banks were established then but they are weak from a capital standpoint. Scandals involving some of them undermined customer confidence in all banks. That is why, over the last two years, licenses to open up new banks were granted at a slower pace and with more deliberation. Five banks received their licenses in 1992, while in 1993, it was just the Polish Investment Bank (which arose out of the remnants of NBP's commercial part). The criteria for granting concessions were also tightened up. The NBP chair does not anticipate a bankruptcy by any private bank in the immediate future, even though she does not rule out such a possibility. NBP intends to spend 3 trillion zlotys this year for a program of bringing private banks back to health. This should be compared with $6 billion (over 130 trillion zlotys) which was spent on saving the banking system in Sweden in the 1990s. Gronkiewicz- Waltz was trying to convince the banks to display a greater solidarity: "When privately-owned banks in some region have troubles, this means a decrease of confidence also toward state- owned banks, while generally speaking, this also causes a decreased willingness to save money" -- she said. More Openness Boguslaw Kott, chairman of the Bank of Economic Initiatives, proposed that state-owned banks implement a procedure soon to allow their shares into public circulation. The main purpose of such an operation now, would not be the introduction of the shares onto the stock market, but to better inform the public about the banks' financial situation. Wojciech Kwasniak, NBP's representative in the Securities Commission, promised to support the idea.
