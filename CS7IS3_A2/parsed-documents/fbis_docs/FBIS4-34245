Nevertheless, he warned that the Dominican Government is prepared to protect the joint border. Balaguer said he is confident that due to the Latin American government's rejection of an invasion, the international community will not reach the extreme of invading Haiti. He said dialogue between the two sides in conflict in Haiti could contribute to the return of democracy in that country and he explained that Dominican authorities are ready to defend and protect the 386-km border shared with Haiti on the island of Hispaniola, in case of a military invasion. Balaguer has repeatedly opposed the embargo imposed on Haiti by the international community. Nevertheless, since the end of May there has been strict compliance with the sanctions, to the point of preventing Haitians from obtaining food and medicine in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican president has ordered approximately 15,000 soldiers to guard the border with Haiti to prevent the violation of the international embargo against that country. Border surveillance intensified after Balaguer held several meetings with UN and U.S. officials in Santo Domingo. The heavy border surveillance, which prevents Haitians and Dominicans from trading on the border, has caused at least three Haitian deaths in the past 15 days during attacks on Dominican soldiers who prevent Haitians from crossing the border.
