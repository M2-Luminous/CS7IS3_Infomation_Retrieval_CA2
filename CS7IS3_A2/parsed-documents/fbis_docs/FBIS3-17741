This was reported to the press by the commission chairman Ivan Yemets. However, "several district commissions suggest holding the second round already this week, on 2 April." In these circumstances the Central Commission is not going to insist on its opinion, Yemets said. Moreover, district commissions will have a chance to hold elections at a time suitable for them. "They will be free to organize voting this weekend or the next, but 10 April is the latest possible date under the law," the official said. According to preliminary reports from district commissions, 47 out of 450 members of the new parliament were elected in the first round. Thus, a second round of voting will be held in 403 electoral districts. Fourteen of the elected members of parliament are Socialists and Communists. They were elected mostly in Donetsk, Lugansk and other eastern regions. Thirteen members from Western Ukraine belong to national-democratic organizations. There are also two members of the radical Ukrainian National Assembly.
