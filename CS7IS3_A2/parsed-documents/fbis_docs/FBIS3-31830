In a statement read out to reporters by a French officer, Soubirou said trench digging by Bosnian soldiers drew fire from Serbs who thought the Bosnians were trying to advance their lines. "The cease-fire is overall respected. However some shots fired break it from time to time," Soubirou said in the statement read by Major Guy Vinet. "Most often they are the result of Serb reaction from anxious soldiers who shoot at the Muslims who dig some trenches regularly. These diggings are a Bosnian provocation," the statement said. The ceasefire between Serbs besieging Sarajevo and the Bosnians defending it was agreed by the two sides on February 9, the day NATO issued an ultimatum for heavy artillery to be withdrawn from Sarajevo. The ceasefire has held and Sarajevo is the calmest it has been since war began in April 1992. Meanwhile a nation-wide ceasefire in Moslem-Croat fighting was due to take effect at 1100 GMT Friday.
