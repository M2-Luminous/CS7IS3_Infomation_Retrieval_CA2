It has been reiterated what valuable assets we have received, because Lithuania, recognized by the former USSR as a strategically excellent territory, has inherited 12 military airports. Many of them are situated in forests and remote places. No one cares about some of them, while disputes are continuing about the others. The Lithuanian president, his advisers, the Seimas [parliament], and its National Security Committee will discuss the utilization of the airports in strengthening Lithuania's national defense. This will require objective information. On 2 February, a group of officials had a chance to see the airports from both the bird's-eye and close views and explore the actual situation and the prospects for their utilization. [passage omitted] First of all, the group went to Kazlu Ruda airport in a Mi-8 helicopter. Currently, the airport is under the National Defense Ministry ownership. Formerly, it belonged to the seventh USSR airborne battalion occupying a 60-hectare area. The airport has a 200-meter-long runway, several garages and storehouses, 12 wooden barracks, the framework of the officers' apartment block, and a two-storied underground emergency dugout for the USSR air force command. Almost all of these buildings have been either taken away or destroyed to prevent their utilization. The edifices lack radiators, electric cables, windows, and doors. Nor are there any aviation facilities. Servicemen from the Kaunas motorized battalion of the field army brigade are working in Kazlu Ruda now. They are guarding the premises, repairing the facilities, and learning the art of war. Colonel S. Murza, deputy air force commander, said that, thus far, military aviators had been unable to use the Kazlu Ruda base. There are plans to turn the latter into a training base and to station a squadron there, so that war pilots could gather in one place to perform common assignments. [passage omitted] Incidentally, the Latvian military would also like to have its pilots trained in Lithuania (we have already trained their first two war aviators). The Latvians would contribute finances and assist in restructuring the base. In addition, Kazlu Ruda should house a duty air unit. J. Lasinskas, chief of the training squadron at the rear service, who is also acting commander, said that the base was built on concrete blocks which were laid on poles driven into a swamp. All underground conduits are close to the surface or on it, the pipes are ruined, and there is no money to replace them. [passage omitted] The pavement is good, and it has only grown over with grass over the past couple of years. The Kazlu Ruda airport has no commercial value, and no one claims it. From the viewpoint of military strategy, the airport cannot be neglected. Having flown over the Paliepiai airport, we found out that its 3,500-meter-long and 80-meter-wide runway consisted of 10,000 concrete blocks, 1,000 of which had been sold by the Russian soldiers. Fuel reservoirs had been sold to Lithuanian and Latvian firms. There had once been plans to use the blocks from Paliepiai in restructuring the Vilnius airport. The Paliepiai airport had belonged to the USSR naval force and had been an emergency base for long-distance planes. The Kedainiai airport has become the property of the self-government. After landing at the airport in Meskuiciai, we found all the Lithuanian military aircraft -- fighters, training planes, and helicopters -- stored under the open winter sky. [passage omitted] Those are not top-class planes. Therefore, they are not leak-proof, and water easily gets into their engines. Only the Zokniai airport has sufficiently spacious hangars suitable for storing planes. However, these facilities have been assigned to the Siauliai self-government. The military facilities accumulated in Meskuiciai can hardly undergo major repairs because there is no equipment or spare parts. A group of highly skilled engineers with higher aviation education is trying to make spare parts itself, and it is gradually repairing all planes and helicopters deployed in Meskuiciai. A conference held at the Meskuiciai base put forward the following idea: Does the National Defense Ministry [KAM] have a chance of acquiring at least some of the necessary buildings and hangars at the Zokniai airport? Air Force Deputy Commander S. Murza delivered a report about the key goals of Lithuania's aviation. These are control over the state borders and the Baltic Sea economic zone, and the supervision of the inviolability of the entire air space. Aviation should also engage in rescue operations, assist other army units in performing special assignments, and transfer other military units, servicemen, equipment, and facilities. In addition, aviation should also perform photographic work from the air and the radiation and chemical surveillance of the territory. According to the speaker, Lithuania needs three airports. The most suitable ones are in Zokniai (Siauliai region), Pajuoste (Panevezys region), and Kazlu Ruda (Marijampole region). It was expected a year and a half ago that the Zokniai airport would become the first strategic airport in northern Lithuania. It has the best hangars built in 1989, new buildings, the possibility of installing a good flight control center, and so on. It has a particularly good 3,500-meter-long runway (which was also an emergency runway for the spaceship "Buran"). The KAM received the buildings situated on both sides of the runway which cannot be used for cars. The zone for fighters, the launching pad, the parking lots for heavy planes and vehicles, the headquarters of the radioelectronic combat regiment, and the laboratory went to Siauliai City. "The security of entire Lithuania was sacrificed for the benefit of the city and for temporary finances," stressed Colonel S. Murza. "The airport which was too large for Russia has become too small for Lithuania." The self-government has forbidden the military even to drive across its territory. Therefore, quite a long road will have to be built on the other side. This might cost the military about 0.5 million litai. The conference was also addressed by Captain J. Marcinkus, commander of the first air base, who noted that the runway belonged to the self-government, but that the services for maintenance, navigation, and flight control could be common -- as is the case around the world. The self-government uses only part of the buildings (which the aviators need). The devastation of many facilities is continuing. The compact territory belonging to the self-government has all the buildings necessary for the normal work of the national defense air force, for the organization of the air defense, and for the installation of repair and engineering facilities, laboratories, and a maintenance unit. In the opinion of A. Norvilas, the president's adviser for national defense issues, and A. Orenius, adviser to the Seimas National Security Committee, a special commission should be set up and a project drafted for national defense. The fate of the Zokniai airport might change then. The decision of the former B. Lubys' government concerning the division of the airport will not be revoked unless there are some serious arguments. However, A. Norvilas told a TIESA correspondent that military aviators should be supported. From Meskuiciai we flew to Zokniai and inspected the deplorable buildings allotted to the KAM. After the "excursion" in Zokniai, the airport in Pajuoste (Panevezys region) looked tidy and well-groomed. [passage omitted] Thus, the restoration of the Pajuoste airport may not require large finances, if the decision to use this heritage for Lithuania's national defense is adopted.
