Do you think the political nature of the strikes is associated with the coming presidential election, or is it perhaps still too early? [Bugaj] You know, I do not think so. At any rate, I think that, so far, the president has been acting with some restraint. I have had the opportunity in the past to voice views in this very studio that were critical of the president, but, regarding this conflict, I must say he has been demonstrating restraint.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Will you vote for Walesa in the presidential election? [Bugaj] I do not think so. I hope there will be a countercandidate for whom I could vote.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And what kind of candidate would it have to be? Let us not give specific names. [Bugaj] You know, I would put it this way--and you are right about not mentioning any names. Whether he would be someone of left-wing or right-wing views--that is rather irrelevant to me, or at least I see that as a secondary issue. But, of course, I would like him to be someone who respects the Constitution very much, who is capable of resolving situations relevant to the president, and who is capable of being an umpire and of enjoying strong authority. But I must say I would prefer this person not to have very strong views because it might happen that he will have to cooperate with very different types of government, of a very different nature, with very different [words indistinct] [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Do you know of such a person? Is there anyone like that in Poland? [Bugaj] You know, I know an enormous number of such people, indeed, but the problem is that none of those figures are distinguished or outstanding enough to be able to take up the post without problems. I think there are such people in the Freedom Union [UW], and perhaps I could find them in our party, too. I would not hesitate to say there are also such people at the very right-wing end of the political scene. I think the most important matter is that we shape the Constitution in a way that would prevent the presidency from becoming something like the chief executive office, or something of that nature because.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And can I ask you to give a name now? [Bugaj] You know, what I think is that, for instance, when it comes to the UW, both Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Jacek Kuron are the kinds of people who fulfill my criteria, and when it comes to our circles, both Karol Modzelewski and, for instance, Aleksander Malachowski fulfill the criteria. Which does not mean that they want or are able to run--that is a separate issue. [passage omitted]
