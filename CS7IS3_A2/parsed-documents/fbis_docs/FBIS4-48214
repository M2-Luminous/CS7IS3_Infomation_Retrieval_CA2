He told the Malian press that he was not questioned at the Bamako gendarmerie, where he was taken. Reliable police sources in Abidjan disclosed that the former AEEM leader left Abidjan aboard an aircraft from the Air Transport and Liaison Group, a national company. Mr. Mariko disclosed that he was questioned in Abidjan on his meetings with opposition leaders and Ivorian students. No legal action is being taken against him in Mali. He arrived in Cote d'Ivoire on 10 May on his way from Ouagadougou, where he had been staying for a week as part of a tour aimed at establishing "a leftist African youth organization." For two years now, the AEEM, which is backed by several Malian opposition parties, has been at the root of violent demonstrations against President Alpha Oumar Konare's government. The association is contesting the new criteria for the allocation of student grants, which henceforth will be based on examination results. AEEM has 500,000 members, and was at the root of the March 1991 demonstrations, which led to the ousting of Former Malian President Moussa Traore.
