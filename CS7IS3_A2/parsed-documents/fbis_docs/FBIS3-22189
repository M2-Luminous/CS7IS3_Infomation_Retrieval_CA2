In its latest order issued on 11 January, the Election Commission has directed the State Government to undertake `special revision' of electoral rolls in respect of the 40 Assembly constituencies (out of the total 126) where their use had been stayed pending `approval and clearance of the Election Commission.' This unusual intervention, withholding the publication of electoral rolls of almost one-third of the total number of constituencies in the State, was made between the publication of the draft electoral rolls on 5 October 1993 and the eve of the publication of the final electoral rolls on 27 December 1993. This step clearly invested the popular perception among most Assamese speaking people that the State had a very large number of `illegal aliens' most of whom were seen as inhabiting the very areas covered by these Assembly constituencies, illustrative of the catholicity of the political choice of these `suspected illegal aliens' is the fact that candidates from all the major political parties in the State were returned from these 40 constituencies in the last elections, though there was a marked preference for the Congress whose nominees, won from 23 of these constituencies. The other parties representing the remaining 17 of these `suspect' constituencies are: AGP (Asom Gana Parishad (Assam People's Council)) (five, including Barhampur, represented by the former Chief Minister, Mr. Prafulla Kumar Mahanta), BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) (four), Bodoland Legislature Party (three), CPI (Communist Party of India) (two), SUCI (two) and Independent (one). Basic document: The most interesting feature of the `special revision' with 1 January 1994 as the `qualifying date,' is that they will have as the basic document the draft electoral rolls published on 5 October last year. In other words, the Election Commission has taken exception to the procedures and actual conduct followed in the preparation of the final electoral rolls between that date and 27 December 1993, and has directed the State authorities to go over the whole process once again. All indications are that the impasse will not be broken since the structures in the State (as well as the political and other compulsions that presumably vitiated the earlier process remain the same. The Election Commission has also directed the State authorities to take up a `summary revision' with respect to the 86 Assembly constituencies whose final electoral rolls it had allowed to be published barely three weeks ago, with 1 January as the fresh qualifying date.
