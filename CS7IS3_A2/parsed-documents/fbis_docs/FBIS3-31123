Its principal objectives have been clearly identified: Poland's accession to Western security structures as well as those concerned with European economic and political integration. This aim is being fulfilled by developing close relations with the European Community, now the European Union, and with EFTA [European Free Trade Association], as well as by establishing special links with the Visegrad countries and consolidating very good relations with Poland's neighbors. Poland's integration into the European Union remains of vital national interest. Poland needs a Union that is open to its neighbors in Central and Eastern Europe. The absence of such openness would signify the continuation of old divisions or the creation of new ones. We in Poland are expecting the intensification of trade links, the extension of political dialogue, an intensification of our participation in the mechanisms of European political cooperation, an adjustment in the level of support given to our efforts at transforming and modernizing our country, and the completion of the integration of Central Europe in the interests of both Western Europe and Poland itself. Following the fall of Communism in 1989, Europe entered into a period of essential structural transformation, a complex, long-term process. In the eyes of the postcommunist countries, this process goes hand in hand with the task of defining their place within the new European structure. We are seeing an entirely unique opportunity presenting itself in Europe. Throughout its history, Europe has rarely been at peace and has never been unified. Now, the opportunity for a unification of this kind would appear to be emerging. This conjunction of new European realities, the awareness of new needs, and the possibility of creating a unique opportunity constitute a major challenge for the political architects of Europe. In Central and Eastern Europe we are experiencing a rapid differentiation of the pace of political and economic transformation in its various parts. Poland and its partners in the Visegrad group (Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia) are already operating on the basis of principles identical to those of their Western partners. However, the general division of Europe is partially persisting: The Iron Curtain has turned into a line demarcating prosperity. Tradesmen's Europe Although Europe has always been divided along the lines of the prosperity of its societies, this division is currently making itself most keenly felt as a result of the cessation of antagonism between the Western and Eastern blocs. It would be impossible to neglect this division. Such a socioeconomic variant of the old politico-military division of the continent is, in the longer term, exerting a destabilizing effect on Europe. The consequences of the illegal arms traffic, of organized crime, of uncontrolled migratory movements, of ecological catastrophes, and of the phenomena associated with economic crisis will not merely affect the eastern part of the continent. The appearance of a new wall would put an end, in the political sphere, to all that Europe has achieved since the changes of 1989-90 and that it has quite rightly raised to the rank of something of common value. At present, we are witnessing three parallel phenomena in Europe: integration, the reemergence of nationalism, and intranational divisions. The process of Western European integration within the context of the European Union, initiated by the founding fathers of Europe--Robert Schumann, Jean Monnet, De Gasperi, Spaak, Adenauer--is currently undergoing a crisis in the eyes of the majority of elites in the countries belonging to the European Community. Integration still remains the primary objective, but sometimes we have the feeling that the notion of European construction, as it existed after World War II, has been lost sight of, and that we are moving toward a "tradesmen's Europe" rather than a "politically planned Europe." Security policy in Europe is faced with new intellectual and structural challenges. The concepts of security that existed before 1989 boasted military significance, above all. Today, ecological and socioeconomic factors also have to be taken into account, and security is no longer viewed as a principle of conduct. Today, faced with the requirements to bring about systemic changes in the East as quickly as possible, and to accelerate the integration processes in the West, security is acquiring a new dimension, which is above all more dynamic. In Poland, help in achieving these transformations must be treated as an essential component of security policy, which takes nonmilitary factors into account in equal measure. Unfortunately, the positive transformations which are being accomplished in Central and Eastern Europe have also brought to light the weaknesses of the countries involved, as well as the risks to which they are exposed. Neither the East nor the West were prepared for the emergence of new phenomena on such a large scale. It could even be said that we were all surprised, especially with regard to the pace and extent of these transformations. So far, in international politics, no effective instruments have been devised for solving the nascent problems. Moreover, no system has been perfected for achieving harmonious links between the various countries' rights to self-determination and national sovereignty, on the one hand, while respecting ethnic and cultural peculiarities and reconciling the trends running counter to regional and global integration with the centrifugal mechanisms driven by ethnic and cultural imperatives, on the other. Consequently, during this crucial period, it is extremely important that we continue to be tireless in our search for the appropriate means to resolve the new, interlinked problems that are continually arising. It is important that all the parties concerned participate in this search. The orientation toward the West and European integration have become the strategic linchpins of Polish foreign policy. The essential aim of this policy is to lend a durable and indissociable character to Poland's political, economic, cultural, and civilization-related ties with the Western world. We must ensure that the Polish presence becomes a durable feature of the institutions and system of European integration, so that our country becomes an indispensable constituent of this system. That would constitute the best guarantee of Polish development within the context of European construction, with which we identify.
