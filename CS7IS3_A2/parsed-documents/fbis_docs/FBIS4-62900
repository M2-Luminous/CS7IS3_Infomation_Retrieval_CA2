A proposal to dissolve the current government and to form a new one was moved by the party Isamaa (Fatherland), the major one in the government coalition. According to Defence Minister Indrek Kannik, the main reason for the cabinet's possible resignation is internal differences between government members. Kannik himself was asked a few hours before to step down as defence minister by Mart Laar, Estonia's prime minister and Isamaa leader.
