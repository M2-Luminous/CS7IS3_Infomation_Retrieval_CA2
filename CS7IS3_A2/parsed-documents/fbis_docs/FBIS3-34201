President Mubarak said that Egyptians are committed to the continuation of the economic reform program, even though they have suffered from some of its side effects, because they realize that today's sacrifices will ensure economic prosperity in the future. In a comprehensive interview with the French magazine POLITIQUE INTERNATIONALE [INTERNATIONAL POLICY], President Mubarak said fundamentalism is a phenomenon that exists in all societies and it is wrong to view it as concerning only Islam. He added that the real objective of the terrorist groups is to seize power and they are using Islam as a cover. The president said: We are capable of resolving the terrorism problem and of putting it in its true perspective. He also stressed that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles is irrevocable because it reflects the feelings of the great majority of Palestinians and Israelis even though the agreement is not ideal. He added that the UN resolutions are the reference point and framework for the peace process and that the current negotiations are hard and need both patience and time. He stressed that history does not repeat itself. On the current Arab developments, President Mubarak said: No one is happy with the Iraqi people's tribulations. We are looking forward to the day when it will be over.
