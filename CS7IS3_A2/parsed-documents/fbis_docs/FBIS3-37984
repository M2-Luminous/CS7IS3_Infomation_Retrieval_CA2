An agreement to this effect was concluded during the recent vivit by Azerbaijan's official delegation to the Central Asian republic. The document was signed between the Turkmennebitgasexport organization and the Azerigas state-run company. The agreement provides for clearing payments in hard currency. The contracting sides settled the price at the level of 80 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas, transport carges inclusive. Azerbaijan is to supply Turkmenistan with industrial equipment, consumer goods and foodstuffs for the sum equivalent to the value of gas supplies. As for gas supplies to Ukraine, Turkmen Oil and Gas Minister Nazar Suyunov [title as received] confirmed they had been fully discontinued because of unpaid debts. However, it does not mean that Turkmenistan rejects any counter proposals, he stressed. The republic is ready to consider them on any positive basis. Suyunov noted Ukraine's commercial structures are willing to cooperate but they cannot do this bypassing state-run organizations resolutely determined not to pay off their debts. Once, the minister explained, Turkmenistan offered clearing settlements to Ukraine, but the latter turned down the offer. Now it also refuses to honour its bills. According to the Turkmen minister, such an approach is rather surprising, to say the least. However, Turkmenistan is still ready to search for mutually acceptable solutions, which is proved by its agreements with Georgia and Azerbaijan, Suyunov said.
