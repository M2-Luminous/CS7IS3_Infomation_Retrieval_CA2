Pejak: "The General Laughs at Rumors About Resignation"] [Text] Jahorina, Feb -- General Ratko Mladic, commander of the general staff of the army of the Srpska republic, has not appeared in public for some time. This has caused all sorts of speculation. Along the right bank of the Drina, "the well informed" were even saying that Mladic had resigned. In a conversation with our correspondent on Mt. Jahorina [near Sarajevo] recently, the general first laughed at that and then explained the reasons for his absence: "I was not there because I was busy with obligations at the front. In this situation, I do not want to be very much present in public, because in this way, people get used to individuals. And there are some personalities who possess more authority, so let us rather have them in the public eye. I am doing my job as well as my knowledge, capabilities, abilities allow, together with my associates. What matters is that there are some evident results of this," Mladic said. Replying to the observation that the term "withdrawal" is very much present in this war, Mladic said the following: "Withdrawal has never brought luck to anybody. We have to free ourselves from the Serb syndrome that by withdrawing in 1915 and 1916, we achieved our aims. I am not saying that this was right or wrong. However, in that war there were some sort of tactics and `stop-go' strategies. They experienced a disaster. One should only compare a withdrawal with this `stop-go' strategy and draw a conclusion. It is clear what should be done: One should only look straight ahead and walk straight on and up. I do not know what withdrawal means. Withdrawal can take place in a way at a moment when the war chaos in the regions of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the former Yugoslavia is settled by political means, when the hatchets are buried by those people who have dug them out and have set off to attack the Serbian people, when they withdraw their declaration of war on the Serbian people, when they express a real wish for peace and put their signature to it. Only then can we return our weapons to our barracks and get ready in case a new holocaust befalls the Serbian people."
