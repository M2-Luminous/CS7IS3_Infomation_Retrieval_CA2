This is the first time the sides have met for formal talks since the introduction of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. Jack Katzenell reports: [Begin recording] [Katzenell] The talks ended a short while ago. Major General Rothschild came out, and he said there would be another meeting next week. He said he had not engaged in negotiations proper, merely preparations, discussions of a wide range of subjects, problems that had cropped up, and things that had to be discussed. I asked him if there was any truth in the report that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was unwilling to proceed to the next stage of the autonomy until the Palestinians had proven themselves in the area of civilian administration. [Rothschild] Well, the fact that I am here, dealing with Dr. Nabil Sha'th on issues of the continuation of the peace process, shows you that Israel will do whatever is needed as far as the DOP [Declaration of Principles] is concerned. [Katzenell] When the group convened this morning, Minister of the Environment Yosi Sarid was also present. His meeting with Nabil Sha'th was more like a reunion of old friends. When Sarid came out, he was asked by a reporter when Nabil Sha'th would be visiting Jerusalem: [Sarid] There is no problem. Jerusalem is a free city, open city, and the only problem is to coordinate Dr. Nabil Sha'th's visit in Jerusalem. The problem is in coordination. [passage omitted] [end recording] [A related report on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 28 June adds: "Dr. Nabil Sha'th says he advised Yasir 'Arafat to postpone his arrival in the autonomy territories because having visited Jericho himself, he realized that the local security arrangements are inadequate." [The report adds that Gen. Rothschild said "that in his meeting with Sha'th, a decision was made to expedite the resumption of the negotiations on the transfer of civilian powers in Judaea and Samaria to the Palestinians."] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1005 GMT on 28 June carries a report on an interview with Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq by Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe, adding that "Baraq said that the implementation of the agreement in Gaza is making good progress." "In response to a question on whether Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahaq has ended his role as head of the Israeli delegation, Baraq said: Do not worry. Gen. Shahaq was not, is not, and will not be removed from this activity. Who will conduct the talks in Judaea and Samaria? we asked. The composition of the delegation and the way it will be managed will be determined by the government, along with the details as to what will be discussed and when. Gen. Shahaq completed an important circle in the signing of the agreement, and he will continue to follow and coordinate the activities of the various IDF branches vis-a-vis the Palestinians. On the practical, civilian level, contacts will be managed by Maj. Gen. Dani Rothschild, coordinator of government activities in the territories. On issues regarding the security committee, in which the Planning Branch takes part, the talks will be managed by Maj. Gen. 'Uzi Dayan."]
