This week, L. Petkanchin, the Bulgarian deputy minister for energy, visited NOVEM to hold further talks regarding a project for the local communities in his country to save energy. Of the bilateral aid The Netherlands is giving to East Europe, NOVEM is paying for technical advice from consultants, modern measuring equipment, and supervision. Energy consumption by Bulgarian (Government) buildings, households, and industry is very high. There is the threat of an energy crisis because the bills can no longer be paid. One quarter of the fuel used for generating electricity is imported from Russia. The Bulgarian partners in the project began by measuring the energy consumption of local communities. In addition, advice and training was given for improving organization and making cleaner use of heating and ventilation systems. NOVEM's experience in energy saving in The Netherlands is a guideline. The Bulgarians were taught that they have to contend with not only a financial problem, but also a quality problem. According to NOVEM's T. Verkerk, Bulgaria can save 10 to 15 percent of its energy consumption without any costs at all, and another 15 percent by making small investments. This project serves as an example and as a step toward wide scale energy saving projects to be funded by the Bulgarian Government, the East European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank.
