Vladimir Shumeyko Succeeds in Weapons Training at Baltic Fleet Base"] [Text] Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko hit three half-length practice targets with short assault-rifle bursts fired "from the shoulder," thus having attained an officer's performance standard. Deputy Defense Minister Konstantin Kobets has registered the result. Leaving the firing range in the city of Baltiysk -- the main base of the Baltic Fleet -- the speaker said that he would oppose the Finance Ministry's attempts to slash the Armed Forces' financing, because "servicemen have no benefits; on the contrary, they receive less than their due." Local servicemen claim that a recent statement by Polish President Lech Walesa about an overconcentration of troops in Kaliningrad Oblast does not square with reality. Governor Yuriy Matochkin has told SEGODNYA that "around 10 percent of the oblast population have a direct relation to the Armed Forces," that is, around 90,000 people. According to the Baltic fleet staff, there are slightly more than 25,000 men serving in the fleet, although an average crew's strength is only 65 percent of the standard level. The command insists that the personnel has shrunk drastically in the past few years, as has the number of ships. Vladimir Yegorov, the fleet's commander-in-chief, says that the fleet includes only a few submarines, which are currently being withdrawn from Latvia's Liepaja. Only two of them are operational, and none of them is nuclear, the commander said. "There have never been any nuclear arms in Baltiysk," a press center staffer said. Officials at the Baltic Fleet staff say the last force to become part of the fleet was a missile boat squadron pulled out from Poland last year. Lieutenant General Anatoliy Pimenov, commander of the 11th Guards Army, which is deployed in the oblast, says that the last time his army was expanded was three years ago, when a motor rifle division withdrawn from Czechoslovakia was attached to it. Afterward, no troops have been redeployed to Russia's Baltic enclave, the servicemen say, while reports on the concentration of the military force have been prompted by foreign observers' mistaking units that pass the oblast on their way from East Europe for new troops. It is not yet clear, however, how the upcoming merger of the region's two military bases -- in Baltiysk and St. Petersburg -- under a single command may affect the enclave's military might. Observers do not rule out that troops may be reallocated between the bases, and then new submarines may emerge in Baltiysk. Oblast Administration chief Yuriy Matochkin, like a number of the Baltic Fleet's top officers, believes that "further reductions in the fleet are inevitable. And considerable ones at that -- up to 40 percent." Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Yegorov states firmly, however: "In our view, it cannot be any smaller. And the General Staff agrees."
