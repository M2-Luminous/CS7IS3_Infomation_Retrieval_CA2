The recent price index for Guangzhou City increased 17.5 percent, which was 7.6 percentage points lower than last year's average. According to preliminary estimates from departments in charge of price administration, the index dropped nine percent or so in May, which was markedly lower than the average increase in prices in the first quarter of this year. The rising trend in the general level of retail commodity prices has slowed down. Retail prices of a number of nonstaple foodstuffs and industrial products for daily use are lower than in the same period last year. In order to deal with such problems as the production of fake and inferior goods, reaping staggering profits, asking exorbitant prices, and monopolizing the market, and to standardize pricing behavior, from 6 June on, departments in charge of the commodity price inspection in the city will strengthen the administration of work encouraging sales at marked prices and will punish, in strict accordance with laws and regulations, units and individuals who do not sell commodities at marked prices in a standardized manner. The practice of unreasonable charges levied in the service sector will be punished according to provincial regulations on the administration of executive charges, state regulations on price administration, and other laws and regulations.
