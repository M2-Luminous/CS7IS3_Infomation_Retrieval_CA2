This crisis was brought about mainly by the fall in the prices of our main agricultural produce for export, notably cocoa, coffee, cotton, palm oil, and rubber. As you know, the economic crisis is not limited to Cote d'Ivoire alone, it does not spare any country in Africa. Since the beginning of the 1980's, most African countries have been coping with this external constraints through the implementation of structural adjustment programs and important reforms, demanding increasing sacrifices from the people, were effected. Of course, some considerable results were obtained, but it is sad to note that the hope we expected from these sacrifices has not as yet been sufficiently achieved. On the contrary, we note that the daily difficulties of the hard-working people have increased, which obviously calls for a reform in the economic strategy. It is within this context that the heads of state of African countries, members of the franc zone, have just unanimously decided, in consultation with France and all their development partners, to use monetary adjustment as an instrument of economic policy. In fact, in the face of persistent economic and financial difficulties of each of their countries, and having the improvement of the living conditions of their people at heart, they feel that this measure will offer them new chances to attain the objectives of lasting economic growth and sustained development. To this end, with effect from 11 January, the exchange rate of the CFA franc has been modified as follows: 100 CFA francs are equal to 1 French franc instead of 50 CFA francs to 1 French franc. This adjustment in the exchange rate of the CFA franc will considerably improve the competitiveness of our export commodities, considerably increase the level of productive investment, free our economic potentialities, and generate the creation of new jobs. This historic decision of African heads of state of the franc zone is the assertion of the solidarity, which had, through intensified cooperation, enabled us to make this zone a solid and dynamic monetary space for the benefit of all its members. The modification in the exchange rate of the CFA franc falls in line with the actions taken by our countires to successfully carry out their common project concerning particularly business laws, insurance settlements, social security, and the specific knowledge of economic and social realities. Concerning our subregion, what must be stressed particularly is the rich prospects now open by the important project of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, UEMOA, which has just been created, because regional integration will multiply the possibilities offered to each of our economies. The conditions for a revival of the economic growth are not clear. It is up to all -- businessmen, state functionaries, farmers, and private sector workers, and so on -- to take advantage of all these new opportunities created by the decision of the African heads of state of the franc zone and act in such a way that our country will, in unity, hard work, and peace, regain the exceptional performance it accomplished in the past. A special appeal is made to all private investors -- both nationals and foreigners -- to play their role in the development of our country. Concerning the immediate effects of the modification in the exchange rate of our currency, it is worth stressing that the normalization of our relations with the international financial community will be translated into the regular payment of salaries in the public sectors and parastatals. Concerning the effects on prices, specific measures will be taken to mitigate the effects of price hikes. But already a selective lowering of taxes is envisaged with the intensification of financial management of the state with an attendant radical improvement in tax collection. The prime minister and minister of economy and finance will address the nation on this subject in the next few days to give all the details on all the necessary backup measures concerning this decision. Ivorians and friends of Cote d'Ivoire, who are not used to devaluation so frequent in other countries, are called upon to display a sense of calm and confidence in the future of our country. They should receive the news of this devaluation as the signal for a new departure for more effort, for more prosperity, and profit.
