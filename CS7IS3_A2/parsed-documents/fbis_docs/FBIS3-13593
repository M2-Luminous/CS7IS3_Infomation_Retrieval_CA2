In an interview with Iraqi television aired tonight, the minister added that most UNSC members have actually begun to call for the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, and that their consciences are now burdened by the Iraqi people's sufferings, which are caused by the continued enforcement of the criminal and unfair embargo. The minister maintained that Iraq is bound to emerge victorious, noting that the Iraqi people's patience is matchless, because they have held out in the face of the most ferocious onslaught in history. The minister went on to say: Since inspection teams started their work, there has been full compliance with the unfair resolutions passed against Iraq. The minister wondered how many paragraphs of the unfair resolutions passed against Iraq have violated its sovereignty and independence, how many violations Iraq has suffered, and who drew up the parallels that encroach upon Iraq's national sovereignty. Al-Sahhaf noted that the game of the handling of Resolution 687 has become clearer, not only to politicians, but also to all citizens, and to all observers who take an interest in this matter, which is in violation of all UN conventions and international laws. The minister said: Resolution 687 was passed on 3 April 1991 after it was submitted to the UNSC by the arch-leaders of colonialism. Sixteen drafts of this resolution were made. After that, new amendments and changes were introduced into it. Only then was it put to a vote. Twelve members of the UNSC voted in favor of the resolution. Cuba voted against it, because it is a courageous and audacious country. Two nonpermanent members of the UNSC, Ecuador and Yemen, abstained. Certain countries, such as China, voted in its favor, but explained their positions, criticizing several paragraphs of this resolution. The foreign minister added: This resolution consists of an introduction and 34 operative paragraphs. It is lengthy and complicated. Its operative paragraphs were deliberately divided into nine sections, the pivotal points are in Section C, which was addressed by leader President Saddam Husayn in his valuable speech the day before yesterday. On 3 April 1991, the resolution was passed. On 6 April 1991 Iraq informed the UNSC of its frank and clear stand on the resolution in a lengthy and refined message grounded in the rules of international law and the UN Charter. Iraq addressed all these paragraphs in accordance with the rules of international law. It explained how these paragraphs violate the rules of international law. At the end of the message, and this is an important thing that I must mention, Iraq, through then Foreign Minister Ahmad Husayn, said "while noting these principled, legal, and legitimate remarks, Iraq urges conscientious members of the international community and the public to see the facts as they are, and to vindicate justice as appropriate. Given all of the above, Iraq has no choice but to accept this resolution." We demanded that this message be circulated as a UNSC document. The request was fulfilled. The minister went on to say: The purpose was to confirm our legal and legitimate rights, which are grounded in the UN Charter and the rules of international law, so that these rights could not be mistaken, even though we accepted this resolution under the circumstances. The second remark I would like to make, which is an extremely important one, is the following: Line 3 of the preamble of Resolution 687 stipulates that all member states are committed to safeguarding Iraq's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence. The authors of this resolution violated the basic concepts enshrined in this sentence in several paragraphs of the same resolution. Several paragraphs of the said resolution conflict with these basic concepts, which are cherished by the international community. Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf noted that this remark should be made so that we may understand the facts pertaining to the unfair and sweeping embargo clamped on Iraq. Al-Sahhaf added: Resolution 661 of 6 August 1990 explained why this unfair embargo was imposed. It said that the embargo was imposed because Iraq had not accepted Resolution 660 of 2 August 1990. What about Resolution 660? Resolution 660 consists of two paragraphs calling upon Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, and urging Kuwait and Iraq to negotiate to resolve their problems. It also states that the UNSC welcomes all efforts to achieve this, especially the efforts of the Arab League. Al-Sahhaf went on to say: Iraq later accepted all these resolutions, including 660, 661, etc. As for the UNSC, it did not honor its commitments. Then, they drafted this resolution, thus "forgetting about" all their previous resolutions. They set new conditions and brought about a new situation that exposes the true motives for the aggression against Iraq.
