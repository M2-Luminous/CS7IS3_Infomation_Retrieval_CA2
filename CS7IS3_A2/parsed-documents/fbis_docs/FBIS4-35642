Talking to THE MUSLIM here on Monday [word indistinct] officials of the three organisations expressed their serious reservations about the contents of the malicious story and above all about the timing of the publication of the story. The story has been published around the time the Indian Prime Minister was in the US and two days before the private visit of the Pakistani President. Knowledgeable sources said it was pertinent to note that WASHINGTON POST's correspondent visited Pakistan in the last week of March and met only an official of the level of Director General in Islamabad. The Foreign Minister and the Foreign Secretary had declined to meet him because of their preoccupations with important matters. Intriguingly, the WASHINGTON POST correspondent chose to file his story a month and half after his visit. That he had to wait for such a long time to file his story is indicative of mala fide [as published] intentions. According to the report reproduced by THE GUARDIAN in its issue dated May 17, 1994, Pakistan military sources admit they have resumed arming, training and providing logistical support to militants fighting Indian security forces in Kashmir less than a year after convincing the US they had adopted a hands off policy there. The report goes on to say: "The Pakistan Army's Inter-Services Intelligence directorate -- akin to the CIA -- and its field intelligence unit are coordinating the shipment of arms from Pakistani Kashmir to the Indian side where Muslim insurgents are waging a protracted war, the sources said. They said the Pakistani military was also occasionally helping to train militants and coordinate their fight against India. India and Pakistan each control a portion of Kashmir, but each claim the entire region. Pakistani officials denied any active role in arming or training militants. The US considers Kashmir a potential flashpoint for a nuclear war. India and Pakistan -- both capable of making nuclear bombs -- have fought three wars since independence 47 years ago -- two of them being over Kashmir. "The Pakistani military sources -- including two serving and two recently retired army officials involved in the ISI's Kashmir operations -- said Pakistan had suspended active support for the insurgency last year when the US threatened to include it to the list of countries sponsoring terrorism. This would automatically have served aid and business ties between the two countries. Pakistan then `privatised' its Kashmir operations, funneling support to militants through non-governmental organisations often run by retired army and ISI officials, the sources said. They said that when the US failed to include Pakistan to the terrorist list, the army resumed its active operations early this year, although at a reduced level. "In its annual report on terrorism released this month, the US State Department confirmed `there were credible reports in 1993 of official Pakistani support to Kashmir militants'. `Many private organisations also continue to arm the insurgents with the Pakistani help', the sources said. Giving his comments on the WASHINGTON POST/THE GUARDIAN report, a spokesman of the Foreign Office said that though the correspondent who has filed this report, usually carries objective reports, unfortunately and surprisingly the report in question is totally baseless and fabricated. The correspondent he said, has failed to substantiate his report with circumstantial evidence. Except for quoting some unidentified sources, the correspondent has not mentioned any spot or the name of the camps where the Kashmiri guerrillas are being allegedly trained and armed, the Foreign Office spokesman said. The ISI sources while talking to THE MUSLIM said that the story is fabricated to the extent that we don't even wish to comment on it. They, however, made it categorically clear that none of the foreign correspondents or privately with any of the officers in the ISI in particular and with army officers in general. When the top aides of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto were asked if there was any change in Bhutto government's policy with regard to hands-off to Kashmiri guerrillas, they said Ms. Bhutto has time and again made public statements that Pakistan was only supporting the Kashmiri guerrillas diplomatically and politically. They said it is unfortunate to misinterpret the policy statements of the government. A government acts on the same policy which it professes publicly. They said it's a well calculated move to malign a prestigious, sensitive agency which has effectively checked the infiltration and activities of RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] and Mosad agents in Pakistan, particularly in Sindh. The government sources confirmed that this security agency has nabbed a large number of RAW agents from Azad Kashmir and Sindh. They said the lists of these agents would be handed over to the Indian government when and if required.
