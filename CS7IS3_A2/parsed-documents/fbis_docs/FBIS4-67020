The NAD's [narcotics squads] seized 15,000 XTC [ecstasy] tablets and 3,000 LSD stamps -- substances which were practically absent from the market in previous years. Synthetic drugs are in fact cheaper (a tablet costs between 50,000 and 80,000 lire [L], compared to L120,000-150,000 for a heroin dose). According to the "carabinieri," the increase in the use of synthetic drugs explains the reduction in the number of deaths from overdose, which dropped from 1,217 in 1992 to 840 in 1993. Furthermore, the NAD's determined that most of the drugs came from the Netherlands and their price, at the source, was in the region of L2,000-3,000. Milan, Genoa, Verona, and Rome are the major distribution centers. Yesterday the NAD's exposed a Milan woman doctor who had been issuing morphine prescriptions -- in the form of hydrochloride syrup -- to 35 drug addicts, many of whom had criminal records. The prescriptions were made out in the name of a person who had died some time before. Over a three-year period, from 1990 to 1992, she signed 1,600 prescriptions for as many bottles. This doctor's case is not an isolated one: In the course of the police operation, more than 1,000 people were arrested, including 11 medical doctors; 1,584 people were arrested and subsequently released on bail (including 357 doctors and chemists); and 598 kilograms of drugs were seized.
