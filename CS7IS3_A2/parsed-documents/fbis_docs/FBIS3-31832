This was one of the most important conclusions reached at today's negotiations between our and the Serb aggressor delegation at Sarajevo airport. The document, which will most probably be adopted, provides for the opening of a road corridor from Sarajevo via Vogosca [Serb-held district north of Sarajevo center] to Visoko and Zenica [Muslim-held towns in central Bosnia] for humanitarian convoys and all other users with valid documents issued by the relevant authorities.
