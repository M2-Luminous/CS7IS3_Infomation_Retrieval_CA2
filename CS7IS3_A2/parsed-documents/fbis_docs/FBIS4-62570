On returning to Moscow Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev noted that conditions for a political settlement of the conflict in Bosnia had been created in Geneva and that the opposing sides had regarded the ministers' efforts with understanding. "I must say that the response from both the Serb and Muslim leadership was pretty good," the Foreign Ministry head stated. "We were in contact with the prime minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Haris Silajdzic, during which time considerable scope for work on a settlement based on the adopted document emerged. I consider that signals of a readiness to embark on talks without preconditions are also forthcoming from the Serb side, which is very important."
