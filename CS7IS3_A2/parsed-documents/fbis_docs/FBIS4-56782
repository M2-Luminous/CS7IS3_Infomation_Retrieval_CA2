This was announced on 6 May by Brigadier General Ramon Rosa Rodriguez (retired), the Senad executive secretary. He highlighted the key aspects that Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Bolivia, and our country will consider in fight against trafficking. Rodriguez said: "The first measure we took was to open a channel of international communications in the Southern Cone. We have thus adopted a positive line of action to internationalize the struggle against trafficking." He expounded the plan of action followed by Southern Cone countries as of the 12th International Conference on Drug Control held in Quito, Ecuador. On that occasion, Rodriguez was elected drug enforcement coordinator for the Southern Cone. "We will take positive lines of action. We attended a meeting sponsored by the OAS in Mar del Plata [Argentina] three months ago and, in my view, the presentations by the different representatives were lacking in strength," he said. "It all ended in expressions of goodwill, brotherhood, and the like. Now, through the communications channel, we have established an action mechanism. Any Southern Cone country will now have recourse to another by fax, telephone, or other mechanism at hand to ask for help or to exchange information," he explained. The plan's second point deals with the furthering of the regionalization process by member countries. Rodriguez noted that "Southern Cone countries have pledged to participate in joint operations at least once a year." "This does not mean that we will work in other countries. Each country will pursue an established and coordinated task according to its possibilities," he said. Rodriguez added: "We are interested in two things: Marijuana, our number one problem, and cocaine, which we must combat on account of an international commitment. We can now receive direct aid -- without much red tape -- through the communications channel. This means that aid must be granted to any country in the region that requests it." Another subject Rodriguez broached pertains to the legal framework, which in his view, partly favors drug enforcement and partly does not. "This is quite a broad subject. The seizure of 2 kg of cocaine from some Japanese citizens, who offered police personnel a $10,000 bribe and were released by a judge from the Caaguazu area after a week in jail, is just one example," he noted.
