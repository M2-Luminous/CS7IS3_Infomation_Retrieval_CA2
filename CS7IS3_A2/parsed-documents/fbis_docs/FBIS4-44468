The first paragraph is a source-supplied introduction.] [Text] It is the authors' opinion that in implementing the classified tax system, we must adhere to five basic principles: We need a unified policy with administrations at separate levels; financial authority should match administrative authority; the central government should have the bulk of financial power, but local interests should be taken into consideration; fairness and efficiency should be combined; and reform should be radical but gradual. The target mode of China's classified tax system is the radical classified tax system characterized by different kinds of taxes levied at different rates. We can achieve this goal only in steps. That is, we must first set up a classified tax framework, then amplify the mechanisms to regulate regional interests, and lastly, we eliminate the defects left behind by the old system and implement a radical classified tax system. The authors emphasize that the implementation and operation of the classified tax system must be in conjunction with the tax reform, and we must also set up corresponding local tax systems and improve budget management. The conflicts China is facing as its economic system shifts to a different track and our urgent task to increase national strength urge and compel us to accelerate the restructuring of the financial system. After years of deliberation and preparation, the classified tax system, as a modern financial management system, has been formally affirmed by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee, and at any time, it will move from the theoretical probing and experimental stage to the nationwide implementation stage. This is an important move to meet the needs of the socialist market economic development and to put an end to the dissipation of the state's financial strength, the weakening of the central authority's regulation and control power, and the financial plight of governments at all levels. It is a positive step in promoting lawful and scientific financial administration. It is an unprecedented change in China's financial system since the founding of the nation. This article proposes some guiding principles for this reform and for its implementation and operation. I. Guiding Principles and Basic Requirements of the Classified Tax System Modern classified tax system is accepted worldwide in nations that have adopted the market economic system. But different countries' classified tax systems have different characteristics and contents; each has to do with the respective country's situation and financial system. China is a developing nation with a socialist market economic system. Its goal must be to develop the socialist market economy, vitalize public finance, and increase its national strength, so that its classified tax system can have contemporary Chinese characteristics. The overall requirement is to build a financial operating mechanism that meets the needs of the socialist market economy through the classified tax system to improve and strengthen the financial ministry's functions, mobilize the enthusiasm of the central and local governments, distribute the financial strength between central and local governments in a scientific and standardized way, and achieve financial autonomy at every level within the scope stipulated by state laws and national policies. Specifically we must abide by the following five principles: 1. The principle of unified policy and graded administration. China is a unified socialist nation and is fundamentally different from countries uder the federal system. The most important thing in restructuring the financial system is the central government's unified leadership, which is manifested primarily in its unified policies and decrees. From the point of state finances and taxation, the country's basic, and most important, policies and laws and regulations must be unified; there can be no flexibility here. This is a point we must insist on. This means we must insist that the central government has financial leadership and regulation and control rights. On the other hand, China is a large multinational state with geographic, historical, and environmental differences, and unlike some small countries, the central government cannot be too broad or too detailed when exercising control; it must give play to the role of local governments. Creating an administrative hierarchy has important practical implications. Localities should be given reasonable autonomy and legislative power over regional financial and tax laws and regulations as well as methods and systems of operation and interpretation. We should adhere to the principle that every level of government should have its own administrative power and its share of financial power. The central and local authorities have their respective duties and responsibilities, and each should suit measures to local conditions and manage their own financial affairs and balance their own budgets. This is another point we must insist on, for failing to do so will render it impossible to mobilize local initiative and enthusiasm, and then there will be no classified tax to speak of. Under the old system, "every measure has a countermeasure"--it was like a chess game between those on top and those below; it hindered the country's government and weakened public finance. We must insist on changes and replace this with a new system of unified policy with an administrative hierarchy and which is coordinated between the higher and lower levels. 2. The principle of matching financial jurisdiction to administrative jurisdiction. Any amount of administrative power must be guaranteed by the appropriate amount of financial power and financial strength. "One must be paid for the amount of work one performs"--this is a simple and basic principle. Thus, we must determine the amount of administrative authority before we determine the amount of financial power. In implementing the classified tax system, first, we must draw a clear line between the central government's administrative power and that of the local governments at different levels. Thereupon we can separate the tax categories and delimit the financial power. We must make sure that the state and the localities have the financial power and the financial strength to carry out their respective administrative functions, so as to give expression to the principle of integrating responsibilities, rights, and privileges. The delineation of administrative power involves the restructuring of the political system and the standardization of government conduct. We must comply with the demands of the modern market economy and reconsider the status, function, and role of the state government in society. In the past, there were problems of mishandling, abuse, and shirking of administrative power among the state government, enterprises, and society; between the central and local governments; and between the higher and lower level governments. That has to be corrected, so that we can radically solve the problem of financial misallocation. 3. The principle of upholding the central government's dominant financial role while taking care of local interests. A strong and effective central government is the organizational guarantee of the proper administration of important state affairs and solidarity of the people of all regions and nationalities. An important part of being "strong and effective" is having financial strength. If the central government is not backed by substantial financial strength, state administration and macroeconomic regulation and control will be but empty words. In recent years, the central government's income as a percentage of the national income has been declining steadily, and by 1992, it only came to 38.6 percent, which marked the lowest point since the founding of the PRC. This percentage not only was below that of nations with a centralized state power system but was also much lower than nations with a federal system of separation of power. Worries about "heavy branches on a weak trunk" are not just alarmist talk; we must be on the alert. On the other hand, while we insist on giving the central government the dominant financial role, we must take care of local financial interests and give the localities--financial administration at the first level--the necessary political power and some important sources of revenue, so as to fully mobilize local initiative and enthusiasm in taking care of their financial matters as their own masters. We must not over-correct the problem and go back to the old "state monopoly of revenues and expenditures." 4. The principle of balancing fairness and efficiency. Economic development requires efficiency; social stability demands fairness. Efficiency comes first, but we must take fairness into consideration and combine fairness and efficiency. This is an important principle in China's system of income distribution. Thus, linking the benefits of economic development to the government's revenues and expenditures is a necessity; it complies with the needs of the socialist market economic system. In establishing a financial system, it is understandable that for some time, we must give consideration to the vested interests of the economically well-developed coastal regions, but as a unified socialist nation, large disparities in reveue and expenditure and living conditions among different regions not only has an adverse effect on the underdeveloped regions but will ultimately jeoparidze the long-term development of the developed regions. One of the central government's fundamental functions is to balance the regions through macro regulation and control and reasonably limit the differences among the regions and prevent the gap from widening. In particular, there must be a protective policy for public services in the low-income regions. We must scientifically determine a poverty-line; regions that fall below this poverty-line must be given the necessary assistance. As for the autonomous nationality regions and provinces deemed their equivalent, we should extend exceptional care in accordance with laws toward the minority nationalities. This is out of economic consideration, but it is out of political consideration too. 5. The principle of combining reform's radical nature and the need to proceed gradually. The classified tax system involves the comprehensive reallocation and readjustment of financial strength among the governments and among the regions. It affects the economic interests of all parties. We can imagine how sensitive the issues, how sharp the conflicts, and how heated the debates can be. Adding China's complicated situation and the lack of proper conditions in many areas, reform is bound to be difficult and cannot be achieved in one step; we must proceed gradually. Therefore, we must insist on two things: First, we must set the goal of implementing a scientific, radical classified tax system nationwide; this goal should never change. Second, to achieve this goal, we must work hard to create the conditions and move in steady steps until we succeed. In short, the determination of our reform goal should be positve and radical; the implementation of our reform should be gradual and gentle. This will reduce friction and avoid shock, so that we can smoothly attain our reform goal. To uphold the above five principles, we must accomplish the "six conducive" and "two guarantees." That is, everything must be conducive to the construction of a unified socialist market; conducive to the central government's effective macroeconomic regulation and control; conducive to the local governments' autonomous management and lawful financial administration under the supervision of the people's congresses at their corresponding levels; conducive to encouraging the local governments to show interest in local public welfare undertakings and the building and preservation of public facilities; conducive to scientifically smoothing relations between the central and local governments at all levels and clarifying the interest boundaries to reduce friction; conducive to tax collection and management and prevention of loss of tax revenues. On those bases, we can guarantee that the new system will work as expected and guarantee that when the system changes tracks, it can shift without confusion and change in an orderly fashion, so that revenues will increase and budgets will balance at all levels. II. Choice of a Specific Form of Classified Tax System and Its Implementation Procedure As said earlier, the goal of China's restructuring of the financial system is to implement the radical classified tax system. The so called radical classified tax system is a graded financial administration system of classified taxes based on socialist market economic principles and public finance theories. The "radical" nature of this kind of classified tax system is manifested not only in its clear-cut tax categories, but more importantly, it is manifested in its scientific, legislated, standardized administration of revenues and expenditures at separate levels. Today, in nations that have relatively sound classified tax systems, they usually take one of two forms: one form allows revenue-sharing taxes and the other does not. Judging by China's situation, without revenue-sharing taxes, it will be difficult to take care of central and local interests at the same time. Revenue-sharing taxes provide a "common point" between central and local financial interests and facilitate economic development. However, revenue-sharing should not take the form of percentage retention; instead, it should be in the form of "taxing from the same sources" but at different rates. The central and local governments' revenues may be collected at different rates by separate tax organs or by the same organ on their separate behalf; however, each should have autonomous power to tax, not to tax, to exempt, or reduce taxes without interference from the others. Under this method, the delineation of financial power and financial sources is very clear, which is completely in line with the principles of the radical classified tax system. Therefore, it is our opinion that China's classified tax system should be the radical classified tax system characterized by separate tax categories and different tax rates. Implementing the radical classified tax system has broad ramifications and is a complicated, systematic project. In view of China's actual situation and realistic conditions, it will be very difficult to succeed overnight. We must keep pace with the restructuring of the economic system and adhere to the principle of combining the radical and gradual nature of reform and proceed in three steps: Step one: Set up the framework and implement a preliminary classified tax system. The preliminary classified tax system is not a complete classified tax system. Its main purpose is to set up a framework according to the principles and needs of the classified system to create a mechanism in the near-term to lay the foundation to promote and deepen the restructuring of the tax system. The preliminary classified tax system is born out of the contract system and bears two characteristics: On the one hand, it has the basic substance of a modern classified tax system. For example, we can delineate administrative and financial power according to the classified system, concentrate financial power in the hands of the central government, and set up separate central tax and local tax collection organs. On the other hand, it retains many of the original features of the contract system. For example, we will still implement percentage revenue-retention, set the revenue and expenditure bases using the base method, collect income tax based on enterprises' jurisdictional relationship, and retain the original method of delivering subsidies to the higher levels. When reform first begins, these measures are inevitable and are necessary. Its a transitional format that suits the realistic conditions. Step two: Strengthen the regional interest regulation mechanisms and further amplify the classified tax system. Step one of the restructuring of the tax system tries to preserve the original interest pattern and, on that basis, allocates financial strength according to the classified tax system only for the incremental portion; it is but a fledgling classified tax system. According to the principles of the modern classified tax system, there are still many unresolved essential questions we have not dealt with. In particular, we have not achieved the goals of macroeconomic regulation of regional financial interests. Therefore, the main purpose of step two of the reform is to amplify the substantive contents of tax assignment according to the needs of the classified tax system by focusing on the readjustment of the interest pattern. Specifically, the most important thing is to implement the transfer of payment system and gradually introduce the factoring method for calculating expenditures in the process and solve the problem of the widening gap between the rich and poor regions, so as to give expression to the state's macroeconomic regulation and control policy. At the same time, we should create conditions for further deepening the reform to install the classified tax system via financial legislation, by building a tax collection and management contingent, and by developing sources of revenue, so that we can make the "quantitative accumulation" to facilitate the transition from the preliminary classified tax system to the radical classified tax system. Step three: Eliminate the defects left by the old system and implement the radical classified tax system. This reform step is founded primarily on the previous two steps to further smooth relations, perfect the system, define responsibilities and rights and privileges, and eliminate the defects left by the old system. It changes the percentage revenue retention system to a system of classified taxes collected at different rates. We should go all out to promote the factoring method according to objective, scientific, and standardized needs to really smash the original, improper interest pattern, so as to truly meet the needs of radical classified tax system. Specifically, we should: (i) clearly and properly delineate administrative and financial power to comply with political reform and adhere to the principle of b alancing power and obligations; (ii) establish and reinforce the central government's dominant financial role, perfect the transfer of payment system, and amplify the macroeconomic regulation and control system to suit the socialist market economic mechanism; (iii) amplify and strengthen the central and local tax collection and management system and create and develop major sources of tax revenues at different levels to meet the needs of financial administration at separate levels; (iv) set up rigid budget constraints to meet the needs of financial autonomy at each level. We expect that this radical classified tax system can be implemented nationwide by the end of the century. III. Actual Implementation and Operation of the Classified Tax System Overall, the implementation and operation of the classified tax system should coincide with tax reform to link the restructuring of the tax system to the new form of taxation. Specifically: 1. Delineate administrative power and assign spending responsibility. The delineation of administrative power is based on the responsibility of each level of government as assigned in the restructuring of the political system. This task must be carried out as meticulously, quantitatively, clearly, and scientifically as possible based on the separation of government and enterprises and as government functions change to meet the needs of macroeconomic regulation and control. Besides taking care of their respective administrative expenditures, the central government's spending should cover the state's key basic constructions, national defense, foreign relations and foreign aid expenditures, the state's share of price subsidies, interest and principal payment of domestic and foreign loans. Local expenditures should cover local basic constructions, urban construction and public undertakings, agricultural support, pension and welfare, and local share of price subsidies. Certain factors should be used to determine various social development and public welfare expenditures to guarantee the necessary spending in carrying out the government's duties and make sure that every taxpayer receives the same social services. But we must realize that the classified tax system can only be implemented in gradual steps, and we should allow for a crude-to-refined process (especially in 1994 when we build the framework, we should not go into great details,) but we must plant our foothold on the present but look to the future and pay attention to linking up with our long-term goals. 2. Delineate financial authority and assign jurisdiction over specific tax categories. After delineating administrative power, we must delineate financial power based on the mix of tax categories created by the restructuring of the tax system. As for where specifically to draw the line, it is our opinion that tariffs, value-added tax and consumption tax collected by customs, and revenues handed over by the railroad, post and telecommunications, banking, and insurance departments and so on should go to the central government. Agricultural and livestock taxes and odds-and-ends taxes which have always been collected locally should go to the localities. Opinions are more or less unanimous on these, and we need not elaborate here. The two main areas that are more controversial are: One, circulation tax which comprises more than 80 percent of the financial revenues. The localities will find it unacceptable if this tax goes to the central governments, and vice versa. The other is enterprises' income tax. This has to do with the original source of revenue of various levels of governments and the localities; it has deep-rooted blood ties with governments at all levels, and it will be equally difficult no matter who ends up with the jurisdiction. According to the financial ministry's plans, consumption tax goes to the central government, business tax goes to the localities, value-added tax will be shared, and enterprises income tax will continue to be levied according to enterprises' jurisdictional relationship, and the amount will be based on 1993's revenues and expenditures. In our opinion, this program may be far from meeting the needs of the classified tax system and is in fact a new version of the old "double-track system," but in view of today's situation and conditions, it is our best option and the only program everybody can accept at this early stage of the restructuring of the tax system; it is necessary and workable. However, as the restructuring of the tax system deepens, we must gradually make improvements and adjustments, so as to better give expression to the principles of the classified tax system. First, the proportion of revenue-sharing tax should shrink; percentage revenue-retention cannot be applied on a long-term basis. Tax collection based on enterprises' jurisdictional relations should also be changed. Specifically, (i) value-added tax should be changed from a "shared" tax to the central government's "exclusive" tax; it will be the central government's main tax category which guarantees its dominant financial role, so that it will have the financial strength to implement macroeconomic regulation and control. (ii) Enterprise income tax should be changed to "shared" tax and administrative subordination relationship should be ignored. Central and local governments will tax the same sources at different rates to encourage both to be concerned about enterprises' management and administration and economic efficiency and prevent governments at different levels from treati ng enterprises differently based on their jurisdictional ties, so as to facilitate enterprises' fair competition. 3. Implement a reasonable transfer of payment system based on the central government's macro regulation and control needs. According to the needs of the classified tax system, most of the income should go to the central government, and most of the spending should be in the localities. Financially, the central government needs room for maneuvering to give expression to the state's macroeconomic decisions and intentions through various kinds of rebates and subsidies. We should change today's "upward flow of funds," which in some sense puts the central government under the control of the localities, to "downward flow of funds," which gives the central government macro regulation and control power over the localities. We need the following types of subsidies: (i) Balancing subsidy--systemic subsidy used mainly to balance local budgets and help the localities to meet basic expenditures for carrying out the government's functions. (ii) General subsidy--used mainly on projects which the state wants but the localities cannot afford to undertake because of lack of financial means, or on projects which when taken by one locality will benefit many. For example, subsides for water conservancy projects, compulsory education, disaster prevention and relief, immunization, and family planning. (iii) Special subsidy--subsidy for large construction projects, agricultural development matching funds, and price subsidies and so on. (iv) Extraordinary subsidy--primarily to aid large natural disasters and other extraordinary events. In short, through transfer of payment, we can strengthen the financial ministry's role as lever and strengthen the central government's macroeconomic regulation and control capability. In the future, the high level financial departments should guide the lower level departments not by "red-heading documents" and administrative orders but mainly by enticing them with financial gains. 4. Actively create conditions and adopt unified objective standards and scientific method to determine revenue and expenditure bases. One of the important features of the classified tax system is the adoption of the factoring method to calculate revenue and expenditure, but because of various limitations, implementing that method requires a long process. Except for the first year of the classified tax system--that is, in 1994--when we will continue to use the base-year method because we don't have much time, we should adopt some transitional methods in subsequent years and draw closer to the factoring method in steps. Specifically, we should calculate the per-capita financial revenue capacity based on the legally-set tax rate and actual tax base and other factors and use those as basis for determining the percentage or amount of various subsidies. In calculating spending, we can use a combination of the factoring and base methods. That is, we should adhere to the principle of the factoring method, treat the original base as a "historical factor," take it into consideration along with other objective factors, and integrate ordinary needs with extraordinary needs and theoretical spending base with actual spending base. While we should take vested interests into consideration, we should not try to protect all vested interests. We should make ordinary needs the base and use extraordinary needs to readjust and amend ordinary needs. In actual operation, first, we should determine a national per-capita spending norm and then consider various objective factors that can affect that norm and come up with a revision coefficient for making revisions and adjustments and verify all aspects of the spending base. At the beginning, we can use a "rough" figure (be as simple and direct as possible.) The proportion of objective factors can be smaller, and except for such basic factors as population, land, and administrative districts which determine expenditures, the main factor is the special subsidies. Later, the objective factors should proportionally play a larger role and historical factors a smaller role, and we should be even more scientific and precise in our calculations until we implement the factoring method in full. IV. Establishing Local Taxation Systems The core of the local tax systems consists of three issues: the scope of local income, legislative and administrative jurisdiction, and installation of tax organs. 1. Expand the scope of local tax revenues. We hope to see a gradual increase in the share of local taxes to 30 percent of the state's total tax revenues and 70-80 percent of the total local revenues. We must foster and develop sources of tax revenues using this as basis. In developing local tax systems, we should expand local revenues' "two proportions": The first is the proportion of local revenues to local national income. In particular, we should change the situation where the non-state-owned economy contributes a disproportionate share of revenues. Secondly, when local governments gather funds in society, they should increase the proportion of tax revenues and reduce the share of non-tax revenues, so as to gradually eliminate the "three chaos." After the implementation of the classified tax system, in the near-term, the bulk of local tax revenues will come from the circulation and service sectors. Therefore the localities must vigorously develop tertiary industry and enliven commercial circulation, and while they actively promote the development of the state-owned economy and collective economy, they must also encourage individual and private economies. In addition, we must pay attention to protecting, developing, and utilizing local resources and develop more sources of resource tax (resource tax should best be allocated to the localities or be shared based on different tax rates in the future.) 2. Expand local (referring to provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions) legislative organs' power to legislate local taxation. Basic laws pertaining to local taxation nationwide should be formulated by the central government, and within the scope of the basic laws' regulations, local people's congresses may consider local conditions to formulate implementation methods and individual laws applicable to some local tax categories. They should have the right to determine the scope of taxation, the tax rate, the amount, and the starting point of taxation as well as the right to decide when to begin or stop taxing and to grant tax exemption and reduction. We must enhance the local people's congresses' legislative authority and strengthen the local people's congresses and governments' concept of being responsible to the masses and the taxpayers. Characteristically, local taxes are "taken from the localities to be spent on the localities," and the localities should have greater autonomy. They must "open the front door and close the back door." As long as the central government's interests are not being compromised, as long as the unity of the nation's basic orders is not jeopardized, the central government should not interfere with the tax laws and regulations local people's congresses have introduced through normal legislative processes. Central authorities and local supervisory departments may check and rectify taxes and fees that have not been legislated through normal procedure, and local parties may refuse to carry out the orders. 3. Set up branch tax organs. In the wake of the implementation of the classified tax system, we must set up separate central and local tax organs to collect and manage state and local taxes. We have already reached a consensus on this point. The question now is how to set up those tax organs after introducing the classified tax system. We have two options: One, we can turn the existing tax organs into state tax bureaus and local tax bureaus. Two, we can turn the existing tax organs into state tax bureaus and set up local tax bureaus using the agricultural tax department and financial department as bases. We think the second option is better, because we can avoid the trouble and complication of having to "divide up the people, household, and properties" in the process; it can help steady the cadres' minds and will not affect current tax collection. Moreover, letting the localities themselves set up local tax organs is something local governments value and support, and they can provide the conditions and basis in terms of setup, funding, and leadership and functional mainstay. Our concrete suggestions for setting up local tax organs are: (i) Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should be the basic units responsible for setting up local tax organs. They should suit measures to local conditions. In principle, local tax bureaus should be set up in provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions,) cities (autonomous prefectures,) and counties (cities); city-administered districts should have local tax branch bureau; township and urban district branch bureaus should set up local tax offices. As the provincial government's agencies, prefectural administrative offices generally should not set up local tax bureaus, but, if agreed by the province or autonomous region, some localities may set up local tax bureaus so long as they retain their existing prefecture-level budgetary status. (ii) Local financial departments and local tax organs should implement the leadership management system of "hanging up two signs but having one leading group." The head of the province-level financial department (bureau) should serve as head of the province-level local tax bureau; financial bureau chiefs and department heads at below-province-level become local tax bureau chiefs and local tax department heads at the corresponding levels. Local tax bureaus should not set up party organs; they should be led by the financial departments' party organs at the corresponding levels. (iii) Local tax system at above county-level will not provide vertical leadership; the higher-level tax departments are responsible for guiding and supervising lower-level local tax departments. Urban local tax branch offices and township (town) local tax offices are agencies of local tax bureaus at the next-higher level; their bureau chiefs and department heads are appointed and dismissed by the higher-level local tax bureaus, and a dual leadership system should be implemented, with the higher-level local tax bureaus having more say. (iv) Construction of local tax organs must begin before the classified tax system is introduced and should go into operation when the new system goes into effect. The most urgent task now is to develop the system, set up the framework, and hang up the shingle, and we can worry about personnel and facilities later. V. Improve Government Budget Management According to Classified Tax Principles To implement the classified tax system, we must make budget management even more legislation-oriented, more standardized, and more systematic, so as to truly give expression to the principle that each level of political power can administer its own finances and has its own budget. 1. We must have independent budgets at separate levels. Setting up independent budgets at separate levels is the centralized manifestation of graded financial administration. In some sense, China's existing local budgets are budget in name only; in fact they are not independent, and they have no fixed source of income. Local budgeted income and spending are include in the state's total budget; there is no independent legislative right to have a budget. Therefore, we must promptly strengthen budget legislation and follow the Constitution to delineate the budget management jurisdiction of the people's congresses and their standing committees and of governments at all levels and their financial offices and clarify the central and local government organs' authority in checking, approving, legislating, and supervising the budgets. For each level to administer its finances and have its own budget, we must separate local budgets from the state budget, so that the state's budget only include the central government's budget. Localities should gather their own income and plan their own spending according to their scope of responsibilities and amount of local taxes when preparing their budgets which must be approved by the local legislative organs to make them more rigid and binding. 2. Establish a budget management system that is compatible with the restructuring of the administrative organs and the classified tax system. After implementing the classified tax system, financial administration should take the following form: It should consist of two levels of regulation and control (central and provincial,) three levels of administration (central, provincial, and county) and four levels of operation (central, provincial, county, and township.) We should follow this pattern to determine the duties of financial administrations at each level and standardize their financial conduct and smooth the financial relations between levels. In particular, we should standardize the method of computation and allocation basis and principle in the transfer of payment (subsidies, loans, and interests) from the central government to the localities, so as to strengthen the state budget's ability to regulate and control and balance society's overall financial strength and strengthen its rights and responsibility to guide local budgeting behavior. We should further improve the budgeting procedure and make the process tighter and more scientific. Under the state's unified policy guidance, each level should prepare and report its own budget; deficits will not be made up by the central government, so that each level truly manages and balances its own budget. 3. Actively promote the double-entry budget system and separate "grocery money" from "operating funds." Double-entry budget includes government budget, state-owned asset management budget, social security budget and so on. Double-entry budget as a modern budget form has inseparable internal ties with the classified system and must be installed together. The double-entry budget should make laws and regulations the criteria and give expression to the characteristics of graded financial administration. We should use double-entry budget to make financial administration more transparent. It must separately reflect how regular and construction funds are being balanced, so as to help party and government leaders at all levels to make analyses and decisions, facilitate the people's congresses in their budget supervision, and help governments at all levels to adhere to the principles of "doing one's best and gauging one's ability" and "feed the people first, build later." The most important thing is to "have food on the table" and then worry about construction. No deficit is allowed in regular budgets. 4. Strengthen ta x collection and management and prevent loss of revenue. To separate the "legislation" and the "enforcement" of taxation, separate "tax law" from "taxation," and tighten the relationship between financial administration and taxation, we must include tax work in the centralized planning and execution of financial undertakings at each level. In the past, we went overboard in reducing taxes and yielding profits and incurred losses as a result, and it has also led to today's improper interest pattern. That is water under the bridge now, but there is still a lesson to be learned. We must insist on curbing arbitrary tax reduction and exemption and tax contracting in its actual or disguised forms (circulation tax should never be contracted; contracting of enterprise income tax should be stopped with the "separation of taxes and profits.") We must link the strengthening of tax management and collection to the anti-corruption activities and the crackdown on unhealthy practices in the grass-roots collecti on units. We should quickly set up and amplify the tax report system and the open tax return system and strengthen supervision and auditing. In particular, we should take advantage of the fact that after the implementation of the classified tax system, local governments at all levels will have a better sense of their financial roles, and with the party and government leaders' increased attention, we can raise the standard of tax collection and management and minimize the incidents of tax evasion, tax loopholes, and export tax fraud. 5. Improve extra-budgetary fund management and curb external fund circulation. Implementation of the classified tax system will create the positive environment and conditions for improving and strengthening extra-budgetary fund management. First, after the implementation of classified tax system, all extra-budgetary funds managed by the local financial departments can be included in the local budgets, ending the separate management of two kinds of funds at the same level. Second, administration-related charges must be separated into revenues and expenditures and put into the budget. Extra-budgetary funds managed by institutional units should be carefully sorted out and clarified and included in the local budget where possible. The portion that cannot be included in local budgets must be included in the unit's revenue and expenditure plan to offset spending or to be spent along with the state's allocated funds. Moreover, as enterprises' management mechanisms change, and with the implementation of the "two principles," and in particular, with the gradual improvement of the modern enterprise system, the extra-budgetary funds managed by state-owned enterprises is essentially different today; they are no longer extra-budgetary funds, and after careful checking and examination, they should be legally deemed enterprise funds, to be put under enterprises' own disposal. Thereupon, we must draw the line between government funds and enterprise funds and resolutely block the local governments from "stashing their wealth in enterprises," preventing them from turning budgetary funds into extra-budgetary funds. 6. Strengthen financial legislation. We should take into consideration the new situation after the restructuring of the economic system and the introduction of the classified tax system to sort out the financial laws and regulations, and depending on the situation, we should amplify, supplement, and amend or abolish some of them. We should change the old practice of relying on government documents in lieu of the people's congress's legislation, and in particular, important laws and regulations pertaining to financial administration and local taxation must be formally promulgated and implemented by local legislative organs according to legal procedure. We must resolutely overcome the tendency to rely on words instead of laws or power instead of laws and refrain from being arbitrary when fulfilling the budget. Besides the above-described situations, in order to meet the needs of the classified tax system, we should adopt other budget management measures. For example, not only should we use the factoring method to calculate and allocate the central government's portion of transfer of payment, we should carefully separate the transfer of payment in the central government's budget, not only in preparing the budget but also in the bases. We should strengthen the management of bonds; local-issued bonds should be evaluated and debated by the central government. VI. Several Noteworthy Issues in Implementing the Classified Tax System 1. The issue of preventing distortions during reform. Most people are very confident about the classified tax system, but some comrades are worried that because of the complicated situation and because of strong local interests, there will be a lot of resistance, and if not done right, the classified tax system can be distorted: One, we may have the "classified tax system as a shell with the contract system at its core"; two, we may have "classified tax administration in form but in effect we may be "returning to state monopoly of revenues ad expenditures." In our view, the first concern is not completely baseless, and we should pay close attention. In implementing the classified tax system, it is inevitable that we will have to make certain "compromises" when dealing with various conflicts and interest relations; without compromises, we cannot begin to take care of everybody's interests. But this kind of compromise should not violate the principles of reform; they cannot obliterate the basic characteristics of the classified tax system. The so called classified tax must at least uphold six things: One, it must not expand the scope of percentage revenue retention; two, it must clearly delineate administrative power, and financial power and administrative power must be fully integrated; three, it must not follow the old tax base method; four, it must not allow central and local governments to usurp their power in granting tax reductions and exemptions; five, it must not permit arbitrary subsidies and appropriations; six, it must not perpetrate the kind of "idling" seen in the pilot classified tax system. Failing to comply with the above, the classified tax system will be a fraud. Of course, as we said before, because our classified tax system is based on the contract system, at the beginning (specifically in 1994 and 1995,) it will retain some of the contents and practices of the contract system. But in our minds, we must clearly understand that this is the new system's temporary "concession" to the old system, but it cannot be permanent. To "take a step backward" is for the sake of "taking two steps forward." With the passing of time and as various conditions are met, traces of the old system must slowly be removed, and the reform goals of the new system must be gradually attained. This is the concrete meaning of the radical and gradual nature of reform. As for the second concern, we think it is but a misunderstanding; it reflects errors in some comrades' understanding. We should point out that the financial contract system was a negation and abandonment of the system of state monopoly of revenues and expenditures; it was progress. The classified tax system, as an even more advanced stage of graded financial management, is an extension and advancement of the contract system. In implementing the classified tax system, we are correcting the defects of the contract system marked by the dispersion of financial strength; it strengthens the central government's macroeconomic regulation and control and is in no way a "restoration" of the system of state monopoly of revenues and expenditure. The biggest difference between the system of state monopoly of revenues and expenditures and the classified tax system is that the former overly emphasizes "centralization" and ignores "autonomy," and in some sense it turns the localities into the central government's accounting units. The latter system pays attention to "proper degree of centralization" while emphasizing "legal autonomy," and it adheres closely to the theme of establishing a macroeconomic regulation and control system and takes care of the central and local governments' interests at the same time, and in turn it brings the enthusiasm of the central and local governments into play. In our opinion, we must do a good propaganda and explanatory job, and at the same time, when concentrating the central government's financial strength, we should pay attention to the proper "degree" and avoid dampening the enthusiasm and initiative of local financial administration. Reform must be substantive and avoid giving the people the impression that except for handing a few important tax categories to the central government, everything will stay the same. 2. The issue of regulating financial interests among the regions. Within a unified country and given the same tax burden, citizens living in regions of different economic conditions will receive unequal public services. This is unfair but realistic. Reasonable and proper adjustments are necessary. "Adjust" does not mean "equalize." The national economy is an organic integral whole. No one region must support another region. Support must be mutual, and without mutual support, there will be no rapid and coordinated national economic development. We must stand on the high plane of the whole situation and adhere to the principle of fairness and efficiency to resolve this issue. Specifically, there are two things: One, the amount of "grocery money" should be more or less the same for all. There should be protective policy to help regions that cannot meet basic needs; we must gradually narrow today's differences. The other thing is that "operating funds" should be planned based on how they affect the layout of and benefit the nation's construction; measures should suit the times and local conditions. In this respect, perhaps we can learn from Australia's and Germany's "equality" and "fairness." We can set up some very rigid laws and work out a simple formula for computing the transfer of payment, and all subsidies and aids must be calculated according to that formula without negotiations. 3. The issue of the actual application of the factoring method. The factoring method is fairly complicated, and we will inevitably run into many problems in practice, but we have no choice. Without the factoring method, the classified tax system will not be a scientific system. Therefore we must concentrate our efforts on investigation and studies and learn from other countries' experiences. In particular, when choosing the factors, we must solicit ideas from all regions. We suggest that the financial departments set up a special organ to study and work out the factoring method and come up with a specific implementation program for the leaders to examine and make a decision on and legally put it into effect upon promulgation. 4. The issue of resolving the conflict between "tax break" and "tax discrimination." Based on the principle of fair competition in a market economy, we should set our preferential policy based on industry and not on economic nature or jurisdictional relations, even less should we extend preferences to individual enterprises. To attract foreign investments, we should work on improving the investment environment and not focus simply on tax reduction or exemption. To extend one-sided preferential treatment to foreign-funded enterprises is to discriminate against domestic-funded enterprises. In the future, domestic and foreign enterprises should pay the same income-tax, and except for the free-trade zones, we should not grant foreign companies tax-breaks within Chinese territories. After implementing the classified tax system, domestic-funded enterprises' taxes should be administered at different levels according to the law; foreign-funded enterprises' tax collection and administration involve national interests and therefore we must em phasize centralization. 5. The issue of other related reforms. Primarily, they are (i) reform of the tax system; (ii) reform of the administrative organs' personnel assignment system; (iii) further deepening of reforms of various specific financial systems based on the criteria of the "two principles"; (iv) continued implementation of the "Provision" to change enterprises' management mechanisms and go all out to promote reform to "separate profits from taxes," (v) reform of the state-owned asset management system; (vi) reform of the state treasury system. Among these other necessary reforms, the most important is the reform of the tax system. It should follow the laws of the socialist market economy, adhere to the principle of fair tax burden and encouragement of competition, and meet the need to raise the "two proportions." In view of the fact that the circulation tax has traditionally been China's most important tax, in the near-term reform, it is both necessary and possible for us to set up a three-tax-two-regulation pattern comprising of the value-added tax as the primary tax and supplemented by the consumption tax and business tax. But in the longer time-span, as the classified tax system develops, we should strengthen the income tax and develop the resource tax. The change or development in the circulation tax is based on the rate of economic growth; income tax's development and change is based on economic efficiency. Income tax has a great future; many countries that practice the modern market economic system are relying primarily on the income tax. It is our opinion that it is quite likely that China will embark on this path in the future. 6. The issue of properly linking the old and the new systems. When the system changes tracks, it should "shift without confusion" and "change in an orderly fashion." Specifically, the central and local financial administrations and tax bureaus should work together to make meticulous preparations and keep in touch and pay attention to possible cracks and loopholes. They must vigorously encourage people to consider the whole situation, submit to the whole situation, do everything according to the law, banish the tendency to grab power and shirk responsibility, and to look beyond self-interests. We should guard against those who fiddle with the base numbers and artificially generate revenue surpluses or shortfalls, avoid paying unnecessary price in implementing the classified tax system, and maximize the positive effects while minimizing the negative effects, so as to ensure steady development of financial administration at all levels, striving for double bumper harvest in structural reform and financial administration.
