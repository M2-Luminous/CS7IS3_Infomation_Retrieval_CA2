How did the Office for Hungarians Living Beyond the Borders participate in the preparation of this meeting and what made this meeting timely? [Entz] Given the nature of our office, it is our primary task to keep contact with the organizations of ethnic Hungarians abroad. Regular contacts are held with the heads of organizations of ethnic Hungarians abroad at a prime ministerial level and at the level of other government officials, and this means the implementation of the constitutional obligation of this cabinet. The fact that the mother country and the Hungarian Government deal with the issue of Hungarians living in the neighboring countries has a stabilizing effect in the region. If we did not do this and failed to take up this responsibility, the deterioration in their situation would carry the danger of an advance of extremist forces, and this would definitely destabilize the situation. With the current meeting, the old-new government also wants to express our political continuity, a continuity that cannot be broken even by the upcoming elections, given the basic national interests involved. [passage omitted] [Botlik] Is there any division of labor between your office and the Foreign Ministry? [Entz] It is the task of the Foreign Ministry to keep contacts with governments; our task is to cooperate with various organizations of the civil society, namely with the Hungarian communities living in the neighboring countries and with Hungarian organizations and churches all over the world. We regard these communities as partners in solving the international and domestic administrative tasks that affect them. It would be a mistake to treat the issue of ethnic Hungarians abroad as a foreign affairs issue only, because it practically affects the activity of every ministry in one way or another. Naturally, we offer partnership to the neighboring countries in these matters too, and there are countries that accept this offer and there are countries that do not yet accept it. Obviously, the decisions made in the various government spheres must form a uniform whole. It is our main task to coordinate these various activities. [passage omitted] [Botlik] Where did you start from in analyzing the situation of Hungarians living abroad? [Entz] We cannot disregard the fact that, with the Trianon Treaty of 1920, some 3.5 million Hungarians found themselves citizens of neighboring countries. These Hungarian communities are native inhabitants and have been playing an important role in shaping the civilization of those areas for centuries. If the real needs of this Hungarian minority are disregarded and if the regime and logic of these states aim at eliminating these communities by various milder or tougher forms of ethnic cleansing, up to genocide, then one must declare that this is the real source of the tension. It is also the fundamental interest of the other nations that have been living together with the Hungarians for centuries to treat the issue of the Hungarian minority positively, because only this approach can create the conditions for a fruitful cooperation and, in a wider sense, the bases of equal European integration. [passage omitted] [Botlik] Could a dialogue emerge between the government and the Hungarian political parties in Slovakia? [Entz] There are no realistic chances for such a thing in the current situation; however, there will surely be such a development in the long run. The Slovaks and Hungarians are interdependent, and this must emerge in Slovak politics sooner or later. We would like to see such a development as soon as possible. [Botlik] With what neighboring countries are there possibilities of strengthening bilateral relations and improving the situation of the Hungarian minority? [Entz] We can hardly count on a spectacular breakthrough in this respect. The current situation is the result of decisions made in this century, decisions opposing the interests of nations living in this region. It is characteristic of the situation that, in our region, nations that came out as victors in wars are now in the worst situation. This is definitely not good for Hungary. The fact that most of our neighbors are more unstable and their economy is also more unstable than ours hinders the assertion of the nice principle of making the borders traversable. This is not a matter of subjective decision; this requires the implementation of considerable market economy and social conditions. If these conditions are not there, the borders will continue to be difficult to traverse. [Botlik] The fate of the Carpathian Euroregion clearly shows the problems.... [Entz] Yes, we can have no illusion regarding the complete openness of borders in the near future. We do not have to fear a Balkans-type conflict leading to armed violence in the region, but we do have to consider an economic stagnation, something that represents a constant crisis. This is mainly the reason for difficulties in improving relations. On the other hand, the extremist manifestations of national state ideas play a role in the region, and this represents a serious political obstacle. [Botlik] In view of your recent talks with the heads of Hungarian organizations abroad, what chances do you see in improving the situation of ethnic Hungarians abroad? [Entz] For example, there is not a large-scale immigration of Hungarians from Slovakia into Hungary, or brain-drain, or any other negative process. However, the same type of problems are of worrying size in Romania. Emigration from the Subcarpathian region has also become considerable lately. Unfortunately, some countries continue their traditional policy toward national minorities. Serbia regards Hungary as a long-term strategic partner, and this could work in peacetime. The need for Slovakia and Hungary to cooperate is obvious. [Botlik] The Hungarian public is mainly focusing its attention on our eastern neighbor and Transylvania.... [Entz] Unfortunately, in the case of Romania, this need for cooperation is not so obvious. For example, in the eighties, when the CEMA was "flourishing" and cooperation was so "excellent" that some people are sorry for the collapse, our eastern neighbor occupied 16th place among Hungary's trade partners, and the same position is valid today. Lasting political trends can be clearly seen from economic indicators. In this situation, when economic contacts are so insignificant, every element of interstate relations easily becomes political, especially if there are organizational frameworks for this. This is why hysterical waves play an important role occasionally in Hungarian-Romanian relations, just like in the past. As long as there is no change in such basic issues, we cannot expect much better things from the future either. [passage omitted]
