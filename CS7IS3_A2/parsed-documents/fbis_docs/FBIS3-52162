It is not at all clear that the Taba talks will resume tomorrow, but it is clear that an Israeli team will depart for Paris tomorrow. Yitzhaq Rabin said that before clarifications are received on what and with whom we are negotiating, we will not resume any talks. He added Israel can resume routine economic and security related contacts; for example, it is possible to continue talks on fugitives. Rabin pointed out, however, that we will not return to Taba before it is clear on what basis the talks will be held. Rabin left some room open for a low-level delegation going to Taba for dealing with the problem of the fugitives. The heads of the delegations, however, will not go. Rabin said he has received the impression that the territories do not interest 'Arafat and that he is using this fact against us. Rabin stressed that the controversy centers on the political issue rather than on 'Arafat's honor. Rabin added that from 'Arafat's point of view the main problem is whether he has control over an international border or not. At this point Rabin provided some details regarding 'Arafat's new demands as conveyed via the weekend fax messages: They are demanding the presence of policemen near the bridges, which in fact implies a physical PLO control over the border crossings. The Palestinians also demand not to see any Israelis at the crossing points. The solution they propose is the use of cameras. They are also demanding to receive total control over al-Nabi Musa in the Jericho area. The Palestinians also demand full control over the Muratas baptism site on the Jordan River. They also demand control over the Lido beach on the Dead Sea and to maintain an international presence in the enclaves. There seems to be a problem regarding the Musa 'Alami agricultural farm, because some of the land registered to that farm is located east of the Jordan Valley, therefore Israel's proposal to hand over this farm to the PLO is problematical. Minister Shim'on Shetrit asked Rabin for clarifications regarding Israel's security areas in Gaza and Jericho. Rabin said that Israel demands to retain between three to five kilometers between the Jericho enclave and the Jordan Valley. In Gaza, Israel is demanding less than that. Minister Ya'aqov Tzur said that apparently the maneuvering room is narrowing down: [Begin recording] The PLO must drop its demand for control over the external borders. This is not merely a tactical issue. It is a most significant issue and the government will see to it that its principles are implemented. Israel will not compromise over retaining control of the external borders and will not accept 'Arafat's demands, which in fact amount to the essence of a state. If the PLO returns to the spirit of the declaration of principles the way will remain open. We know that we are paying a price for the delay, but we reached point where we must insist on the implementation of the agreement we reached. [end recording] I asked Minister Yosi Sarid whether the Taba talks will resume tomorrow: [Begin recording] This is entirely unclear. If the talks will be based on the understandings reached in Cairo, we will be able to resume the talks tomorrow or even tonight. If, however, the basis will be Yasir 'Arafat's new demands then at this point there is no room for continuing the talks. At this point I do not know when they will continue. [end recording] Prime Minister Rabin also said that if the Palestinians will change the agreements this will be reciprocal, and Israel will also demand to introduce changes. [passage omitted]
