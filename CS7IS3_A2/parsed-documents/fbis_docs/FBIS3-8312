This was all to guarantee what President Berisha promised: openness, judicial independence, and the enforcement of legal standards and procedures in the trial of the opposition leader. According to announcements, the trial was to take place in open court but with admission by invitation issued by the Tirana Court because of the size of the hall. Shaqir Vukaj, deputy chairman of the Albanian parliament, was not allowed entry to the courtroom to follow the proceedings. Meanwhile, dozens of policemen who were not on escort duty were present in the court. Judge Agim Bendo opened the session at 0900. The case's prosecutors were Arben Qeleshi and that strange little fellow Genc Gjokutaj. Facing them in the dock were opposition leader Fatos Nano, Sokrat Plaka, Hasan Allkja, and Robert Gjini. After presenting the bench of judges to the court, Mr. Bendo turned to the defendants and asked whether they recognized the court. Fatos Nano then read the statement we publish under the title, "Even Though You Do Not Have the Civil Courage to Face Up to Us, I Agree To Stand Before You, Because the Law Stands Between Us." Defense counsel Perparim Sanxhaku then spoke, making a detailed summary based on individual articles and laws of the Penal Code, describing all the violations of procedure committed from PS Chairman Fatos Nano's arrest to his imprisonment and the rejection as inadmissible of the submissions of Fatos Nano and his lawyers. The lawyers of the other defendants also protests procedural violations. The lawyer Sanxhaku called for the court to threat Nano's case separately from those of the other defendants, to return the files to the prosecutor, and to commute Nano's arrest. The other defendants' lawyers made the same requests on behalf of their clients. Prosecutor Gjokutaj then asked for one hour to reply to the lawyer's requests. After one hour he replied in his own way; i.e., he gave no reply. The bench then withdrew to decide on the lawyers' requests. At 1500, Judge Bendo seemed to repeat Prosecutor Gjukotaj's reply. He rejected the lawyers' requests, with the exception of commuting Sokrat Plaka's arrest. After this decision, Deputy Fatos Nano stated that he was breaking all relations with the bench. Lawyer Tirana supported and explained Mr. Nano's legal decision and asked for the court to remove Mr. Nano and his two lawyers from the court. Mr. Bendo considered this an unreasonable attitude on the part of the lawyers, and gave them 10 minutes to reconsider. However, it seems that these 10 minutes were less for the lawyers to reconsider than for Mr. Bendo himself. Mr. Bendo opened the session, asking Prosecutor Qeleshi to read the charge. For 25 minutes, Qeleshi reread for the umpteenth time the State Control Commission's report published by Blerim Cela. After this, Mr. Bendo asked the accused whether they accepted the charges. Opposition leader Fatos Nano repeated his stand in his statement, "I Have Broken All Relations With the Court." Lawyer Sanxahku reminded Mr. Bendo of the need for 10 minutes' break, but the latter interrupted him, saying that the court's decision could not be opposed at this moment. The defendants did not accept the charges. Mr. Bendo closed the session, to reopen it at 1000 today with the questioning of opposition leader Fatos Nano. Courtroom Incidents Prosecutor Genc Gjokutaj bellowed instead of giving a reply to charges of violations of procedure by the Prosecutor's Office during the investigation of the Nano affair. From the manner in which he read, it was clear he was not reading his own writing. Meanwhile, in contrast to his junior colleague Gjokutaj, Chief Prosecutor Arben Qeleshi, whom Fatos Nano called a puppet prosecutor required by the state solely to sign arrest warrants, showed himself able to read fluently a typed charged sheet that bore the signature of his deputy Dervishi at the end. The presiding judge Agim Bendo tried to maintain the seriousness of the court, and succeeded when he was reminded of the Arsidi trial and his trip to Paris with Ilir Hoti, who is now in prison. At this moment, cameras flashed in the courtoom to preserve on celluloid the expression of his face. At the end of the first session, Mr. Bendo broke a taboo of trials under the dictatorship by allowing the defendants to meet those of their relations who were in the courtroom. Kurt Kola, chairman of the Association of Former Political Prisoners and Victims of Persecution, was the most attentive person in the hall. Who knows what ideas swirled through the mind of this martyr of democracy as he heard the denunciations of the violations of the human rights to which he and his association are so attached, exceeding in their dedication even the Meksi Government and the former Communist President Sali Berisha. Let us remember how Kola once let off his revolver in Kavaje as a sign of understanding and conciliation among Albanians and then wiped the barrel before thrusting it back in his belt. Fatos Nano Addresses the Bench: "Even Though You Do Not Have the Civil Courage To Face Up to Us, I Agree To Stand Before You, Because the Law Stands Between Us" Your honor, this is a political trial, because it has been seriously prejudiced by the attitudes, statements, and public and private activities of persons associated or not with the judicial process, from the head of state, the chairman of the People's Assembly, the chairman of the ruling Democratic Party, the chairman of the Association of Former Political Prisoners and Victims of Persecution,, the president of the Appeal Court, etc., down to the most recent chairman of the Democratic Party Youth Forum. Of course, at the appropriate time, I will ask for their well- documented public pressure on the judiciary to be taken as evidence of the political character of the trial, and will call on these persons, together with their "minion," as witnesses to this and to other private acts. Because of these circumstances, and because I do not identify justice with individual names, I am indifferent to the selection and composition of your bench. This indifference extends to yourself as presiding judge, despite the substantial and strong evidence that compromises your position as an independent judge such as the law demands. I will mention here only one piece of evidence. The state is using against you "the Paris Charter," by which I mean not the well-known Paris Charter on democratic principles recognized throughout the world, but the one connected with the "Arsidi affair," and your involvement in this scandal, in tandem with Hoti, on the side of citizen Berisha. The latter, in his capacity as president and chairman of the Supreme Coucil of Justice, quashed your last moral stand when you submitted your resignation to this Council, of which you are still a member. The tandem has now become a quartet, and, as on other occasions, you are coming to this trial after meetings last Monday [1 Mar] and between 0900 and 1300 yesterday with President Berisha, at which P. Martini, A. Qeleshi, and F. Dervishi were also present, in Villa Number Four near the Palace of Brigades, where the Supreme Council of Justice now meets to discuss the "Nano affair" and many others. Thus, you are prisoners in a villa-prison, while we are free, as you also see from the press. In conclusion, even though you do not have the civil courage to face up to us, I agree to stand before you, because the law stands between us. Thank you. Fatos Nano, PS chairman, People's Assembly deputy.
