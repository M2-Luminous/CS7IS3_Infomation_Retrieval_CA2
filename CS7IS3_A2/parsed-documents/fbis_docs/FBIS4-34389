[cheers]. Dear friends: We have won. [cheers] This victory does not belong to Ernesto Samper; this victory belongs to all of you. [cheers] For the first time, after having adopted a new Constitution, we held an electoral process in accordance with the rules established by the National Constituent Assembly to modernize and cleanse the nation's politics and its administration. One thing in particular pleases me, and I would like to spotlight it here, before all these foreign reporters. Colombians have also defeated abstention today. [cheers] We have shown the world Colombia has a great, modern, and open democracy, under which there is full assurance that all expressions of our pluralist society can compete. All of Colombia's friends know that our country does fulfill its international commitments and will continue to do so and that they will find in Colombia an eager ally to fight for Latin American and Caribbean integration, for international cooperation, for the peaceful resolution of all conflicts, and that we will combat drug trafficking and ensure that international law prevails. I am reaching the Colombian Presidency following a long career that began many years ago and that has had many stages. In all of them, in all of them there has been an invariable guideline. I have been and I will always be a tireless worker, and I believe there is no effort that can be spared when it comes to helping the people. I have always acted, and I will always act inspired by my great love for Colombia and by the conviction that our country must be immense so it can house all Colombians and their kids. [cheers] I am now thinking about Luis Carlos Galan and many other murdered people. His death was the biggest tragedy Colombians experienced, but it would have been even worse if that sacrifice were in vain. The ideals of Galan in favor of an honest exercise of politics and government will be the objectives for which my administration will work every day, every hour, and every minute. [cheers] I also salute President Gaviria. His vision and courage gave Colombia a great push in favor of the country's modernization, which we are going to continue. His government proved we were not anchored in the past. My campaign programs to create jobs and elect a government that can work in favor of the people are no longer the proposals of a candidate; they are the plans of a president who will fulfill them with everyone's support. I am very grateful to all Colombians for the support they gave me today. I am especially grateful to my party, the Liberal Party [cheers] and the members of the Alliance for Colombia. I am grateful to those who voted for me. I also send my fraternal greetings to those who voted for Andres Pastrana. I invite them to work to make our dreams become a reality, our dreams of peace, social justice, and progress. We are now facing an open window, a window of opportunities, a window of which we are going to take advantage with everyone's support and for everyone's benefit. Dr. Andres Pastrana should be praised for making a great effort to conduct a different campaign. I found a persistent competitor in him. I also extend to him my friendly hand and congratulate him for conducting an innovative campaign. I want to thank many people for their support and their contribution in this victory. I want to emphasize the support of Jaquin, my wife. [cheers] She experienced the intensity of this long campaign. As anyone else, she always worked with enthusiasm, which was needed during times of fatigue, and she exhibited an optimism that never lagged when times were difficult. As anyone else, she always had a smile. [cheers] I want to thank my mother, Jaquin, Andres, Miguel, and Felipe; they were decisive factors during this stage. They are also going to be the most important individuals of my life. I want to thank my collaborators and my running mate, Humberto de la Calle. He is an exemplary Colombian. I also want to thank Rosalba. Our work was worthwhile so that we could come out ahead, not only because we won an election, but because we have given Colombians a road full of hope. Our duty is to think about the future generations. Our mission is to work for the future. We are going to work without respite for the needy of Colombia. We received a social mandate from the Colombian countryside today. I want to speak with sincerity to Colombians. I am anxious to start working for Colombia as early as tomorrow. I am counting on your support, your work, and even your sacrifice, when necessary, to make our dream come true. Everyone's commitment and participation are the greatest strength our democracy has as well as our country's secret weapon and the shortest way to prosperity. My dear friends, let us work to take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges that await us during the next four years. We will face them without hatred or fear and with the responsibility the majority of our fellow Colombians have given us. I call on all citizens of goodwill, who are the majority, to join us in this time of change we are now beginning. I hereby declare myself free of all bitterness or animosity. [cheers] No Colombian will be subject to discrimination during my administration due to his or her political party, beliefs, or racial origin. I invite all of those who mistakenly chose the road of armed conflict to reconsider and lay down their weapons. Let me say there is still space for peace. To my adversaries I say: I guarantee you a part, if you so wish, in the process of social transformation we will set in motion. I call on all of you to join in this new period of work. The time for Colombia's great social leap has come. [cheers]
