"I have never explained the definition," Saito told a scheduled news conference. He declined further comment, noting a joint economic forum of the government and ruling coalition parties was dealing with the tax issue. Saito said the ministry "will respect the decision made by the forum." On the stock market that staged a sharp rally, Saito said there would be "no direct effects" on the state of the economy because market prices are determined by supply-demand conditions which do not necessarily reflect economic fundamentals.
