The meeting lasted more than three hours and focused on the effects of the devaluation on commercial activity. [passage omitted] Trade unions did not attend this afternoon's scheduled meeting with President Soglo in protest against the ban on this morning's briefing rally. [passage omitted] In a communique issued this afternoon, the trade unions that have formed the interunion crisis committee said the ban is a violation of union freedom. The unions and organizers are basing their argument on a series of factors in an attempt to prove that they are being muzzled by President Soglo's government. In concrete terms, they pointed out that the interior minister's reply to the interunion crisis committee's letter on this morning's meeting did not in any way question the holding of the meeting. Besides, the unions maintained that the holding of a union meeting has never required prior permission from the authorities. The interunion crisis committee also protested against the interior minster's radio statement, which it described as untrue, and claimed it could lead to confusion. Concerning the interior minister's radio statement on the 1315 news, the unions [words indistinct] directed at them. Furthermore, in light of this offensive, which the unions think is targeted at them, they are making an urgent appeal to all workers to be on standby to follow directives and orders from the interunion crisis meeting. Finally, the unions in question, namely (CSA-Benin), (CGPD), (RSTB), (CFEB), (PINAD), (SYNTRAPAC), (SYNARES), (SYNCITRACEP) [expansions unknown], convene their activists for a briefing and protest meeting at the Cotonou Labor Exchange at 0800 on 1 February.
