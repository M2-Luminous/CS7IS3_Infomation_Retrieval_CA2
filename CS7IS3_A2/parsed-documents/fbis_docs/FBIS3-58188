Atun issued a written statement in connection with Greece's moves to accept the Greek Cypriot Administration as a full EU member. In his statement, Atun said that it is the duty of the government to again warn the EU members and the UN Secretariat General with regard to this irresponsible move on the part of Greece and the Greek Cypriot Administration. Atun announced that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] will immediately assess any negative moves by Greece during its six-month term presidency and rapidly make all the necessary decisions in cooperation with motherland Turkey. Atun recalled that the illegal Greek Cypriot Administration does not have the authority to speak on behalf of the Turkish Cypriot people, to represent them, to conduct negotiations that will be binding on them, or to sign agreements on their behalf. The TRNC expects EU member countries to prevent Greece from creating more impasses by exploiting its term presidency and from further complicating the problem, Atun remarked. The UN Secretariat General and Security Council have seriously been warned about the Greek and Greek Cypriot moves, which undermine the talks and which contradict all previous agreements and accepted principles, Atun noted and called on these organizations to exert the necessary efforts to avoid negative developments.
