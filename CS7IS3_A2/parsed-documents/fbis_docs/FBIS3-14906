He referred to a statement by head of the Baltic bureau of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Prikhodko, who has accused Estonia of unwillingness to mark the border jointly with Russia. The Russian claims of Estonia's unwillingness are groundless, Arusoo said. Estonia is willing to settle the border issue as soon as possible, but it cannot be done on Russia's terms and before Russia has recognised the Tartu Peace Treaty, he pointed out. The Russian propositions have only concerned the present provisional border line, Arusoo explained. The Foreign Ministry spokesman further pointed out that Russia has actually already started the construction of border control facilities and expressed his opinion that this may be an attempt to anticipate a possible international discussion of the issue. Head of the Russian delegation Vasily Svirin accused Estonia of delaying the negotiations in a Russian TV news broadcast on Thursday [24 February]. He claimed that Estonia is unwilling to hold constructive negotiations or to discuss issues important to Russia. The Svirin statement is another example of Russia's negotiation tactics, secretary of the Estonian delegation Ago Tiiman commented. He added that Estonia is willing to discuss any problems, while the Russian delegation understands negotiations as Estonia accepting any idea suggested by the Russian side. "Our partners forget that the entire world has found our tactics to be correct. But the Russian side does not respect the international opinion and only cares of its own position," Tiiman said. The next round of negotiations is to take place in Lohusalu on March 1-2.
