There is no doubt that Israel and its agents are behind this odious scheme. Israel has started to play the tune of sectarianism to sow seditions. Israel carried out the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron and also perpetrated another reprehensible crime at the Lebanese Sayyidat al-Najat Church. The timing of these two odious crimes is not a coincidence, but is the result of a studied and premeditated plan. In view of these crimes which have greatly pained the Jordanian leaders and people, Jordan, under his Majesty King Husayn, took the initiative and acted on all Arab, regional, and international levels to acquaint the entire international community of the hideousness of this type of terrorism, which undoubtedly is Israeli terrorism. [passage omitted] His majesty the king was the first to realize the dimensions of this treacherous scheme that is hostile to the cordon states and to the peace process which is based on the international legitimacy resolutions. His majesty linked the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the Lebanese Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre, in that there is one party which planned for these two odious crimes. His majesty also held consultations with the Lebanese and Syrian presidents to contain this odious scheme which seeks to drown the region in blood and sow sedition so as to foil it before it becomes uncontrollable.
