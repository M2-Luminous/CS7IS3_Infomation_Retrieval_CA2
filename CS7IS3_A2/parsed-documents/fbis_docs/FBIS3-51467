Upon ending the visit, however, Savage said it had met and surpassed his goals. Savage and his entourage were received by Cuban President Fidel Castro, and Savage showed his great sensibility as a person and a doctor. He was impressed with the Cuban people's determination to move ahead and overcome the current economic crisis. Savage, who won the post of prime minister for the Liberal Party last May, presides over the government of a province of the Canadian Atlantic Coast, 80 percent of which is forest land. The province has great hydroelectric potential and is noted for its fishing. The experience of visitors in this area will serve to promote the recently signed fishing accord with Cuba as well as to analyze additional operations. Not only did both parties sign accords on fishing, but Canadians and Cubans established a passenger cruise service for tourists. They also decided to create a mixed enterprise to produce soap, and Cuba agreed to purchase Canadian wood while Nova Scotia will receive Cuban citrus. In addition, Savage and his delegation showed interest in the current transformation process of Cuban agriculture, evaluated the prospects for greater Canadian participation in mining, and drafted other mixed enterprise projects with Cuba. Savage termed the visit by he and his entourage as advantageous and very fruitful. For Cuba, it represents an opportunity to expand ties following the loss of its traditional commercial partners. This visit, the first to Cuba by a Canadian provincial prime minister in 17 years, also contributed to coordinating future cooperation in developing ecological tourism, one of the basic objectives of tourism in Cuba, which has been given priority by the authorities. The contacts proved that the relations initiated have potential to expand to such areas as culture as well as to increase in the areas of economic associations and investments. The businessmen from Nova Scotia and other Canadian regions are not prepared to lose the commercial opportunities offered by Cuba, which represent mutual benefits, at the hands of increased U.S. pressure to frustrate any commercial negotiations to which Cuba is a partner. We cannot forget that the Canadian Government maintains a respectful attitude toward Cuba, that the island represents its fourth largest trading partner in America, and that 22 of the 112 commercial associations operating in Cuba with foreign capital are Canadian.
