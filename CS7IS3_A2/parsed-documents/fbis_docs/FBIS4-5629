FBIS4-5629 "dreas071_q_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 AUSTRALASIA Australia Jobless Rate Reported Lowest Since 1991 Jobless Rate Reported Lowest Since 1991 BK0704101794 Melbourne Radio Australia in English 0500 GMT 7 Apr 94 BK0704101794 Melbourne Radio Australia English BFN [Text] Unemployment in Australia has fallen to 10.3 percent, prompting a government prediction that the rate would end at 10 percent by the end of the year. Linda Mottram reports the March figure is the lowest since November 1991, down from 10.5 percent in February: [Begin recording] [Mottram] Driving the continued fall is seven consecutive months of employment growth. Seven thousand more jobs were created in March, but they were part-time rather than full-time positions. But the government is very encouraged by the figures overall. Federal Employment Minister Simon Crean predicted the jobless rate would be below 10 percent by the end of this year, disputing OECD claims that the jobless rate would remain in double digits for two more years. [Crean] The figures show that we have done better than what the OECD suggests. I believe we can get below that figure in the not-too-distant future, but it will only happen with the continued strong economic growth. [Mottram] The federal opposition also welcomes the lower number of jobless, but opposition leader John Hewson maintains the country is locked into 10 percent-plus unemployment. [Hewson] We are concerned that it seems the improvement in the labor market seems to be slowing and we are now left with a situation. We've still got over 900,000 people without paying jobs and over 50 percent, or about 50 percent, are those who are long-term unemployed. [end recording]
