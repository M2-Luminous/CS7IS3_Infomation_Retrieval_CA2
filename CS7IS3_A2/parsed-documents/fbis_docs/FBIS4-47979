Violence broke out at 1300 when a Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party air force plane parachuted supplies for the Luanda regime troops. Ironically the parachutes landed in the area of the city controlled by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. Government forces were promptly mobilized to retrieve the parachutes. The Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] reacted against the provocation. The People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] persisted in their designs and the clashes began. The clashes were intense and there were dead and wounded, though it has not been possible to make a final assessment of yesterday's skirmishes. The situation was calm last night, but it is not known whether FAPLA will mount new attacks.
