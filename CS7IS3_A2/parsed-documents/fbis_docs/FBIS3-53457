Has the Palestinian delegation to the Taba negotiations received any new instructions regarding tomorrow 's resumption of the Taba negotiations? [Al-Yahya] Yes. We and the Israeli side have agreed to resume the second round of negotiations in Taba tomorrow morning. I hope that during this round, we will be able to make some progress on the security issue. [Mu'addi] Has the Palestinian delegation received special instructions from the PLO leadership on the resumption of these negotiations? [Al-Yahya] Yes. We received instructions this morning. The Israeli side was contacted on this issue. We only hope that this time negotiations will be successful and productive. [Mu'addi] Will tomorrow's negotiations in Taba also cover the topics listed on the agenda of the Civic Committee? [Al-Yahya] Yes. The negotiations will also cover the work of the Civic Committee. [Mu'addi] What are the topics listed on the agenda of the Security Committee? [Al-Yahya] It might be correct to say that all issues are listed. So far, we have not agreed on any particular issues. [Mu'addi] What about the topics on the agenda of the Civic Committee? [Al-Yahya] During the past round, some progress was achieved. We hope that progress will continue in the same pattern. [Mu'addi] In light of the consultations that were held with the PLO leadership, do you believe that it is possible to overcome the obstacles and reach an agreement on security issues during this round of negotiations? [Al-Yahya] Everything is possible. I believe that this issue depends more on the Israeli side than on the Palestinian side. [Mu'addi] Are there any new proposals or compromises with respect to the pending security issues: Control of the crossings and the size of the Jericho region? [Al-Yahya] So far, there are no compromises. But I hope that during this round, we will be able to achieve some progress. This round is supposed to continue until Friday [21 January]. [Mu'addi] Will tomorrow's negotiations in Taba take place within the general committee or within the subcommittees of negotiations? [Al-Yahya] Negotiations will be held within the framework of both the subcommittees and the general committee. To explain, there are now two drafting committees, one on security issues, the other is civilian. There is also a general drafting committee which covers all topics and which will draft a final formula of the major agreement and its security and civilian appendixes. [Mu'addi] Maj. Gen. 'Abd-al-Razzaq a-Yahya, head of the Security Committee, many thanks. [Al-Yahya] Thank you.
