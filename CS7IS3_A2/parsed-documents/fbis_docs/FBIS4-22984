V. Shambazov, S. A. Anichkin and O. N. Romanov; UDC 621.394.4] [Text] The rapid world development of telecommunications has brought the advent of new kinds of telecommunications networks that are the basis for organizing a variety of telecommunications services (telex, fax, e-mail, and so on). In future it may be possible to merge various services and networks on the basis of digital networks with integration of services. Such networks are already in operation in some world nations; however, universal introduction will take a lot of capital investments. Considering the current status of development of telecommunications and data networks in Russia, it can be concluded that networks like the X.21 data network with digital channel switching, or a digital network with integration of services will hardly be widely prevalent in our nation in the near future. Therefore, the authors believe that the problem of quickly establishing an up-to-date infrastructure in Russia to support integration of various telecommunications services can be solved only on the basis of X.25 networks with packet switching. Networks of this kind, when used as a universal transport medium for data transmission in combination with additional servers, are an effective and comparatively inexpensive means of support for all services, and provide the basis for their integration. The feasibility of such an approach is demonstrated in this article as exemplified by development of the INFOTEL network. Characteristics of INFOTEL network. The INFOTEL network provides up-to-date communications services on a commercial basis for different classes of users, as well as supporting their interaction with the resources of other data processing networks of Russia and other nations. This network has been set up by using the communications infrastructure of GP [not further identified] ``Moscow Municipal Telephone Communications'' and the communications enterprises of other cities (municipal telephone networks, ``Rossvyazinform'' GPSI [not further identified] and so on). Information is exchanged in the INFOTEL network by the packet switching principle. This network utilizes international standards and recommendations on public data networks, and specifically CCITT Recommendations X.25, X.3/X.28/X.29, X.75, X.121. The INFOTEL network uses CCITT international code (DNIC) 2504. INFOTEL interacts with 190 foreign data networks via the DATEX-P network operated by the Deutsche Bundespost Telecom Company. The hardware base of the INFOTEL network is series EWSP equipment made by Siemens (Germany): 1. HNN/HMS packet switching centers (200 ports, 1500 packet/s) combined with a network control center; 2. HNN packet switching centers (100 ports, 1500 packets/s); 3. HNN-20 packet switching centers (20 ports, 200 packets/s); 4. modems for operation over dedicated and switchable communication channels, physical lines; 5. multiplexers of various types for organizing discrete channels. Long-distance and international communication channels, including satellite channels, are used to organize data transmission between users in other cities. Packet switching nodes are connected by dedicated communication channels with transmission speed of 9,600-64,000 bauds; transmission rates on subscriber sections are 1,200-64,000 bauds. Subscriber access is over dedicated digital AF channels and physical lines, as well as over switchable channels of the public telephone network and the ``Iskra-2'' network. Provision is also made for calling a subscriber on the network side via the telephone network. There are different options for connecting subscriber stations to the data network: a) by X.25 protocol using dedicated communication channels or physical lines; the user's computer must have an X.25 interface (and appropriate software) and a modem for operation over the dedicated communication channels that implements one of the CCITT Recommendations V.22, V.22 bis, V.29 or V.32. b) by X.28 protocol using switchable communication channels (public telephone network and ``Iskra-2'' digital telephone network), and also dedicated channels or physical lines; to implement this connection option, the user must have a communications software package and a modem that implements one of the CCITT Recommendations V.22, V.22 bis or V.32, and also V.42/V.42 bis or MNP-4/MNP-5. In addition, the Network Administration may offer the user a V.35/V.36 or G.703 interface for connection to the INFOTEL network over a dedicated channel with rate of 64,000 bauds. In isolated cases, the dedicated channel to the user may be organized over an already existing telephone pair with parallel transmission of speech and data (at a rate of up to 19,200 bauds). Connected to packet switching nodes as subscribers are e-mail servers that also offer services to network users. On the first stage, the network uses servers that are compatible with the Internet/RELCOM e-mail network (mainly based on IBM 386/486 personal computers under control of the UNIX operating system), and that also enable transmission and reception of telex, teletype and fax messages. Thus, thanks to the use of the X.25 network as a transport medium and e- mail servers as facilities for delivering additional services, the INFOTEL network provides the following basic services: rapid and reliable data transmission (text and binary files, electronic documents, software and other forms of information); on-line (interactive) access to remote information and computing resources (databases, information retrieval systems, electronic bulletin boards, and so on); data transmission in e-mail mode; data transmission and reception in e-mail mode of telex and teletype messages, and transmission of fax messages; output to other data networks, including foreign networks. In essence, the package of services offered is the merging of capabilities of an X.25 network and systems that have been developed in Russia mainly on the basis of telephone networks. However, analysis of the current level of development of telecommunication services shows that this service package is far from complete (for example, there are no services for electronic data processing or transmission of fax message with temporary storage). To expand the list of services offered by the INFOTEL network, a multicommunication system (MCS) is being introduced that will integrate the following services into a unified hardware/software platform: X.400 e-mail; electronic data exchange; telex; teletype; megaFAX transmission of fax messages with temporary storage; physical delivery of correspondence; voice mail; electronic bulletin boards. The MCS is based on an X.25 packet switching data network. In addition, the MCS can be accessed via telephone, telex and teletype networks as well. The hardware base of the MCS is provided by the Tandem Company's fault-tolerant computers, and by centrally controlled Tandem computers for fax transmission with temporary storage. As base software, the MCS uses OSIware's Messenger 400 system that implements Recommendation X.400 1984/1988 and is compatible with European and U.S. profiles for implementation of X.400. The Messenger 400 system is modular, and includes the following modules: - message transmission agent (MTA) Messenger 400/MTA -- there are two versions of the MTA: 1984 and 1988. The 1984 version contains session and transport levels. The network level protocol may be X.25, TCP/IP, or a proprietary asynchronous protocol: TTXP; - User agent (UA) Messenger 400/UA -- this module is in one of the computers with MTA and interacts with it via a software interface that is functionally coincident with P3 protocol; - interface with physical delivery service (Messenger 400/PDAU) that sends hard copies of messages from X.400 users by conventional mail; - remote user agent support [by other than P7 X.400 protocol for support of interaction with the UA in a personal computer, including support of error-correcting protocols like Xmodem, and by P7 X.400 protocol (Messenger 400/RUA) for implementing functions of P7 protocol, including the application level]; - file storage (Messenger 400/MS) -- supports P7 protocol for remote UA access, and P3 protocol for interaction with the MTA; - directory services (not X.500); - electronic data exchange services. The e-mail service can be accessed in the interactive mode from a terminal (PC), telex, teletype using service functions of the UA integrated into the system, and also in the packet mode from a PC using local software that implements UA functions. The electronic data exchange system provides exchange of electronic documents via the X.400 e-mail system, and also supports EDIFACT, ODETTE, TRADACOMS and ANSI X12 standards. This system has the following capabilities: - conversion of user application data; - standard formatting of documents; - checking document formats; - support of controlling messages; - support of different versions of standards; - document routing; - interface for application-specific software. The megaFAX system controlled by a Tandem computer consists of megaFAX nodes connected via an X.25 network. A megaFAX node supports input/output, storage and transmission of fax messages, as well as a gateway to the X.400 system. The latter provides for fax output of messages generated by e-mail users (telex, teletype, text messages), and interfacing with other systems of the same kind; The megaFAX system is accessed from group 3 fax machines with the capability of using: voice menus (possibly including Russian); the megaTEL device by which the operator can work in the same procedure as with a telephone network. The X.25-based megaFAX system provides: - fax broadcasting (999 addresses) with user-friendly editing capability; - fax transmission at sender-specified time; - fax reception from a mailbox at any time convenient for the user; - automatic repetition of fax messages (voice detected, no answer, busy, access denied); - capability of user storage of standard blanks; - fax delivery to alternative addresses if the main number is busy or not working (up to three user-specified addresses); - abbreviated addressing of subscribers (users may maintain their own address books, including company name, lines with names of recipient and sender, alternative fax number); - message delivery priorities; - fax transaction reports; - closed user groups (fax transmission permitted only within a user group); - delivery of reports regarding user work to a predetermined device (X.400 mailbox, fax mailbox, max machine, and the like). In conclusion, we would like once more to mention that the INFOTEL data network is today one of the most intensively developing Russian telecommunications networks that were not put on the Russian market until late last year. In spite of this, it already covers about twenty regions of the Russian Federation. In 1993-1994, plans call for setting up packet switching centers in regional centers and in the most important cities of Russia over the entire territory of the Russian Federation.
