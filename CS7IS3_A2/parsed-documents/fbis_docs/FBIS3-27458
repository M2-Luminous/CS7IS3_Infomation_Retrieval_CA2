As long ago as 1986, a large number of labourers from 25 provinces and cities in China began pouring into the capital in search of work in such industries as construction, environmental work and coal. Of the 1.5 million [figure as received] labourers coming from elsewhere, nearly one million of them live in the capital on a more or less permanent basis. Some 800,000 of them are engaged in various kinds of economic activities with 300,000 of them working in construction on such projects as the construction of buildings, 81 flyovers and 3,000 kilometres of roads. Such labourers from outside the capital are also engaged in production, processing and repair services. Apart from those engaged in the urban area, there are yet another 200,000 of them in the suburban areas engaged in agriculture, hand-finished products and domestic service.
