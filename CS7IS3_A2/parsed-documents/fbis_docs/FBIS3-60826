On the other hand there has been a sharp fall in the number of shooting and stabbing incidents. These figures were relayed from the prime minister's bureau to Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu at the latter's request. The Likud claims that the government is hiding the figures in order to justify the claim that the intifadah has subsided.
