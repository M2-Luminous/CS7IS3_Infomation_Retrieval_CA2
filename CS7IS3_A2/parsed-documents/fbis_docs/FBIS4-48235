But it is nowhere near enough to lift an economy which, nevertheless, has the potential to achieve much-heightened growth rates. Aid of about R1.7 billion a year might seem a lot of money. Yet perspective indicates that R1.7 billion worth of aid in the next 12 months is about equal to the cost of establishing one new gold mine. It's half the sum South Africa borrowed from the International Monetary Fund at the end of last year -- funds used to bolster foreign exchange reserves which, in spite of that injection, are now, only five months later, under severe pressure. Indeed, in the first four months of 1994, the net reserves plummeted by R3.2 billion, equivalent to more than two years' worth of foreign aid. Accordingly, the aid-to-SA [South Africa] conduit won't even begin to have a favourable impact on an economy desperately trying to emerge from five years of crippling recession. Not that we should be looking for handouts to pull us out of the economic mire. We need to be tugging ourselves up by our own bootstraps. Aid dents the pride of the nation and promotes a poor work ethic -- as countries to our north have discovered at exorbitant cost. In short, the entire country has to get back to work -- to work hard, efficiently, and assiduously. Is the nation prepared and able to do just this? The portents are promising. What remains is for the potential to be realised. It is the new Government's most awesome task to get people into jobs, to train them to do those jobs well and to ensure that they keep doing them well. It won't be easy and it won't happen soon. The starting point is to enhance South Africa's economic growth rate. Even this year's predicted 3 percent is well short of the desired mark. Next year simply has to be 5 percent plus -- and, if one is to take a less than jaundiced view of the future, it can be achieved. How? -- The psychology is right. All South Africans are suddenly on the same side, working for the same goals. No more is government at such odds with labour and business; no more is labour at such odds with business. Co-operation among all the aspects of production translates into meaningful economic growth. -- Foreign investment, as opposed to foreign aid, stands ready to enter an economy no longer constantly threatened by violence and labour unrest -- an economy with a well-developed infrastructure, a sound legal system and one which offers an attractive platform for launching products into sub-Saharan Africa. -- Even without the post-apartheid benefits that are about to accrue, the economy has been emerging from recession. The major indicators are pointing up and, given a heightened level of foreign and domestic investment, they are poised to point yet higher. -- Inflation remains in single-digit territory. While many fear that the huge social upliftment expenditure targeted by the new Government will before long jerk inflation back into double digits, the substantial excess production capacity in the economy and the Reserve Bank's continued vigilance are notable ameliorating factors. -- International capital markets are now, as seldom before, ready to lend to South Africa. Although they involve a cost in the form of interest payments, if the funds thereby raised are used to expand the nation's productive base, the interest bill can be covered many times over by heightened exports and import replacement. -- Much local and foreign money is destined for education and training. Some dividends will be garnered only many years into the future. But some, particularly in the training arena, will accrue in the near term. In concert with the will to work hard, those dividends will help lubricate South Africa's economic engine. -- Interest rates are scheduled to decline in the near future as the balance of payments constraint is rendered less onerous by capital inflows. Cheaper money implies more investment in productive capacity and increased spending -- vital ingredients for growth. -- The global economy is expanding. This is bound to benefit all exporting nations, including South Africa. In addition, the upturn is coinciding with a revival in the commodities cycle. And South Africa is among the world's leading exporters of gold, platinum, diamonds, coal, manganese, and chrome. Too optimistic a scenario? Are there no flies in the economic ointment? Earlier in the year, the gloom and doom merchants predicted that the election would bring chaos; that the Left-leaning elements in the ANC would drive the country down the communist precipice. Today they're silent. Business people are positive. The Johannesburg Stock exchange continues to scale new peaks, pointing to a future more prosperous than the recent past. Even so, flies, among them exchange control, are by no means absent from the ointment. International investors are invariably reticent about placing their money in a country which prevents its unfettered repatriation. They're wary of a country which aims to attract foreign capital via a discounted financial rand. Why not, then, abolish exchange controls and scrap the financial rand? Because vast sums of funk money would leave our shores, plundering our scarce foreign exchange reserves. At least that's been the reason for the past decade or so. It's a reason which could evaporate if confidence is restored -- confidence that South Africa does indeed have a bright future; confidence that capital seeks to flow into the country rather than out of it; confidence that democracy will bring with it responsible government of responsible citizens. Ultimately, South Africa will row its own boat. Its oarsmen's determination, wisdom, and strength will determine its destiny.
