In a telex message sent to IAEA headquarters in Vienna on Thursday, North Korea also said it was prepared to allow additional IAEA inspections of a key radiochemical laboratory. Despite the latest development, the IAEA plans to send a team of inspectors on Sunday to check the radiochemical laboratory and service surveillance equipment in other facilities, IAEA spokesman David Kyd said in Vienna Friday. The agency had insisted that its inspectors must be present when North Korea changes nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor. The IAEA said it would send inspectors only when Pyongyang postponed the refueling. Nevertheless, the U.N. nuclear watchdog has decided to dispatch inspectors in the apparent belief that North Korea has not yet removed the fuel rods from the reactor, informed sources here said. The United States has also said it would suspend dialogue with North Korea if it changed the fuel rods without an IAEA presence. But the sources said Washington will now decide whether to hold a third round of high-level talks after learning the outcome of the IAEA inspections. State Department deputy spokesman David Johnson said Washington was not in a position to comment on further talks with North Korea until it heard from the IAEA on the result of the upcoming inspections. The IAEA alone must determine whether the continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea has been maintained, Johnson said. Only then will the U.S. Government decide on the third round of negotiations. What the United States is interested in right now is to choose the spent nuclear fuel rods at random and preserve them for later checks, said another State Department official, requesting anonymity. Another diplomatic source here said "All is not clear at the moment" with regard to the changing of the nuclear fuel rods. However, it appears that North Korea has just begun preparations for refueling, rather than having taken fuel rods out of the reactor, he added. The contents of Pyongyang's message to the IAEA will not influence the prospect for U.S.-North Korean talks, he said, adding that a firm evaluation of the overall situation will be made after the IAEA inspectors' visit. Meanwhile, Pak Yong-nam, minister of the Atomic Energy Industry, said in the telex to the IAEA that North Korea was compelled to begin changing nuclear fuel rods because the IAEA had failed to send an inspection team, attaching unjustifiable conditions. The message was addressed to IAEA Secretary-general Hans Blix. Pyongyang nevertheless welcomed the IAEA's decision to send inspectors, though belatedly. North Korea will allow them to inspect its experimental nuclear power generating station and the radiochemical laboratory in order to maintain the continuity of nuclear safeguards, it said. North Korea has also proposed resuming negotiations with the IAEA to resolve complicated problems with the refueling. It would be more productive to hold the negotiations close to where the refueling is proceeding, it said, hinting that it wants to hold talks in Pyongyang. Referring to the refueling, North Korea said work has just begun and that there would be many opportunities for the IAEA to collect the spent fuel rods at random and preserve them.
