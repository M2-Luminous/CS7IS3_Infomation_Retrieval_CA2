More than 25 million people went to the polls, with the highest voter turnout recorded in Lvov, Ternopol, Ivano-Frankovsk, Donetsk, Lugansk, Poltava, Khmelnitsky and Kharkov regions. The turnout of voters in the Republic of Crimea was 71 per cent. In Kiev, slightly more than a half of the electorate cast their votes. Only 49 out of the prospective 450-member parliament were elected in the first round of polling (25 had been nominated by parties and 24 are nonparty people). Run-offs are to be held in 401 districts before 10 April. However, Central Electoral Commission Chief Ivan Yemets believes that in the majority of districts run-offs may be held this coming weekend, with only two candidates in each district to contest seats in parliament.
