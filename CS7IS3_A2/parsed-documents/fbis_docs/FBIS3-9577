Our correspondents Anna Samelova and Ivan Samel report from Presov: [Samel] Good morning to you from Presov. About 200 citizens have been waiting for the delegates to the congress since this morning. The movement's chairman, Vladimir Meciar, joined them shortly before 1000 and addressed the gathering. [Samelova] In his brief address, Vladimir Meciar recalled that, with the voters' support, the HZDS had resolved the issue of the Slovak Republic's statehood. Now, it is to resolve the issue of the peace and prosperity of the state. Vladimir Meciar thinks it would be sensible to complete what was begun in the referendum or, in other words, the issue of early elections. That is why one of the main points of the assembly's deliberations will be to draft the movement's policy for the election period 1994-98. The implementation of this policy will begin next Monday. We lost a major battle in the parliament, Vladimir Meciar went on to say, but we will win the war. The HZDS chairman then handed the floor to Ivan Gasparovic [Slovak parliament speaker], who, in essence, reiterated what Vladimir Meciar had said. [Samel] Following the gala opening of the assembly and addresses by invited political parties, the agenda of the assembly has begun. Despite the fact that he has not been invited to the assembly, the president of the Republic, who is still an HZDS member, has at least sent a greetings message to the congress. It says that the HZDS is a substantial political force in Slovakia, whose position in the center of the political spectrum attracts hundreds of thousands of citizens with most varied opinions. I quote from the letter: It would not be correct if I were to conceal the tension between the HZDS chairman and the president, which gradually grew into open attacks against the president of the Slovak Republic. Even though this tension does exist, its nature is not personal. However, as a social and political conflict, it had a negative impact on the developments in our country as a whole. As president, I had to take a position on this. I expressed my position in the National Council of the Slovak Republic. At the same time, I urged all political entities to support the policy of national, political, and civic reconciliation. It is our duty to seek and choose decisions and solutions that will satisfy not only us but, first and foremost, our fellow citizens. In the conclusion of his letter, Michal Kovac wished the congress peaceful proceedings and expressed the hope that the congress would be a continuation of the best policies that yielded undeniable success for the HZDS over the past three years. [Samelova] According to the information we have, no one has yet read the contents of the letter from the president to the assembly delegates. [passage omitted]
