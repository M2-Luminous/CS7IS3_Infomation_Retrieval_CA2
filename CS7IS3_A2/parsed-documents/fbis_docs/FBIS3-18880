Since 1992, there have been only five annual rates higher than February's 73 percent consumer inflation rate. There were reports on Friday that a monetary crisis in mid-January lifted Turkey's February inflation rate to 73 percent, the highest since last July. The State Institute of Statistics (DIE) revealed Friday that consumer prices shot up 6 percent in February to bring the annual inflation figure to 73 percent following a 13.6 percent lira devaluation on Jan. 26. Consumer prices had risen 4.4 percent in January when year-on-year inflation stood at 69.6 percent, and 3.6 percent last December when the year-end figure was 71.1 percent. The wholesale price index soared 10.1 percent in February, the highest since January 1992 and almost doubling the 5.3 percent figure for January. The 12-month rate rose to 68 percent from 60.6 in January. A run on the lira from mid-January has caused turbulence in financial markets and rapid depreciation of the lira. Shortly after the Jan. 26 devaluation, the government launched a wave of price hikes, which were followed by several price makers in the private sector. In the aftermath of the crisis, economists and observers widely expected a substantial increase in price levels but Prime Minister Ciller denied this. "The impact of devaluation on the general level of prices will not be as strong as they claim. During the whole year, there will be an increase of about 3 to 4 percentage points in the inflation rate due to the devaluation," she said in a recent statement. But financial analysts predict an even higher rate in March. They reason that several retailers have implemented massive price hikes since the end of February and beginning of March. "The damage, spilling over from higher prices in the government sector, will be felt more clearly during March," said one economist. The announcement of March figures on April 4 will come after the election period. Economists pointed out that there was a reverse occurrence of wholesale and retail figures in February, supporting expectations of a bleaker inflation picture for March. "The general tendency is that retail prices rise faster than wholesale prices. In February the situation was reversed. This was because several retailers were not too quick to respond to changes in wholesale prices," explained one economist. In a related development, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ITO) announced that its own price indices for February produced a year-on-year consumer inflation rate of 73.7 percent, only a slight 0.7 percentile up on the DIE figure. ITO said retail prices in February rose by 9 percent. Observers say Ciller's failure to defeat rampant inflation, a promise made several months ago, has significantly lowered her True Path Party's (DYP) popularity and has jeopardized her election chances.
