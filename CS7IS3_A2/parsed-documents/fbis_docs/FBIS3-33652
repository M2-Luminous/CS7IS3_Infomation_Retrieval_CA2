It said the group members would provide "more than 120 million dollars to cover the budget deficit of 158 million dollars" in connection with Palestinian autonomy this year. The donors -- including the European Community, the United States, Japan and some Arab countries -- also agreed to the broad outlines of expenditures and receipts contained in the first Palestinian budget, developed by the Palestinian Economic Council for Reconstruction and Development, the announcement said. The consultative group, grouping 24 countries and five international institutions, was supposed to cover the entire budget deficit. Palestinian delegation head Nabil Kassir told correspondents that "We did not get everything we need to ensure economic stability. But we did not come out so badly." The donors' meeting was held Thursday and Friday at the World Bank's European headquarters in Paris.
