When Li Peng stepped down from the ramp of the airplane, Akayev elatedly stepped forward to meet with him, and Akayev firmly shook hands and exchanged greetings with him. Kyrgyz girls presented bouquets, bread, and salt to Li Peng to show their warm welcome to the honored Chinese guest. A military band played the national anthems of the two countries at the airport, where the flags of China and Kyrgyzstan fluttered in the breeze. Li Peng, together with Akayev, viewed the honor guards. A large banner stating "We warmly welcome Premier Li Peng" in Chinese characters could be seen hanging down from an airport building. Premier Li Peng warmly shook hands with Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov and other Kyrgyz Government officials. A large, bright, eye-catching, five-starred Chinese national flag could be seen among the welcoming crowd. Premier Li Peng waved at and greeted the Chinese-flag-waving crowd. Chinese Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Pan Zhanlin and the entire diplomatic staff from the embassy were at the airport to welcome Premier Li Peng and his delegation. Foreign envoys in Kyrgyzstan also welcomed them at the airport. Those arriving at Bishkek on the same plane with Premier Li Peng included Zhu Lin, the wife of Li Peng; Ismail Amat, State Councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission; and Qi Huaiyuan, director of the State Council Office of Foreign Affairs. Citizens along both sides of the road greeted Li Peng when he was driven to the state guesthouse in the accompany of Akayev. Premier Li Peng delivered a written speech at the airport. He said: China and Kyrgyzstan are friendly neighbors linked by mountains and rivers, and they share a common border stretching over more than 1,000 km. The friendly contacts between the two countries' peoples date back 2,000 years. The "Silk Road," the famous belt of friendship that historically linked China with the countries of Central and West Asia, ran through this stretch of land on which we now stand. He added that the relationship between China and Kyrgyzstan has developed in an excellent manner since diplomatic relations were established. The successful visit of President Akayev to China in 1992 has propelled the development of the neighborly, friendly, and mutually beneficial-cooperation relationship between the two countries. "I believe that my visit to your country will surely further enhance the understanding between the two countries, deepen the friendship between the peoples of the two countries, expand the mutually beneficial cooperation in all spheres, and benefit the peoples of China and Kyrgyzstan."
