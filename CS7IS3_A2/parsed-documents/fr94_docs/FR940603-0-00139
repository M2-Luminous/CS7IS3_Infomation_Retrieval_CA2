FR940603-0-00139 FR940603-0-00029 IV.A.4.a_General The ability to compete in the marketplace and to adapt to changing market conditions is key to the survival of any enterprise, and a crucial part of that is the ability to plan well. NCUA, therefore, requires an applicant to submit a business plan based on realistic and supportable projections and assumptions, including, as a minimum, these elements: •Mission statement. •Analysis of market conditions_economic prospects for the group, availability of financial services from other credit unions, banks, and savings and loans. •Summary of survey results. •Financial services needed/desired. •Financial services to be provided. •How/when services are to be implemented. •Staffing of credit union and credentials of key employees. •Physical facility_office, equipment. •Type of recordkeeping system, including consideration of a data processing system. •Budget for 1st and 2nd year. •Semiannual pro forma financial statements for 1st and 2nd year, including assumptions_e.g., loan and dividend rates. •Goals for number of members. •Goals for operating independently. •Source of funds to pay expenses during initial months of operation. •Written policies (shares, lending, investments, funds management, capital accumulation, dividends). •Goals for shares and loans. •Plan for continuity_directors, committee members. •Evidence of sponsor commitment if subsidies are critical to success of the federal credit union_evidence may be in the form of letters, contracts, or any other such document on which the proposed federal credit union can substantiate its projects. NCUA expects that the subscribers and proposed officials will understand and support the business plan submitted. IV.A.4.b_Special Requirements for Community Credit Unions Community credit unions are frequently more susceptible to competition from other local financial institutions and generally do not have substantial support from any single sponsoring company or association. Also, the lack of payroll deduction creates special challenges in the development of savings promotion programs and in the collection of loans. Therefore, it is essential for the group to develop a detailed and practical business plan for at least the first three years of operation. The business plan should contain, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: •Analysis of market area_geographic, demographic, employment, income, housing, and economic data. •Service/market strategy_financial and other services to be provided, new member/share/loan promotion policies and procedures and income generation strategy. •Organizational/management plan_qualification and planned training of officials/employees, operating facilities to include office space/equipment and supplies, accounting system, safeguarding of assets, insurance coverage, etc. •Financial plan_sources and application of funds statements and pro forma balance sheet and income/expense statements and assumptions. IV.B_Effects on Other Credit Unions_Overlaps (This discussion pertains to new and existing charters.) IV.B.1_Overlaps In General An overlap exists when a group of persons is eligible for membership in two or more credit unions, including state charters. General policy requires that every reasonable effort be made to avoid an overlap. Ideally, a group of persons should be included in the field of membership of only one credit union. New credit unions are obligated to investigate the possibility of an overlap prior to submitting an application for a new charter by surveying the prospective field of membership. When a potential overlap situation does arise, officials of the involved credit unions must attempt to work the problem out between or among themselves. In the case of a new federal credit union applying for or converting to a community field of membership, the applicant will generally be required to contact only those credit unions with a service facility within the community boundary. Other credit unions serving select groups within the proposed area will not ordinarily be contacted or afforded overlap protection unless a significant portion of their field of membership is affected. If the matter is resolved informally, the applicant must submit a letter to that effect from the credit union whose field of membership already includes the subject group. If no resolution is possible, an application for a new charter may still be submitted, but must also include information regarding the overlap and document attempts at informal resolution. Documentation on the interests of the group, such as a petition signed by a majority of the group's members, will be strongly considered. When resolution of the issue is not possible, and other circumstances warrant, an overlap may be permitted. Among the circumstances which may justify an overlap are: •Failure of the original credit union to provide quality service. •Limited participation by members or employees of the group in the original credit union after the expiration of a reasonable period of time. •Incidental overlap_the group of persons in question is so small as to have no material effect on the original credit union. In reviewing the overlap, the regional director will consider the nature of the issue, efforts made to resolve the matter, financial effect on the overlapped credit union, the desires of the group(s), the desire of the sponsor organization, the opinion of the state credit union supervisor and other interested parties, as applicable, and the best interests of the affected group and the credit union members involved. Potential overlaps of a state credit union's field of membership by a federal credit union will generally be analyzed in the same way as if two federal credit unions were involved. However, where a state credit union's field of membership is so general as to include virtually everyone in a wide area, NCUA may exclude any state credit union from overlap protection altogether just as it would with a federal credit union with a broadly defined field of membership. Prior to making that decision, the regional director will consult the credit union and the state regulator. Any decision by the regional director will be provided in writing to the credit union and the state regulator. Generally, NCUA will permit federal credit unions serving occupational groups to overlap associational and community charters. However, should the proposed overlap pose significant safety and soundness concerns, NCUA may provide overlap protection for any type charter. For example, labor union groups constitute an associational common bond, and while some labor unions serve members who work regularly for several employers, others have members who work for only one employer. In these latter cases, overlap protection may be provided if a substantial portion of the company's employees are served by the credit union. Some situations may not justify approval of a requested overlap. For example, if the requesting credit union offers certain specialized services not offered by the original credit union (such as credit cards, ATMs, and IRAs), the extra services alone may not justify the overlap. Also, proximity, by itself, may not warrant approval of an overlap. A federal credit union in Chicago, Illinois, may not have a convincing argument, based on geography alone, that a select group also located in Chicago would be better served by it than by the select group's headquarters credit union located in Dallas, Texas. From an overlap prevention perspective, new charter applicants and every occupational or associational group which comes before the regional director for affiliation with an existing federal credit union must advise in writing whether the group is included within the field of membership of any other credit union. This requirement will alert the regional director to possible overlap situations before they occur. Most potential field of membership conflicts can be avoided in this way. If cases do arise where the assurance given to a regional director concerning unavailability of credit union service turns out later to be inaccurate, the misinformation is grounds for removal of the group from the federal credit union's charter.
