Touching on the arrangement for next year's work for the ACFTU, Wei Jianxing stressed it is necessary to successfully carry out the following five tasks in a down-to-earth manner: 1) persist in focusing efforts on economic construction and treat the promotion of economic development as the central task of the TU's; 2) take active part in reform and promote reform by laying emphasis on successfully transforming the operating mechanisms of state enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system; 3) play an active role in establishing a stable labor relationship, in maintaining the legitimate rights and interests of staff and workers, and in maintaining social and political stability; 4) take more part in legislation and policies, and give full play to the role of TU's as a democratic channel and in social regulation; and 5) strengthen the building of contingents of staff and workers. Wei Jianxing pointed out: In the face of heavy and complicated reforms next year, TU's must unite and mobilize the broad masses of staff and workers to stand steadfastly in the forefront of reform and to vigorously support, participate in, and promote reform by laying emphasis on successfully transforming the operating mechanisms of state enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system. He said transforming the operating mechanisms of state enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system are the basis for the establishment of a socialist market economy, the orientation for the reform of state enterprises, and the focal point for the next-step assault on fortified positions and for our TU work. He believed implementation of the fundamental policy -- rely on the working class wholeheartedly -- must not change in socialist China. So long as the role played by the public ownership of enterprises as the principal part remains unchanged, the position of staff and workers as the masters of enterprises; their rights to exercise democratic management of, democratic participation in, and democratic supervision over enterprises through staff and workers' congresses and through other forms; and the rights of enterprise TU's to represent and maintain the legitimate rights and interests of staff and workers, as well as to independently conduct work according to laws and according to TU regulations, shall remain unchanged no matter how state enterprises' operating mechanisms are transformed. Wei Jianxing stated: Stabilizing labor relationships and maintaining the legitimate rights and interests of staff and workers is an important social responsibility of TU's. There is a lot of work to do now. Four points must be stressed: First, we must show concern for the livelihood of staff and workers who encounter difficulties. Second, we must attach importance to production safety. Third, we must maintain the legitimate rights and interests of staff and workers of enterprises, and in particular, of foreign- invested enterprises and private enterprises. Serious infringement on the legitimate rights and interests of staff and workers, and even violation of their personal rights and insult to their human dignity, have occurred from time to time among these enterprises. We must pay close attention to such phenomena. Fourth, we must quicken the pace of establishing experimental TU's for village and town enterprises. He said: TU's represent staff and workers to participate in administration of state and social affairs and in democratic management and democratic supervision of enterprises and institutions. This is a great trust placed by the party in TU's, a demand set by staff and workers on them, and a right vested by law in them. TU's at all levels must make efforts to enhance their law consciousness and must take the initiative to successfully fulfill their duties of participation with perfect assurance. The presidium meeting opened on 20 December. It was convened mainly for the purposes of studying and implementing the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and determining the ACFTU's major tasks in 1994 in the light of the actual conditions of TU work. In addition, it heard a report on the investigation of the serious "19 November" fire accident at Shenzhen and discussed how to improve TU work among foreign-invested enterprises.
