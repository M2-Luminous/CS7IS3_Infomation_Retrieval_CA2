Aleksandr Livshits, Head of the Russian Federation President's Group of Experts, Comments on the Latest Edicts Aimed at Developing the Reforms"] [Text] The edicts signed by the president affect the interests of millions of Russians. In the first place, this relates to documents offering people new opportunities for solving the housing problem. Three edicts were signed: on housing credits, on housing certificates, and on the sale of unfinished houses. As for housing credits, government decree No. 1278, dated 10 December 1993, approved the statutes on granting Russian citizens in need of better housing conditions free subsidies to build or acquire housing. Consequently, it is a matter for the government, which must keep its word. More significant is the edict on housing certificates, which enables anyone wishing to do so to buy housing by installments. Under the president's edict, corporate bodies that have the requisite documents, a plot of land, and a house that is in the process of being built, are entitled to issue a new type of security, a "housing certificate," provided they have gone through the obligatory Finance Ministry licensing process and their activities in connection with the certificates are guaranteed by a bank or some other credit institution. Any Russian citizen will be able to buy a certificate and pay for it gradually, initially, for example, by buying one square meter, thus gradually accumulating the housing space. The certificates are absolutely liquid, that is, they can be sold. But if a citizen has accumulated 30 percent of an apartment, then under the Statutes he is entitled to apply to the issuing body (the one that bought up the property) and conclude a contract for the apartment, bearing in mind that the remaining forms of payment are already regulated. Certainly, further instructions are needed from the Finance Ministry and Central Bank, but the way is clear to making it easier to tackle the housing problem. On the one hand, there are now people who have money and want to buy apartments. On the other hand, we have finished or almost finished construction projects and houses. Construction organizations are building or are prepared to build. The idea behind housing certificates is that they bring together the interests of those who want to buy apartments and those who have housing to offer. But all this must be strictly supervised by the state.
