At the Restructuring of the Financial System Report Meeting jointly sponsored by the CPCCC Propaganda Department, Party Committee of Departments under the Central Committee, CPC State Organ Work Committee, Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and the PLA General Political Department, Zhou Zhengqing said, since 1978, in the wake of the deepening reform of the nations' economic system, a series of reform of the financial system has also been implemented. Consequently, we are beginning to find different kinds of financial institutions; we have a central bank system and are gradually setting up a financial macroeconomic regulation and control system that integrates direct and indirect regulation and control; we have made progress in creating new financial tools and different ways of extending credit; we have a fledgling financial market; and we have begun to restructure the foreign exchange control system. We have further opened up the financial sector to the outside world. Zhou Zhengqing pointed out that despite the progress made in the restructuring of China's financial system, the old system is still flawed. Primarily, People's Bank of China has not turned into a bona fide central bank. It has not really assumed the responsibility of supervising the nation's financial activities. The central bank itself is still handling some policy-oriented loan business. We are still not utilizing the monetary policy tools skillfully enough, and we lack effective indirect regulation and control measures. The specialized banks are still not separating government from enterprises, and unlike banks in the market economy, they lack the mechanisms to discipline themselves or let risks constrain their behavior. The financial market lacks effective supervision which often leads to market disorder and confusion. Reform with respect to the financial infrastructure has been slow. Zhou Zhengqing said, the main purpose of the restructuring of the financial system which begins next year is to turn People's Bank of China into a bona fide central bank. The specific reform measures are: To change People's Bank's functions and define its duties. The headquarters of People's Bank will have the power to issue currency, the power to manage basic money, and the power to regulate and control the overall credit volume and regulate the interest rate standards. The headquarters of the People's Bank normally will have financial dealings only with the national commercial banks. The branches' basic duties are to exercise financial supervision and management, compile and analyze statistics, regulate the money supply laterally, manage the state treasury, regulate and transfer cash, and manage foreign exchange and inter-bank settlement. In restructuring and improving the monetary policy system, People's Bank's ultimate goal is to maintain currency stability and in turn promote economic growth. The monetary policy's intermediary and operational targets are the money supply, the credit volume, inter-bank short-term loan rates, and bank reserve rates. Meanwhile we must strengthen the central bank's leadership, supervision, and management of the nation's financial industry. Zhou Zhengqing pointed out that, next year, we must set up policy-oriented banks, achieve the separation of policy-oriented and business-oriented financial undertakings, and solve the problem of specialized banks taking on double responsibilities. After the policy-oriented banks are established, they must strengthen management, take their own risks, uphold the principle of not doing money-losing business and not competing with the commercial financial institutions, and accept People's Bank's supervision on business matters. After separating out the policy-oriented matters, existing state-owned specialized banks should gradually be turned into state-owned commercial banks, and they should operate like modern commercial banks. Zhou Zhengqing said state-owned commercial banks should compete among themselves, and their businesses may overlap. State-owned commercial banks must not invest directly in nonfinancial enterprises. Meanwhile we must actively but steadily develop a cooperative bank system, which consists mainly of urban cooperative and rural cooperative banks. Their responsibility is to serve the medium-sized and small enterprises and the agricultural and developing regions. Zhou Zhengqing said, we must set up a unified and open, orderly and competitive, and closely managed financial market and a tightly controlled money market; we must clearly define and regulate the market entities and their conduct to prevent funds from draining away from the money market to the securities market and the real estate market; we must perfect the national debt market and create conditions that enable People's Bank to engage in open market operations; we must perfect the stock market and restructure the foreign exchange control system--the long term goal is to turn RMB into a convertible currency. Finally, Zhou Zhengqing emphasized that the direction of next year's restructuring of the financial system is set and specific steps are mapped out, but in the actual implementation process, particularly in changing from the old to the new system, we must insist on controlling the total volume to prevent runaway inflation. He said that this round of financial reform will be more rigorous and broader in scope than previous rounds, and it will entail major changes in the central bank itself. This means we must pay even closer attention to controlling the total volume; otherwise not only will the restructuring of the financial system fail but the whole economic reform process will be jeopardized. Thus, in next year's financial reform, before the new monetary policy tools and specific measures are in full operation or show initial improvement, we should not be rash and abandon the original volume regulation and control measures prematurely. Zhou Zhengqing said that after the policy-oriented operations are taken out of the state-owned specialized banks, it does not imply that they will automatically become commercial banks. The transformation of specialized banks into commercial banks is closely tied to the establishment and perfection of China's modern enterprise system. It must be coordinated with the reforms of the planned system, investment system, foreign trade system, and taxation system. The transformation itself is a process. To implement financial reform, we need a series of financial laws and regulations. Some parts of the reform must be defined in legal format to ensure an orderly process. Next year will be a year of financial legislation. We expect that more than 20 laws and regulations will be drawn up and ratified.
