FBIS4-6931 "dreas080__a94018" FBIS-EAS-94-080-A Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Banks Present Deregulation Demands to MOF Banks Present Deregulation Demands to MOF OW2504143294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2504143294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] It was learned on 23 April that the banking industry presented to the Ministry of Finance [MOF] a list of 57 deregulations, including its main demand to create deposits linked to stock prices and a demand for simplification of reports submitted to the MOF. Wide-ranging demands are included in the list, such as: relaxation of regulations on large lendings, lifting of the ban on new financial services such as FRA's (forward rate agreements), and relaxation of regulations on opening new branch offices. The banks are asking for greater autonomous decisionmaking power in bank management since they are facing intensified competition with the liberalization of interest rates. There has also been an upsurge of international demands on Japan to relax regulations. Therefore, the MOF is taking a positive attitude towards the banks' demands. This will probably contribute to a transformation of bank management, which has been strictly regulated. The list of deregulation demands was compiled mainly by the major city banks. It includes items in 13 areas, such as bank deposits and regulations on branch offices and affiliated companies, plus a demand for simplifying reports to the MOF. Since the process of liberalizing interest rates for bank accounts will be completed by October, the banks are asking for liberalization of regulations concerning matters other than interest rates. This is the first time the banking sector has asked for such wide-ranging deregulation. The main feature of the list is the creation of deposits linked to stock prices, which offer to depositors gains corresponding to stock price increases, and no interest at all if stock prices go down. Apart from deposits linked to stock prices, the banks are also asking the MOF to lift the ban on new types of deposits which allow interest earnings to be invested in market commodities, such as deposits linked to the land price index. The banking sector aims at expanding its range of financial services. The banks are also asking for the abolition of regulations on opening branch offices--not more than two regular branches, or not more than seven small branches in two years--which has been the mainstay of bank regulations. With regard to CD's (cash dispensers) set up at client institutions, the abolition of the regulation on the location of such cash dispensers is also being demanded. A total of 11 demands have been presented on the opening of branch offices alone. In the area of hi-tech financial services which may become a major source of income for banks, the list includes demands to lift the ban on handling FRA's, which is a form of commodity futures, and FXA's (foreign exchange agreements). The banks are also asking for a lifting of the ban on the loan participation method of loan liquidation, which does not require the consent of the debtor in transferring credit rights, and the ban on the method of transferring credit rights to a special-purpose corporation which in turn issues CP (commerical paper).
