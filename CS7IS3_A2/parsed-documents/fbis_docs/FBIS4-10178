The following is the edited, condensed transcription of questions posed by the newsman and his audience, along with Ramirez Mercado's replies. [Question] Why should Sergio Ramirez sign a document of one faction of the FSLN? I have heard people say that the DN [National Directorate] should stay out of it and then, later on, act as a "grand judge" and hand down a final ruling. [Ramirez] That view is now history. The FSLN is going through a very important phase of evolution and transformation during which differing points of view must be expressed in order to enrich debate. I have always thought that ideas and thought were the only thing that could change the world--along with action, naturally--since no change takes place without thought behind it. I am a member of the DN, elected on the 1991 ticket, and we were supposed to remain on the Directorate until 1995, but we have not been protected by history. If a special congress is to be held, it is because the party leadership comes up for election. In other words, starting now and until May, I consider myself a provisional leader of the FSLN because that congress will decide whether or not I continue to occupy a post of leadership. Based on that freedom of action and thought, I felt authorized to sign a document expressing a nonconfrontational position, a document that is an attempt to contribute to the debate. When a group of FSLN comrades met to draft the document, we discussed whether Major Luis Carrion, who is also a member of the DN, and I should sign or not. We decided that the most honest and most transparent thing was for us to sign since we were involved in the drafting. We could not fall back on the old trick of throwing the stone and then hiding our hand. [Question] How can you win power when some think that the Front is not yet prepared to be unified, not just because factions exist, but because of an entire culture, different styles of work and leadership, that seem to stand in the way of any possibility of unity? [Ramirez] That is precisely what we must change. The FSLN must face up to a process of transformation because it has never been afraid of change. Far worse would be to imagine a conservative Sandinism afraid of taking a chance, of moving forward, of thinking. If the Sandinists were able to put an end to the Somoza dictatorship, it was because they moved ahead, not just with military action, but also with new political ideas, by joining forces and forming alliances. The creation of the Group of the Twelve was a key move enabling the FSLN to take power by calling upon social sectors which, at the time, did not yet envision the FSLN as a government alternative and which in 1979 did so despite the fact that the FSLN proposed the option of armed struggle. Now, if what the FSLN is presenting is the option of civil, electoral struggle, then I believe all the more strongly that we can once again summon thousands of Nicaraguans who believe that this country deserves a better fate and that the FSLN can provide it. [Question] The crux of the matter is how to unite the so-called "majorities." What must the Sandinists offer in order to win them back? [Ramirez] A very clear message. I think the Sandinists lost the 1990 elections because many Nicaraguans began to harbor many prejudices in their minds. The people thought the FSLN was a symbol of war, that it would not solve the country's economic problems. [Question] But it continues to project that image at times. [Ramirez] That is what we want and need to change at all costs. I maintain that if the FSLN does not get to the majorities with the image of a civilian party, removed from violence, removed from any confrontation, one that wants harmony and reconciliation for this country, then it will be very difficult for us to rally the votes we need to win because we are indeed talking about votes here. Furthermore, it neither frightens me nor makes me ashamed to say that the FSLN is a revolutionary, electoral party because it has to go into the elections and win. One wins elections by rallying the will of all those who go into the little booth and who then, alone with their conscience, place a mark under a flag and decide for whom they will vote. That is the decisive, definitive time for a political party, far from the noise of the crowds and the demonstrations. I hope that a new, transparent FSLN, an FSLN that is very clear and firm about what it says, about doing what it says and saying what it does, can convince the voters that we are once again a viable alternative for the country. [Question] I would like you to define what you mean when you say, "We oppose violence," what kind of weapons the working people still have, people who, because of the Sandinism of the majorities, accused the group of being social democratic. [Ramirez] I do not think the FSLN has any weapons left. Those weapons are now in the hands of the Army and the Police, which are the only institutions allowed to have weapons in this country. This must be stated quite clearly and without fear. The FSLN is a party that must use all the paths of civic struggle that are open to it, not lending themselves to confusion. The FSLN must fight from the perspective of the majorities, their conquests and their rights. The right to strike, marches, and social pressure are legitimate instruments. What is not legitimate is resorting to violence in a strike, attacking those who do not agree with what is being done. In addition, certain terms are deliberately used to confuse the people. I am referring to the notorious "social democracy." As a result of a decision by the Sandinist Assembly, the FSLN appealed to the Socialist International, an international organization of social democratic parties, to admit it as a full member, but the IS decided to admit the FSLN as an observer. The request was a party decision, not a decision by individuals in the party. Before that, as we prepared for the World Interparliamentary meeting, we decided, following the assassination of Olof Palme, one of the outstanding social democratic leaders in the world, to give his name to the convention center. Major Daniel Ortega, secretary general of the party, personally attended the funeral of Willy Brandt, another of the foremost social democratic leaders in the world, in order to pay homage to him on behalf of the Sandinists. The Sandinists have always been a friend of social democrats and continue to be. I am not an enemy of any social democratic leader. Next week I will meet in Spain with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, a great friend of Nicaragua and the Nicaraguan revolution. He is a social democrat and does not go around denying it. I am not a social democrat, but I am not their enemy either and see nothing wrong with being one. I am a democratic Sandinist who believes that the only possible Sandinism is democratic Sandinism because if someone were to tell me that there is a type of Sandinism that is potentially totalitarian, I would not believe it. [Question] Why is there no definition of the left anywhere in the document? [Ramirez] It is stated in the document, a leftist document. It is not, in my view, a rightist document, nor is the one drafted by our other comrades in the FSLN rightist because the FSLN is not a party of the right. The Nicaraguan political spectrum has a right and a left and the political space occupied by the latter is filled by the FSLN. However, it is necessarily a democratic left and I find it unnecessary to speak of a democratic left. The left is the left, the left of today. Perhaps there was a totalitarian left before, but it disappeared and one cannot say "I belong to the democratic left" because this would amount to agreeing that there is also a left that is not democratic and for me such a thing is impossible. If I belong to the left, I am democratic. [Question] How convinced is the entire FSLN and all its members that they do indeed no longer represent the majority, that they cannot lay claim to representing the nation or thinking for it, that we must have a change in style, method, and thought in order for the FSLN to return to power in the 1996 elections? [Ramirez] I believe there are many more people convinced of that than would appear. An attempt is often made to give a false image of radicalism in the ranks of Sandinism, as if it were enclosed in a radicalism with no way out and as if ideas about transformation, change, and renewal existed only in the heads of a handful of intellectuals. I am labeled an intellectual as if it were an offense, and it seems to me to be somewhat odd that anyone who thinks or who is an intellectual should be treated in a pejorative manner. All of us who think are in some way intellectuals, but the term "intellectual" is used to denote an elite that is unaware of what is happening among the rank and file, that only thinks about things unrelated to Nicaragua, as if to renew Sandinism, to transform its ideas, to go back to the majorities, were social democratic, European notions removed from this society. I have even been accused of having a European education, as if that were somehow negative. [Listener fromn Boaco] Why do you not have access to broadcasting stations such as "Radio Ya," "Radio Sandino," "Channel 4," and all the supposedly Sandinist media? That worries the rank and file because while the leaders say there is no split, we see different groups. What is happening within the party? [Ramirez] I share your concerns, comrade. They are well-founded, but you should not be worried about finding different ways of thinking within the FSLN. Thought must be heterogeneous in order to enrich debate, provided we are still speaking the same language. What we should be concerned about is silence, particularly when one is not allowed to express oneself. I would be very happy to speak on "Radio Ya," but I do not have access to that station. About three months ago, I participated in a debate on the constitution on Channel 4, but I would not say that I have access to that television or radio time. I think we must be honest in stating that this is an internal problem of the FSLN that we must air publicly. I prefer not to have time on certain radio stations, but I hope they will not mention me or my late brother at all! I prefer it that way because I have always opposed insults, slander or lies, which I cannot accept as a Sandinist. Your concern is well-founded because all Sandinists should have access to all the media. It is a great pleasure to be on Xavier Reyes's program because he invited me and has never denied me access. It was I who delayed coming for reasons of time. [Question] The emergence of currents of thought with well-defined positions has "shifted the ground" under the feet of those traditionally accustomed to "the line," to the fact that such matters were not debated publicly. They say they are confused, that the party is split and is falling apart. [Ramirez] That is a concern which must be removed from the thinking of people who truly believe in the strength of the party. The FSLN continues to be a very strong party and will be strengthened even further the more we debate, the more we think. You do not have to worry about me. If the ideas I present do not find acceptance among the majority of the FSLN and the latter makes a different decision, then, in a disciplined manner, I will yield to what the party says. That is why I belong to a party. I will continue to be a member of the FSLN. I would never switch to another party, nor would I fit into any political or ideological faction other than my FSLN. If the majority decides that the methods of struggle that we must choose are precisely those which I view as the wrong ones, then I shall continue to criticize such positions if they are taken by the majority, but I would not leave the party. I have complete confidence that a revolutionary party must evolve constantly. Every tree must shed its leaves in order to have new green ones; that is one of life's laws. [The same listener] I am concerned about the split in the party and I wish you would explain why, when you continue to be a member of the DN, Mr. Guadamuz denies you access to his program. What is going on? I wish you would be more explicit. [Ramirez] It is not that I am avoiding responding because that is not appropriate for a leader, but I think the question should be put to the person who is denying me space. He should reveal his reasons for doing so. However, it should also be put to those who are insulting and slandering me and the memory of my brother Rogelio. Let them explain why they act as they do. That radio station does not belong to the party. I asked for a clarification from the DN, and Major Henry Ruiz, who is treasurer, responded that the radio does not belong to the FSLN. Consequently, I assume that it is a private radio station and that its owners--I do not know who they are--are the proper ones to answer for what the radio station says. Consequently, if it takes a divisionist attitude, an attitude that does not contribute to party unity, then that is the responsibility of the owners, not the DN or the FSLN, because they do not own it. That must be made quite clear. [Carlos Guadamuz, director of "Radio Ya"] I was happy to hear Dr. Sergio Ramirez say he would like to be on "Radio Ya." For several days now, I have been trying to start a debate between the different factions and I am inviting him to come tomorrow or the day after tomorrow during prime time. It would be an enormous pleasure and source of pride to have Dr. Ramirez with us on "Radio Ya." [Ramirez] I am truly very happy to hear that tone of voice because it is not the same (perhaps it is not the same person) as the one that for days has been directing insults, lies, and slander at me. As a Christian, I forgive them because the Christian faith teaches us to forgive. I would merely ask Carlos Guadamuz to allow me to go first to Masatepe Cemetery to consult with my brother Rogelio, with whom I sometimes talk at his tomb because he continues to be my faithful adviser, about whether I should accept the invitation to speak on "Radio Ya." I will reply when I have spoken with Rogelio. I do not refuse to speak on any broadcasting station, particularly those claiming to be identified with my party. However, what I refuse to accept is that an invitation to speak on a station that previously heaped insults on me should then serve as a justification without first uttering a word of apology for those lies and insults. For example, it has been said that I betrayed Carlos Fonseca, something I cannot accept as mere words or verbal excesses. These are very heavy charges that wound me deeply because I have always defended my political honesty. I cannot therefore yield to such schemes or, as we say in Nicaragua, use such "ways out."
