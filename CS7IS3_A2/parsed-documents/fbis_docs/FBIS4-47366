The reasons for variations in the forms of presence of radioactive fallout over the territory of the Ukraine are discussed, as well as the mechanisms causing a change in mobility of radionuclides with time under different landscape-geochemical conditions. The processes of natural self-purification of territories from radioactive pollutants are evaluated, followed by a prediction of radiation conditions over the polluted territories for a period from 5 to 1000 years. The following are among the phenomena observed in the considered area. There is a multisided dynamics of the vertical migration of radionuclides in ground and soil horizons related to changes in the mobility of radionuclides. There is a considerable nonuniformity in the distribution of radioactivity in samples of soils, plants, water, bottom deposits and hydrobionts. There is fractionation of radionuclides in the fluvial network caused by the forms of entry of nuclides and their different physicochemical properties. There is active destruction of fuel particles and conversion of radionuclides into migratory forms. There is a nonuniformity in the distribution of radionuclides expressed in a difference in the dose loads by an order of magnitude for biosystems even in small test areas within the 30-km critical zone and beyond its limits. Under conditions of explosive discharge of radionuclides there is a great difference in the accumulation factors for the very same plants in different regions. Considerable redistributions of radionuclides are found in the system of Dnepr reservoirs and the Black Sea. Mathematical simulation made it possible to organize a databank for predicting the dynamics of radionuclide pollution of soils, water and bottom deposits. Dynamic models were constructed for estimating the formation of radionuclide pollution doses for the people living in regions with an increased content of radionuclides. The accumulated experience shows that the results of geochemical research are fundamental in solving technical, agroindustrial and biomedical problems. On the basis of these and other findings a list of problems in the field of geochemistry of radionuclides which must solved in the near future is given.
