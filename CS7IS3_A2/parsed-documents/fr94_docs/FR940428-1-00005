FR940428-1-00005 FR940428-1-00003 Another proposed revision to section 220.8 involves the expansion of a single outpatient rate to multiple reimbursement category rates similar to that for inpatient care. The Department of Defense proposes to adopt a methodology for computing rates for outpatient care similar to that used for computing multiple rates for inpatient care. Thus, collections for most outpatient services will be based on a standard per visit fee to a specialty/subspecialty which is representative of the average cost in facilities of the Uniformed Services of an outpatient visit to that specialty clinic. Multiple outpatient visits on the same day to different clinics will result in one charge for each clinic visit. Multiple visits on the same day to the same clinic will only have one charge. As a general rule, each standard per visit amount to the specialty/subspecialty clinic will be all-inclusive. No additional charge will be made for routine laboratory, radiology, pharmacy or other ancillary or overhead services provided in conjunction with an outpatient visit. Although most outpatient services will be billed based on the standard per visit fee for a specialty/subspecialty, there are several special rules for particular types of care. One special rule is that a separate charge for the same day/ambulatory surgery will be published annually. The proposed effective date of the proposed expanded number of billing categories is targeted for October 1, 1994. The specific rates will be published in the Federal Register . C. Miscellaneous Healthcare Services Initial implementation of the Third Party Collection Program was somewhat limited in scope and concentrated on inpatient and ambulatory care areas. We propose to expand the program to include outpatient services which may not traditionally be provided in hospitals or which are not traditional clinical specialties or subspecialties. This includes, but is not limited to, ambulance service, hyperbaric treatments, dental care services and immunizations. We propose to recover the cost of these services to the extent they are generally applicable coverage provisions of a third party payer. We propose to recover the cost of ambulance service which includes the cost of providing emergency aid and then transportation of beneficiaries to a medical treatment facility. It would also include the transport of patients to other medical facilities or the specialized clinics for diagnostic or therapeutic services which also is frequently necessary. We propose to recover costs on the basis of the length of time the ambulance is in service with one hour to be the minimum amount billed. Our reimbursement rates for ambulance care will only cover the costs of operating the vehicle, including labor costs (driver and attendant), supplies, fuel, and overhead. We also propose to recover the cost of hyperbaric treatments provided to beneficiaries as part of a course of treatment. For example, high pressure oxygenation treatments, burn treatments and decompression treatments in response to diving incidents are frequently provided. We only intend to recover the cost of providing these treatments which includes the operating cost of the chamber, e.g., labor costs, (operators and attending medical personnel), supplies, and overhead. We do not intend to include amortization of either the actual or replacement cost of the hyperbaric chamber or the building. Dental services are provided to beneficiaries on a space available basis and in remote locations. Dental services may include oral diagnosis and prevention, periodontics, prosthodontics (fixed and removable), implantology, oral surgery, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry and endodontics. We also provide a wide range of immunizations to Military Health Service beneficiaries, including immunizations against common childhood diseases such as measles, smallpox and diphtheria and regional endemic diseases such as yellow fever, plague and cholera. We also administer a variety of medications and test beneficiaries for allergic conditions. Immunizations costs are not included as part of the reimbursement rates for either inpatient or ambulatory care. We intend to seek reimbursement for immunizations against childhood diseases and diseases characteristic of the United States and its Territories. We will also seek reimbursement for the administration of all medications or allergy extracts, when the medication or extract is purchased by the medical treatment facility, and for the testing for allergic conditions. We do not intend to seek recovery for immunizations administered incident to overseas travel or transfer or for those medications purchased by the beneficiary and simply administered at the medical treatment facility. Our reimbursement rate shall be based on the average fully burdened cost of an immunization and we shall apply a separate charge for each immunization which is administered.
