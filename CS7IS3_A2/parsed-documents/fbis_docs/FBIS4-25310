According to a briefing, 20 academicians of the CAS and the CAE now work in medical care, public health, scientific research, higher education, engineering, technical, and the Armed Forces' departments. They included Qian Xuesen and Zhu Guangya, world-famous scientists. They have won twelve special-class state awards for scientific and technological progress, special-class awards for scientific and technological results in national defense, and state awards for major scientific and technological results; 21 first- and second-class state awards and first-class military awards for scientific and technological progress; and 10 merit citations, first or second class. Sixteen of them have been issued special subsidies by the government, and three have been rated young and middle-aged experts with outstanding contributions. At the forum, Zhu Guangya, Wu Mengchao, Wang Chengwei, Zhang Xiaoxiang, Chen Fangyun, Zhou Tingchong, Qian Qihu, Sun Manji, Zhou Xingming, Cheng Kaijia, Wang Yongzhi, and other academicians stated their views on developing science and technology for national defense, strengthening the training of qualified personnel in advanced science and high technology, attaching importance to scientific and technological exchanges, organizing personnel to tackle difficult scientific and technological problems through coordinated efforts, and further arousing the enthusiasm of scientists and technologists. Liu Huaqing made a speech after listening to academicians' opinions. On behalf of the Central Military Commission, he extended warm congratulations to the academicians of the two academies as well as high respects to large numbers of scientists, technologists, and engineers who had made outstanding contributions to the development of science and technology for national defense and the Armed Forces' modernization. He called for various departments to conscientiously step up research and continue to improve their work. Liu Huaqing said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that science and technology constitute a primary productive force. The Armed Forces' modernization cannot be accomplished without science and technology. It is a long-term, arduous task to develop science and technology for national defense. Large numbers of scientists, technologists, and engineers are charged with important tasks. We should further arouse their enthusiasm, train high-level personnel, have our eyes on the future, and coordinate and concentrate our efforts on continuously achieving results in modern science and technology. Liu Huaqing hoped that scientists and technologists working in the Armed Forces would strengthen their contacts with their counterparts at home and abroad, do a better job in academic exchanges, learn from others' strong points to offset their weaknesses, and improve themselves and that they would, under the Central Military Commission's leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, unite as one and work in a pioneering spirit to contribute more to the national defense's modernization. Central Military Committee leaders had group pictures taken with academicians of the two academies and also had supper with them.
