The leader of the Belarusian Popular Movement parliamentary opposition, Zyanon Paznyak, stated that the main reason for dismissing them were the facts that they knew about corruption and the involvement of government officials and leaders in that corruption; moreover, they were uncompromising on this issue. Second, there are political forces at work which have close connections with imperial Russian circles, including special services and the Russian counterintelligence service, according to KGB Chairman Eduard Shirkovskiy's statement during the behind-closed-door proceedings. Zyanon Paznyak also touched upon the personal qualities of the dismissed officials. Thus, according to the oppositional leader, thanks to Vladimir Yegorov, there was no bloodshed in Belarus over the last four years. Both Vladimir Yegorov and Eduard Shirkovskiy have been trying, while adhering to the law, to act in line with Belarusian interests, which was much to the dismay of the Council of Ministers.
