Interviewed following the Honor Guard anniversary celebrations, de Leon said that "the members of the transportation sector agreed not to adopt illegal positions but they failed to keep their word, which shows irresponsibility." The president said that "fortunately" all gasoline stations are working normally and that his government is not willing to accept these types of pressures. He even went on to say that if it became necessary he would take legal measures and "if it were required he would resort to intervention because the Constitution gives him the authority. Therefore, they should accept the consequences." He noted that the Constitution states that when public services are adversely affected the government may intervene, so the people can rest assured they will have fuel without any inconvenience. "That is what they are trying to provoke. They are trying to blackmail the government by taking advantage of the referendum situation." Ramiro de Leon, however, said that once the referendum process is over, the president will act firmly on behalf of all people and "not on behalf of a small group of irresponsible people." He added that of all the demands made by the transportation sector some have already been resolved and the rest are in the process of being resolved. That is why the strike announcement by transportation sector members to frighten the population is illegal, inappropriate, and shows their irresponsibility. De Leon said the intercity and international freight transportation bills have already been drafted. As for other types of transportation bills, legal rulings have determined that they are unconstitutional, which have prevented them from passing. As for cement price changes, he pointed out that the Communications Ministry has already drafted an agreement to deal with this request, which means it is being resolved. As for a 4-percent tax retention by the internal revenue office, it was determined that it is applicable to all persons who provide any kind of service and do not hand out authorized receipts. That is why the transportation sector must pay this tax. Finally, de Leon Carpio said that as for transportation fares, members of the transportation sector were invited to meet with the economic cabinet on 2 February, as is government policy, in order to find a viable solution to the problem. Transportation Sector: Decision To Strike Remains Firm Meanwhile, Miguel Angel Luna Gamboa, president of the National Transportation Coordinating Board [CNT], said he was surprised to hear the president's statements and reiterated that the entire land transportation sector is determined to go ahead with the strike. He added that the movement they are promoting is not politically oriented. Proof of this is that during the electoral event they will work nonstop. That is why "the president's statements are unfair." What happened, he said, is that the president is trying to mix economic and political problems, but the CNT reiterates that its demands are administrative in nature. "If the problem is not resolved it is because there is no presidential, ministerial, or political willingness to solve it," Luna Gamboa said.
