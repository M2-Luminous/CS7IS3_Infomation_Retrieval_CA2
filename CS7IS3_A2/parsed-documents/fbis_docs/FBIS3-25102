The minister of justice and of defense, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, and his Zimbabwean counterparts, Mr. Emmerson Mnangagwa and Mr. Dumiso Dabengwa [name as heard], said after talks in Harare that a working committee had been established to oversee an exchange of information on matters such as the administration of justice, the combating of organized crime, and the resumption of an extradition treaty. The imprisonment in Zimbabwe of three South Africa agents had also been discussed, but Mr. Mnangagwa merely said that the men would be freed at an appropriate time. The men were sentenced to life imprisonment for bombing an ANC [African National Congress] house in 1988.
