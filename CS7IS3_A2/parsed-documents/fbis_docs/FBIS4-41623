Everyone abroad seems to think that everything is nice and quiet in Ukraine. However, the danger of transforming Ukraine into a new Yugoslavia persists. Kuchma was obliquely criticizing the United States, which had promised economic aid to Ukraine in exchange for its nuclear disarmament. For now, all we have received are words, but not a cent. Kuchma believes that there is no problem with the Crimea. The conflict there is a myth used for political purposes, he said. These words are regarded as a hint on Kravchuk's position. The former Ukrainian prime minister also said that no one can order the Russians to leave Sevastopol.
