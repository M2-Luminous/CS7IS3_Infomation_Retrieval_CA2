After the conclusion of the talks Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu made a statement to the press in which he reviewed yesterday's and today's meetings with the trade union confederations, saying that each of those demands has been examined separately. The premier said that many of them refer to issues for which there are no financial resources, whereas others are in connection with the problems of the economic reform and the 1993-1994 program for economic restructuring and privatization, whereas other demands lack realism. Some of the demands have nothing to do with the unions' activity, the Romanian prime minister assessed adding that those claims pursue other goals. Vacaroiu also mentioned the fact that issues related to social protection were also approached, especially the ensuring from the state budget of the necessary funds to improve the standard of living of employees working in the public sector. In that context the premier expressed his hope that by the end of this year the standard of living will increase to a certain extent, but the essential prerequisite of that is the increase of production. The prime minister concluded his statement by saying that interruptions of work lead to considerable losses in the national economy. In turn, the chairman of CNSLR-Fratia, Mr. Victor Ciorbea, stated that the majority of their claims date back four to 13 months, and they have still not been settled, whereas in the case of certain demands the solutions that were found have not been applied. During today's meeting they agreed that negotiations should be continued between CNSLR--Fratia and the government intended to settle the 14 demands forwarded to the government by the union confederation. Ciorbea also pointed out that none of the claims was settled during today's meeting, and, as a consequence of this, the general strike on 28 February will take place as scheduled. Today we were sent via fax the decision adopted by the National Council of the National Trade Union Bloc [BNS] in connection with the continuation of their labor actions. The text outlines the fact that BNS continued its efforts to conclude an economic-social pact, provided the signatory partner is a credible and generally accepted executive. The document also says that after taking note of the state power's refusal to cooperate with BNS in order to extinguish the current conflict, as well as of its refusal to answer the suggestions forwarded to it by that union confederation, the BNS National Council decided to continue the labor conflict against the government that was begun on 10 January last year. The document also points out that in order to avoid making the same mistakes that were previously made by Romania's trade unions, the BNS National Council decided to commence ample actions to mobilize basic union structures and to organize a national referendum intended to establish the opportunity, viability, and the concrete schedule of the continuation and implementation of the labor actions that were begun on 29 November 1993.
