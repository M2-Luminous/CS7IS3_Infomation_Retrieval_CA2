In remarks to Radio La Red of Buenos Aires, Menem added: "We have done away with a system in which corruption had been established for many years, that is, the oversized state that we had. There were state-owned enterprises that had truly become centers of corruption." Menem emphasized that his government "had dismantled this system" and asked entrepreneurs to cooperate and "help in eliminating these small centers." The reports on alleged acts of corruption within the retirees social services organization (PAMI) [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan] has been described by political observers as one of the reasons why the ruling Justicialist Party (PJ, Peronist) lost in the country's capital the Constituent Assembly elections held on 10 April. PAMI President Matilde Menendez, the No. 2 candidate on the PJ ticket for these elections, resigned as a Constituent Assembly member 48 hours after the elections, but denied that she was involved in acts of corruption and asked the General Directorate of Taxation (DGI) to investigate her assets.
