FRAMATOME, which also has activities in computer services and electronic components, is not on the list of 21 publicly-owned groups which the centre-right Government has slated for privatisation. It will be sold through a limited tender offer. The likely candidates to take a controlling stake in the group include ALCATEL-ALSTHOM, the engineering, transport and communications group, which already holds 44 percent of the shares. In 1990, ALCATEL-ALSTHOM briefly managed to acquire a majority stake in FRAMATOME, raising its investment from 40 percent to 52 percent. FRAMATOME was formed in 1958 to design and build light pressurised water reactors and nuclear components. It has since diversified and expanded sales to more than FF12 billion a year. In 1992, the latest year for which figures are available, it reported net profits of FF900 million.
