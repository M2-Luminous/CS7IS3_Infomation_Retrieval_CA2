In your statement, you spoke about greater intervention in world crises. Do you want to send troops into Bosnia to fight in that country? [Berlusconi] I can tell you what is actually happening in Italy and in my government. In Italy, there is no nostalgia for a period that we consider to be buried in the past and condemned by history. All the surveys that have been carried out on this issue have shown that less than 1 percent of Italians -- the last survey said exactly 0.4 percent of Italians - have what could be termed nostalgia, and perhaps that is even going a bit far, for fascism. So this problem does not exist and has nothing to do with the real state of affairs. Moreover, the government that I head and which is made up of the ministers I chose does not contain, nor could it ever contain, any minister who is not a democratic minister, any minister who does not believe in freedom and democracy or who does not believe that totalitarianism must always be fought. As to the second part of your question, we have discussed the possibility of international organizations taking more effective action in the future. Concerning specific situations in the world -- the former Yugoslavia is one, but there is also Rwanda, and other situations in Africa, of which Somalia is an example -- a great deal has been done. When they see all these tragic scenes on television, all our people ask themselves whether enough has been done. I know that it is not easy to find solutions, and I do not think anyone believes that by simply sending in troops things can be solved. Nevertheless, I believe that the international organizations must pay the utmost attention to what is happening in the world so that through diplomatic action they can prevent potential crises from developing and giving rise to many disasters, much pain and suffering. Above all, I believe that everything must be done to prevent a wound from becoming a permanent and incurable ulcer and a a continuous cause of pain and suffering. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] Could I ask Mr. Berlusconi something? Since any judgement about the government must be based on concrete facts, we would like to know which measures will be put before parliament first and most urgently, and how does he intend to move in the Senate, where he only has a very narrow majority? Also, I would like to ask President Clinton what he thinks about the possibility of Italian troops participating in the UN mission in former Yugoslavia -- whether or not he agrees with this. [Berlusconi] I do not believe that we should bore our guests with matters concerning domestic politics, which have already been explained several times in the presentations of the government's manifesto to the Senate and in the replies to questions in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. We know very well that we are waiting for a relaunch of the economy and for growth and that we must tackle the central problem of creating new jobs. We will proceed in this direction, and let me say that on this matter I can clearly remember what President Clinton said in Detroit a few months ago, when he stated that the employment problem could not be solved by state intervention, but that the state should encourage private initiative, which is the real engine and can create new jobs. I also remember that on that occasion he outlined what he thought were the best ways of tackling the problem and specifically that of a different relationship between man and work. In other words, a different way of looking at the changing face of work to achieve greater flexibility in the labor market -- and a determined effort on everyone's part to improve training. We are following the very same line, and we are already making changes, because this government has restored confidence to business, to the many millions of Italian businessman on whom our particular kind of wealth is based and who would have felt let down by other governments, but who now have the promise of intervention to support them, of various measures, of a tax truce, and above all have the promise to change the stance of the machinery of politics and bureaucracy toward those who take risks and do business, who have already started again and who are looking with trust and optimism to the future of their companies. I believe that is what we should worry about doing and it is what we are already doing. As for the second part of the question, I am not at all worried because certain committees appointed chairpersons who do not belong to the majority parties. I believe that the road is long, and I continue to be optimistic -- I still think that the minority parties have accepted the outcome of the election and the Italians' desire for a working government and that the minority parties will not want to be destructive or to hinder government, but that they intend to judge policies individually, for the good of the country. The minority parties will be vigilant, careful, and will analyse things, but they will work for and not against government.
