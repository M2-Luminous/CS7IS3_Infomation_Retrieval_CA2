It is long overdue, because fear of retaliation keeps those who know something quiet. The latest victim of contract murder was sportsman, businessman, and philanthropist Otari Kvantrishvili, who was killed by a sniper. Shots from hired guns sound increasingly often on the streets of the capital. And with impunity. Is it really true that `GODFATHERS' OWN THE CITY? Moscow was shocked and intrigued by the latest, clearly contract murder. An unidentified sniper fired several shots and killed O. Kvantrishvili, a controversial personality about whom there had been a great variety of opinions while he was still alive. For some, Kvantrishvili was a famous philanthropist, who kept out of poverty many previously famous athletes and a well-known coach, and one of the founders of the Lev Yashin Foundation for Social Protection of Athletes and of the sportsmen party. In the opinion of others, behind Kvantrishvili was a trail of questionable connections, which in the final count led to his sad demise. Anyway, let us wait and see what conclusions the investigation will reach. Meanwhile let us try to reconstruct some events that preceded the tragedy. Nine Months Before the Murder In the beginning of August of last year, O. Kvantrishvili's brother Amiran--an "exposed" kingpin in the Moscow criminal world--was killed in a classic mafiosi score-settling. The shooting, which took the life of Amiran and his people, happened right in front of a commercial company on Yakimanka. Crime kingpins (many did not make any particular effort to hide on that day) held a posh funeral for A. Kvantrishvili in the style of criminal novels. A burial service was performed in the Vagankovskoye cemetery church, and he was buried right there, next to the grave of... Vladimir Vysotskiy. Many recalled then that several years before Amiran's funeral another kingpin from the Caucasus--Valerian Kuchuloria--was buried at this prestigious Moscow cemetery. In the evening, in the Hotel Moscow restaurant, the deceased was remembered, noisily and with pomp. Among the invited guests were quite a few famous Moscow personalities with whom the crime boss was friendly. The only person who did not attend the wake, according to some sources, was one of the chiefs of the Dagestan mafia, S. Lukmanov, who was supposed to be in hiding from the authorities and very carelessly "exposed" himself at the cemetery. A little later many mass media also began mentioning direct connections with the criminal world of the other Kvantrishvili brother--Otari. Members of the law enforcement community in confidential conversations advanced guesses regarding his weight in the criminal world. There were also questions regarding the Yashin Foundation, which to some looked like a convenient cover for money-laundering. Meanwhile, Otari Kvantrishvili continued, with visible pleasure, to attend society mingling parties and to "shine" on television. Two Days Before... Nikita Simonyan, first vice president of the Russian Soccer Union, was one of the last persons to see Kvantrishvili alive: "It just so happened that I saw Otari Vitalyevich literally a couple of days before this. He felt fine, was in a good mood. Together, we had a conversation with Russian Hockey Federation [RHF] President Vladimir Petrov. We talked about the conflict between the RHF and the leadership of a number of clubs in the International Hockey League. By the way, Otari Vitalyevich was always very interested in the problems of our sport and, being the president of the Yashin Foundation, gladly helped impoverished athletes and the disabled. Most of all, however, he rooted as a fan of Moscow Dynamo. Very often I saw him in the bleachers at the stadium." INFORMATION: As our correspondent was told by the Sports Wrestling Federation, Otari Vitalyevich has done free-style wrestling for quite some time. He has not earned any particular laurels in this endeavor, however, and has never been a member of the USSR national team. He did find success as a coach. One of his disciples--Yuriy Vorobyev--even rose as high as two-time European champion. Later Kvantrishvili was awarded the title "Distinguished Coach of Russia." And the Shots Sounded From various sources, we have been able to reconstruct the picture of the murder. Otari Kvantrishvili left Krasnopresnenskiy bath house on Tuesday at 1730 in the company of friends. When he reached the parking lot, three shots sounded. One bullet hit him in the head, one, in the neck, and the third, in the chest. Kvantrishvili's companions immediately took the wounded man to the Botkin Hospital. But it was too late... Several minutes after being brought to intensive case unit, Otari died. Militia personnel who arrived at the site of the incident established that the shots had been fired from the attic window of a corner building, No. 4 (No. 29 on Presnenskiy Bank), located next to the baths. The operatives found a German-made small-gauge rifle (5.6 mm gauge) with a telescope and magazine, and three spent cartridges. That the assailant was a professional the investigators have no doubt. It is quite possible that having received his "honorarium" the hired killer had already left Moscow, or had been immediately "removed" by his own customers in order to cover the tracks. There are several versions of the cause of the killing. Some believe that Kvantrishvili was killed on order from the so-called Slavic mafia, which had been lately very actively "pushed" by Caucasians. It is possible that the killing is somehow linked with the recent--second--attempt on the life of one of the Moscow mafia kingpins going under the nickname Raspisnoy. Others believe that the three fateful shots are "greetings from Lubyanka," which decided to sow discord between two largest criminal groups so that in the fight among themselves they would eliminate as many of each other as possible and at the very least would not unite--the latter holding a threat of unforetold consequences for the city's safety. There are also other versions, including some related to Kvantrishvili's "sports" activities. In particular, with the sportsmen's party, which the Ministry of Justice had been refusing to register for quite some time despite tremendous pressure brought. Having visited the site of the incident yesterday morning, our correspondents did not find anyone from internal affairs organs: "Investigative work" on the site had been completed during the night. Neither could anything be learned from bath house employees who, as if on a prompt, totally clammed up. There were, however, several cars with bored "riders" in them. INFORMATION: It is a known fact that Otari Kvantrishvili was a good acquaintance of Iosif Kobzon. Unfortunately, we were unable to find out the singer's reaction to the event: He is currently on tour in the United States. In the office of his company, Moskovit, we were told that Kobzon already had been informed of the tragedy, but no detailed information is available yet. The Yashin Foundation for the Social Protection of Sportsmen distributed a list of the deceased's achievements: raising several athletes who earned high titles; founding the foundation itself; helping Great Patriotic War and Afghan war veterans.
