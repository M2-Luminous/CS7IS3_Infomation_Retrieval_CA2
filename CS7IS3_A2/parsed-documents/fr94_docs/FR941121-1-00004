FR941121-1-00004 FR941121-1-00001 The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;8638 (58 FR 39644, July 26, 1993) and by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows: Pratt & Whitney: Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;21. Supersedes AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14, Amendment 39&hyph;8638. Applicability: Pratt & Whitney (PW) Model JT8D&hyph;9, &hyph;9A, &hyph;11, &hyph;15, &hyph;15A, &hyph;17, &hyph;17A, &hyph;17R, and &hyph;17AR turbofan engines containing front compressor fan hub Part Number (P/N) 817401 with the following serial numbers: J78892 through J80538, K32019 through K34018, L32197 through L34133, or M05722 through M07296; and all serial numbers of fan hubs P/N 594301, 640601, 743301, 749801, 750101, 791801, and 806001. These engines are installed on but not limited to Boeing 727 and 737 series, and McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 series aircraft. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent fracture of the front compressor fan hub, which can result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft, accomplish the following: (a) For front compressor fan hubs installed in engines in the No. 2 position on Boeing 727 aircraft on or after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), inspect and shotpeen the front compressor fan hub in accordance with Appendix A, Appendix B, and Attachment 1 (NDIP&hyph;764) of PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6104, Revision 3, dated June 16, 1994, as follows: (1) Initially inspect the front compressor fan hub as follows: ␣ 1Total Part Cycles (TPC) on the effective date of this AD 1Initial inspection interval Over 18,001 TPC Inspect at the next shop visit, or within 300 cycles in service (CIS) after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. 16,501 to 18,000 TPC Inspect at the next shop visit, or within 500 CIS after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. 15,001 to 16,500 TPC Inspect at the next shop visit, or within 750 CIS after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. 13,501 to 15,000 TPC Inspect at the next shop visit, or within 1,000 CIS after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. 10,501 to 13,500 TPC Inspect at the next shop visit, or within 1,500 CIS after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. Less than 10,501 TPC Inspect at the next shop visit but not to exceed 12,000 TPC, or by the compliance end-date, whichever occurs first. (2) Engines removed from the No. 2 position on Boeing 727 aircraft and reinstalled in aircraft or positions other than the No. 2 position on Boeing 727 aircraft after the effective date of this AD must adhere to the initial inspection interval specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this AD. Inspect and shotpeen front compressor fan hubs on these repositioned engines in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this AD. (3) Remove front compressor fan hubs from service if cracks are found during the inspection process and replace with a serviceable hub. (4) Shotpeen the front compressor fan hubs that pass the inspections required by paragraph (a)(1) of this AD, in accordance with Appendix B of PW ASB No. 6104, Revision 3, dated June 16, 1994, prior to returning the hub to service.
