Inaugurating a P [Philippine pesos] 4.5 billion rural development project funded by the Japanese government here, he cited this farming-fishing town as an example of how to turn a rebel- dominated area into a "vibrant, bustling community." "Tapos na `yung problema na 'yon, nasugpo na natin `yon (We have overcome that problem)," the president declared, referring to the communist insurgency. In the case of Jala-jala, he said, the government won not through the military solution but by providing livelihood programs and job opportunities to the people. Mr. Ramos, a former Armed Forces chief of staff and later defense secretary, recalled that this area used to be "strategic" to the New People's Army. He said this town by Laguna Lake was often used as a jump-off point because several key areas and provinces are easily accessible from here. Having been once stationed in the area as a junior military officer, the president added he had seen how the Huk [anti- government rebel group] and later NPA [New People's Army] campaigns had turned the area into a "no man's land." He also said this town had been isolated for so long from the rest of Rizal province and Metro Manila because of lack of concrete roads and infrastructure. "But now, you're no longer isolated here," he told farmers and fisher folk in a speech at the newly completed rice processing complex. The president said the rural development project, now on the second phase of implementation, has helped made this possible. Funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, (JICA), the project comprises a rice processing complex, irrigation, water and power supply systems, and trunk and feeder roads. Construction began early last year and is expected to be completed March 1995. Yesterday's ceremonies involved the turnover of some of the completed facilities and equipment. Agrarian Reform Secretary Ernesto Garilao said Jala-jala has also become a "model agrarian reform community" through the land distribution component of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). "The problem of skewed land ownership, which is the reason for rebellion in the area, has been addressed," he said. From having nine landowners, he said, Jala-jala has been transformed into a town of 2,000 farmer-landowners. For his part, Japanese Ambassador Yoshifumi Matsuda [name and title as published] said his government intends to give priority to CARP projects in extending more economic aid in the future. In brief remarks during the turnover rights, he said his government believes CARP should be implemented "as fast as possible."
