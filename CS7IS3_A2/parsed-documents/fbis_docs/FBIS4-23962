The president of Medecins sans Frontieres, (Bernard Grandjean), said that people have been killed and activities paralyzed in the camp. Journalists and humanitarian workers have been chased out of the camp by the militias. The militias also harass and stop people who want to come back to Rwanda and instead argue with them to stay in camps in Tanzania so that they can be trained and armed to attack Rwandan Patriotic Front forces in Rwanda. The Tanzanian authorities and the UNHCR should come to the rescue of the people in this refugee camp and also be able to control the activities of the militias who take the law into their own hands.
