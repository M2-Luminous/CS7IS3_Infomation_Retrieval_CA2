As reported by the Information Center of the Zaporizhzhya AES, in summer, each one of the operating power units will be halted for a scheduled overhaul involving the reloading of fuel. This work will be started with Power Unit 1, which is presently under repair. However, do not hasten to answer in the affirmative to the question posed in the heading. Under the pressure of the ``Greens,'' sessions of the local councils of people's deputies of Kamyanka Dniprovska in Zaporizhzhya Oblast and of Nikopol in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, adopted a decision to hold, on 26 June, local referendums on building storage facilities for dry used nuclear fuel on the territory of the Zaporizhzhya AES. We hope that residents of these towns and adjacent rayons will trust the conclusions made by atomic specialists--not only ours, but also those from the United States, Germany, Sweden, and Canada, where the system for dry-storing used nuclear fuel is already used. If the construction work takes one or one and one-half years longer, the Zaporizhzhya AES will have to start closing down power units next [1995] summer. The reasons are that used nuclear fuel has not been evacuated from the plant for a long time, but accumulates in the reservoirs inside the sealed shells of the units. They cannot stretch indefinitely.
