FBIS4-10326 "drlat070_a_94013" FBIS-LAT-94-070 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Nuclear Technology Program Discussed Nuclear Technology Program Discussed FL0804211094 Havana Cuba Vision Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 6 Apr 94 FL0804211094 Havana Cuba Vision Network Spanish BFN [Second "Open Agenda" program segment on Cuba's nuclear program with host Antonio Resillez and guest Gilberto Salazar, vice secretary of the Nuclear Affairs Executive Secretariat, SEAN -- live] [Excerpts] [Resillez] Today's program is rather unusual in that most of the information will come not from dialogue but through videos. We have prepared several reports that we are confident will give our viewers a comprehensive idea of the practical application of nuclear technology in the Cuban economy's principal developing sectors. "Open Agenda" will include exclusive statements by the director of the radiation health and safety center, as well as by SEAN executive secretary, engineer Andres Garcia -- a rather important part of tonight's program. We wish to begin with a report by Cienfuegos correspondent Omar George. [passage omitted] [Resillez] Salazar, the SEAN gives particular attention to the completion of the isotopes production center. I recall that on last Tuesday's program we talked about isotopes and their characteristics. I would like you to explain the importance of this center. [Salazar] The Isotopes Production Center is going to be the largest and most complex nuclear-technology facility, and is extremely important for economic as well as strategic reasons. At its temporary facility at Quinta and 30th Streets, three radiopharmaceutical products are manufactured, but there are certain products that cannot be made there. The new facility will make producing more products a reality. It will also allow us to increase the volume of these products. In a short period, we will be able to produce 25 items. At the temporary facility, we can produce only three items. By 1995, we expect this increased production to save Cuba approximately $1 million; hence its economic importance. In strategic terms, this increase in production will allow us to increase the application of nuclear technology nationwide, and reduce our foreign dependency. Moreover, this work of producing, receiving, and handling the isotopes in a centralized manner will increase safety in this area. This new center will thus be of tremendous importance to the country. [Resillez] Thank you, engineer. We are now going to run a video that will confirm and perhaps increase understanding of this center, and will also show the current stage of construction of this isotopes production center here in Havana. [Begin video recording by unidentified reporter] Among the priorities of Cuba's nuclear program is a modern isotopes center that is being built in the vicinity of Pedro Pi in the eastern part of Havana. Conceived as a production, research, and development unit, this center seeks to extend nuclear techniques to medicine and industry. Its basic objective is to organize reception and quality control, distribute the primary radioisotopes, and produce whatever is needed in Cuba. This center intends to carry out a number of tasks, among them production of radiopharmaceutical products and tracer compounds [compuestos marcados] essential for medical diagnoses and therapy. The tracer compounds are practically irreplaceable instruments in developing new medicines, a program the country is implementing. The requirements for registering and marketing these medicines include complex pharmacokinetic studies, many of which are possible only when the molecules are marked with radioactive isotopes that allow them to be followed through the living organism, tracing their body's accumulation and excretion processes, as well as other characteristics. A group of radiochemists from this center are in charge of doing the radioactive marking of this new medicine known as PPG. This has allowed a savings of $17,000, and above all, protection of the formula, which should be revealed to the foreign company in charge of the marking. Because of its production capacity and characteristics, the new plant -- which employs Argentine technology -- will be the largest facility in Cuba to handle radioactive material. Consequently, SEAN has paid special attention to the work in order to guarantee its safety from the very beginning. [end recording] [Resillez] Probably very few people are aware that nuclear technology is employed in vital areas of the country's economic and productive spheres. Some may be aware of this, but for many it will come as a surprise. When I say vital areas of the country's economic development, I am referring, for instance, to the sugar agroindustry, nonsugarcane agriculture, the nickel industry, biotechnology, and others, which could include exploration for and extraction of Cuban crude oil. In all these lines of development, nuclear technology is used. I think the best way to convey this to our viewers is through the following report: [Begin video recording of unidentified correspondent] The use of nuclear technologies in various spheres of national life is one of the main objectives of Cuba's nuclear program, which received a special thrust in the 1980's. The areas in which these techniques are used includes agriculture, the sugar industry, and iron and steel production, as well as geological exploration for oil and minerals. Cuban agriculture has especially benefited from the use of nuclear techniques. Through the use of ionizing radiation, an important phytotechnical program of mutation has allowed us to obtain a variety of new plants of great economic importance. An accelerated program using the technique that leaves plants insect-free has been implemented to control pests that affect several crops; the most important results achieved have been with the borers that attack sugarcane. Radioactive tracers and nuclear analytical techniques in the sugar agroindustry have allowed us to evaluate the operations of our installations and learn about the chemical composition of the products and by-products obtained. The use of radioisotopic instruments has developed greatly over the past few years. The iron and steel and mechanical industries must be highlighted. Factories in these industries use monitoring systems based on this type of equipment. This production line is currently being strengthened, with the possibility of developing and producing equipment for these purposes in Cuba. An example of this is the nickel industry's humidity-measurement system based on the method of reflecting neutrons that was designed and manufactured in Cuba. This system gives us a tremendous saving in fuel. The other area in which nuclear techniques are used is petroleum research. Determining the point of interphase between water and oil and establishing the causes of failures in wells under exploitation are two of the objectives of the use of radioisotopic techniques in which foreign companies currently operating in Cuba have expressed interest. [end recording] [Resillez] Engineer Salazar, before going on to discuss the use of these practical techniques, I think our viewers might be interested in learning whether our nuclear development program is maintaining fluent international relations or is at all isolated. [Salazar] It maintains good relations, internationally. [Words indistinct] to show that our program is consistent and on the right path. We have bilateral relations with approximately 15 countries, and multilateral relations through the assistance and cooperation system of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], of which we are a member. Proof of this is that we have been elected to the board of governors by Latin America for a fourth time. This will give you an idea of the prestige we have achieved and of our current relations in this regard. We have received support from the IAEA for the period 1993-94 in support of the work we have been developing in Cuba involving the use of nuclear techniques. This support amounts to $1.2 million and has been provided to Cuba in equipment, training, and advising. This cooperation increased to $8 million over the past two [as heard] years and includes a food irradiation plant; a gamma chamber; modern nuclear-medicine equipment; modern equipment for other techniques applicable to industry, agriculture, (?and) computer laboratories; and technical assistance. I also want to point out that when we talk about $8 million over the past 10 years, we are referring not only to SEAN but to the nation. The Cuban nuclear program, through SEAN, supplies the entire country: Over 56 percent of those resources is in other organizations such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the Public Health Ministry, et cetera. [Resillez] Thank you, engineer. I see Engineer Salazar's reference to the health program and the presence of nuclear techniques in the health system as opportune. I am almost convinced that this is nothing new for our viewers, but let us see what happens with the practical use of nuclear techniques in the health system and in biotechnology. [Begin video recording of unidentified correspondent] Nuclear science and technology are becoming increasingly more important in the health program, in biotechnology, and in the pharmaceutical industry. Diagnostic methods with the use of radiopharmaceutical instruments are indispensable to the public health system. Among the radioisotopic techniques we can mention is the gammagraphic technique broadly used in neurological, cardiological, oncological, renal, and other studies. Cuba has a total of eight gamma cameras installed in nuclear medical services nationwide, in which professionals and experts in nuclear matters are working. National consumption of radioisotopes and tracer compounds has increased to more than $1 million annually over the past five years, although this cost has dropped over the past few years thanks to a group of radiochemists from the SEAN who have produced three tracer compounds used in renal, bone, and brain studies. This has allowed a savings of more than $100,000 annually. The radiosterilization system has allowed the decontamination and sterilization of bioprepared plastic materials and of medical-pharmaceutical products. The tracer compounds are in great demand in the genetic engineering and pharmaceutical industries. They facilitate the demand for studies of new pharmaceutical products before their registration. The task of the Cuban nuclear experts has also been extended to producing a small quantity of medical equipment. This equipment, which is produced in the country, are of high quality and very competitive. An example of this is the Degos bone density measurer for the diagnosis and treatment of problems in bone metabolism and in osteoporosis. It operates through a nuclear method called (photonic) absorption. This is very important for the studies of bone metabolism implemented by the Public Health Ministry. [end recording] [Salazar] Resillez, with the opportunity presented by this video, I would like to mention a few things. The video says that we have eight gamma cameras in the country. I would like to add that nationwide today, we have 17 nuclear medicine modules. This shows the high-level diagnoses that can be made of given diseases anywhere in the country. The video also mentions the production of some medical equipment we already discussed in the previous program. As you can see, the quality achieved is outstanding, and not only for this show. This has been confirmed by our own medical personnel who are using this equipment, although they are still facing a medical registration process. [Resillez] Thank you, engineer. The use of all these nuclear techniques, not only in Cuba but in any country in the world, demands very professional work and severe safety measures to prevent damage to people or the environment. In Cuba, of course we are doing this. In the following video we are going to see what is happening in this field. Then we are going to listen to Dr. Luis (Jova), who is head of the Center for Radiation Protection and Control [centro de proteccion e higiene de las radiaciones -- CPHR]. We therefore consider this video and these exclusive comments for Open Agenda of great importance to national public opinion. [Begin video recording by unidentified correspondent] Since its founding in 1985, the CPHR has been the coordinator and leading guide for radiological activities in Cuba. Together with the territorial delegations to the SEAN, it controls the radiation dosage received by each worker professionally linked to ionizing radiations in the 192 radiation institutions operating in the country. One of the most relevant activities carried out by this center is the research entitled: Environmental Radiological Studies Carried Out in Cuba Between 1984 and 1992, awarded by the Cuban Academy of Sciences. The radiation control task includes study and control of the local and regional influence that man has on the environment, of nuclear and radiation installations, and the influence of overall radioactive discharge. The data released by the national network is representative of the whole country. For their study, zones of economic interest have been prioritized, such as Juragua in Cienfuegos, and those of interest to tourism such as the northern coast of the provinces of Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, and Las Tunas. One of the conclusions of the radiation studies is that the radioactivity to which current and future visitors could be exposed in a tourist zone as important as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Paredon, or Cayo Sabinal, and the beaches of Santa Lucia, Covarrubias, or Por Ella, is much less than the average level throughout the world. Cuba is a territory with a normal radioactive background. It is a place with radiological conditions favorable to the development of any human activity in general, as well as being a magnificent place for those people who, in addition to the beauties of the area, enjoy the environmental cleanliness. The CPHR has demonstrated this with solid scientific arguments. [end recording] [Begin (Jova) recording] In fact, in addition to what you just saw, we can add that our center, as a center in charge of all scientific and technical services in the area of radiological safety, has participated [passage indistinct] treatment of children from the area affected by the Chernobyl accident, our experts have been charged with making a review and evaluating the amount of radiation these children received. Other studies have been developed in the field of radiology. In 1986, our center was also given the mission of collecting all radioactive sources no longer in use in the country, and to confine them safely in quarters owned by the SEAN and specially designed and built for that purpose. We were also charged with collecting all radioactive waste generated by institutional users of these sources. These wastes were also treated and are safely kept, thanks to technology designed by experts from our institution and our country. As you were able to see in that video, our center has an important responsibility concerning environmental radiation control. This, linked to services rendered in the radiation protection area by workers who are professionally exposed to radiation, guarantees radiation protection of the people, of workers who are exposed because of the work they do, and of the environment throughout the country. [end recording] [Resillez] Cuba has been working on its nuclear program for almost 20 years. Preparation, production, and training have been the essential pillars of this complex project which, as you have seen through these two consecutive programs on Open Agenda, the country can already witness the results it has achieved. A few hours ago we had a long chat with Engineer Andres Garcia, executive secretary of the National Atomic Energy Commission. As we said in the beginning, we attribute great importance to this conversation, especially regarding information for national and international public opinion. We have taken one segment of that dialogue, which basically discusses the prospects of the Cuban nuclear program. With that, we wish to conclude these two programs devoted to this issue, but not before expressing our gratitude to the SEAN and its information center for all the support they have provided us for this program. I would also like to thank Engineer Salazar, and you, viewer, for tuning in to this Open Agenda program. [Begin Garcia recording] First, I would like to thank everyone involved in this program, and especially you, Resillez, for this opportunity you are giving us to inform our people through this program about the Cuban nuclear program. Those videos have demonstrated that our nuclear program is in good health. Concerning future prospects, we are making efforts to begin the nuclear energy program. Thus, in the development of increasingly more complex installations, we have begun with the principle of using our own efforts -- in this case, the scientific potential created by the Revolution -- in this scientific-technical structure. Apropos to this idea, I wish to say that our development must be essentially based on the capacity created by the country to design and build complex installations in this field. We thus consider it a priority to keep our experts united, and especially to keep them developing their knowledge in the scientific-technical field. The world must think more and more about how to solve future energy problems. It is not only Cuba facing this energy crisis today. Man must think about how to solve this problem in the future. In this regard, nuclear energy plays an important role, and great efforts are being made today to develop sophisticated reactors, fast-breeding reactors, and nuclear fusion, which have greater potential than the current methods. What we have been doing so far is a way of keeping ourselves up to date on possibilities for beginning a much more complex energy generation system in the near future. However, if we abandon this idea, the potential created over the years by the Revolution would be dispersed. I think we, the men working in this field, have an obligation to be realistic and sensitive to the country's situation, confronting tasks that have to do with current times. But we must also have a view of the future, and work on this view. This is the way we think at the SEAN, and I think I can say, to sum up this idea: We must be able to daydream. I think our commander in chief, in his historical allegation -- and history will support me -- being a young lawyer, was able to have a future view of nuclear energy. In his allegation then, he was already referring to the importance of nuclear energy to solve the country's economic problems. Imagine! In 1953, we were a year short of operating the first nuclear power plant in the world. [end recording]
