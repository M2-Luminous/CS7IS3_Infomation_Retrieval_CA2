What A. Kozyrev Will Bring Back From China"] [Text] Beijing -- Andrey Kozyrev's three-day visit to China, which ends today, cannot be called too strenuous. Our foreign minister's talks with Qian Qichen, his Chinese colleague, took up only approximately 90 minutes. Then came a brief lecture for Chinese political experts, two very brief meetings with PRC State Council Premier Li Peng and PRC President Jiang Zemin, and the traditional news conference for journalists. The chief result of the visit evidently should not be regarded at all as the agreements signed here on crossing points in the border region or the protocol on consultations between the two countries' foreign policy departments but Kozyrev's very appearance in Beijing, which interrupted the succession of cancellations and postponements and confirmed Russia's desire and ability to tackle in earnest the building of relations with a great neighbor. Kozyrev assured Beijing that "the president's foreign policy" will not undergo any changes in connection with the government reshuffles and urged it to "judge by results, not by persons." Rejecting accusations of neo-imperialism, our minister declared: "If anybody thinks that he will be unable to reach agreement with me and will find someone else with whom it will be easier to reach agreement, I am afraid that they are badly informed, for example, about the makeup of the present State Duma. I invite them to familiarize themselves." The visit to Moscow of Jiang Zemin, president of the PRC and general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, promises to be the next important step in the Russian-Chinese dialogue. After failing to happen last year, this trip is now planned for the third quarter of this year.
