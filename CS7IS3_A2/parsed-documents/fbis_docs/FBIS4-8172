FBIS4-8172 "dreeu070_p_94013" FBIS-EEU-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 POLAND State Revenues Derived From Privatization State Revenues Derived From Privatization WS1104143894 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 11 Apr 94 pp 1, 7 WS1104143894 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA Polish BFN [Article by A.K.K.: "Finances of Privatization; How Much for the Treasury"] [Text] In line with preliminary calculations from the Finance Ministry, last year's privatization yielded 7.8037 trillion zlotys [Z]. The share of capital privatization--that is, the sale of stocks and shares of the Treasury--was Z4,8312 billion; the liquidation privatization--that is, the sale of liquidated companies or parts of their property--was Z1.2199 trillion. This means that the privatization of state-run enterprises and banks did not yield the expected revenues: It was expected in the 1993 budget that privatization revenues would equal Z8.8 trillion. This sum was supposed to be obtained from all sorts of privatization--that is, capital and liquidation privatization; this means that not only the Ownership Transformations Ministry was supposed to work to achieve it, but also other ministries that supervise privatization as well as other founding organs--first of all, voivods. If one wanted to find out what the real privatization revenues are, one would have to take into account not only the budget's revenues obtained from privatization, but also costs incurred because of that. The results concerning all of 1993 have not yet been prepared. In a brochure published by the Polish Economic Society, the authors Danuta Milczewska, Jacek Partyka, and Marianna Strzyzewska, using data from the beginning of privatization until the third quarter of last year, say that capital privatization yielded Z9.456 trillion for the state--that is, 64 percent of all privatization revenues. In that sum, foreign investors' contribution was Z5.541 billion. At that time, on the basis of Article 19 of the Law on State Enterprises, 191 enterprises were liquidated, yielding Z592 billion for the state; this means that, on average, one state-owned enterprise that was liquidated in this way was handed over to a private owner for Z3.1 billion. The revenues from the liquidation carried out on the basis of the privatization law--the liquidation of enterprises that were in better financial condition (there were 691 such cases)--came to Z4.575 billion. That means that one firm was sold for an average Z6.6 billion. Since the privatization process began, the share of revenues derived from liquidation carried out on the basis of the privatization law--that is, voluntary privatization, not privatization forced by a poor financial-economic situation--has been 88 percent. At the same time, however, the number of weak enterprises has recently been growing faster than the number of companies that voluntarily chose the privatization path. Toward the end of September, there were 1,095 of the former and 723 of the latter. This means that the state will not only have smaller revenues from the liquidation of enterprises (smaller direct revenues plus overdue payments to the budget) but also that the property will not be managed very efficiently. (After bankruptcy liquidation, the property is most frequently sold separately, less often, sold as a whole; after liquidation for the purpose of privatization, a given enterprise is most often leased or sold.) The costs that accompany ownership transformations are, among others, outlays for sector research, notary fees, remuneration for consulting companies, advertising costs, and commissions paid to banks for the sale of shares. In 1992, outlays for privatization were set in the Budget Law for Z263 billion plus 4 percent of the revenues from capital privatization. In all, Z365.8 billion, or 7.6 percent in comparison with all privatization revenues, was spent for this purpose. In the 1993 Budget Law, outlays were set at the level of Z320 billion plus 4 percent of the revenues from capital privatization. That means that the outlays should not have been greater than Z594 billion.
