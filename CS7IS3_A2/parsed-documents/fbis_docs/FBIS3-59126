Returning from Taiwan to Europe as head of a party delegation, Csepe is paying a three-day visit to Germany at the invitation of the CDU-CSU parliamentary group. "The goal of my visit is to hold political and economic talks rather than canvass electoral support," Csepe said. The German side offered assistance in intensifying Hungary's relationship with NATO within the framework of the Partnership for Peace scheme, he said. "We disagree with the view that we were left alone after the Brussels decision of NATO. Although full membership in NATO is still a goal, it lacks reality today. We accept the opportunity offered by the Partnership for Peace scheme," Csepe said. The German side stated it would promote Hungary's integration into the European Union, he said. Regarding his visit to Taiwan, Csepe said that Hungary should open a trade representation there. "The Czech Republic has already taken that step," he added.
