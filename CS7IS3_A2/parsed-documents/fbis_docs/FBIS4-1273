The appointment of Edem Kodjo, chairman of the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] is being disputed by the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR], which is the other party of the majority. The CAR recalls that according to an agreement made last month with the UTD, the prime minister should come from the CAR. For his part, Edem Kodjo wants to calm things down. Here is his reaction, speaking to Guy Mariot, our correspondent in Togo. Listen hard: The line quality is not of the best. It will be difficult to hear all of what he says. [Begin recording] [Kodjo] We must try not to poison the atmosphere, because the reaction of the CAR is a reaction that must be integrated within the framework of the problems that we are facing and will face. The most important thing is that the bridges should not be broken between the two political parties which make up the parliamentary majority. And these bridges have not broken. As Mr. Agboyibo has himself suggested, and I think it is not a bad idea, we should seek fresh consultations in such a way as to make progress on the problems we face. [Mariot] But does the UDT-CAR coalition still exist, Mr. Prime Minister? [Kodjo] Of course it does. And it is this coalition which is the fruit of the victory of the Togolese people during the recent parliamentary elections. We cannot get away from this coalition. I believe we must do our utmost to ensure its continued existence. [Mariot] So when will the government be announced, and how will it be made up? Will it be technocrats, and from which parties? [Kodjo] In principle the government should be made up of representatives of political parties in the assembly, personalities from the political world, and civilian personalities, who can make a contribution to solving the problems of this country, and there is no question of forming a government of technocrats. I think [words indistinct] a certain number of choices (?about its direction) and this has to be taken into account. As such, we have to appoint a new kind of government where the main political forces of the country are represented. [Mariot] How can you sell your government program? What are its main outlines? [Kodjo] First of all we need national reconciliation, in other words, we have to ensure that conditions exist enabling everyone to express their opinions and to feel free in a free country. I think that to do this we need to give up our quarrels. We will do what we can. The different players in the political game should be associated in this game, and find themselves free in this country. We must do our utmost to get the problem of refugees solved, because it is a basic aspect of reconciliation. Starting this reconciliation, (?demanded by the people), must be carried out [words indistinct] in such a way that the army, which is our army, can find understanding and a total feeling of brotherhood among the people. After this comes the creation of a state based on law, which is something essential in democratic systems; human rights must be respected, we must have institutions to strengthen respect for human rights. Certain solutions have also been envisaged in the constitution. We must institute it rapidly. We must quickly move toward a state based on law, and the state based on law should be decentralized so that the people can take a closer part in mapping out policies concerning their future. We also need an economic recovery. This is the main problem. As you know, the economic situation in our country is bad, its economic recovery can only come as a result of efforts and also as a result of the confidence we must give the outside world so that we can use the necessary capital sums for the development of our industry, agriculture, and trade. With the devaluation of the African Financial Community franc, the problems are all the more difficult. We need to buckle down to this problem to ensure the economic recovery of this country. We can do it. Finally, we need social peace, because economic development is of itself a good thing, but we need social peace in as far as whole strata of the people, like young people, women, farmers try a new path [as heard]. Otherwise, young people [word indistinct] the future. [Mariot] What do the people of Togo expect of you today after such a long period of difficulties? [Kodjo] (?First let me say) what I expect of the Togolese people: That they should have confidence, that they should mobilize themselves for the work we are going to do in common. As for what the people expect of me, it is the small contribution I can make, because in the nature of things, I have perhaps a small degree of experience in some areas, and I could put to use this experience and the relationships I have been able to form here and there to solve the problems that the Togolese people want to solve.
