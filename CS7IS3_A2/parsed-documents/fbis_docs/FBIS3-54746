In his view, because only 50 percent of the Russian MPs were elected on party lists while the others, in electoral districts, these talks infringe on the rights of deputies who are not members of the four parties. He thinks that reduction of the government headquarters might "weaken" the government in which he is a vice premier and step up the confrontation between the executive and legislative branches. He did not rule out the possibility that he, Aleksandr Shokhin and some others would not be included in the new government.
