The explosion occurred 100 kilometers off Vladivostok at 16:00 local time. A fire broke out which caused other explosions with unexploded shells scattered within the range of over 10 kilometers. The fire reduced to rubble 200 out of 800 wagons with ammunition, a service room for the guards, soldiers' barracks and other constructions and partially damaged the railway. It was only on Sunday that the fire was extinguished. Luckily, there were no casualties among the guards and the personnel of the ammunition depot. According to preliminary estimates made by experts, civilian constructions in nearby settlements of Novonezhino and Romanovka were out of reach of fragments of shells scattered by the explosion. Later, numerous damages of buildings and economic facilities were detected. Over 2,000 people were evacuated from the villages of Novonezhino, Romanovka, Smolyaninovo. A total of 22 civilians who were injured by broken glass smashed out by the explosion applied for medical aid. Conter-intelligence officers of the Pacific Fleet established that one of the soldiers on guard, after his shift was over, found an electric igniter of a gun-powder rocket accelerator and began to disassemble it with a knife. The knife set the gun-powder accelerator on fire and the soldier threw it into the bushes, setting dry grass on fire. Rocket shells piled up nearby caught fire and several minutes later an explosion occurred. The soldier and his teammate who was nearby escaped from the scene of the explosion without notifying the command about the accident. The military prosecutor's office of the garrison has instituted criminal proceedings. An investigation into the explosion continues.
