(4) The fleet owner, or owner group, shall compare the calculated Fleet Average Emissions with the Baseline Emission Level (BEL) in Table 2966&hyph;3 applicable to the calendar year for which the calculation applies (that is, the calendar year in which the submittal is due), and shall calculate the fleet averaging program surcharge according to the following equation: Surcharge=$10,000×(FAE^BEL×(Number of Affected Vehicles) This calculation shall be performed separately for vehicles in the 19,501 to 33,000 pound GVWR range, if the fleet contains any such vehicles, and in the over 33,000 pound GVWR range, if the fleet contains any such vehicles. If the calculated surcharge is less than zero for either category of vehicles, the surcharge for that category of vehicles shall be set to zero. The sum of the surcharges for the two categories of vehicles shall be paid concurrently with the submittal of information described in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section.
