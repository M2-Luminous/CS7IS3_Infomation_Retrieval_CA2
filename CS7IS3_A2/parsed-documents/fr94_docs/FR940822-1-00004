FR940822-1-00004 FR940822-1-00002 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 86 [A&hyph;94&hyph;13; FRL&hyph;5030&hyph;1] Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles and New Motor Vehicle Engines; Nonconformance Penalties for 1996 and 1998 Model Year Emission Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles and Engines AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing that nonconformance penalties (NCPs) be made available for specific emission standards taking effect in the 1996 and 1998 model years. In general, the availability of NCPs allows a manufacturer of heavy-duty engines (HDEs) or heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) (which include heavy light-duty trucks) whose engines or vehicles fail to conform with certain applicable emission standards, but do not exceed a designated upper limit, to be issued a certificate of conformity upon payment of a monetary penalty. The specific emission standards for which NCPs have been considered in this rulemaking are the 1996 and later model year Tier 1 standards for heavy light-duty trucks, the 1996 and later model year Particulate Matter (PM) standard for urban bus applications, and the 1998 and later model year heavy-duty diesel engine oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) standard. EPA is proposing to offer NCPs for the 1996 and later model year particulate matter (PM) standard of 0.10 g/mile for Light Duty Trucks 3 (LDT3) at full useful life. EPA has considered, but is not proposing to offer NCPs for the other standards. The proposed upper limit associated with the LDT3 PM standard is the previous diesel-fueled LDT3 vehicle standard of 0.13 g/mi.
