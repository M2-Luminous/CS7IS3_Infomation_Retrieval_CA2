Aldo Ajello said it is urgently necessary to find a solution -- specifically, to close the assembly areas and demobilize the soldiers. The head of the UN Operations in Mozambique was reacting to the incident which occurred in the Mocubela assembly area in Zambezia Province, in which mutinying Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] soldiers detained, stripped, and assaulted Brigadier Raul Dique, head of that movement's delegation in the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF]. The soldiers are protesting the amount to be paid to the demobilized soldiers and demanding the full payment of demobilization subsidies when they are demobilized. The CCF will hold a meeting on 6 June to discuss the incidents in the assembly areas. The Supervision and Control Commission will meet on 8 June to assess the issue.
