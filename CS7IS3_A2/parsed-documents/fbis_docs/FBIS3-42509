The level of development of science and industry of a nation has traditionally been defined, and is defined, by achievements in aviation as well -- both civil and military. The Ukrainian aviation scientific and technical complex imeni Oleh Antonov has reason to be proud. It is enough to mention the An-124 Ruslan and An-225 Mriya aircraft, well known around the whole world. The "Antonovites" have also done a great deal for the development of military and military-transport aviation. A whole family of "An's" has served and is serving in the army: The An-2, An-8, An-12, An-26. An-30, An-72 and An-124. But new times advance new demands. The building of effective and mobile Ukrainian armed forces is simply impossible unless the army is provided with contemporary models of hardware, including aviation hardware. That is how to explain the attention that the leadership of the Ministry of Defense is devoting to the emergence and development of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex, with an important place in it occupied by the ANTK imeni Oleh Antonov. The deep traditions of aircraft construction, the widespread use of computer technology in the work and the adoption of new technologies are providing an opportunity for the Kiev specialists to develop aviation products that are the equal of the most advanced international demands. The representatives of the military department were convinced of that with their own eyes. The Minister of Defense devoted considerable attention, while being familiarized with the prospects and capabilities of the ANTK, to the new transport aircraft with the working name of the An-77. The development and construction of this model is one of the few examples of very close collaboration between Ukraine and Russia, based on an international agreement. The An-77 surpasses the capabilities of analogous aircraft, both civil and those of military-transport aviation, in both freight capacity and in speed, altitude and range. Less than half of the necessary funds, however, were directed toward the requirements of the An-77 project, as was emphasized by ANTK imeni Oleh Antonov General Designer Petro Balabuyev. Moreover, the lion's share of that money was funds that the design bureau had earned through its own efforts. That is obviously insufficient. The first model of the new transport aircraft is planned to be ready to go out to the airfield for trials by the end of the month, and another model will have to be built and tested for objective results. It is difficult to say when this will be done. The Ukrainian aircraft-building industry, after all, is experiencing far from its best times: Skilled specialists are leaving because of the poor pay, and the disrupted business ties provide no opportunity for the timely performance of the necessary work. Kiev has been visited more than once this year, however, both by representatives of the ministries of defense of Great Britain and France and by representatives of the FLA--an organization of countries in the European Community to which France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy and Spain belong. FLA specialists have been engaged for a long time in the development of a design for an analogous aircraft; they have not even begun the design engineering. The Ukrainian aircraft builders, however, have built the first aircraft, which virtually conforms to the FLA requirements. The Kiev ANTK, by the way, can offer the nation and the armed forces more than a new transport aircraft. The arsenal of the design bureau has many more innovations, from a powered hang glider to an aerospace system based on the widebody Mriya aircraft as a launch platform. This system provides the opportunity to put a satellite into space with the assistance of rockets launched from the An-225 during aircraft flight. Furthermore, the cost of such a method is only one seventh that of a conventional vertical launch. And there is no need to explain the importance of our own satellites for the development of civil and military space. Also discussed at the meeting was the fact that the ANTK imeni Oleh Antonov has an opportunity to take up the resolution of such problems as the development of trainer aircraft. General Designer Petro Balabuyev indicated that attention should be turned to the training of American military pilots. They first fly for thirty hours on trainer aircraft at the first level of difficulty, and then 75 hours on aircraft of the second level of difficulty; only after that do the pilots begin to master the combat aircraft directly. That way is both safer and more economical, which is very important under contemporary conditions when fuel is scarce. "We are ready to develop such trainer aircraft for the needs of our military aviation," said Petro Vasylovych. "The need for them will arise sooner or later, after all." So then, time will tell what problems they will be able to solve on the road to a modern, truly effective and mobile army. But we need to rely on two solid wings--industry and science--in order to attain that goal as quickly as possible, the more so with the intelligent expenditure of state funds.
