The operation was unanimously approved by all the members of the inner cabinet in a meeting on 19 May. Its purpose was to bring here the man who today heads a terrorist organization operating against us in the security zone -- the Believers Resistance -- and who held Ron Arad for at least two years and who, I hope, will definitely be able to give us information about the period during which he held him and perhaps about his condition later on. The operation was conducted on the basis of our responsibility for the MIA's and the POW's. This time, the reasons I had for submitting my recommendation to the inner cabinet were not the same as those I had at the time when I recommended to the inner cabinet to bring Shaykh 'Ubayd to Israel. At that time, I had hoped that Shaykh 'Ubayd would serve as a bargaining chip in the negotiations. I no longer have any illusions that anybody can be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations -- certainly not Mustafa al- Dirani. Our goal was to further exhaust the chances of obtaining information about what happened in the past and the current fate of Ron Arad. This operation was also part of our fight against Lebanese terrorism directed at the security zone. [passage omitted] Israel Television Channel 1's political correspondent Gadi Sukenik: Mr. Rabin, with all due respect to those who executed the operation, of course, could not such an operation have been carried out during the seven years that Ron Arad has been in captivity and to this day in order to extract information from people such as al-Dirani? To this day, is there any certainty that Ron Arad is alive? Rabin: [passage omitted] This operation could have been carried out a few months ago, but it was put off because of intelligence considerations and chances of obtaining information. It was designed to be carried out in a specific area -- in that area where the operation took place. Therefore, the timing chosen was the first possible time after another channel and hope of obtaining information through other means were blocked. Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Dov Gilhar: Mr. Rabin, what is the next stage? Assuming that Mustafa al-Dirani confirms that he handed Ron Arad over to the Iranians, is it now a question of international pressure on Tehran? What are the next moves? Rabin: At the moment, I do not want to say what we will find out in the course of his interrogation. Furthermore, I should say that the unit, which carried out the operation admirably -- I would like to congratulate the chief of staff, the General Staff, the chief of intelligence, the Air Force commander, and particularly the soldiers who carried out the mission and the pilots who flew them -- also brought with it a considerable amount of written material which will certainly throw light on some points. When I presented my recommendation to the inner cabinet two days ago and asked it to approve the operation, I said that we must exhaust any lead and any way that will offer us more information. I cannot assure you that we will get conclusive information about the whereabouts and condition of Ron Arad today. I can assure you that such operations will also be carried out in the future, if they are necessary and if possible, because we bear responsibility for all the MIA's and POW's whose fate has not yet been conclusively determined by Israel and the IDF.
