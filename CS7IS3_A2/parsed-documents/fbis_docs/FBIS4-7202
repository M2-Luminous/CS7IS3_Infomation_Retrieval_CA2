Kato, 67, a member of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), replaced Eijiro Hata of the same party. He left the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) last year to join the coalition's mainstream conservative and the LDP's breakaway party Shinseito, which was founded by Tsutomu Hata, new prime minister, and Ichiro Ozawa, the alliance's primary strategist. Kato is known to be close to Ozawa. In the LDP, Kato held such ministerial portfolios as Land Agency, Hokkaido Development Agency and agriculture. He formed his own group in 1991 after seceding from a major LDP faction led by Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, a veteran legislator who has held the posts of foreign, trade and transport ministers. Kato also headed the LDP's Policy Affairs Council and Research Council on Tax System. On political realignment, Kato shares a similar view with Ozawa, who is urging a two-party system, in which a unity party of coalition blocs rivals the LDP. Kato, hailing from Okayama Prefecture, western Japan, has been elected to the powerful House of Representatives ten times.
