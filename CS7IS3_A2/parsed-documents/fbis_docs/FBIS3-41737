He was a relatively young man who had never traveled abroad. That is all that was reported about the patient at the Oblast Center for AIDS prevention and Control. The rest is a doctor-patient privilege. The virus of the ``plague of the 20th century'' was detected when the patient visited the rayon polyclinic for a quite different and insignificant illness. At present, physicians are investigating this first patient's contacts. Incidentally, a correction must be made: first officially detected HIV carrier. In the opinion of specialists, there are up to 10 undetected cases for each one that is found.
