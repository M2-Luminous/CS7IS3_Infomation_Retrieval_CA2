There were stronger armed provocations during the night of Wednesday-Thursday by Moslem and Croat forces against the Serb defence lines on other war zones in the Sava River region. Provocations ceased after the Bosnian Serb army responded. The Bosnian Serb military sources also reported that, besides infantry weapons, the Bosnian Moslem forces used mortars and anti-aircraft guns in their attacks on the Serb positions in the Teslic, Doboj and Mt Ozren war zones. Moslem forces' attempt to infiltrate commando-reconnaissance teams behind the Serb positions in the Mt Ozren area was foiled by the Bosnian Serbs.
