The failure dashed hopes of a long-expected deal at the Joint Liaison Group session expected to be held early next month. Emerging from yesterday's talks, Chinese team leader Chen Zuoer lamented that China's reasonable appeals for information had been unsuccessful. He criticised the British side for holding back information China had been seeking for the past seven years, but did not specify what was wanted. And he rejected "rumours" that China had made new demands on the handover of military sites. China has reportedly asked for a slightly bigger naval basin and decided to hold back one of the 25 military sites it had promised to hand to the Hong Kong Government for development. "This does not comply with the facts. The fact is that the talks on the handover of the military sites are still going on between the two governments, and this will continue," he said. His British counterpart, Alan Paul, attributed the failure to the complicated nature of the issue. "If it were not, we would not have been talking about it for seven years," he said. "We have done our best over this time to reach an agreement. We have not been successful. We are obviously disappointed but not despondent because both sides will continue to strive for agreement." It is understood the British side deemed the new Chinese demands to be unacceptable, both to them and to the Legislative Council which will have to approve funds to reprovisioning of military facilities for China. Foreign Office spokesman Bill Dickson said he was not aware of Mr Chen's claims of secrecy: "The British side has gone to enormous lengths to provide the Chinese delegation with information." He said he did not expect yesterday's outcome to have any impact on the Joint Liaison Group plenum. In Beijing, a senior mainland official warned Britain not to repeat the mistakes of the political negotiations when it seeks co- operation on other issues. "China still wants to have co-operation on other issues... (We) hope that the British side can show sincerity and not repeat what it has done over the political question," said the deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Chen Ziying. "The difference between clever and stupid people is that the former will not repeat the same mistake. (We) hope that we are all clever people," he told a business delegation from Hong Kong. Earlier, in the territory, a deputy director of XINHUA (the New China News Agency), Zhang Junsheng, accused Britain of leaking to the press its determination to push ahead with the airport financing arrangement outlined in the fourth package of proposals. Mr Zhang said Britain should make its stance clear at the Airport Committee meeting set for this week. "Any problems between China and Britain should be sorted out through the Airport Committee discussions. The fact that Britain announced the re-opening of the talks while at the same time unilaterally publicising its stance on the fourth proposal will have a detrimental effect," he said.
