Ammonia and other nitrogen compounds are used for the production of fertilizers which have an annual estimated production growth rate of 5 percent. About 70 percent of the world's ammonia production is derived from natural gas; the most energy-efficient method of producing technological feed gas for ammonia is catalytic conversion of natural gas with steam in two stages. In the first stage pre-treated natural gas is passed over a nickel catalyst in a tubular reactor heated with natural gas under conditions selected so that the residual methane content in the dry converted gas is 9-11 percent by volume. In the second stage the methane is converted with steam and air oxygen in a columnar reactor where the entire oxygen content reacts with hydrogen, methane, and oxides of carbon. Heating the mix to 1250-1280� C shifts the equilibrium to catalytic reaction of methane with the steam. The quantity of air supplied to the reactor is controlled so that the CO and H[.sub]2[/] to nitrogen ratio is 3.05-3.10 and residual methane is 0.3-0.5 percent by volume. The next step in the production of technological feed gas is catalytic conversion of carbon monoxide to increase the hydrogen content, remove carbon dioxide, and methanize any residual oxides of carbon to give a nitrogen-hydrogen mixture for the ammonia synthesis stage. Owing to the sharp rise in energy costs, the problem of energy savings became acute for multi-ton ammonia production, especially in production of the technological feed gas. In the present work some results are presented on a theoretical analysis of various variants in organizing a technological scheme and simulating processes in basic reactors making it possible to uncover tendencies in the modernization of multi-ton aggregates for the purpose of lowering energy costs. One such variant could be lowering the temperature in the secondary reforming stage under conditions of selective methane combustion to 1200� C. Figures 3; references 16: 13 Russian, 3 Western.
