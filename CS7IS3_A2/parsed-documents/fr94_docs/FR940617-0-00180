FR940617-0-00180 FR940617-0-00026 where GP = analyzer operating pressure (Pa) (iii) Calculate the expected dilute NO span gas and water vapor mixture concentration (designated as D1 ) by the following equation: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.003 (iv) For diesel (compression-ignition) exhaust, the maximum raw or dilute exhaust water vapor concentration expected during testing (designated as Wm ) can be estimated from the CO 2 span gas (designated as A ) criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the assumption of a fuel atom H/C ratio of 1.8:1 as: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.004 Where: A = undiluted CO 2 concentration. Percent water quench shall not exceed 3 percent and shall be calculated by: E:GRAPHICSER17JN94.005 ยง89.319&hyph;96 Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration.
