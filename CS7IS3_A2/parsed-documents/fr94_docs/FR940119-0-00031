FR940119-0-00031 FR940119-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Office of the Inspector General 32 CFR Part 312 [Office of the Inspector General Policy and Procedures Manual, Chapter 33] Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Privacy Program AGENCY: Inspector General, DOD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This is an administrative change. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the Justice Department could not require FOIA/PA requesters to provide notarized signatures to prove their identities, finding the policy clashed with other Federal law. Based on that ruling, the DoD Privacy Office has determined that DOD Component rules having a similar requirement for notarized signatures must be amended to eliminate the requirement. Therefore, the Office of the Inspector General, DOD, is amending its rules to eliminate the requirement for notarized signatures. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 19, 1994.

Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980.
