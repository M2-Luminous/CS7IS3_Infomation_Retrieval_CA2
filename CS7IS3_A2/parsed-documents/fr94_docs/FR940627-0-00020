I. Introduction In the Matter of: Before Commissioners: Elizabeth Anne Moler, Chair; Vicky A. Bailey, William L. Massey, and Donald F. Santa, Jr. In a companion order in Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is issuing a final rule revising its standards of conduct and reporting requirements for transportation and affiliate transactions. The final rule continues some of the existing reporting requirements under Order No. 497. 1 To prevent a regulatory gap between the termination of the existing reporting requirements and the effective date of new reporting requirements, the Commission is extending the sunset date for the existing reporting requirements from June 30, 1994 until July 31, 1994. 1 Inquiry Into Alleged Anticompetitive Practices Related to Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines, Order No. 497, 53 FR 22139 (June 14, 1988), FERC Stats. & Regs.

II. Reporting Requirements This order does not change the reporting burden under the current Order No. 497 regulations. The order merely extends these requirements until the effective date of the Commission's new regulations to prevent a regulatory gap. III. Discussion In Order No. 497&hyph;E, the Commission extended the sunset date for the reporting requirements under §250.16 of the Commission regulations until June 30, 1994. On December 23, 1993, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000 which proposed to revise these reporting requirements significantly. 2 2 Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions, 59 FR 268 (Jan. 4, 1994), IV FERC Stats. & Regs. [Proposed Regulations] ¶32,504 (Dec. 23, 1993). Contemporaneously with this order, the Commission is issuing a final rule in Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000 which significantly revises the marketing affiliate reporting requirements. The final rule continues some of the reporting requirements from the previous regulations, in particular the requirement that pipelines maintain transportation discount information for both affiliates and non-affiliates.
