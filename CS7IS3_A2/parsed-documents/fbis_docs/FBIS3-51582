Velasquez and President-elect Rafael Caldera, have said there are no plans to control the exchange rate of the Venezuelan currency. The two appealed for calm and for preventing a flight of foreign exchange because this would not help the situation, on the contrary, it would worsen it. They insisted that common sense will determine the dollar exchange rate. The two agreed that the measures announced last night by President Velasquez will be maintained and there will be continuity. President-elect Rafael Caldera has reiterated his support for the announcements made by President Velasquez. [Begin recording] [Velasquez] Banking policies will be conserved, first because they are the product of lengthy analyses in which bank authorities and bankers have participated; they are the product of experience; and they are the result of the banking sector's decision to respond positively to the Venezuelan situation. [Calderas] The measures that have been announced have my support and that of all Venezuelans because the financial situation is important for all of us. In that declaration there are very important points. It not only lists the current government's commitments that will be inherited by the government over which I will preside, but also lists the banking sector's commitment making it obligatory for the presidents of the country's largest banks to maintain a healthy financial system and a system deserving of the Venezuelan people's trust. [end recording] The president-elect reported his government's firm decision to back judicial rulings because although he has nothing against anybody, he believes the country wants the implementation of severe measures to prevent a repeat of past events. The Banco Latino intervention board was sworn in this afternoon at the Presidential Palace. Finance Minister Carlos Silva introduced to the media the three members of the board noting that the three have much banking experience. [Begin recording] [Silva] We trust they will objectively evaluate that bank and adopt the necessary measures. [Board President Jose Santo Domingo] Regarding our future plans [words indistinct]. [Unidentified reporter] The scheduled 28 January reopening of the bank could be modified now that you have been sworn in as bank interveners? [Santo Domingo] I think that date will stay. Yes. The Deposit Guarantee Fund will supply funds necessary to pay accounts having a balance under 100,000 bolivares. [end recording]
