The Western press, which a couple of weeks ago, reported on the false British allegations of Iran-IRA contacts in their headlines, have now apparently decided to ignore the bugging of Iranian Embassy completely. This is not the first time that the so-called free press agencies of Western countries have collectively decided to keep quiet on issues embarrassing to so-called Western democracies. The low-key reporting of atrocities committed in Bosnia when compared proportionally, the genocide of over 2,800 Panamanians resulting from U.S. invasion, the war crimes committed by British forces against Argentine POWs in the Falkland Islands, and the mysterious killing of Rwandan and Burundi presidents are just small reminders to those with common sense.
