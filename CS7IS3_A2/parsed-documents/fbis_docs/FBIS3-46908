They are the tendency toward "small government" and the tendency toward a "cultural age." However, neither has a strong political support base. What is called for is political participation by the citizens and residents. Ad Hoc Council on Administrative Reform and the "Cultural Age" Within the coalition administration, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is divided by internal confrontation and on the brink of oblivion. Komeito is also headed toward merging with the conservative new parties. Japan's political party structure already appears to be shifting toward a conservative two-party or three-party system. The outlook is the result of the advent of two new conservative forces--Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the Japan New Party/Sakigake [Harbinger] Party--in addition to the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] which is the old conservative force. Forming the backdrop are the two political tendencies since the late 1970's. One is the trend that progressed from administrative reform to political reform. The other is what may be called the tendency toward a "cultural age." In this article, we intend to examine the two eral tendencies that gave rise to the Hosokawa administration, and to use our findings as material to consider the future outlook. First, let us look at the transition from administrative reform to political reform. The administrative reform based on the Second Ad Hoc Council on Administrative Reform [hereafter referred to as the "Ad Hoc Council"] has various aspects, and the most characteristic is the fact that it was a challenge against the money politics of the LDP (more than it was an attack against leftwing forces). In other words, it was an attempt to dismantle the "iron triangle" which is formed by the government agencies, the industrial sector, and the "zoku" [special interest group] Diet members. The Kankoro [National Council of Government and Public Workers' Unions], including the Kokuro [National Railway Workers' Union], which is seen as having united with these forces to protect its own vested interests, was also a target of attack. Viewed from this aspect, administrative reform was actually also an attempt toward restoration of power by the bureaucrats. The reason is that the "iron triangle" found itself in a situation where the government organization was eroded by the "zoku" Dietmen and the administrative rationality of the bureaucrats was distorted. For the individual bureaucrat, due to such inducements as ensuring one's employment after government retirement, the benefits brought by the "iron triangle" were a matter of major concern. On the other hand, the loss of independence was the price paid by the government organization. At this point, regulation by the state, for example, was more a means to protect the vested interests of the industrial circles than an expression of the maintenance and expansion of authority by the government agencies. The realization of administrative reform through the initiatives of the elite bureaucrats cannot be understood without such a backdrop. The fact that pension reform and health insurance reform were realized through the initiatives of the top elite of the Welfare Ministry is well known. However, it was also a process in which the Welfare Ministry escaped from the influence of the Kankoro which tried to protect its vested interests, and from the control of such industry organizations as the Japan Medical Association. Also, the privatization of the Japan National Railways and the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation [NTT] was realized because the elite bureaucrats of the Transportation Ministry and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications who had resisted at the outset changed their direction. It was because the bureaucrats of the two ministries became aware of the administrative rationality of their respective ministries. In addition, the "zoku" Diet members, who acquired administrative rationality through the experience of rule under long-term administrations, suppressed the demands for protection of vested interests by the rank-and-file "zoku" members and marched toward reform, thus enabling a series of administrative reforms. Also, the Finance Ministry bureaucrats, who stand at the top of the government pyramid, became the major promoters of administrative reform on the government's side. Moreover, it is equally significant that the major force for administrative reform consisted of the top elite of the financial circles, and that they displayed great power in throttling the demands of the industrial circles under their jurisdiction. Political Reform Was Necessary Various factors nudged Japan's elite toward reform. The introduction of software and the internationalization of the Japanese economy provided the backdrop, the maturation of Japanese society was a factor for pension reform and health and insurance reform (including aging), and the internationalization of Japan's politics was a factor for the debate on international contribution in the era of administrative reform. However, particularly significant were the demands that resulted from Japan's internationalization. Concretely, it was the pressures brought to bear by the United States, demanding market opening and contributions by Japan. Faced with these pressures, Japan's elite arrived at the judgment that they must comply with international demands even at the sacrifice of domestic demands. It was in this context that, with the progress of administrative reform, they deepened their awareness that political reform was indispensable for administrative reform. Numerous problems remain which could not be solved by the administrative reforms in the first half of the 1980's. The agricultural problems centering on rice are typical. Other reforms are the easing of regulations and the reform of special corporations. Consequently, the United States has made severe demands against Japan in the forum of the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative [SII] talks. In order to meet these tasks, reform of the ruling and opposition parties that have been resisting--i.e. "political reform"--became necessary. However, the "political reform" was, more than administrative reform, a challenge against the power base of the elite in the form of stablized control by the conservative party. The greater the progress toward political reform, the greater was the resulting destruction of their own power base. However, an awareness arose among the elite that they could not commit themselves to the nation's tasks without restructuring their power base itself. The election system reform proposed several years ago was a means to meet the tasks by restructuring the power base of the political parties. In the first place, administrative reform was pushed through with powerful support by public opinion mobilized by the mass media. Its substantial support layer was the urban salaried-worker class that was unrelated to the vested interests called the "iron triangle." From the standpoint of the LDP's support base, it means a shift from the farm regions to the cities, and from the old middle class to the new middle class. However, it is extremely difficult to make the new support layer a stable political base with the current election system as the premise. The glorious advent and disappointing exit of the Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club was the outcome of such a risk. In order to overcome this instability, the reform of the election system is a most effective means. The proposed small-constituency system and the proportional-representation system are both expected to provide stable support bases for the new conservative parties by centering elections on the political parties. Moreover, the systems will strengthen central party authority within the political parties. The plan avoids the fate of the Shinjiyu Club, and is simultaneously a double-edged strategy for the elite to cut off pressure from the industrial circles and the (rank-and-file) "zoku" Dietmen who received support from those circles. Ichiro Ozawa, who was the core promoter of election system reform and the most enthusiastic supporter of PKO [UN peacekeeping operations], epitomizes the above-mentioned tendency for a shift from the direction of the Ad Hoc Council to political reform. Tendency of a "Sense of Play" However, there is a second tendency among the new conservatives which has a number of traits in common with the above-mentioned tendency, but at the same time it is intrinsically different. It is personified by Prime Minister Hosokawa. Its traits are typified, above all else, by his political style. A sense of play, leeway, an "age of sensibility" and the natural man--expressions used by the prime minister himself--describe the tendency. Hosokawa's criticism of "efficiency for efficiency's sake" and his expression of "a sense of play" translate into a policy of "not scrimping on design fees" for public construction, for example, in actual policies. However, such a posture is clearly foreign to the direction of the Ad Hoc Council. The Ad Hoc Council may be said to have concretely represented the interests of the "consumers/taxpayers" with the urban salaried worker in mind. However, the "consumers" represented by Hosokawa are a class that seeks quality goods that satisfy good taste despite somewhat higher costs, and not goods that are "cheap but shoddy." They are people who, despite their awareness of cost, seek services commensurate with the prices paid. Regarding easing of regulations also, rather than chiefly blaming regulations for economic inefficiency, their criticism is directed mainly toward the bureaucracy for its adherence to efficiency and its "inelegant" uniformism that strives to maintain minimum standards nationwide. Also, Hosokawa's sense of play which contrasts with the late Toshio Doko's stoic lifestyle and Ozawa's straightforwardness, is a contrast between the latter's sense of crisis and sense of mission as the policymaking elite, and the awareness of an amateur politician who considers politics as one among a number of pursuits. It is the difference of the political and economic elite and the upper class (or the cultural elite). In a word, Hosokawa may be said to express the political sense of the mainstay upper-class salaried workers of the cities who do not feel any particularly serious and urgent mission in politics. The statement by Hosokawa while he was governor that "the only legacy that can be left by administration is culture" directly expresses his philosophy. For the supporters of the Japan New Party and the new Sakigake, and for the relatively affluent middle class of the cities, politics is truly one of a number of activity domains. It is a domain from which "withdrawal" is possible at any time. The "fickleness" of this class as voting constituents reflects it. It is the opposite of (a part of) the farmers and smaller enterprises that are obliged to depend on politics within economic activity and who regard political support as indispensable. It is natural that this class welcomes with a sense of affinity the Hosokawa style of being able and ready to quit at any time. Politics must be, above all else, an interesting drama for them. The drama of a "change in government" was climactic. Hosokawa's record as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture was characterized by the construction of buildings and the sponsorship of events as cultural legacies, and by his appeal for a "distinctive prefecture." The quickest way to accomplish this was to invite national-level designers and cultural personalities to work in Kumamoto. It could be described as bringing an urban and Tokyo-type sensibility (or, further, a West European culture) directly into the farming and "local areas." Typical construction included the ultramodern police stations, prefecural housing complexes, bridges and toilets. A cultural orientation quite different from the development-oriented past is clearly seen here. Ohira-Sonoda Urban Concept To reflect on the past, the emphasis on "culture" in administration goes back to the Sonoda urban concept of the Ohira cabinet (incidentally, the Japan New Party also advocates the Sonoda cultural sphere concept). The nine "policy study groups" organized by Ohira called for the realization of "more lofty aspirations" or "spiritual and cultural affluence" as Japan's task in the 21st century. The central slogan was "a cultural age" as a substitute for the economic age. It also sought an expanded cultural budget and fiscal spending to build a transportation/information network (for the formation of a pastoral city state). It was premised on pride that Japan had caught up with and passed Europe and the United States, and optimism concerning the future. The assumption was that leisure time will increase in the future, and cultural activity with the elements of "leisure" and "play" will rise as consumer activity. Of course, forming the backdrop is self-confidence that Japan has overcome a double oil-shock to achieve a favorable economic performance surpassing the other advanced nations. It is a policy direction that is clearly based on a different awareness from the direction of administrative reform that appeared immediately later. Because the continuity between the scholars who participated in the Ad Hoc Council and the brains of the Ohira cabinet is often debated, the difference between the two tendencies is apt to be overlooked. However, the difference between the two groups is decisive. In administrative reform, aside from the formulation of the ideological portion, it was the economists and financiers like Hiroshi Kato and Yoichi Sando who displayed their power through concrete policy designs, resulting in the ideology of economic liberalism. However, Ohira's brain trust, centering on such cultural stalwarts as Masakazu Yamazaki, were a group with a different and unique principle from the principle of competition. Those overlapping with them were only a handful of scholars concerned with international politics (if Kenichi Koyama, who was later active in the National Council on Educational Reform, is excluded). The intellectuals advocating a "cultural age," who formed the core of the Ohira group, contended that the principle of competition on the cultural dimension contained an inherent tendency for bad money to chase out good money as seen in the television culture described as "turning 100 million people into idiots," and that it was impossible to fully agree with the logic of free competition "to create high-level concepts." Based on this, they contended that "some sort of public environment and means are necessary" for "basic academic research and the creation of a new cultural tradition." Ohira himself had sought aggressive activity by the state worthy of an "age of culture," and had intended to solve the fiscal deficit, not by conversion to a small state, but by increasing taxes. From this standpoint, the transition from Ohira to Suzuki and Nakasone was an important turning point in policy. Furthermaore, the pastoral city state concept was clearly an urban planning and national planning concept, and was different from the direction of the ad hoc commission whose staple was the principle of free competition. This is most clearly evident in the difference between the commission mainstream, which stressed deregulation of land use, and the pastoral city state concept, which proposed aggressive land expropriation from the standpoint of public ownership of land. Burden of "Culture" Assumed by Local Regions Faced by a budget deficit, Japan at the time may be said to have had two options. And, faced with these options, there was a difference in judgment as to how to inherently view the budget deficit. Beginning with Michio Watanabe who assumed the post of finance minister in the Suzuki cabinet, the rhetoric of those who stressed a budget crisis explained the budget crisie in the same light as the household budget. It is easy for any budget specialist to understand that such a naive metaphor is a fallacy. A budget deficit is essentially different from an individual's loan. The argument can be made that it is not a problem which requires an immediate solution because there is no loan from a foreign country involved, and there was actually such an argument. In Ohira's case, it was necessary to implicitly recognize the validity of such a rebuttal and, on that basis, the budget "crisis" had to be solved in order to invoke future budgetary power. Rather, it was considered to be necessary as preparation for the display of state power. (As far as this writer knows, he never stated that a budget deficit in itself creates a situation of crisis.) In any case, Ohira's theory implied an awareness that Japan had become an affluent nation (after overcoming the two oil shocks), and it is seen as totally different from the awareness of the Ad Hoc Council which stressed the imminent budget crisis and the future arrival of the "advanced nation's disease." It also judged that the urban salaried workers could afford to accept a certain degree of increased burden. Generally speaking, the argument for "small government" as a backlash against the Keynesian welfare state is said to have appeared with the post-oil-shock economic crisis in the advanced nations as the backdrop, and the radical reforms by the Thatcher and Reagan administrations are considered to be typical. However, Japan's economy had already completely overcome the economic crisis resulting from the oil shocks when the Ohira cabinet made its advent. In Japan, after overcoming the economic crisis and due to its impetus, such liberal reforms as the reexamination of welfare based on the "small government" theory and privatization appeared on the scene. In that sense, it must be said that the necessity for reform was lower than in Europe and the United States. In other words, it may be said that in the early 1980's there was another option besides administrative reform (this point is essentially different from the Mitterrand administration of France which introduced social democratic policies and was simultaneously brought down). However, historical reality shows that the Ohira direction was rejected with a tax increase as the reason, and the direction of using the affluence achieved by Japan for spiritual and cultural policies (or more generally, the buildup of social capital) was denied, resulting in the pursuit of further efficiency and economic growth. In other words, a policy of accumulating further wealth to prevent future crises was adopted. It will probably be criticized as an excessive preventive step. The bubble economy may be said to be the consequence (from this standpoint, it is probably ironic that the Hosokawa administration faces a major task of overcoming a long-term recession, and is demanded to overcome it through budgetary mobility). However, it is also important from the standpoint of later evolvement that the "age of culture" concept of the Ohira era had formed a twin pillar with the "age of the local regions" in support of the pastoral city state. In the first place, there is very little work concerning policy by local governments that requires urgent solutions (like the central government), except routinely processed administration. Moreover, once a headman is elected, he may exercise the prerogative of his incumbency to secure his position for eight to 12 years, or even beyond 20 years. Each headman has a political base which plays a central role in "cultural" policy according to his own preference. That is why the local governments have taken on the challenge of an age of culture. And that is exactly what Hosokawa had done as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture. In the last half of the 1980's when budget reform made reasonable progress, and particularly about the time the Takeshita regime came into being, the regional age (of culture) expanded nationally. The "creation of the homeland," which was the centerpiece of the Takeshita cabinet, is a concrete example. Governor Hosokawa was one of its pioneers. Toward Political Participation by the Citizens The birth of the Hosokawa administration signifies the convergence of the aforementioned two new conservative tendencies. Despite their differences, there was no lack of opportunities for convergence by the two tendencies (transcending a simple and impulsive union). The primary factor was the denial of the LDP's money politics. It was a union between a denial by the elite based on the practical necessity for criticism of the status quo-minded policymaking system, and the perceptional rejection among the urban mainstay and upper-layer salaried workers on the level of its image as a "dirty" system. Easing regulations is at once a strategy for "restructuring Japan" among the elite and a policy to promote the interests of the consumers, as we have pointed out. The deregulating policy agreed upon by the two new conservative forces and proposed as a policy program may be interpreted as a merger between criticism from the top and criticism from the bottom against the "iron triangle." Furthermore, the tendency of an "age of culture" has provided an opportunity to join also to the SDPJ which has had a support base in a portion of the urban salaried-worker class. Its participation in the ruling coalition can be understood in terms of such a backdrop. Nonetheless, there continues to be a lack of a strong political support base in the two new conservative trends. For example, the easing of controls that began during the Carter era in the United States was prompted by a rise of the consumer movement. Reagan's advocation of "small government" also originated from a movement called the taxpayers' revolt. In contrast, neither movement exists in Japan. The direction of the Ad Hoc Council in easing regulations and advocating "small government" was merely evoked and mobilized by "pubiic opinion" with support by the mass media as the backdrop. Consequently, after the initial stage of reform, an ironic phenomenon arose in the form of the Japan-U.S. SII talks in that the United States spoke for the interests of the consumers in Japan. Meanwhile, in the tendency toward an "age of culture" also, elitism takes the lead. It can also be seen in the criticism of Governor Hosokawa's track record. It is said that, by inviting designers and cultural personalities from Tokyo and introducing top-level cultural assets to Kumamoto, he has perhaps merely strengthened his yearning for Tokyo's culture. It is described as "providing a dream." The harder a local headman pursues top-level culture, the more difficult it is for it to take root, and the limitation of cultural elitism becomes exposed. The participation of the general citizenry becomes unavoidably difficult. It is true that, as governor, Hosokawa energized the will for participation by local government employees. He introduced the method of participation used by employees of Japan's companies (through QC [quality control] circles, for example) to the local bodies--i.e. the same method used by (the then) Chairman Hisashi Shindo of the Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Public Corp. It served to energize the local bodies, but it is highly questionable whether it promoted participation at the citizens' level. The situation is pretty much the same in the cities, towns, and villages throughout Japan that have been urged toward city-building and town-building. It is clear from the foregoing discussion that the two new conservative forces have failed to create a culture that promotes active public participation such as participation in Japan's politics. Therein remains a potential which is yet to be cultivated in Japan's politics. Amid the internal contest among the coalition forces, including the Social Democratic Party of Japan, the political party that arouses the will for participation and succeeds in organizing it will be able to survive. And that party will definitely become the matrix of true political reform. Hideo Otake: Professor at Kyoto University law school. Born in 1943.
