The weather was chilly and the land was frozen during the bitterly cold January, but the house of (Ma Qinglin), a worker of the No. 5 cotton mill in Jinan city, was filled with the atmosphere of spring. On the morning of 19 January, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, and leading comrades of the province and Jinan city sent the warmth of the party and the government to his house. As soon as he entered the house, Secretary Jiang held the hands of (Ma Qinglin) and asked after his health with deep concern. He said cordially: We came to visit you today in order to send regards to all workers of your plant. On saying this, he placed a red envelope containing 400 yuan of relief money in his hand. Not having received wages for over two months, (Ma Qinglin) was so excited that he could not say anything. His wife, with tears in her eyes, said emotionally: I never dreamt that leaders would come to our house. The party and the government have always kept us in mind. I thank the party and the government for this and thank them for sending us relief funds. She bowed as she gave thanks. On the afternoon of 19 January, accompanied by the party committee of (Huaiyun) District in Jinan city, Jiang Chunyun also held a forum of leaders and representatives of workers of financially strapped enterprises and sent relief funds to them. Jiang Chunyun said: Recently, in order to solve difficulties in the lives of workers of enterprises in the red, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have collected a relief fund of 80 million yuan to help some workers of financially strapped enterprises and retired personnel so that they may have a happy Spring Festival. To realistically solve difficulties in the lives of enterprise workers, the most fundamental thing we should do is to enhance the vitality of enterprises through deepening enterprise reform. Jiang Chunyun called on party and government leaders at all levels to always be concerned with the well-being of the masses, care for their food and clothing, listen to their voices, understand their difficulties, and adopt practical measures to help them solve difficulties. Party and government organs at all levels and all trades and professions should continue to promote the spirit of conducting all tasks by means of thrift and long years of hard work, resolutely check the unhealthy trend of using public funds to invite guests, send gifts, and arbitrarily issue bonuses and articles, share the happiness and hardships of the masses of people, and realistically spend the Spring Festival in an honest, clean, civilized, peaceful and harmonious manner.
