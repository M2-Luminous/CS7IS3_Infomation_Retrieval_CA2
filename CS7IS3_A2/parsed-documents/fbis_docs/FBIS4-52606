Aguirre made this statement as he defended the National Police's continued detention of CPP-NPA [Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army] Secretary General Wilma Tiamzon and four others. He cited cases of kidnapping with serious illegal detention, robbery and other rebellion-related offenses as their bases for holding the five under custody. Aguirre also stressed that the arrest did not adversely affect the peace process, since the Philippine Government has not entered into any agreement to suspend any arrest, hear cases or surveillance activities with the National Democratic Front. In a related development, doctors of Tiamzon are urging President Ramos to order her release from detention on medical and humanitarian grounds. The doctors examined Tiamzon, Tuesday morning, and recommended her immediate hospitalization. They said Tiamzon is suffering from severe uncontrolled hypertension, chronic infection of the kidney, kidney hemorrhage and bronchial asthma. They urged the president to have her transferred to the Philippine Heart Center where she can get immediate and constant medical attention.
