Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, Chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, Answers KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondents' Questions"] [Text] [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Mikhail Petrovich, we will soon be celebrating the second anniversary of the creation of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. What, in your view, is remarkable about these two years? [Kolesnikov] The most remarkable point has been that we have indeed set up Russian Armed Forces. And those are not just words. Despite the fact that the bulk of former USSR Armed Forces groupings were part of the Russian Army, they did not represent an integrated military organization. That was the first problem which we had to deal with. The results of our work were assessed by the Russian Federation president in his address to the Federal Assembly. He noted that the Armed Forces are combat-ready and capable of carrying out the tasks facing them. This assessment from the supreme commander in chief places a great responsibility on us and, at the same time, attests to the correctness of the approaches chosen by the Defense Ministry toward the safeguarding of security. As for specific measures, I believe that KRASNAYA ZVEZDA readers know about them. These include the cutbacks in Armed Forces manpower, the troop withdrawal from other states, and structural changes in administrative organs. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Just how substantive have been the changes to the initial reform concept? After all, two years ago we were all hoping that the country's economic position now would not be so difficult. But the situation regarding Army funding has not improved and there are still big problems, so it seems to some of our readers that under these conditions any break with the existing specific structure of the Armed Forces will inevitably lead to breakdowns in command and control.... [Kolesnikov] I would like to note that the main measures regarding the organizational development of the Russian Armed Forces were drawn up and reflected in the concept and plan for the organizational development of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. And although, owing to funding difficulties, we are indeed changing the timetable for the introduction of certain military infrastructure projects and the pace of the technical equipping of the troops has been slowed, the questions of their military and technical provision are being very actively resolved and, on the whole, the main thrust of the creation and reform of the Army and Navy is being maintained. This includes improving the structure and composition of the Armed Forces, reforming the Defense Ministry's military-technical policy and the principle for manpower acquisition, enhancing combat and mobilization readiness.... As regards the second half of your question, I would like to reassure readers -- we are being very cautious about changing the structure and combat makeup of the Armed Forces. And decisions are made only after painstaking theoretical analysis and practical checks, and, of course, not to the detriment of the troops' combat readiness. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] It is well known that the first strategic echelon of the former USSR's defense ceased to exist with the troop withdrawal from East Europe. The second echelon troops remain behind in our nearest neighbors, and our former internal districts -- like Moscow and the North Caucasus -- have become border districts. What are the prospects for their development? [Kolesnikov] The demise of the USSR resulted in a fundamental break in the disposition of forces. We lost territories and, correspondingly, a strategic echelon, and reserve troops formed the basis of the first operational echelon. It was necessary to create force groupings in all the western and southwestern sectors virtually from scratch. The problem was that large strategic formations and combined units were being organized from scratch, and this required the preparation of the relevant infrastructure. This has happened during a period of Armed Forces organizational development and reform, with an acute shortage of material resources and funding. As a result, the tasks and role of the Leningrad, Moscow, and North Caucasus Military Districts have changed substantially.... The Russian Federation border in the west now runs through the western borders of Leningrad, Pskov, Smolensk, Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, and Rostov Oblasts and, in the southwest, through Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays, Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan -- as a result of which the Moscow and North Caucasus Military Districts have acquired the status of border districts. Their staffing has been increased somewhat. But I consider it necessary to draw attention to the fact that the increase is taking place in connection with the Russian troop withdrawal from other states. We are proceeding primarily on the basis of the convenience of stationing and providing for those troops on national territory. Several additional combined and other units have been set up in the southwest -- in the North Caucasus Military District -- primarily with light weapons. As far as prospects are concerned, these are to conclude the reception of the troops withdrawn from the FRG and the Baltic in these districts, to billet them, make provision for them, and organize planned combat training in them. On the whole, border military districts as newly constituted will have to resolve the tasks of safeguarding Russia's military security in accordance with the changed conditions of the current situation. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] The transition which began last year to the mixed method of Army and Navy staffing has shown that contract service is not all plain sailing. In particular, it has not proved possible to substantially use contract servicemen to fill positions which primarily determine the combat capability of units and ships, or positions in troops carrying out peacekeeping missions. This year another 150,000 contract servicemen should join the forces. Will they again find themselves at bases, dumps, and other "hot" spots? What needs to be done to prevent this happening? [Kolesnikov] The Russian Federation president in his edict No. 166 of 18 January 1994 instructed the Defense Ministry to recruit 150,000 volunteers to fill primarily combat positions. In execution of these instructions the defense minister, defining the tasks for 1994, called for candidates to be taken on for military service under contract as soldiers and sailors with the kind of skills in particularly short supply which determine the combat capability of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. He ratified a list of these positions, and for each of them the qualification requirements which the candidates taken on under contract would have to meet were drawn up. Moreover, in order to create a material incentive, pay scales for the main posts -- including gunnery commanders, pontoon bridge commanders, self-propelled artillery commanders, mine specialists, reconnaissance troops, divers, crane operators, and so forth -- have been increased. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Let's talk about alternative service.... [Kolesnikov] There is currently no law on alternative (nonmilitary) service in the Russian Federation, although this kind of service is laid down by the Russian Federation Constitution. Obviously, in drafting such a law -- whose speedy adoption is increasingly being advocated by the public and by spiritual or religious organizations -- the provisions of the relevant international acts, and world practice in the organization and implementation of alternative service will be taken into account. At the same time, it must also take account of national interests and, above all, of the need to reliably safeguard the state's defense capability. We have made progress in this area. I think that it will be necessary to refrain at least until 1997 from adopting or even introducing a Russian Federation law on alternative service. There is a whole host of reasons for this, chief among which is the exceptionally difficult situation with regard to the manpower acquisition of soldiers, sailors, warrant officers, and petty officers in the Russian Federation Armed Forces and other troops owing to the severe shortage of draft resources and the still very undeveloped system of contract service, whose formation should have been completed only by 1997-1999. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] It is understandable that the problem of military-technical policy should have a special place in the organizational development of the Russian Armed Forces. Under today's conditions of tight financial appropriations for defense, what priorities can be highlighted in the development and purchase of arms and military hardware? [Kolesnikov] On the basis of the main provisions of military doctrine, military-technical policy is aimed at concentrating limited financial resources in order to develop weapons with flexible [mezhvidovoy] applications ensuring the resolution of tasks primarily in local wars and conflicts. The main priorities in developing and purchasing armaments and military hardware are integrated reconnaissance, communications, and battle management systems and weapons. When buying armaments at the minimum level necessary to preserve a core military-industrial potential, stress is laid on developing the scientific and technical contribution and to working on key elements which will make it possible, when the economic situation improves, to move to full-scale work and to provide timely supplies of the requisite numbers of modern weapons for the Army and Navy. Currently, as a result of meager Defense Ministry funding, the number of weapons types that are under development or have been modernized has been severely cut back, along with the total volume of purchases. Any further funding cuts could lead to the collapse of the defense industry, the loss of core scientific and defense potential, and an inability to independently develop [sozdavat] and produce basic competitive high-tech prototypes of weapons and military hardware. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] At the start of the reforms there were a lot of complaints about the inadequacy of the relevant legislative base. How do you now assess the legal backup for Armed Forces organizational development and the provision of social guarantees for servicemen? What new progress has been made in this direction? [Kolesnikov] The legal foundations for the organizational development and activity of the Russian Federation Armed Forces have basically already been created. Eleven laws and more than 100 other normative legal acts have been adopted and are in force in the defense sphere. The main provisions of Russian Federation military doctrine have been ratified for the first time at the level of a normative legal act. We will now have to bring the legal basis for the organizational development and activity of the Armed Forces into line with the Constitution and the main provisions of the Russian Federation's military doctrine, and to create a clear-cut system of military legislation. We have prepared proposals on clarifying current laws and elaborating new ones in the defense sphere. Above all, these would be laws making amendments and additions to the Russian Federation laws "On Defense," "On the Draft and Military Service," "On the Status of Servicemen," "On Pension Provision for Servicemen".... We will have to draw up and adopt new laws: "On Martial Law," "On the Military Militia (Police)," "On Military Courts," and others -- more than 20 draft laws in all. Moreover, we need a package of normative legal acts to define the procedure for implementing military organizational development as a whole. As for social guarantees for servicemen, these have been laid down by Russian Federation laws and other normative acts issued by the Russian Federation president and Government. Unfortunately, a number of provisions of the Russian Federation law "On the Status of Servicemen" are not in operation owing to the fact that a mechanism for implementing them has not been defined and there is no funding available. We will have to fully develop a mechanism for implementing the privileges, guarantees, and compensation laid down by law for servicemen, persons discharged from military service, and their family members. Moreover, on the basis of constitutional principles, we are planning to step up legal protection for servicemen and Armed Forces' civilian personnel in military administrative organs and military units, to charge the military-legal service with the defense of their legitimate interests, and to set up a military advocate's service. These and other changes in the military-legal sphere will be implemented within the framework of military-legal reform in the Russian Federation Armed Forces. This is something that the Russian Federation president in his address to the Russian Federation Federal Assembly made one of the main avenues of Armed Forces organizational development. The Defense Ministry is currently drawing up a concept for military-legal reform whose measures will be implemented in coordination with other military reform measures in 1994-1995 and in the subsequent period. [KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] One last question, Mikhail Petrovich, regarding the press. Or, rather, relations between the General Staff and the press. After all, a lot of people in the writing fraternity have recently been making loud statements on the subject of negative aspects of the Army. And everything in this area is, as the saying goes, grist to the mill -- from the publication of unverified facts to out-and-out lying. How do you personally react when you encounter these sorts of articles? On the other hand, to what extent has a link been established between the General Staff and the press? [Kolesnikov] I would call the relationship between the General Staff and most of the Russian media entirely normal. With the help of the Defense Ministry's Information and Press Directorate, we have organized regular business contacts. We are striving to ensure that all the most important events in the life of the Armed Forces with a direct impact on the General Staff's sphere of activity are covered by media representatives. We systematically invite them to briefings and press conferences, answer their questions, give interviews, consult with them on the most difficult problems, and prepare articles at editorial collectives' request. Field trips by journalists to military units, visits to various Army and Navy installations, military-training establishments, training centers, and so forth are organized with the direct participation of General Staff personnel. This kind of relationship between the press and the General Staff has already become an established system and allows us to make our military policy more open to society. Our fellow countrymen get an entirely objective idea about everything taking place in the Army. At the same time, certain journalists have clearly failed to cement a relationship with the General Staff. And we are by no means to blame. Certain journalists are trying to make a name for themselves with pseudosensationalistic stories, unconfirmed facts, rumors, conjecture, and sometimes even barefaced lies. Take, for instance, the "report from entirely reliable sources" that there is allegedly already some kind of plan in place for dividing up the General Staff and the Defense Ministry. Totally false! And I could quote dozens of examples like that. How do I personally react to all this? In different ways. Sometimes I just swear, but most often I give instructions for a corresponding explanation or refutation to be prepared if the lies are, as they say, totally off the wall and could have major negative consequences not only for Russian public opinion but also for international relations. Of course, you cannot muzzle everyone. Freedom of speech has brought to journalism not only greater glasnost, but also irresponsibility when it comes to dealing with information. We at the General Staff are increasingly arriving at the conclusion that the relevant articles of the law on the mass media are not working. If liars and spreaders of disinformation and calumny were taken to court more often, then many of them would probably lose their "appetite" for making a name for themselves through lying. We probably need to stop being always on the defensive. We will combat those who besmirch us in the appropriate manner -- following the letter and spirit of the law. But it is better to build civilized relations in the way that is generally accepted worldwide -- using the language of truth and mutual respect.
