She was not willing to comment on the question of air strikes. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher knows how not to be a diplomat when he so wishes. His French interlocutors -- Francois Mitterrand, Edouard Balladur, and Alain Juppe -- experienced that on Monday when they discussed the Bosnian crisis with him: All their demands, aimed at securing a clear commitment from Washington in favor of the European peace plan which makes provision for an unequal partition of Bosnia, were rejected. This plan, the head of U.S. diplomacy told them in substance, is "immoral" and "unjust" because it penalizes the "victims" of an aggression which is essentially Serbian. Those victims should have the right to defend themselves. Therefore the United States will never exert pressure on the (Muslim) Bosnian authorities to accept a solution which does not suit them, even if they have reached a military effectiveness which is causing problems for Bosnia's Serbian and Croatian armed forces. As in May 1993, the United States is still in favor of lifting the arms embargo which is affecting Bosnia -- a measure to which the European countries which have sent contingents to the former Yugoslavia are still hostile. If the UN bodies agree, Washington will not oppose the use of air strikes to break the stranglehold on Sarajevo, reopen Tuzla airport, and free the city of Srebrenica, but is, however, completely opposed to sending American troops to Bosnian soil to impose a settlement. The French officials clearly did not expect such an outright rejection. There was "misunderstanding" or "misinterpretation" of our position, the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Affairs Ministry] said on Tuesday. We did not ask for U.S. military intervention and we did not put forward a new plan for a conference; we simply asked them to support a political plan and to accept increased cooperation with the Europeans and the Russians who, within the Security Council framework, are increasingly clearly opposing the use of force against the Serbs. And the question was asked: "How can the Americans refuse this dialogue?" The Twelve's plan, it was added, is not "intangible." Although the Bosnians must be deterred from reviving the war, pressure must be envisaged on the Serbs to make them concede certain regions to the Muslims without which their territory would not be "viable," and on the Croatians to accept that the Bosnians should have access to the sea. But these geographical changes in a plan which is changing constantly, because each side is trying to maximize its profits and minimize its risks, cannot be entrusted to the result of armed conflict. A resurgence of the fighting would place the UN Protection Force troops in an impossible situation which would result in their withdrawal. But it is clear that for Washington, which only has a few hundred men in Macedonia, the Bosnian crisis does not require an urgent decision, because it does not threaten any vital American interest: Bosnia, from this viewpoint, is much more similar to Lebanon than to Kuwait. A top U.S. official passing through Paris, who does not wish to be named, said on Tuesday morning that pressure must naturally be brought to bear on the Serbs and Croatians, but the best means of pressure is still the force of Bosnian arms. And, after once again mentioning the notion of "justice" to justify the American lack of action, this same interlocutor gave a cruder description of the state of mind of the American public ("only the big East coast newspapers are worrying much about Bosnia") and of Congress, which is hostile to any U.S. involvement in Bosnia following the problems encountered by the United States in Somalia and Haiti. "To impose a peace settlement in Bosnia," he added, "would take at least 200,000 men, which cannot be envisaged in the present situation," he added. After such a rebuff, which says a great deal about the U.S. desire to take the Europeans at their word when they demanded an identity in the security and defense sphere at the last NATO summit, the Twelve can only submit their work on the subject and hope that a conflagration does not precipitate a chaotic withdrawal. The task is particularly uninspiring because the Bosnians will emerge strengthened in their conviction that this Franco-American clash has ended to their advantage. The Russians, who have never concealed their sympathy for the Serbian camp, understood this immediately and, in an attempt to freeze the situation to Belgrade's advantage, have just demanded an emergency meeting of the Security Council in Geneva at foreign ministers' level. The aim of the meeting, to which all the parties to the conflict would be invited, is to adopt, following the conclusion of a cease-fire, "an agreement in principle on peace before examining the details." There is no doubt that the Twelve could have done without such an initiative.
