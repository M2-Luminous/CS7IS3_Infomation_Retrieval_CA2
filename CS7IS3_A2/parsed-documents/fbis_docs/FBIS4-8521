FBIS4-8521 "dreeu072_i_94017" FBIS-EEU-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Karadzic Protests Bombings to Butrus-Ghali Karadzic Protests Bombings to Butrus-Ghali LD1304105294 Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service in Serbo-Croatian 0942 GMT 13 Apr 94 LD1304105294 Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] Belgrade, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic expressed the hope today that "a positive turn in UN behavior is still possible," if bombing and other enemy acts against the Serbs stop immediately. "If this does not take place there is not a nation in the world that will accept the presence of UN forces on its territory," Karadzic said in a letter sent to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. "After this bombing, which can only be explained as involvement in the civil war on the Muslim side, our relations cannot be the same as before," the letter sent after NATO's second air attack on Serb positions near Gorazde says. Reminding Butrus-Ghali that he himself said on one occasion that the "safe areas" were Muslim army strongholds, Karadzic cites the international law on war, according to which "safe areas" should be demilitarized and in which only the armed presence of a third side, in this case UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], is allowed. "Muslims are constantly killing us from their `safe areas', protected by your soldiers, and they have launched a major offensive from Gorazde against the Serbs," Karadzic stresses. He stresses that UNPROFOR has placed itself completely on the Muslim side and bombed Serb civilian and military targets at a time when the Serbs are offering a cease-fire and the Muslim side is rejecting this. Karadzic says that there have been many irregularities in UNPROFOR's behavior in the two years of war. Its members have engaged in illegal trading, they have smuggled arms and ammunition to the Muslims, and they have openly given them military assistance in terms of reconnaissance and other actions. Despite this, the attitude of the Serbs toward the UN authorities has been exceptional during this entire time, Karadzic says, adding: "There have not been any serious incidents, while the other side has killed dozens of your soldiers." "The most recent UNPROFOR command in Bosnia-Herzegovina has utterly damaged these relations, while its bombing has destroyed the last remnants of respect for your armed forces here," Karadzic stresses. "You will understand that we can no longer cooperate with this command of yours that ordered the bombings. You will also understand our greater caution regarding the movement of members of UNPROFOR and the equipment being transported by them. All the agreements and good relations until now, which arose out of trust, have been wiped out, and we must monitor the behavior of UNPROFOR as a potential hostile force." "I hope, Your Excellency, that a positive turnabout in the behavior of the United Nations is still possible. Of course, this implies that the bombings and other hostile acts against the Serbs must stop immediately," Karadzic concludes in his letter to Butrus-Ghali.
