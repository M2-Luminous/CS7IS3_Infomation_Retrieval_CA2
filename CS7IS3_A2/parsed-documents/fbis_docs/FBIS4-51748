Rafsanjani hosted a banquet in honor of President Le Duc Anh and his entourage in Tehran. In his speech at the banquet, President Rafsanjani stressed: The Iranian people understand and admire the Vietnamese people for their protracted and arduous struggle in the past. It serves as a good example for the Iranian people. Indeed, the Vietnamese people's determination and victory have greatly encouraged other nations to continue their struggle. Vietnam has won admiration and respect from countries throughout the world. Today, like other nations, Iran highly appraises the Vietnamese leaders' intelligence and creativity in carrying out the national reconstruction program and in implementing the renovation process. We are convinced that Vietnam will continue to score ever greater achievements. People in Third World countries have taken Vietnam as a good example. I am convinced that through cooperation in various fields, we will be able to strengthen bilateral relations to meet the aspirations of our two peoples. The current visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran by the Vietnamese delegation will create a favorable condition for further exchanges of experiences and views. I believe that if we do not enhance our cooperation, best results will not be attained in collaboration between the South-South and Third World countries. Following President Rafsanjani's speech, President Le Duc Anh delivered a reply statement.
