The LPDR and Lao people are very pleased with and would like to wholeheartedly congratulate on such great achievements of the CPV and fraternal Vietnamese people. Your glorious successes have vigorously boosted the morale of the Lao people who have also carried out the restructuring tasks too. We would like to take this auspicious opportunity to wish the fraternal Vietnamese people under the leadership of the CPV, which is headed by respected and beloved Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi, to attain new and greater achievements in implementing the resolutions of the seventh party congress and the guidelines set by the party's recent meeting of representatives from all parts of the country.
