The warplanes had been responsible for an attack on a munitions factory, controlled by the Bosnian government, on the periphery of Novi Travnik, northwest of Sarajevo. NATO's response, uncharacteristically decisive, was entirely apt: Security Council resolutions ban flights by all "fixed-wing aircraft" in all Bosnian airspace. The prohibition, in force since March 31,1993, is unequivocal: the Serbs cannot seek refuge in Jesuitical interpretations of text and word. Also prohibited in clear terms are flights by "rotary-wing aircraft." Serb and Croat helicopters, however, have violated the ban with brazen frequency. The Croats, in particular, are known to have used these aerial means to ferry troops to combat zones. But what has been bitter sauce in Iraq for the goose has -- until now -- not been sauce for the gander in Bosnia. Helicopters have waltzed through Bosnian airspace, encountering nothing more than the occasional bolt of rhetorical NATO ire. Force has never been used against them, although it should have been on more than one occasion. Yesterday's response to the first instance of breach of the "no-fly zone" by fixed-wing aircraft was reassuringly swift. It will have been the intention of the Serbs to test the waters -- or the air -- as regards such aircraft. They can be in no doubt, now, about NATO's new-found resolve: it has shown, albeit thoroughly tardily, that it will carry out the mandate handed to it by the Security Council, which authorised states, "acting nationally or through regional organisations" to take "all necessary measures" in Bosnian airspace to ensure compliance with the ban on overflight. As the Prime Minister, John Major, put it: "Frankly, they couldn't expect anything else." And the Russian reaction, while measured, has not been negative: it has accepted the legitimacy of NATO's action in shooting down the four warplanes, but has avoided a condemnation of the Serbs for their aggression. NATO has used its teeth for the first time, qua NATO, since its formation in 1949. The significance of this will not be lost on the Bosnian Serbs. But apart from the particular issue of the enforcement of a Security Council resolution, its actions will serve as a more general warning to the Serbs: they cannot hope to switch with facility from Sarajevo to a different theatre of war. It is of the utmost importance that the Serbs, and the Croats, comprehend that NATO is intent on expanding zones of peace beyond Sarajevo. Mostar and Tuzla are next. But a few hours after the NATO enforcement action, Bosnian Serb forces commenced heavy bombardment of the Muslim-controlled town of Tuzla, which they have besieged remorselessly for more than two years. But the Security Council has given them until March 7 to lift their siege of Tuzla airport. Yesterday's action by NATO must serve as a model for a response to any Serb failure to "unlock" that airport. NATO, at last, is no longer playing at war.
