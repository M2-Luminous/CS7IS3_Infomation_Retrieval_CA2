Akamatsu, 64, who has served as director general of the Labor Ministry's Women's Bureau, once remarked that the lack of a woman on Sumo's Yokozuna Promotion Council is "strange" and has called for equality in the government's system of conferring decorations. Since becoming education minister last August, Akamatsu has worked to overcome some of the ministry's conservative administrative policies based on decades of Liberal Democratic Party guidance. She once remarked that she "shuddered" at the rule in junior high schools requiring boys to have their hair closely cropped, touching off a public debate over the issue and other school policies seen as restrictive by educational reformers. An Osaka native, Akamatsu graduated from Tokyo University to begin her career in the Labor Ministry in 1953. In 1978, she was put in charge of women's issues at the Prime Minister's Office and the same year was appointed minister at the Japanese mission to the United Nations. Akamatsu was government representative to the 34th U.N. General Assembly that signed a pact abolishing discrimination against women and in Japan worked to enact legislation on equal employment opportunities for women in May 1985. She became Japan's second woman ambassador in 1986 when she was sent to Uruguay, where she served until 1989.
