FBIS4-6631 "dreas078_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 North Korea Japan-U.S. Meeting on Cooperation Denounced Japan-U.S. Meeting on Cooperation Denounced SK2204105394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1040 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204105394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Dangerous Military Tieup" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Japanese and U.S. brasshats met in Tokyo recently to discuss "the Japan-U.S. cooperation system for coping with a possible dispute on the Korean peninsula." NODONG SINMUN today views this as a clear proof that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, in league with each other, are proceeding with designs of aggression and domination on Korea and other Asian countries. They regard aggression on Korea as the key to achieving military upperhand and supremacy in Asia, the analyst says, and continues: The United States is intending to stifle the DPRK by using the Japanese territory and its military and economic potentials, while the Japanese reactionaries are scheming to convert Japan into a military power in a short period and gratify their desire to stage a comeback to Korea by cooperating with the United States in the execution of its policy. It must not go unnoticed that the Japanese reactionaries are openly revealing their design to reinvade Korea, charging the DPRK with "nuclear development" and "missile threat" at a time when the United States has intensified the anti-DPRK campaign to stifle it as never before. It is a lie to describe the Japan-based U.S. Forces as something for "Japan-U.S. security." They have been deployed according to the U.S. aggressive strategy of forward deployment. Their basic mission and duty are to play the role of a shock brigade in the execution of the U.S. policy of aggression and war against the DPRK and other Asian nations. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries must give up their criminal military tieup and aggressive moves against the DPRK and other Asian nations.
