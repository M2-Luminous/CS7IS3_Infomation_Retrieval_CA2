Leonov, A.G. Sila Novitskiy, V.S. Smirnov, A.I. Filin, V.S. Tsikunov and Yu.M. Cherkashov (NIKIET) under the ``S&T Progress to Builders'' rubric] [Abstract] Work on ``Nontraditional Concepts of AES With Natural Safety'' is conducted within the framework of the State S&T Program ``Ecologically Clean Power'' under the auspices of the Ministry of Science, Higher School and Technical Policy. Criteria of inherent safety of nuclear reactors (a new nuclear power philosophy proposed by a well known American scientist A. Weinberg) had been developed, and a contest of concepts of nuclear reactors meeting these requirements was conducted. It has been determined that of the five concepts presented for the contest the concept of fast reactors with a lead heat transfer agent (BREST [Russian abbreviation]) meets the requirements in the most thorough way. A group of IAE [Atomic Energy Institute] associates on the initiative and under the leadership of V.V. Orlov had begun the development of such reactor more than five years ago; the development then continued at NIKIET [expansion not given] and OKB [Experimental Design Bureau] ``Gidropress'', with the participation of FEI, VNIINM, TsNIIKM ``Prometey'', NIIAR, VNIITF [expansions not given], NPO [scientific production association] ``Luch'', MIFI [Moscow Engineering Physics Institute] and a number of other institutes. There are two directions of designing a reactor unit a three and a two loop scheme for removal of heat from the reactor core. The two loop scheme is deemed more promising. Conceptual designs of reactors BRS (300- 1000 MW of electric power) and BREST 300 (300 MW) are described. As far as the cost of electric power is concerned, it is lower for BREST reactors than for reactors BN 1600 and VTGR and comparable to reactors VVER. It is estimated that an experimental demonstration reactor can be built in approximately eight years, while construction of a pilot AES with this reactor will take 12 to 15 years. Three illustrations, two tables.
