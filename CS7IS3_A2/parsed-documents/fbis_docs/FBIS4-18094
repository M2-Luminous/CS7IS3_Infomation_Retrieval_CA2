An improvement for Austria was achieved regarding its representation in the EU bodies. It will be allowed to send 21 (instead of 20) deputies to the European Parliament, and 12 each (instead of 11) to the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. Austria's ambassador to the European Union, Manfred Scheich, stressed that the compromise on the blocking minority in the EU Council of Ministers adopted earlier is the "result of political common sense."
