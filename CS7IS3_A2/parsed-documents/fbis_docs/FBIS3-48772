"I welcome it from my heart," said Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren). "Now I hope that both the ruling and opposition parties will pass the bills in the Diet as early as possible and tackle urgent tasks such as economic measures and the Japan-U.S. Summit," Hiraiwa said. Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the agreement capped a six-year-old controversy and broke the deadlock in politics. "I hope it will somewhat clear the air hanging over the people and have a positive effect on the economy," Inaba said. The business community has been pressing for an early passage of political reform bills, with Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), calling it a prerequisite for writing recession-fighting economic measures. Wrangling over the proposed political reform bills has kept Hosokawa's coalition government from hammering out a new stimulus package to help pull the economy out of recession, and from drafting the fiscal 1994 budget. The Finance Ministry also appears happy with the compromise as it has been working against the clock on mapping out a blueprint for the budget before a February 11 Japan-U.S. summit. Tokyo has been under pressure to carry out an income tax cut as a way to boost the economy and thereby create demand for imports to rectify the bilateral trade gap. Indications are that the ministry is looking to present its budget blueprint on February 10, the day before the Japan-U.S. Summit, in hopes that the government can adopt the fiscal 1994 budget around February 25.
