In an interview for UNIAN today, VPU Chairman Oleksandr Mryl confirmed plans to go ahead with the strike which, according to him, would be staged in the form of a "first Kiev popular assembly," since the city administration refused permission to hold an authorized rally. According to preliminary calculations, about 10,000 workers from Kiev's Bilshovyk and Leninska Kuznya plants, pilots, and railroad employees will gather on Independence Square tomorrow morning. It is planned to approve a resolution on the Ukrainian citizens' appeal to support the Free Trade Unions' demands. According to the plan, the strike will last for two or three weeks until Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers resigns. According to Oleksandr Mryl, telegrams of support for the strike arrived from Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk, Lvov, and Volyn oblasts. Donetsk miners will also go on strike tomorrow. Oleksandr Stoyan, chairman of Ukraine's Federation of Trade Unions [FPU], told UNIAN the FPU does not support the strike and will take the stand of an observer.
