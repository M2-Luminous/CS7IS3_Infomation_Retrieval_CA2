He made this statement at the end of a closed session of the upper chamber of parliament on ratifying the Russian president's decree extending the state of emergency in part of the territory of the Republic of North Ossetia and of the Ingush Republic for another two months. Ruslan Aushev explained this "disagreement with the approach to the resolution of the problem of settling the conflict in the territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia." In his opinion, "in drafting the President's decree on extending the emergency, the opinion of the component parts of the Federation should be taken into account." "This especially concerns those instances when questions are being tackled connected with change of the territories to which the force of the emergency is extended," he stressed. The Ingush president said the position of his republic remained as before: "It is necessary to give power to the interim administration in the conflict zone and disarm all the military formations." President of North Ossetia Akhsarbek Galazov refrained from commenting on the content of the President's decree, and limited himself only to the statement that "it is necessary to move towards peace, stop shooting, and start working."
