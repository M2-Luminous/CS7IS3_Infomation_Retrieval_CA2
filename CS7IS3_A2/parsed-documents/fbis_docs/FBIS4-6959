"Hata was considered the most likely candidate from the beginning," the ASAHI SHIMBUN said, citing the candidate's cabinet experience in Liberal Democratic Party-led governments and his "comparably high" popularity. But "the Hata government sets sails while revealing big contradictions," the ASAHI editorial continued, pointing to major policy differences and animosity between Shinseito's [Japan Renewal Party] key strategist Ichiro Ozawa and leaders of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest coalition party. "Both (sides) were like oil and water from the very beginning," it said, adding that policy clashes over North Korea and tax increases seem inevitable. "As before, Shinseito's No. 2 man Ozawa will play the major role, as so far Hata has failed to put his foot down on the intracoalition struggle," said the ASAHI editorial entitled, "Isn't It Prime Minister Ozawa?" The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN observed that with Hata's candidacy, "the antagonism between coalition parties has not been settled for the time being, and political instability characterized by political realignment is likely to continue." After New Party Sakigake [Harbinger] split from its ally Japan New Party and pulled out of the coalition, "two poles" centering on the Shinseito-Komeito [Clean Government Party] bloc and the SDP have developed, the economic daily said. It said Shinseito and the Buddhist-backed Komeito are devoted to a total overhaul of the tax system and tax hikes, which the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN believes are necessary to finance the country's social security system. The NIKKEI said it is doubtful whether the coalition will endorse "unconditionally" any steps the United Nations could take against North Korea in connection with its alleged nuclear weapons program. "This will unavoidably narrow Japan's diplomatic range," the NIKKEI said. "The rising tide for political realignment shows no signs of ebbing. Fires of change are smoldering," the YOMIURI said about the prospects of the coalition. It urged a "stable and strong government with common policy ideals and policies." The YOMIURI, the nation's largest daily, said it would be better to make Hata's government a caretaker government to pass the fiscal 1994 budget, and then dissolve the House of Representatives for a general election. The MAINICHI SHIMBUN regretted the missed opportunity for political realignment and the formulation of new policies which it anticipated from the formation of a new government. "It will basically maintain the structure of the current coalition government," it said. While urging the upcoming government to continue Hosokawa's reform drive, the MAINICHI doubts whether money politics will be rooted out. "The political reforms focusing on a revival of the self-cleaning capacity of politics have come to an end before penetrating even below the surface," the MAINICHI said.
