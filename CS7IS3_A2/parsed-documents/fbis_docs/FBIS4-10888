How many telephone contacts did they have and what did they discuss? [Robaina] As far as I know, there was only one telephone conversation arranged by a common friend. With regard to the topic of their conversation, I think that President Menem's account of this talk corresponded better with the truth. In other words, they discussed subjects that do not necessarily have anything to do with politics. [Sopena] With regard to the different approaches adopted by Menem and Castro, why does it bother Cuba that a democratically elected Latin American president, whether Menem or any other, should say that Cuban citizens also ought to have the opportunity to choose their rulers in freely contested elections? [Robaina] It does not bother us at all, but I think that both countries face different realities. I believe that we should not be questioned as if we lived in a normal country because my country continues to be a country whose living conditions are those of a besieged stronghold. And a besieged stronghold cannot afford the luxuries it would aspire to if it lived under normal conditions. [Sopena] Has the accession of Bill Clinton to the U.S. presidency somehow changed things? [Robaina] No. Perhaps the only substantial public change is that Clinton is not as aggressive as Bush. But leaving this consideration aside, perhaps there is an even more repressive stance on the trade embargo. Hence, there is no reason whatsoever for being overly enthusiastic. [Sopena] Let us imagine a possible scenario in which, in a move comparable to Nixon when he recognized the PRC, President Clinton decided to lift the embargo and Cuba became a country just like the others. What would change in Cuba? Would there be an economic and political opening? [Robaina] Well, seeing is believing. However, I would say that, under normal living conditions, Cuba will develop a work system in which everything may be analyzed. [Sopena] The embargo seems to be the main argument put forward to explain Cuba's dire financial straits. But is it not a way to hide the domestic economic system's inherent inefficiencies, which have nothing to do with the embargo? [Robaina] There is no denying the fact that there are inefficiencies but, comparatively, the embargo continues to be the main cause of our problems. [Sopena] How far will the current economic opening drive go? [Robaina] As far as it can adapt to our circumstances. We will widen those possibilities as we become more acquainted with the system once the foreign capital we need comes to our country and is channeled into investments. [Sopena] Would Cuba privatize some sectors of its economy? [Robaina] We believe the state has proved that it is efficient in many areas. There are others, however, in which we have started to work together with the private sector. Nevertheless, I think that a long road lies ahead of us so it is still too early to evaluate what we will do afterward. [Sopena] Does Castro wholly mistrust private activity? [Robaina] Both Castro and all of us have seen that in some places where the economy is administered by the private sector it has proved to be efficient whereas in other places it has not. Moreover, I believe that the neoliberal model has yielded good results in some places and is teaching us things that we have to study in-depth. This includes the partnership with the private sector, and even the privatization of what has to be privatized in some areas. However, one should not run away with the idea that these changes will come overnight. [Sopena] The world is changing rapidly nowadays. Does Cuba not run the risk of staying behind? [Robaina] We cannot afford to make mistakes because what others do without being subject to pressure, we must accomplish under pressure.
