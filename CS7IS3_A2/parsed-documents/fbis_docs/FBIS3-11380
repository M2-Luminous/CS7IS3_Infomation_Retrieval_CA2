The companies NEC, Ericsson, and STC (an association between the Sid company and the American giant AT&T) were beaten during the technical requirements stage. Alcatel prices were 25 percent cheaper than those of its main adversary, the company Equitel, representing Siemens. "The intelligent network is a new concept in communications networks and will represent a revolution in the automation of telephone services, which will become more agile and flexible," Telebras President Adyr da Silva said. "Strategically the victory constitutes an important bridge for the company, because it will superimpose a new network on the one already built by Telebras," Alcatel President Manuel Octavio Lopez said. Lopez said the network will offer three new services in the first stage, besides permitting 20 million simultaneous calls, by installing access points to the systems installed in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Salvador, and Curitiba. The number of simultaneous calls will climb to 60 million when the system is completely installed. The first benefit for consumers will be the possibility of using a new kind of 800 service (charge calls) which eliminates the need to call the long distance operator before calling the company number. The system also contemplates the installation of telephones that can be operated with credit cards. Users will be able to pass their credit cards through the machine, and the call will be automatically charged. The company also plans to install an Advanced Virtual Network that will operate as Telebras' voice channel, but with cheaper rates. In this case, large companies will be able to use a PABX [private automatic branch exchange] system for intercity calls. According to the Alcatel president, the company has already agreed with Telebras to create a technological development group for the intelligent network, which will be based at the Research and Development Center (CPQD) owned by the state company in Campinas (SP) [Sao Paulo]. "It is not a partnership, but the means to create new services, and the network standards and testing during the system's installation will be the responsibility of both companies," CPQD Director Paulo Pospissil said.
