It was the first time in our country's aerospace history that a man-made earth satellite was named after an enterprise. Guangzhou's Hualing Limited Company Group mainly produces Hualing-brand refrigerators and other household electrical appliances, and is one of "the country's top 10 enterprises that produce household electrical appliances." To support our country's aerospace service, the company donated 500,000 yuan to the aerospace industry before the "Long March 3-A" rocket was launched. To express its gratitude, the rocket technology institute painted the Hualing group's business emblem on the satellite's cowling and placed inside the satellite a model of the national gold medal awarded to the company.
