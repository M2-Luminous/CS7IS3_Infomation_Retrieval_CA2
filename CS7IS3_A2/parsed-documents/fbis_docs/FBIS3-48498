Kim Sok-kyu, ROK ambassador to Russia, who made a temporary home visit on 22 January to discuss state affairs with his headquarters after 10 months in his position, said it is important to correctly perceive Russia and stressed that the ROK should further strengthen diplomacy toward Russia in the direction whereby Russia can be secured as a support force in reunification and security. Following are questions posed to and answers given by Ambassador Kim: [Reporter] How are things in Russia these days? [Kim] After the new parliament was formed, the conservatives and communists launching the congress became more notable than expected because radical reformers had hurt various classes, such as the unemployed and beneficiaries of the pension system. It will take two years before the situation in Russia stabilizes. However, there will be no change in Russia's policy on the Korean peninsula. [Reporter] How do you assess the Russian Government's recent proposal of supplying, and jointly developing and manufacturing weapons? [Kim] The issue on the military exchanges between the two countries is an issue to be examined on a long-term basis and, in my personal opinion, it is worthwhile reviewing. The reason the Russian Government made such a proposal is that there is no other way for Russia to reimburse the economic cooperation loan. [Reporter] How efficient are the Russian weapons? [Kim] They should be deemed highly efficient, taking into account that Russia once competed with the United States as a superpower. Russia is currently selling weapons to various countries. [Reporter] How about the issue of President Kim's visit to Russia? [Kim] The Russian Government keeps asking when President Kim Yong-sam can visit Russia. However, I have not received any kind of a commitment from the government. If President Kim visits Russia this year, a year marking the 110th anniversary of the establishment of the ROK-Russian diplomatic relations, it will be a golden opportunity for both countries to revitalize relations. [Reporter] What about the issue of compensating the bereaved families of victims of the Korean airliner? [Kim] I have already asked the Russian Government for compensation. The Russian Government, however, seems to have the notion that more solid information should be provided by the United States to clarify the issue. [Reporter] How big is the trade volume between the ROK and Russia? [Kim] Last year, bilateral trade amounted to $1.9 billion, $0.6 billion in exports and $1.3 billion in imports. However, the trade volume is expected to reach up to $10 billion by early 2000 and Russia will become one of our biggest markets. In Russia nowadays, electronic goods manufactured by domestic companies such as Samsong, Goldstar, and Daewoo are selling like hot cakes. Due to the fact that Russia grants the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) to the ROK goods, they are relatively cheaper than Japanese goods and, consequently, are competitive.
