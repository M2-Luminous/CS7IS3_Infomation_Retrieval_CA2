He added: "This pleases us, and we will work toward that goal." In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Lage noted: "This is an important step in terms of Canadian policy toward Cuba throughout the years." "It is in line," he added, "with an increase in existing economic and commercial ties, particularly in the area of tourism." In discussing the visit by Christine Stewart, minister of state for Latin America and Africa, the Cuban vice president said the visit intensifies relations between the two countries, which are, in fact, already satisfactory. "This relationship is very important for Cuba," he concluded. On Monday night, President Fidel Castro received Stewart, the highest-ranking Canadian official to visit the island in more than 18 years since former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's visit to Havana in 1976. Stewart described the meeting as fruitful. Stewart also met with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon; Finance and Prices Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez; and Ernesto Melendez, minister of foreign investment and economic cooperation. Together with Lage, last night, the Canadian minister opened an international businessmen's conference on business opportunities in Cuba sponsored by THE ECONOMIST magazine. More than 120 executives from firms in Canada, the UK, the United States, Europe, and Latin America are participating in the event. On Monday, Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet in Ottawa and Stewart in Havana simultaneously issued official announcements ending the suspension of Canada's official economic aid to Cuba. The aid has been suspended in 1978 in the wake of the Cuban military aid to Angola in the face of the South African aggression. Eduardo del Buey, a Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesman who is accompanying Stewart, stressed: "This is an important moment in the ties between Cuba and Canada" based on "frequent and honest dialogues." "It is a dialogue between friends who disagree on certain things, but who feel mutual respect. It is a dialogue that serves to consolidate the basis of their relations," Del Buey told PRENSA LATINA. In this regard, Bienvenido Garcia, a department director at the Cuban Foreign Ministry, explained: "There are more points of agreement than disagreement." At the inauguration of the businessmen's conference, Stewart said her government supports increased investments in Cuba, not only because it will contribute to Cuba's development, but also because Canada will benefit. Canada has large foreign investments in the mining sector, not only in the traditional nickel sector, but also in prospecting for gold, lead, and copper, as well as exploring for oil. In addition, Canada sends more tourists to Cuba than any other nation. More than 120,000 Canadians enjoy their vacations in Cuba every year. Stewart also expressed Ottawa's desire for Cuba to return to the OAS, where "it can again play an important role with all of its privileges and responsibilities." On this subject, she noted that "isolation is unhealthy," and she said her government plans to review with other nations the possibility of Cuba's return to that hemispheric organization. Cuba was suspended from the OAS in 1962 as a result of U.S. pressures. "This is not something we can accomplish overnight, however; we believe it is a process we must begin to think about," she added. She said Canada understands the current difficulties in Cuba and praised the government's efforts to try to maintain the benefits of important social programs in areas such as education and health. On this point, she stressed: "It is difficult, but vital, to continue these efforts." With regard to the Canadian Government's willingness to heighten the political dialogue, Stewart mentioned the interest expressed by Foreign Minister Ouellet to meet with Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina at "some appropriate moment."
