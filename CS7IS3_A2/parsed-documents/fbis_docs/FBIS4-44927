The reason for this is the reduction of customs tariffs on all cars with a capacity of less than 1,300 cc. This reduction has made these cars more salable than the car produced by Egyptian plants and has eliminated real competition between imports and local production because of the lower prices of imports. We have in Egypt more than one plant that has begun to turn out production or is about to begin production, not to mention the al-Nasr Car Company production. Car experts have demanded reduction of the customs tariff on the requirements needed to produce Egyptian cars of all capacities in order to protect this newborn industry from the ghoul of imports. The experts have also demanded that the car market be protected from numerous kinds of cars that are offered in the markets without any identification or country of origin and that carry international brand names. Officials must do this to safeguard Egypt's economy and its money. Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Sa'udi, head of the car dealers branch of the Cairo Chamber of Commerce, has said reduced tariffs on imported cars with a capacity of less than 1,300 cc has inflicted grave harm on domestic car plants at a time when these plants are making their first steps to meet the domestic demand for cars and to prepare to compete, even if at the price level only, with imported cars. Dr. Sa'udi added that the government must not only consider securing cars for consumers at a price that is 5-percent or 10-percent cheaper. It must, at the same time, consider the national industry's future and must promote domestic investments that open the door for greater employment opportunities and that create other subsidiary industries around them. He urged reduction of the customs tariff on imported components so that plants can reduce their costs and can compete anew with imported cars. Engineer Salah-al-Din al-Khudari, the commissioned member of the Suzuki Egypt Corporation, has noted that the recent customs tariff amendments have harmed domestic plants from two angles: customs fees on imported cars have dropped by 10 percent, thus improving their chance to compete and, on the other hand, the increase of 4 percent in service fees has led to increasing the customs fees on imported components, which means an increase in the cost of the domestic product! Al-Khudari also said that a continuation of this condition will compel the Egyptian producer to depart the domestic car market and that the door will be opened wide for the foreign product to occupy this market. Al-Khudari further added that domestic plants have been forced to lower their prices in order to survive in the market even though this reduction saddles them with added burdens, keeping in mind the constant rise in the costs of electricity, power, water, insurance, and taxes. Al-Khudari went on to add that the increased new car supply in the market and the drop in the prices of these cars, both domestic and imported, has led to an increased demand for them and, consequently, to a drop in the demand for used cars and in the prices of these cars. He has urged that controls be established on car imports and that car dealership owners be given the necessary protection so that they can perform their role and secure post-sale service to the consumer. Requirements for Compact-Car Production Husayn Abazah, deputy chairman of the Trade and Development Center, has said that reduced customs fees on compact cars will negatively affect the production of similar cars in Egypt. Abazah has urged the government to reduce customs fees on requirements for the production of Egyptian compact cars so as to safeguard the investments that have been spent on this industry and to protect this industry's workers, especially since this newborn industry needs government protection. We have been urging full protection for more than a year, because aiding these plants by reducing the customs fees on the requirements for Egyptian compact-car production will enable local cars to compete with imported cars that have less than 1,300 cc engine capacity. Thus, we will preserve the investments that have been made in this field. He stressed that Egyptian cars will find it very difficult to compete with imported cars with an engine capacity of less than 1,300 cc, especially in light of reduced customs fees on the imports. Therefore, the customs tariff concerning production requirements for cars with a capacity of less than 1,300 cc must be reconsidered. Abazah said that Egyptian-produced cars with an engine capacity of 1,500-2,000 cc will not be affected by the recently announced customs tariff reduction and that the volume produced in Egypt has not been able to meet the growing demand for cars with a 1,500-2,000 cc capacity. Moreover, the price of the import exceeds the price of the similar domestic product by nearly 30 percent. Husayn Abazah pointed out, however, that the domestic market for big cars produced in Egypt would, by necessity, be affected by the customs tariff reduction if such cars were produced in large numbers. He urged officials to protect the car market and the Egyptian consumer from the entry of unidentifiable cars now that the door of imports has been opened. He said, "We don't know in what country these cars are produced, even though they carry international brand names. This will undermine the national wealth, because hard currency will be spent on importing such cars. Moreover, the hypothetical life span of these vehicles is 50 percent shorter than the life span of the genuine vehicle originating from the genuine source." He stressed that the Egyptian consumer will suffer a big loss if he buys such vehicles. Consumers Prefer Imports An official source of al-Nasr Car Company has said that reducing the customs fees by 10 percent will affect the Egyptian car market, especially the production plants, negatively. He added that the consumer will buy imports instead of the locally-produced types. This official asserted that [domestic] car companies have begun to reconsider some current proposals to produce new car models in anticipation of chaos in the Egyptian car market. Car Plants Face Threat of Closure Majdi Mukhtar, the chairman of a new company operating in the field of passenger car production, has said that the 10-percent reduction in customs fees will inflict heavy losses on Egyptian car producers. Mukhtar has proposed that the government provide a grace period of 4-5 years without any customs fee reduction in order to enable producers to increase the domestic component and reduce imported components used in car production. Mukhtar also said, "On the other hand, the resource development fee can be raised by as much as the reduction in customs fees so as to make up for the customs fee reduction on the [imported] fully-manufactured commodity." He said that he has invested an estimated 150 million pounds to build a new car factory, and that he will go ahead and produce the car, because complete stoppage means a big loss in the invested capital. Mukhtar asserted that with the customs fee reduction, the fully-manufactured imported car will compete with the national production, thus exposing new investments to extreme risks that reach the extent of complete closure. Faruq Ihsan, a car dealer, has said, "The used and new car markets are dominated by chaos and anticipation now that the customs tariff on cars with a capacity of less than 1,300 cc has been reduced. This condition will last for three months before the car market can regain its past condition. "Used car prices will drop by no less than 20 percent now that new cars have no customs fees and that there has been a big increase in the used car supply." Ihsan added, "Sales declined immediately after the tariff was announced, because buyers have stopped buying cars in the hope of getting the biggest reduction in car prices. They are entitled to do this because the price of a single car may drop by 7,000 pounds." Ihsan further said, "Demand will be for new cars offered by dealers and companies on bank-guaranteed installments so as to take advantage of the 10-percent customs fee reduction. Moreover, all the buyer has to do is make a small down payment get a brand new car."
