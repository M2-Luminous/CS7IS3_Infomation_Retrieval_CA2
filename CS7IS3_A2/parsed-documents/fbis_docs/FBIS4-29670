The deregulation measure also opens many business activities that supplement the basic needs of the people in their daily life. As a matter of fact, the government has taken a very daring move to issue the new investment deregulation measure. The new deregulation package on investment was announced to newsmen by Murdiono, minister/state secretary, at his office in Jakarta on Thursday, 2 June. Murdiono was accompanied by ministers in charge of the measure. Now that the deregulation package has been issued, it looks like the government is determined to make the country more attractive to foreign investors to face the keener and stiff competition in the international capital market. The latest deregulation measure is contained in Government Regulation No. 20/1994 on shareholding in companies and it was approved by President Suharto on 19 May. Under Government Regulation No. 20/1994, foreign investment can be set up in two forms -- wholly-owned foreign enterprises and joint ventures. The foreign investor is allowed to hold up to 95 percent share of the joint venture, and a 100-percent share of the wholly- owned investment. According to the previous regulation, foreign investors were required to gradually reduce their shareholdings to 51 percent after the 20th year of business. This means the foreign investor was forced to become a minor share holder of the business. It is interesting to carefully note that under the new deregulation package, foreign capital in joint venture projects can now enter into business activities that are considered strategic to the nation and which cater to the needs of many people. The new regulation opens seaports, telecommunications, power, civil aviation, sea transportation, production of potable water, railway, nuclear power, and mass media to foreign investors. It looks as if the government made a breakthrough in the capital investment to revitalize foreign investment, to overcome limited infrastructure facilities, to create a lot of job opportunities, and to boost the exports of nonoil and nongas commodities. While the public sector is now opened to foreign capital, we have to further scrutinize the legal aspects and the implications of the deregulation package. Section 33 of the 1945 Constitution stipulates that various kinds of production activities that are strategic to the nation and those that cater to the needs of many people, should be controlled by the state. However, according to Sanyoto Satrowardoyo, minister for investment development, the Government Regulation does not contradict the 1967 Law No. 1 on Foreign Investment. Meanwhile, Murdiono, minister/state secretary, said that the latest deregulation package on foreign capital investment clearly defines the 1967 Law No. 1. On the other hand, we should realize that there must be objective, effective, and timely adjustments to suit the rapidly developing situation. Five years ago, developing countries like PRC, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India were considered to be closed to foreign capital investment. Nowadays, we are facing keener competition from these countries in attracting foreign investment in response to the process of globalization. Another main reason for the announcement of the deregulation on foreign investment is to enable the economy to grow above 6 percent, which has been fixed as the precondition to overcome unemployment. This is because population growth in Indonesia is still relatively high. Indonesia needs at least 660 trillion rupiah in new investment during the current sixth five-year development plan and 73 percent of the total is expected from private investment, including foreign capital. Still, despite the seemingly attractive incentives offered by the new regulation, will the foreign investors be attracted to invest in Indonesia and can the foreign capital increase the limited funds owned by the local private sector? There are other factors that determine the investment climate in the country. They are, among others, economic and political stability and the risks from growing corrupt practices and collusion. Accordingly, we should exercise caution against such country risks [preceding two words in English] to attract foreign capital. Besides, the foreign capital that is invested in vital public sectors should be fully controlled, supervised, and managed by the state. Otherwise, the risks are very high.
