Commenting on the concept of the "national welfare tax," which he proposed last February and later retracted, the prime minister revealed that despite his own intentions, the bureaucracy, including the Finance Ministry, had exerted stronger influence. For example, he said: "I tried to take advantage of the Finance Ministry and other government agencies to achieve my goals. However, it turned out that I was the one who was exploited by the bureaucrats. I was swayed by what they said." In connection with the news conference on the announcement of the national welfare tax being held in the early hours of 3 February, Takemura said: "I ran all over the place to try to stop the news conference." In response, Hosokawa reportedly indicated he "learned his lesson," saying: "I should have not held the news conference at all. I should have postponed it until the next day. It was unreasonable." That night, however, when rumors of Hosokawa's remarks spread through Nagato-cho [the district in Tokyo where the Diet building is located], the prime minister telephoned Takemura and asked him "not to disclose the details." Thus, the relations between the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary remained awkward until the very end.
