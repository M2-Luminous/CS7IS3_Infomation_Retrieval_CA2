He said in a statement he had ordered Generals Basie Smit and Johan le Roux back to work on Monday, saying no grounds existed for them to stay away. The two generals and a third, Krappies Engelbrecht, were implicated in a report by Mr Justice Richrd Goldstone on March 18. The report said there was prima facie evidence of the generals' involvement in third force activities and gun running. They were suspended by President F W de Klerk pending an investigation into the allegations. Gen van der Merwe said he had made his decision after consultations with Transvaal Attorney General Jan d'Oliveira. "I am convinced the evidence which Dr d'Oliveira has in his possession at this stage is not of such a nature that the two generals should be withdrawn from service as a result thereof. "Even though the generals voluntarily withdrew from service the investigation could still continue for several months and due to a lack of grounds for such withdrawal it can no longer be permitted," Gen van der Merwe said.
