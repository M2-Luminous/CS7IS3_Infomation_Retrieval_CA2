In the work published on April 20, 1974, Comrade Kim Chong-il emphasized the need to invigorate the efforts for establishing the monolithic ideological system of the party in keeping with the developing reality in which the whole society was being modelled on the chuche idea. He said what was essential in this was to rear the officials, party members and working people to be chuche-type revolutionaries unfailingly loyal to the party and the leader. The work gives a comprehensive exposition of the reason why loyalty to the party and the leader is the main trait of the chuche-type revolutionaries, the basic characteristics of loyalty to the party and the leader, concrete tasks and ways of cherishing it as the revolutionary faith and obligation and all other theoretical and practical matters arising in rearing revolutionaries of chuche type. In a by-lined article titled "Immortal Work Guiding People To Cherish Loyalty to the Leader as Their Faith and Obligation" the paper says: The work serves as a revolutionary textbook of our people in struggle and life because it fully reflects the noble aspiration and demand of the chuche-type revolutionaries to absolutely trust and follow the party and the leader. It is the main point of the work that only those who cherish loyalty to the party and the leader as their revolutionary faith and obligation can remain infinitely faithful to them through generations in any adversities. The validity and vitality of the idea expounded by the work have been clearly proved through our revolutionary practice over the past two decades. Today our people are staunchly advancing along the road of socialism indicated by the leader, regarding loyalty to the party and the leader as their life and blood. Their loyalty to the party and the leader is underlined by their faith, conscience, morality and everyday life. It is also their purest ideological feelings and something undisputable which remains unchanged in any circumstances. There is no such a people in the world as the Korean people, who remain loyal to the great leader President Kim Il-song and the illustrious leader Comrade Kim Chong-il with their faith and obligation.
