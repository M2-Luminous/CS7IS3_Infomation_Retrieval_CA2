His visit to Iran is within the framework of the regular visits carried out by the officials of the two countries to consolidate and broaden bilateral relations. Tehran and Beijing have particular reasons for expanding bilateral relations: Broadening Economic Relations and Cooperation Qichen's remarks on political cooperation in safeguarding the interests of the countries of the south in the regional and international organizations have been assessed as positive and he has expressed his interest in closer cooperation among the PRC, India, and Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO] member countries. Interest in Preserving Peace and Stability in Central Asia The necessary coordination on issues pertaining to human rights is required, as the countries of the north are seeking to bestow legitimacy on their own overbearing viewpoint in this regard to interfere in the internal affairs of the countries of the south that oppose their domination. It is predicted that the officials of the PRC and Iran will discuss these as well as other issues, such as the crisis in the Korean peninsula, the security of the Persian Gulf, and the Palestinian issue. But most importantly, the talks between the PRC and Tehran will pertain to Washington's goals on the Asian continent. When the world is witnessing the rise of nationalism following the Cold War, the countries of the north spearheaded by the United States are seeking to capitalize on this phenomenon. In other words, the north is seeking to use the weapon of nationalism to break up that group of countries in the south that resists them. The United States sees the extensive region from the Red Sea to Sinkiang and Tibet as suitable for the implementation of its objectives, which include some important countries in the region such as the PRC, India, Iran, and others. In this regard, by supporting the secessionist movements, as in Tibet, the United States wants to create a security organization in Central Asia that will fill the vacuum stemming from its presence in that vast area. [as published] This is why we saw General Waters, the commander of the NATO armed forces, declaring that this organization is seeking to control countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. Similarly it was announced that the United States is seeking to set up a base in Kyrgyzstan. By capitalizing on the economic problems of the Central Asian countries, the United States wants to infiltrate the region. What is important in this path is that the national security of the PRC, Iran, and India will be endangered, because they are near this region. If the U.S. goals in the breakup of the regional countries materialize, the front of the countries of the south and the Asian continent will face tension and instability. But solidarity and coordination among Beijing, New Delhi, and Tehran could counteract this imperialistic policy of the countries of the north and prevent Central Asian countries from depending on them, thus guiding the region toward peace and stability. The visit by Qian Qichen can help achieve this prospect.
