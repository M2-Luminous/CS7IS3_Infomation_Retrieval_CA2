And this is despite the fact that the credit noose is forcing many farmers to abandon the work they started. Since 1 November 1993, punitive sanctions of up to 420 percent have been introduced for failure to repay credits issued at the expense of centralized resources. At the very beginning of the agrarian reform, one of the key ideas was the formation of a fundamentally new type of agricultural enterprise--the peasant farm. A small peasant farm,, managed by its owners and based on their labor, was to become an alternative to large-scale production and the epicenter of reform for the sector. The Law "On the Peasant Farm" became one of the first acts of the agrarian reform. It has been 3 years since the new social order was established by law, and today there are 270,000 peasant farms in Russia (See Table 1). Over these years, it appeared that farming's development repeated the dynamics of the agrarian reform itself. While 1991 may be called the year of the sudden start and 1992 the year of the rapid growth of the farming sector, 1993 saw a slowdown in the pace of forming new peasant farms. Moreover, the number of farms discontinuing their activity has begun to increase--as many disappeared in the last 3 months of 1993 alone as in all of 1992 (See Table 2). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

However, the results of its development over 3 years attests to the fact that the contribution of peasant farms to overall agricultural production is increasing (See Table 3). While there is an overall recession in agriculture, production is expanding in the farming sector. For example, the production of grain, sugar beets, meat, and milk was roughly doubled and egg production increased by five times as much on peasant farms in the past year. Over the past year, which was extremely difficult for a sensitive sector such as livestock breeding, the number of basic types of livestock increased by 1.5 times as much on peasant farms, while it continued to decrease on collective farms. So it is at least premature to talk about reserves being exhausted in the farming sector. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3.

This is its completely "healthy" reaction to the extreme conditions in agriculture at present. Maintaining production, and especially organizing new production, becomes more like a feat in such a situation. The sorest point today is financial survival. For the peasant farms, this is primarily a problem of the availability and accessibility of loan capital. In 1993, short-term loans made up about 56 percent of the peasant farms' production expenditures, and long-term loans made up 58 percent of their capital investments. The granting of credit to the farms has depended almost entirely on state support. Centralized credit resources were provided for them at favorable interest rates and budget funds were allocated for credit guarantees. However, the favorable conditions dwindled from year to year. According to data from the AKKOR [Association of Peasant Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives of Russia], one peasant farm received an average of 30,000 rubles [R] of loan capital in real terms in 1991, R4,500 in 1992, and just R1,000 in 1993. In this case, the credits simply had to be won back. For example, in 1992 the farmers were able to obtain most of the centralized credits allocated for the year in December alone. It has become harder and harder to gain access to long-term loans. Over the past 3 years, the proportion of them in overall credit resources being allocated has been reduced, and no loans for construction were allocated in 1993 at all. The peasant farms' need for long-term loans in 1994 is estimated at R2.1 trillion. This is at a time when the government has planned to allocate R2.6 trillion for the entire agroindustrial complex. How much of this sum will actually be transferred and how much will go to the peasant farms? There has also been considerable difficulty in providing credit on favorable terms. Banks were compensated very late for the difference between the favorable rate and the Central Bank's prime rate. As a result, the banks simply refused to grant loans on favorable terms or made up the difference at the farmers' expense. The decision was made in September 1993 to discontinue extending credit at favorable rates. While before this the peasant farms paid for the credits provided from centralized resources at the rate of 28 percent, this rate jumped up to 213 percent beginning in November 1993, and penalties of up to 420 percent were introduced for failure to pay back the amount owed. By this time, the number of newly established peasant farms fell to its lowest point, where it remained until the end of the year, and the number of farms falling apart began rising quickly. After the extension of credit on favorable terms was abolished, the government promised to introduce alternative measures of support. In particular, farmers were to be granted the right to pay interest on loans received in 1992 and 1993 after the sale of their harvest. This deferment was ultimately granted, but it was extended only to a small proportion of the loans (about 10 to 20 percent), which could not alleviate the farmers' financial situation substantially. Budget appropriations to form the charter capital for peasant farm banks and insurance companies were another measure in the federal program for supporting the peasant farms in 1993. They were planned in the amount of R6 billion last year, but as a result these funds were not allocated at all. Moreover, the peasant farm banks are now in a very difficult situation, since they have not been compensated from the budget for the difference in the interest for farmers' loans in 1994. So the peasant farms find thsmelves in a situation today in which financing sources for development are simply becoming inaccessible, the interest on their debts is eating up current income, and state support is gradually being removed. There is no reason to believe that the situation will change in the foreseeable future, and we can expect the recession in the farm movement to continue.
