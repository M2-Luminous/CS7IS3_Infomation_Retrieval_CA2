This newspaper has published such articles before with the aim of slandering and dismantling the Army. Today's malicious article is false and does not represent the reality in the present process of strengthening and modernizing the Army. We can neither speak nor think about the disarmament of officers. The integration of our Army into the democratic society we are building requires that officers, while in the garrison, be properly equipped. When they leave the barracks or training facilities to go into the city, they are citizens. We are presently working to administer, preserve, nurture, and maintain armament and military equipment according to international standards. This is also an experience of all NATO countries that apply the same practice. The suppositions and insinuations for a drastic shortage and incidents on the part of officers are as provocative as they are malicious. With these lies and slanders, irresponsible correspondents want to create panic, a shadow of doubt, dissatisfaction, and division in the Army and among the people. However, Belgrade's lackeys and their notorious newspaper KOHA JONE, enraged by the achievements of our Army, especially the very successful meeting with a U.S. Defense Department delegation, and, as it seems, financed by Belgrade, are doing everything in their power to reduce the value of the Albanian Army, which is certainly progressing toward its uninterrupted strengthening. The attacks by Enverists, Belgrade's lackeys, and other antinational elements against the Army and national defense will fail. The order in question is based on Law No. 74-96, dated 3 July 1991, Article 4 of the Law on Arms, and Decree No. 74-49, dated 5 January 1991, as well as the order by the general commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic No. 01, dated 13 May 1992, on the improvement of the performance of service in inhabited centers. Based on current law, the defense minister has the right to issue orders and instructions on the maintenance, administration, and preservation of armament and other military equipment. These acts constitute a military secret. The revelation, publication, and propagation of these acts are convicted by law. For this reason, the defense minister has initiated legal proceedings, says the Defense Ministry spokesman.
