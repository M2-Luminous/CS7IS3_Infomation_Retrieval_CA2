[Baudis] Europe is too remote an issue for many French citizens, who feel that this election has nothing to offer them. This is a paradoxical attitude: They bemoan the lack of democracy within the European institutions, and when they are offered a major opportunity to shape these institutions, half of them hesitate to go and vote. I would like our fellow citizens to be aware of the importance of the 12 June vote, a one-round election, if I may point out. Aware and responsible citizens, this is what I hope for, because if we want a European Parliament that pulls its weight vis-a-vis the European Commission and its bureaucracy, people must vote on 12 June, Euro-MP's must be given the legitimacy of the vote. [Portes] If the French seem less interested in the election of 12 June than in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, is this not because politicians themselves are more interested in the presidential election? [Baudis] Indeed, I note that at least five candidates are leading a list in the perspective of the next presidential election, and not with a view to defending their conception of Europe. [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard and [National Front leader] Jean-Marie Le Pen have declared themselves as presidential candidates. As for Jean-Pierre Chevenement [former defense minister], Philippe de Villiers [majority's anti-Maastricht list], and Bernard Tapie [Left Radical Movement], they have obviously been dreaming about the Elysee [office of the president]. [Portes] In your own coalition, several people have also had the impending presidential election in mind. [Baudis] I am not in the running and neither is anyone else on my list. We have only one goal: We want our list, which is the list of the majority and is supported by every single UDF [French Democratic Union] and RPR [Rally for the Republic] official to come in first on 12 June, so as to give as much weight as possible to the majority's European views in the European Parliament. [Portes] Does not the quarrel between supporters and opponents of the Maastricht Treaty still underscore the European debate, both among the Right and the Left? [Portes] This is a thing of the past, and one does not integrate Europe while looking back. The referendum took place in 1992, and the Maastricht Treaty came into force last November. Why reenact a two-year-old debate? Those who envision doing so probably oppose European integration. As for our team, it is open, as is France. It includes yesterday's Maastricht supporters and opponents, united around Europe and in agreement on today's challenges and tomorrow's objectives. One excellent feature of the Maastricht Treaty is that it provides its a review in 1996. Therefore, as soon as the election is over, we shall prepare the changes needed to make Europe more democratic, closer to its citizens, less technocratic, and to improve its decisionmaking capabilities, among other things as a result of the future integration of Austria and the Scandinavian countries.
