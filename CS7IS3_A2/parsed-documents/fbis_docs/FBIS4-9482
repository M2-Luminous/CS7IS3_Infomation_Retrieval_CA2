Asked whether Moravcik's election was in breach of the coalition agreement, Weiss, chairman of the coalition Democratic Left Party (SDL), said the agreement did not suppose the cumulation of political and government posts. DEUS was formed on Saturday by a merger between the Alternative of Political Realism (APR) and the Alliance of Democrats of Slovakia (AD). Moravcik said on his election that in compliance with the DEUS statutes, during his premiership he would be represented as DEUS leader by First Deputy Chairman Milan Knazko.
