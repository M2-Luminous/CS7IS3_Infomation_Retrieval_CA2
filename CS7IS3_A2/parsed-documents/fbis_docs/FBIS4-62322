Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said this to journalists after the meeting with his American counterpart, Warren Christopher. They managed to work out a single position since all the participants -- the heads of the diplomatic departments of the Russian Federation, United States, and the five countries of the European Union -- sensed an objective necessity to work out a joint position. Replying to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Andrey Kozyrev said Russia would inform Belgrade about the ministers' meeting in Geneva. Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian president, will leave for the FRY's capital with this task on 15 May. In its turn, the American side will also take steps to inform the participants in the Bosnian conflict about the results of the meeting. Warren Christopher told journalists that he would meet representatives of Croatia and the Bosnian Government. Russia, the United States, the European Community, and the United Nations "are acting as a united front for the first time", he said. This is "the most significant result of the Geneva meeting."
