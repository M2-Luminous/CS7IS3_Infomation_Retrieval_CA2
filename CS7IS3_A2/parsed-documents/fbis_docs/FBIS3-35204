The unifying and formidable Friday prayers were held in Tehran under the imamate of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the exalted leader of the Islamic revolution, and Tehran's Friday imam, and with a spectacular participation of the fasting and faithful people in serried ranks at Tehran University and its surrounding streets. His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i devoted the first prayer sermon to a discussion about the importance of observing divine piety and its role in a life of faithful human beings and, while calling upon the worshippers to take the opportunity of the blessed month of Ramadan for entering the tremendous realm of piety, said: Piety brings many benefits with it to the life of human beings, including the guarding of self against slips and precipices. Strengthening a spirit of piety brings success for human beings in divine tests and enables them to continue along the path of further strengthening their faith and serving God. Tehran's Friday imam considered the fall of eastern imperialism to have resulted from lack of piety and said: Fall comes after lack of piety and nations devoid of piety will be beset by pride, arrogance, deviation, and destruction. The fact that the powerful nations of the world have been beset by all that at various periods of history demonstrates that all the impious individuals and nations of the world must await such a fall. [passage omitted] The Friday prayer leader of Tehran stressed the widespread currency of words of righteousness in the Islamic country of Iran. He said: The present aura in the country belongs to righteousness. This is because our sovereignty is based on righteousness to which our nation ardently adhere. For this reason, we are not sensitive to the nonsense spoken by the wrong-doers. In the Islamic system, security has been provided for all the members of the society, even for those who are not in agreement with the trend of righteousness. [passage omitted] His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i began the second sermon of the Friday prayers by paying tribute to the Iranian nation for their epic making presence in the 11 February revolution anniversary demonstrations, and considered this move of the people as an important and effective blow to the poisonous propaganda of the enemies of the Islamic Republic of Iran. [Begin Khamene'i recording] I consider it necessary to sincerely thank the great, aware, and vigilant nation of Iran--a nation who appreciates time and place, is fully capable of identifying its enemies, and is always grateful to God for His blessings--for displaying its power and might on 11 February before the eyes of the friends of foes the world over. The huge streets of Tehran, the Azadi Square, and all towns and cities were filled with a massive crowd on that day. This was the case even in those towns which the enemy wants to portray as having disputes with the Islamic system. The serious and resolute faces of the people of these towns were clearly visible. The enemies and the others [as heard] saw that the Iranian nation conducted its movement in such a cohesive manner. [end recording] The leader of Islamic revolution continued his sermons by referring to the hefty budget that the Zionist and arrogant media devote to their attempts to influence the public opinion of the Iranian nation. He said: News agencies which are influenced and guided by the Zionists, as well as a number of foreign radio stations have been trying for a while now to create the illusion that the Iranian people are no longer interested in the revolution and Islam, and the performance of the Islamic republic has led to the weakening of Islam. However, this deceitful ploy is too disgraceful for any one to pay attention to. This is because Islam's growth and magnificence in the world is due to the creation of the Islamic republic. The Friday prayer leader of Tehran then revealed the propaganda ploys of the enemies of Islam and said: They want to induce that the formation of an Islamic government and the delivery of the crushing blow of Islam and the Koran to the enemies has caused Islam harm. However, they are ignorant about Islam. If what the enemies claim had been correct, then the eminent prophet of Islam would not have formed a political entity, and he would not have been involved so many wars. Furthermore, His Holiness 'Ali, may peace be upon him, would not have set out to form a government, and the leaders of the Islamic community during the early years of Islam would have remained in their homes. His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said that the people's magnificent rallies on 11 February humiliated the enemies of Islam. He said: Our enemies saw that the Iranian nation was present on the scene cohesively. Today one cannot find any other nation in the world which is able to mobilize its people in this way to take part in a national and ideological event. [passage omitted] His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said the issue of occupied Palestine is another example of the onslaught by the enemies of Islam. He said: The usurper Israelis have usurped Palestine in full view of the world people and continue to torture, exile, bomb, and execute Palestinians; but the arrogant world, headed by America, condemns the oppressed Palestinians and criticizes their defense of their home. That shows what sort of malevolent new order is ruling the world. The leader of the Islamic revolution referred to the world powers collaborating to destroy Islam. He said: The enemies of Islam have started a dangerous and harsh struggle against Islam. The longer it takes the more they fail, and governments supporting them more scarce. World Muslims should know that Islamic Iran is the point where Islam can say its piece with strength. [passage omitted]
