Northwest China includes Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai Provinces, and the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions, where many people still had a per capita share of less than 200 kg of grain a year and cash income below 200 yuan in the early 1980s, due to historical, natural and economic conditions. During the 1986-1990 period the central government expanded its allocation of funds to help the poor areas, where local governments focused on improving farmland to raise output, moving people from ecologically deteriorated areas to areas with better living conditions, and organizing labor to contract for projects outside, in line with actual conditions. While organizing farmers to undertake farmland capital construction to boost grain output, local governments encouraged local people to grow more cash crops and breed more domestic animals, including sheep and long-haired rabbits, in line with their local conditions and the market needs. Yanan Prefecture, in Shaanxi Province, produced 860 million yuan-worth of tobacco, fruit, sheep and potatoes last year, accounting for two-thirds of its gross agricultural output value. Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai Province, has built four commodity production bases for oil-bearing crops, broad beans, cattle and sheep, and long-haired rabbits respectively; and the poor areas in Gansu Province have set up a number of processing industrial bases for fruit, traditional herbal medicine, carpets and embroidery. A survey shows that Northwest China's provinces and regions have sponsored many technical training courses specially for farmers, and sent agro-technicians to help popularize cultivation under plastic sheeting, intercropping and water-saving irrigation techniques. About 500,000 people living in Xiji, Guyuan and Haiyuan Counties in southern Ningxia and Dingxi County in Gansu Province, where natural conditions are harsh, have been moved to the irrigated areas in the valley of the Yellow River, China's second longest such after the Chang Jiang River, over the past decade. "With government aid, these people settled down in the areas in the first two years and began to make both ends meet in the third year," the paper said. To help people in the remote mountainous areas to live better lives, Haidong Prefectural Government has encouraged local people to set up manufacturing plants outside the prefecture by using local raw materials. So far, the prefecture has 26 such industrial enterprises, which generate a gross output value totalling 40 million yuan a year. In addition, Northwest China's provinces and regions have organized labor forces in the poor villages to carry out labor services in a planned way. Southern Ningxia has sent about 200,000 rural laborers to urban areas to contract for construction and other manual work, and obtained more than 100 million yuan in remittances a year. Farmers in Qinan County, Gansu Province, have set up 53 share- holding co-operative businesses, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has boosted border trade to help poor people in the border areas improve their lives.
