At its federal delegates' conference in Mannheim the party adopted an election program -- with only one vote against -- with which an "ecological and social change in course" in Germany is to be introduced. There was a heated quarrel between the realpolitik wing and the leftists about the future foreign policy course. Finally, the majority affirmed the party's basic pacifist attitude. The delegates approved a motion by the Federal Executive Committee, which came out in favor of a gradual dissolution of the Bundeswehr and of NATO as well as against any German participation in blue- helmet missions. A moderate countermotion by Krista Sager was clearly rejected. As a result, Guenter Verheugen, federal manager of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], accused the Greens in an interview of letting the fundamentalists continue to have the say in the party. A focal issue of the party congress was the economic and social policy. The delegates came out in favor of new ecological taxes, a drastic reduction of work time, and basic care for all needy people. In compensation for the ecological taxes, companies should get subsidies for environmentally friendly investments. With higher taxes on large assets an equalization of burdens, in particular for the benefit of the east, is intended. Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer warned in vain against the demand of getting out of nuclear energy within two years. In practical government work this "immediatism" just leads to disappointed hopes, Fischer said. In asylum policy the motion by representatives of the party leftists, which demanded the retraction of the asylum laws, failed. Lower Saxony's Federal Council Minister Juergen Trittin harshly attacked Wolfgang Schaeuble. Trittin accused the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union group chairman in the Bundestag of having overtaken Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber on the right. At the same time, he accused the SPD in Lower Saxony, where elections will be held on 13 March, of pursuing an election campaign against its own election program: "Anyone who wants to replace Kohl must prevent Schroeder from becoming an absolute ruler in Lower Saxony," Trittin said. At the party congress there was unanimous agreement on striving for a change of power in the coalition with the SPD. The preamble of the program says: "We are ready to contribute ourselves with all our strength to a government coalition, if this promises a serious reform policy. However, there will not be a coalition at any cost," Executive Committee spokesman Ludger Volmer said. On Sunday the delegates recognized the "Green Alternative Youth Alliance," which was founded in January, as the party's youth organization.
