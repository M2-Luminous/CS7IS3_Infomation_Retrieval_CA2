Only three persons survived the 20 February wreck of a ship carrying between 20 and 40 Haitians, according to U.S. authorities. Five bodies, including those of a woman and four children, have been recovered. In a communique, President Aristide, who is in exile in Washington, called on the international community once again to reinforce the sanctions against Haiti to compel the military to leave power. The sanctions are necessary and should have been applied a long time ago, the Haitian president wrote. Those who are supporting democracy in Haiti should show firmness, asserted President Aristide, adding that the authors of the coup d'etat must not be rewarded for barbarous actions.
