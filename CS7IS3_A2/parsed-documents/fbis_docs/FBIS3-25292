At a news conference on 10 February Mr. Bo-Boliko stated: "The PDSC considers this post currently not vacant, and the party is not obsessed by this fact." The opposition press close to Mr. Tshisekedi had accused the PDSC and two other opposition parties belonging to the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition [USOR] of "conspiring" against Mr. Tshisekedi. USOR has so far considered Mr. Tshisekedi the legitimate prime minister through his election by the Sovereign National Conference.
