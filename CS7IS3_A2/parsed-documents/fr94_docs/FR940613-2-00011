FR940613-2-00011 FR940613-2-00005 Comment: The draft language of the Policy Guidance itself does not clearly specify that the procedures apply only to consistency reviews under section 307(c)(1) of the CZMA and other state coastal management decisions not now covered by an existing public participation procedure, although that fact is stated in the discussion preceding the guidance. Response: NOAA concurs and has added specific language in the guidance to clarify this point. Comment: Several states expressed concern that implementing this guidance will add to the state's administrative costs. Response: NOAA is sensitive to this issue and structured the guidance to provide coastal states with a range options for implementing the requirement in a cost-effective manner. Comment: NOAA should change the language under (a)(1) to say that ``States must issue, or cause to be issued, public notice *␣*␣*''. Response: Recognizing that this comment is consistent with the provision allowing for joint public notice with Federal agencies, NOAA has clarified this point in the final guidance. Comment: The use of the word ``guidance'' coupled with the use of mandatory terms such as ``must'', ``mandatory'', and ``at a minimum'' may be confusing. Response: This guidance represents NOAA's interpretation of the statutory requirement by outlining what it considers to be effective public public participation. NOAA recognizes that the guidance itself is not the enforceable policy. Rather, the obligation of coastal states to comply rests in the language of section 306(d)(14). V. Guidance to Implement CZMA Section 306(d)(14) Section 306(d)(14) imposes a new requirement for effective public participation only on the state's review of Federal agency consistency determinations for direct Federal activities under section 307(c)(1) of the CZMA and any other state coastal management decisions not now covered by an existing public participation procedure. For applications under state general permits, public participation in the review of administrative procedures or regulations allowing for a general determination of consistency will satisfy the public participation requirement. The public should have an opportunity to comment on a project's relationship with the state coastal management program's goals and policies. NOAA interprets the statute to require the following: (a) States must provide timely public notice. (1) States must issue, or cause to be issued, public notice at the earliest practicable time after the application and/or consistency determination has been received by the lead state coastal management agency, except in cases where earlier public notice on the consistency determinations by the relevant Federal agency meets OCRM's standards for acceptable public notice listed below. (2) A public comment period must be provided. The length of the comment period may vary in accordance with state or Federal law, and as appropriate for the type of authorization involved. However, the comment period must be sufficient to give the public a meaningful opportunity to develop and provide comments. (b) Public participation, at a minimum, must consist of written public notice and solicitation of public comments. Provision for a public hearing or meeting may also be provided. If a state chooses to use public hearings or public meetings to provide for effective public participation, such hearings or meetings should be held in a location accessible to most interested or affected parties to the maximum extent possible. The written public notice must: (1) specify that the proposed activity is subject to review for consistency uunder the policies of the state coastal management program; (2) provide sufficient information to serve as a basis for meaningful comment; (3) specify a source for additional information; and (4) specify a contact for submitting comments to the state coastal management program. (c) At a minimum, the public notice must be provided in the area(s) of the coastal zone likely to be affected by the activity. Procedural options that may be used include, but are not limited to, the options listed below.The use of one or more of the following must also conform with the guidelines set forth in (a) and (b) above. (1) public notice through an official state gazette; (2) public notice through a local newspaper serving areas of coastal zone likely to be affected by the activity; (3) public notice through individual state mailings; (4) public notice through a state coastal zone management newsletter; (5) arrangements between a state coastal management program and appropriate Federal agencies for joint public notice to be provided by the state and Federal agency where direct Federal activities under section 307(c)(1) are involved OCRM also encourages other streamlined procedures for providing public participation. Federal agency notice of a proposed activity would suffice if it meets the guidelines set forth in (a) and (b) above. W.
