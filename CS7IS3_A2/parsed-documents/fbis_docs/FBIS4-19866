[Correspondent] You are well aware that you are among those whom your opponents love the least. Is your election a "slap in the face" to the majority? [Violante] As a lower house deputy speaker, it is not my task to lead or manage the opposition, but to cooperate with the house speaker for institutional reasons. In this transitional stage in politics, the institutions must be solid. If they are rickety, the transition may become painful, and it may become harmful too. [Correspondent] What is your opinion of the new speaker [Irene Pivetti]? [Violante] I spoke to her for the first time when she was elected. Yesterday morning, before the election of the speaker's office staff, I went to pay my respects to her, as is my duty. The chosen speaker is the speaker of the house as a whole, and thereby loses any partisan characteristics. I am sure that Deputy Pivetti also will fulfill this role. [Correspondent] Let us speak of the progressives. There is a great turmoil at grassroots level, a powerful thrust toward unity.... [Violante] New developments are taking place within the Left. The challenge lies in whether we will be able to keep pace with them, so as to channel them into a government proposal. Two days ago, in the Chamber of Deputies, the great majority of the progressives elected a cultured man with political experience, but one who is certainly a newcomer, as their floor leader: Luigi Berlinguer. [Correspondent] The parties are misfiring. Do you think that the parliamentary group will become the leading center of progressive politics? [Violante] I believe that parliament will become a leading center of progressive politics, but not the only one. There is the problem of building progressive politics, as well as the problem of social opposition, which must be tackled by the parties. We must also wage a great cultural battle. The Right waged such a cultural battle, and it won because it was able to convey its views into public opinion. [Correspondent] You do not often speak of your own party, the PDS. A great debate is now taking place on the leadership. What do you make of it? [Violante] I believe that there are no leaders appointed in heaven. Besides, look at developments. The country's leadership has been taken over by a force that did not even exist three months ago. There are many in the PDS who are qualified to take over the leadership. But the real problem within the PDS lies in building a leading group which, overall, can respond to the pressing need for novelty. A secretary who cannot rely on a good leading group can do very little on his own. This problem is also apparent at the local federation level. I see an extraordinary potential, for example, in the Left's youth. [Correspondent] Does leadership of the PDS mean the same thing as progressive leadership? [Violante] No. They are not one and the same thing today. And I believe that they will not be for a long time to come, not until we can build a progressive party for government. The PDS should not pose the leadership problem in terms of the leadership of the progressive coalition as a whole. They are two different things. [Correspondent] Like [PDS Secretary] Occhetto and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema.... [Violante] The congress will be held in the fall. We must promote a great, honest, and serious debate. It would be ruinous to reduce this to a choice between two people, to a problem of succession to the leadership.
