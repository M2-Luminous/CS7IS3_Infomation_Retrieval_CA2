Chabahar Port nowadays has a new look. The rapid population growth and the expansion of urban services, combined with fundamental investments, indicate a bright future for this port. Chabahar Port, on the shores of the Sea of Oman, with a favorable location and connected to the mainland, is considered the third free port of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and in terms of space and resources is the best transit center for goods from the sea to Central Asia and Afghanistan. High-quality roads have made it possible for goods coming in on ships to be transported over land in the shortest possible time to their destiny of the republic to the north of our country. For this reason, on the invitation of the public relations office of the Ports and Shipping Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran, a number of media representatives visited the ports in this region, the results of which you will read below. According to the correspondent of the Economic Division of JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, Mr. Habibollah Ra'ufi, the director general of the office of Ports and Shipping of the Province of Sistan Va Baluchestan, at a gathering of media reporters who had traveled to Chabahar, announced that 98 percent of the activities of Chabahar Port have been given to the private sector and are only supervised by the Central Office of Ports and Shipping of this province. He said: In connection with the policy of reducing imports, in the nine months of this year, the amount of unloading of goods in Chabahar Port has decreased by 40 percent compared to a similar period last year. He said: Before the revolution the Chabahar region was a deprived village with a population of 5,000 and lacked asphalted roads and urban services. After the start of the port building, fishing, and multipurpose dock projects, facilities such as desalination and naval communications systems were created, and at the preset this port has a population of 50,000 people. Mr. Ra'ufi pointed out: In the province of Sistan Va Baluchestan, there are about 300 km of sea borders. The first port created in Chabahar was the "Martyr Beheshti Port," which is southwest of the city, and its dock was rapidly installed in nine months in 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] and put into operation. The above-mentioned dock is 1 km from the shore with docking stations each 150 meters long for ships up to a capacity of 25,000 tons and is the central dock in this region. He added: The area and the coastal facilities of Martyr Beheshti Dock take up a total of 2,000 hectares[ha], of which 36 ha are open warehouses and 18,000 ha covered warehouses. Ra'ufi mentioned the total cost of the building of the Martyr Beheshti Port dock at $27 million in foreign currency and 1 billion in rials and said: In this port, five desalination machines have been built, the capacity of each of which is 500 cubic meters, a total of 2,500 cubic meters per day. If more are needed in the future, it can be expanded by up to 10 machines. Also, because of these facilities (desalination) in the port, we are able to provide water needed by the transit ships. The cost of the desalination machines is 30 million DM in foreign currency and 18 million tomans in rials, which has all been done by the private sector. Concerning the operation of the nine months of this year of the ports and shipping of the province of Sistan Va Baluchestan, Mr. Ra'ufi said: From Farvardin [21 March-20 April] to the end of Azar this year [21 December 1993], 32 ships have entered Chabahar Port and about 650,000 tons of goods unloaded. Of this amount, 400,000 tons were dry goods, and the remaining 250,000 tons were oil products. The director-general of ports and shipping of Sistan Va Baluchestan said concerning the future programs of Martyr Beheshti Port: We have a large program planned for this port. For example, the wave-breaker project of this port, at 3 km in length with 12 dock stations, the installation of which will start in one month by Iranian experts and engineers and is projected to take five years. He mentioned its weather as one of the advantages of this port, which is the warmest in the country in winter and the coolest in summer. The director-general of ports and shipping of the province of Sistan Va Baluchestan announced that if the problem of goods transit is resolved in this region, this port will grow and said: If more facilities, such as customs exemptions, etc., are provided in this port for ships, the ships will be more willing to come to this region. Also, given the low cost of labor in this region, investors can invest in native industries, such as fishing, which in addition to creating jobs will also affect exports. It is noteworthy that during the stay of the representatives of the media, one ship with a Cypriot flag and Cuban crew, which carried 14,000 tons of sugar purchased by the Islamic Republic from Brazil, docked at the Martyr Beheshti dock to unload and was immediately unloaded by the personnel of the port and sent in trailers to various centers of the country, including sugar factories. This report also indicates: The representatives of the media visited the nonprofit girls school complex of Martyr Beheshti (Hadaf), which has been built by the Central Office of Ports and Shipping of the province of Sistan and Baluchestan, at the levels of preschool, elementary school, middle school, and high school. This school has a staff of 20, and at the levels of preschool, elementary school, and middle school, 65, 120, and 45 students, respectively, are studying. Students in this school take part in such extracurricular activities as sewing, computers, typing, reading and recitation of the Koran, and calligraphy. The principal of the Martyr Beheshti Girls Schools (Hadaf), referring to the long distance and lack of housing and resources of the teachers and personnel of this educational center, expressed hope that next year teacher training school graduates of the province will be used in teaching.
