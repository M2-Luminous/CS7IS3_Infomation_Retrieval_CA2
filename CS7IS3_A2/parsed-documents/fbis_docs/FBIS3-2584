Following is the full text of the statement: On March 9, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten tabled the remaining parts of his political reform bill to the Legislative Council for the first reading. This is yet another deliberate violation by the British Hong Kong authorities of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and earlier agreements and understandings reached between China and Britain, and another demonstration of the British Hong Kong authorities' policy of confrontation with China. We hereby issue our solemn statement as follows: 1. The talks on the arrangement of the 1994-95 election of Hong Kong between the Governments of China and Britain have terminated because the British side unilaterally tabled to the Legislative Council its political reform bill that violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law and agreements and understandings reached by the two sides, thereby disrupting the talks completely. The three-tier legislative structure that the British Hong Kong authorities set up according to its political reform bill naturally comes to an end by June 30, 1997. Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National Committee fully support relevant declarations and stand of the Chinese Government pertaining to the establishment of the first government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its three-tier legislative structure on July 1, 1997 in accordance with the Basic Law and relevant resolutions of the National People's Congress (NPC). 2. We hereby ask the central government to accelerate preparation work for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, speed up work pace and make all necessary preparations so as to ensure a smooth transfer of Hong Kong sovereignty and maintain its stability and prosperity.
