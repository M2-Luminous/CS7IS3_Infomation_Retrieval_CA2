President Venetiaan said Wednesday evening in a speech to the National Assembly (Parliament) that "the government and the Surinamese people cannot allow themselves to be blackmailed." On Wednesday afternoon, the occupiers of the hydroelectric power station issued a fresh ultimatum to the government in Paramaribo, with a final deadline that will run out at 0300 GMT on Thursday morning (midnight in Suriname). An anonymous commander in chief of the Suriname Liberation Front (SLF) declared that President Venetiaan must send his ministers back home. If Venetiaan does not do so, then "Paramaribo will experience further problems," the spokesman for the occupiers said. "We cannot tolerate such useless discussions while the population is fighting its way through the problems of the economic crisis," he said. However, Venetiaan let it be known that he would not accede to any of the demands made by the occupiers. The president opted for a dialogue with those responsible for the action and said he wanted to resolve the matter "quickly without a great show." However, he did not rule out the use of force. "The Netherlands would take any Surinamese request for assistance seriously," Netherlands Foreign Minister Kooijmans said while speaking in Prague in reaction to the events in Suriname. Paramaribo is still struggling with a limited power supply. On Wednesday, the SLF shut down three of the six turbines at the Afobaka hydroelectric power station, causing the 200,000 inhabitants of the Surinamese capital to lose three-fourths of their electricity.
