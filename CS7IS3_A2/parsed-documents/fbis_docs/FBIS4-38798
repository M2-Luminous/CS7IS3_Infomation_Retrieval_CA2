President Kim, accompanied by First Lady Son Myong-sun aboard a Korean Air chartered plane, was welcomed by the Russian Government protocol officer and Korean Ambassador to Moscow Kim Suk-kyu. The presidential plane touched down at 3:30 PM (Moscow time) and the chief executive showed no signs of fatigue despite the 10 and a half-hour flight from Seoul. He waved at the welcoming crowd as he came down the ramp. Kim was then received by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets and Russian Ambassador to Seoul Georgiy Kunadze before reviewing an honor guard and saluting the two countries' flags as their national anthems were played. After exchanging greetings with Vice Foreign Minister Alexandr Panov and other Russian Government leaders, the Kims received bouquets of flowers from the children of Korean residents -- Shin Yong-un and Kim Pyong-su -- and shook hands with many ethnic Koreans who had come out to welcome them. -- Shortly after his chartered plane took off from Seoul Airport, President Kim changed into causal attire and, in a relaxed mood, entered the sections where members of the official entourage and the press corps were sitting and shook hands with each of them. When a reporter reminded him that many leaders of opposition parties, including chairman Yi Ki-taek of the Democratic Party, had come out to Seoul Airport to see him off, the president quipped: "Aren't all trying to engage in big-time politics?" As the plane flew through Japanese air space, Kim summoned Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and other members of the official entourage to his "office in the air" and had a brief chat. At the meeting, Gen. Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the president that because of North Korea, the plane had to go to Khabarovsk via Niigata, taking an extra two hours. "We should be able to fly directly (to Khabarosvk) soon," Kim said, obviously alluding to a time when the country is unified and airlines can fly directly to anywhere from Seoul. -- During the brief meeting with his official entourage, Kim remembered that the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee was to hold a special session on the North Korean nuclear row. Talking to Rep. Chong Chae-mun, chairman of the committee, the president asked jokingly: "Now that you are here, who is going to preside over the session?" "(The committee's) manager Rep. Kang Shin-cho can do that," Chong replied, seriously but with a smile.
