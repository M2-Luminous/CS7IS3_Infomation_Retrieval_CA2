HZDS Deputy Chairman Sergej Kozlik said this after today's joint session of the HZDS and SNS parliamentary groups in Bratislava. At the same time, he said that they would not exclude an agreement with the SDL with regard to stabilizing the Cabinet for a certain limited period or until the elections, regardless of whom the HZDS was in coalition. Answering a question regarding whether a cancellation of the coalition agreement with the SNS and concluding a new coalition with the SDL are being considered, Kozlik said that they had not looked at this issue from this point of view. In this context, Miloslav Kona, chairman of the SNS parliamentary group, expressed the conviction that the SDL would change its stance on refusing a coalition with the SNS while its chairman is Jan Slota. Commenting on the alleged offer of the presidential post to the SDL by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, Kozlik explained that, during a free debate outside the framework of the official HZDS-SDL talks, it had been noted that it would not be impossible for the HZDS to imagine an SDL candidate for the presidential post. However, this was not discussed as an actual offer. The parliamentary groups of the coalition parties also discussed individual points of the agenda of the session of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, which will open on 9 March.
