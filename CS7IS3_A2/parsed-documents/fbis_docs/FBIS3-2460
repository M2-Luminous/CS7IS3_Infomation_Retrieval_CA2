In his speech, Comrade Hu Jintao first affirmed the achievements scored by DANGJIAN YANJIU magazine and noted: Since its inception five years ago, DANGJIAN YANJIU has been run efficiently and has played an important role in research and publicity regarding party building theory, thanks to the party Central Committee's concern, the solicitude and guidance of veteran comrades, and the support and assistance of people engaged in party building around the country. Hu Jintao said emphatically: The key to developing the favorable situation further and to constantly advancing the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics lies in building our party well. During the new historical period, we have amassed a wealth of useful experiences in party building but are also confronted with many new circumstances and problems. We should understand the status and role of party building from the vantage point of the general international and domestic situation, long-term interests, and the future. We should study and solve new party- building tasks; boldly carry out practical work and explorations; sum up the ingenious efforts of people and grass-roots units on a timely basis; strengthen all facets of party building ideologically, organizationally, and in terms of the work style; further increase the rallying power, appeal, and fighting capacity of party organizations at all levels; and give greater scope to the party's role as a leadership core. Hu Jintao expressed the hope that all comrades at the office in charge of party building under the CPC Central Committee's Organization Department and at the DANGJIAN YANJIU publishing house would carry on their efforts, sum up their experiences, build upon their achievements, uphold the goal of publishing the magazine, maintain the magazine's distinctive features, and make fresh contributions to further strengthening research and publicity regarding party building theory. At the forum, Zhao Zongnai, deputy director of the CPC Central Committee's Organization Department, urged people engaged in party building to gain a profound understanding of the guidelines of the party Central Committee's directive on strengthening party building, strive to integrate theory with practice, serve the party's basic line, and make DANGJIAN YANJIU magazine an even greater success. Comrades in charge of relevant departments present at the forum included Xu Weicheng, Zhang Quanjing, Zheng Keyang, Zhang Yunsheng, and You Lin. Veteran comrades invited to the forum included Chen Yeping, Guo Feng, Gao Yang, Li Lian, Zeng Zhi, and Zhou Yi.
