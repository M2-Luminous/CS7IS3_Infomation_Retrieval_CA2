Will all this affect Hungary's military role in the Yugoslav crisis? [Deak] Russia has always been and will continue to be a great military power. We soldiers can only rejoice that the air attack in Bosnia failed to materialize and that the two previously opposing great military powers are now engaged in dialogue. This has also been noticeable from a military viewpoint lately and it has perhaps contributed to easing the Yugoslav tension. Our crisis prevention and crisis management concepts were approved by our prime minister and president at the end of 1991, and at the end of 1993, starting with the defense law and the constitutional modifications, the president again approved the concepts presented by Prime Minister Boross. The essence of our concept is that the Hungarian Republic should stay away from the Yugoslav conflict. Such a position was reaffirmed after Yugoslav bombs were dropped at Barcs in November 1991. Since then, we have maintained a steady, correct, but distanced contact with both the Yugoslav and Croatian military leadership; we do not yet have Bosnian contacts. The most tense period was perhaps the second half of 1991 and the first half of 1992, when we had to apply a larger number of troops and expenses to strengthen our air defense and to deploy radar units. There is no direct threat on our borders now. Until the the NATO deadline expired, we strengthened our preparedness. Our air force units are on constant alert, and we can even increase this alert in tenser periods by increasing the level of combat readiness of one or two aircraft. Regarding our ground forces we will strengthen the surveillance units and services at some bases if necessary, and we will increase the efficiency of leadership; this means that, if necessary, we will keep the individual operational groups within individual headquarters. Obviously, it is important to have cooperation and contacts with the countries in question, including Yugoslavia. [Peto] Would the Hungarian military approach to the Yugoslav crisis have been different if NATO had shown greater readiness to accept the Hungarian request to join the organization? [Deak] This is a political question, not a military one. From a military viewpoint, we can only advise our state leaders to proceed from the interests of our small country. [Peto] In one of your recent statements you said that the Hungarian officers are not leftist in their political orientation. How can one draw this conclusion in the Hungarian Army, which is so sensitive about its apolitical character? [Deak] In accordance with the new defense law, the officer corps of the Hungarian Army cannot carry out party policy activity, and officers cannot be members of a political party. This was the desire of most of our officers. The Hungarian officers are neither leftist nor rightist in orientation; they are Hungarian military officers. Regarding the composition of our officer corps, it is quite different from the eight or 10 years ago. At the moment, there are 13,500 officers serving in the Hungarian Army; some 5,500 have retired, moved into the reserves, or taken up a different job since the change of regime. There has been a complete change of personnel in army headquarters, and the heads of main army groups and heads of army groups today are people who did not serve in these positions before 1989. Among the middle-level commanding officers, no one served as army corps commander or brigadier general before. And some of the old political officers left the army and some of them are working in various professional positions. The lieutenants and first lieutenants who are coming into the service now began their military studies in 1989. I do not even want to know who means what by leftist or rightist; it is pointless to deal with this issue in the army. I do not believe that our officers think about their political affiliations. It is another matter that the officers are rather sensitive socially. This is understandable when you consider that a lieutenant's pay is about 17,000-18,000 forints. [Peto] However, many people think that the Hungarian army officers have been given a strong ideological training. [Deak] One can make someone hate ideology through training. Otto Habsburg said that he has travelled a lot throughout the world and when he met an anti-Soviet man in Africa, the man probably graduated from Lumumba University in Moscow; if someone does not like the Americans, he probably studied in America. Besides, the number of hours dedicated to the study of Marxism-Leninism at the military academies fell well short of the number of similar hours in the civilian universities. In my opinion, most officers have always served in the army because they liked being soldiers, and party membership was almost an automatic prerequisite for this job. That time is past. We did not know the situation and we did not have information. If I want to describe things simply and shortly, I must say that our eyes were opened too late. We lived in isolation, in army barracks and in housing developments, and we read the official newspapers; people who had a different television aerial and could watch a different program came under special surveillance. After all, everyone made sure they kept the rules of the game if they wanted to stay in the army. [Peto] In 1989 the army was separated from the Defense Ministry in order to formalize its apolitical character. With the new defense law, this situation has been practically reversed: the defense minister has the right to give orders to the army commander. And the minister has just become a party chairman and the Defense Ministry public administration state secretary is also the military expert of the same party; and the same party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], provides the political secretary too. One cannot exclude the possibility that, after the elections, the Defense Ministry will come under similarly strong control of another party. Do you think that, by this, the army has become an instrument of party interests and its character as a national institution has ceased? [Deak] We are completely independent of the parties, and we want to stay independent. I must say that the separation of the Defense Ministry and Army Headquarters in 1989 was done in a very brutal way. A lot of administrative and ministerial tasks remained with army headquarters. On the basis of the new defense law, the army is controlled from various sides: the president of the republic, Parliament, the government, and the minister. Without going into detail, I must conclude that the authority of both president and Parliament has become stronger. As he himself used to say, on entering the ministry building, the minister ceases to be a party man, and the army commander continues to have his former authority. The army is led by its commander. The ruling defense minister can only give orders to the army commander, and he can only ask for a report from the army commander. Any order has legal consequences, and this means that an order can only be issued on something that has legal conditions. The essential thing is that the defense minister manages his ministry on the basis of the law and regulations; he must accept responsibility for the budget and supplying the army, and he must supervise distribution and consumption; the ministry is also the army's legal representative, but the minister is not a commander. This is the difference compared with the old ways. The administrative state secretary cannot have any control whatever over the army and its headquarters. [Peto] In any case, regarding the legal status of the state secretaries, the law says that the professional activity of the ministry is directed by the administrative state secretary, although some of the military leadership's tasks have been placed under the ministry's control. [Deak] The Defense Ministry will most probably be a special ministry. The bloc within the ministry that will make up the country's actual military leadership will have to fulfill at least three tasks, namely to coordinate the military professional parts of the ministry, carry out the classic strategic and tactical planning activities of headquarters, and operate as a military command. The aforementioned tasks of the state secretary cannot apply to the military bloc in the ministry. [Peto] At your parliamentary hearing, you said that it was not a good idea to include elements of an economic organization in the defense budget. What do you think would be the right thing, and what can be done with the funds available? [Deak] We are in a very difficult situation. For us to be free of economic difficulties, our budget would neet to be a few billion forints bigger. The budget envisages a compulsory income of 8 billion forints for us, but presumably we will not be able to fulfill this because no one wants to buy our deserted barracks and we have no weapons to sell. [Peto] Thinking of the Lupis [investment] scandal, the circulation of money does not seem to be a definitely military virtue. [Deak] The army should definitely keep away from such activity. Even if it happens at other ministries, the Hungarian Army should not be obliged to generate income. The budget should cover our expenses! Maintaining the technical level of our equipment is at least as important as providing housing, clothing, food, and training for our soldiers. Without the latter, lives could be endangered. We have often declared our priorities: air defense, leadership, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare. In addition, we have tasks originating from the recent partnership for peace program and peacekeeping activities. According to the new budget, we can spend 160-170 forints a day on food, but the soldiers have to be housed and given books to read, television to watch and tape recorders, as well as training. One cannot stress enough the importance of training, and all this costs a lot of money. For example, this year we cannot take our aircraft to the Baltic Sea to shoot live ammunition because we do not have the necessary 200 million forints. For example, a small portable air-defense missile costs 800,000 forints. Of course, it would be cheaper to train on simulators in the long run, but these simulators also have to be purchased, and they are very expensive too. A tank simulator costs 30 million forints, and an anti-armor missile costs more than 100,000 forints. But let me not only complain: A pilot flies 80 hours a year, and this is more than in any country in our neighborhood; we are training the MIG-20 squadron and placing it in operation; we carry out subunit exercises with live ammunition too; and we are continuing to train of commanders. I find the battalion- level exercises very important, but all this costs a lot of money and we are using our reserves. As the State Auditing Office showed us, we must reexamine our budget and administrative systems. Besides, any activity that has no connection with military life is quite alien to me. In any case, I hope the recent financial affair was a big lesson, and the consequences must be born by the relevant people.
