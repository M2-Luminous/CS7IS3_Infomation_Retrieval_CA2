The plan is the latest in a series to bring China's foreign trade regime in line with the standards of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), said the trade official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. About 50 import items are currently subject to quotas or require licences, he said at the China Business Summit. Most of them are capital goods including 18 electronic and machinery products. China had formerly promised it would cut the number of products needing import licences by at least two-thirds to pave the way for its reentry into GATT. The pledge yesterday was another signal that the country is intensifying its efforts to resume its contracting party status in GATT. China hopes to rejoin within the next two years and become a founding member of the World Trade Body (WTO), the international free trade organization that will replace GATT when the final package from the Uruguay Round trade talks takes effect. Gu Yongjiang, Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and China's chief GATT negotiator, is to lead a high- level government delegation to Morocco next month to sign the Uruguay Round package. As a full-time participant in the Uruguay talks, which started in 1986, China has made concessions in agriculture, services, and other sectors. GATT demands that member nations reduce nontariff measures, like import licences or quotas, to the lowest possible level. The government has agreed to slowly reduce its import restrictions during its transition from a planned to a market economy. If China rejoins GATT it will be allowed a transition period to meet all the requirements. In a related move, the trade official said the number of export items under quota control has been reduced. China now requires licences for 114 export products, compared with 235 in 1992. In other words, only 30 percent of China's export products need licences. And about 38 export items such as oil and cotton cloth face quota restrictions. The amount of these products companies could export was decided by administrative orders until this year when an open bidding system started. The first bidding for 13 export items was held on March 18. And the trade official said the government plans to allow more companies to bid for exports. But he said the move would "take time," noting that certain export products like grain and oil are still under tight control. Chinese economists have said reduction of quotas and re-entry into GATT will cause Chinese imports to rise. On the one hand this will stimulate the country's foreign trade. But on the other it will increase the pressure on Chinese enterprises as the market will be flooded with foreign-made goods. Imports last year rose 29 percent to $103.9 billion. And it is estimated that they will increase to $402 billion by 2004. China has also promised to cut its tariffs by 40 percent in the near future. The country has already reduced tariffs by 19 percent since 1986 when it first applied to rejoin GATT. The China Business Summit was organized by the Institute of International Trade Research under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Singapore's Institute for International Research.
