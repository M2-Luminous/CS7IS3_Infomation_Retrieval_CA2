The minister of information, culture, and coordination informs the nation that following approaches made by Haitian Foreign Minister Dr. Charles Antony David, the agreement was signed in Italy on 27 May 1994 between the representatives of the provisional government of Haiti and the state of the Vatican. The terms of the agreement are that Haiti will receive 75 thousands metric tonnes of hard wheat worth $32 million. The Ministry of Information note asserts that Judge Emile Jonassaint, provisional president of the Republic, putting himself in the role of the interpreter of the entire Haitian people who are subjected to a criminal embargo and an unjustified blockade, thanked the state of the Vatican and the Holy Father John Paul II for the great understanding and solicitude. At a time when the international community, practicing systematic disinformation, misrepresents the Haitian realities and shows a total misunderstanding of the drama that the Haitian population faces, the generous gesture of the Vatican comforts us and confirms for us the permanence of the Christian values of truth, honesty, and justice, continues the note from the Ministry of Information. The note adds in conclusion that the Haitian people will always remember gratefully that in the horrifying agony that has fallen on the country -- on Haitian men, women, children, and elders -- the state of the Vatican offered its hand in order to relieve their material and moral sufferings and allowing them to survive with dignity.
