We are meeting just four months and a week after coming here in your company, to bid farewell to President Ndadaye, his aides and other friends who were killed during the events of 21 October 1993. [passage omitted] President of the Republic, Cyprien Ntaryamira, all Burundians are currently crying because of you. You leave us at a time when we hoped to get a lot from you. Who could have thought that the plane you travelled on when you were trying to reach your country as soon as possible could have killed you. Now you are dead. You left this world on 6 April 1994. You died outside the country. Nobody has seen you since or heard you talking. You left this world without quarreling with anybody. Burundians are also biding farewell to Ministers Ciza Bernard and Cyriaque Simbizi who were traveling with you. They died together with you. We are not aware of the content of your last conversation. But what we do know is that Burundi has lost men, wise men, who only dreamed of fighting and strengthening peace for freedom, democratic rule, and development for all Burundians. Let the Almighty welcome you in his kingdom and give you an everlasting life. There is no doubt about this. Our prayers will be accepted because neither you, the head of state, nor Ministers Ciza and Simbizi, did wrong to anyone. In the event of you having wronged any Burundian or foreigner, we join you to ask for forgiveness. Burundians, this is the second time that you lose a head of state in not more than six months. Some think that God has let us down. Others say that God may be testing us. Still others say this is the pain felt by a mother while giving birth to a baby. Here in Burundi, we are looking for a good path that can help us release ourselves from the ropes of divisionism in our country. Looking at it, none of the above comments are wrong. Our country is going through a difficult time. It is therefore necessary that Burundians unite, so that Hutus, Tutsis, and Twas know that they are brothers; so that they unite to build a new Burundi, a peaceful Burundi in which justice and development prevails for all; so that the peace prevailing in Burundi will also spread to the whole of our region.
