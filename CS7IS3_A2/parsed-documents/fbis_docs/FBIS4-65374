This plan is expected to be submitted after the UN secretary general submits his report to the Security Council. Mikhailidhis said that expert legal advice was sought in the preparation of this report. He added that apart from the ideas that are already included in it, the action plan should be completed in a substantive manner and should include issues that will arise after Butrus-Ghali submits his report. The foreign minister emphasized that the Greek Cypriot side's position stresses that the Security Council must examine ways to change the current unacceptable status quo and create prerequisites for a substantive dialogue.
