The hospital has an internal treatment department, a surgical department, a pediatric department and other specialized departments equipped with modern medical facilities, a laboratory, a dispensary and sick wards. Doctors take charge of all people under the section doctor system. Doctors frequently call at farmers' houses to prevent a disease and take measure for patients. As soon as children were born they are under the care of doctors and undergo regular medical examination, preventive inoculations and other systematic medical care. The hospital has created thousands of acres of herb fields, produced different tonics to supply them to people. Before the liberation of the country, Migam-ri was a place far behind from modern civilization. In those days there was no doctor. Endemic disease and other contagious diseases took a heavy toll of lives. But this has become the past thing forever. Today Migam-ri has turned into a paradise of longevity where all the farmers are leading a happy and civilized life in good health. This represents all the rural villages of prospering Korea. The policy of turning ri clinics into hospitals put forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song at the fifth congress of the Workers' Party of Korea (November 1970) was implemented across the country during the six-year plan. There are hospitals and medical networks with modern medical equipment and apparatuses in all places, a solitary islet as well as a mountainous village, where the people live and they protect the health of the people.
