FR941128-0-00006 FR941128-0-00002 2. Civil Penalty Adjustment Factors * * * * * (b) Corrective action. A civil penalty for violations involving discrimination should normally only be mitigated if the licensee takes prompt, comprehensive corrective action that (1) addresses the broader environment for raising safety concerns in the work place, and (2) provides a remedy for the particular discrimination at issue. * * * * * VII. Exercise of Discretion * * * * * B. Mitigation of Enforcement Sanction * * * * * (7) Enforcement discretion may be exercised for discrimination cases where a licensee who, without the need for government intervention, identifies an issue of discrimination and takes prompt, comprehensive, and effective corrective action to address both the particular situation and the overall work environment for raising safety concerns. Similarly, enforcement may not be warranted where a complaint is filed with the Department of Labor (DOL) under Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1994, as amended, but the licensee settles the matter before the DOL makes an initial finding of discrimination and addresses the overall work environment. Alternatively, if a finding of discrimination is made, the licensee may choose to settle the case before the evidentiary hearing begins. In such cases, the NRC may exercise its discretion not to take enforcement action when the licensee has addressed the overall work environment for raising safety concerns and has publicized that a complaint of discrimination for engaging in protected activity was made to the DOL, that the matter was settled to the satisfaction of the employee (the terms of the specific settlement agreement need not be posted), and that, if the DOL Area Office found discrimination, the licensee has taken action to positively reemphasize that discrimination will not be tolerated. Similarly, the NRC may refrain from taking enforcement action if a licensee settles a matter promptly after a person comes to the NRC without going to the DOL. Such discretion would normally not be exercised in cases in which the licensee does not appropriately address the overall work environment ( e.g. , by using training, postings, revised policies or procedures, any necessary disciplinary action, etc., to communicate its policy against discrimination) or in cases that involve: allegations of discrimination as a result of providing information directly to the NRC, allegations of discrimination caused by a manager above first-line supervisor (consistent with current Enforcement Policy classification of Severity Level I or II violations), allegations of discrimination where a history of findings of discrimination (by the DOL or the NRC) or settlements suggests a programmatic rather than an isolated discrimination problem, or allegations of discrimination which appear particularly blatant or egregious. * * * * * Supplement VII_Miscellaneous Matters B. Severity Level II_Violations involving for example: * * * * * 7. A failure to take reasonable action when observed behavior within the protected area or credible information concerning activities within the protected area indicates possible unfitness for duty based on drug or alcohol use; 8. A deliberate failure of the licensee's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to notify licensee's management when EAP's staff is aware that an individual's condition may adversely affect safety related activities; or 9. The failure of licensee management to take effective action in correcting a hostile work environment. C. Severity Level III_Violations involving for example: * * * * * 8. A failure to assure, as required, that contractors or vendors have an effective fitness-for-duty program; 9. A breakdown in the fitness for duty program involving a number of violations of the basic elements of the fitness-for-duty program that collectively reflect a significant lack of attention or carelessness towards meeting the objectives of 10 CFR 26.10; or 10. Threats of discrimination or restrictive agreements which are violations under NRC regulations such as 10 CFR 50.7(f). D. Severity Level IV - Violations involving for example: * * * * * 4. Isolated failures to meet basic elements of the fitness-for-duty program not involving a Severity Level I, II, or III violation; 5. A failure to report acts of licensed operators or supervisors pursuant to 10 CFR 26.73; or 6. Discrimination cases which, in themselves, do not warrant a Severity Level III categorization. * * * * * Dated at Rockville, MD, this 21st day of November, 1994.
