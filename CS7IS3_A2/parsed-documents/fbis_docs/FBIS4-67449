SEGODNYA has already reported about the book the minister helped write, a book that sets forth a new environmental concept for Russia. The concept is based on avoiding environmental crimes characteristic of nascent capitalism and preserving the natural reserve we inherited from the centralized administrative system. A golden mean is always desirable but almost never attainable in practice. By contrast, the idea of a special Russian path seems forever popular. Frolov: Viktor Ivanovich, can it be that the idea of a so-called unique Russian path is attractive to environmentalists as well? Danilov-Danilyan: I am absolutely against viewing Russia as an exclusive country, in any case in the sense of its searching for ways to harmonious coexist with its own nature. Everybody has to review approaches of protecting the environment--the United States, Europe, Japan, third-world countries. Russia's uniqueness consists in that virtually one-third of its territory has never been subject to economic influences. We are confronted with special problems from the standpoint of protecting it, but we will have to solve them. In doing so, we should by no means pit ourselves against the rest of the world. On the contrary, we must integrate our own efforts into the environmental protection efforts of mankind. The Rome Club's famous slogan urging people to think globally but act locally has become obsolete to a significant extent. In any case, there is not a single post-industrial country that has not already used this path. Nevertheless, pressures on the biosphere continue to mount. Frolov: Why is it that in Russia, with its devil-may-care attitude toward the environment, to put it crudely, the situation is not as disastrous as commonly thought? Danilov-Danilyan: We are saved only by the circumstance that Russia occupies 12.5 percent of the world's land mass, while just 2.5 percent of the world's population lives on its territory. Meanwhile, Russia's "contribution" to the pollutants produced throughout the world is 10 percent, which is four times greater than average indices. If other countries allowed themselves to do the same, the Earth could not withstand it. It is very fashionable to talk about geopolitics these days, but most of those who discuss this topic do not realize that this in particular is its chief aspect. Frolov: It is equally fashionable to say today the Russian population is declining. Wouldn't the reverse process be an even greater problem, considering the harm we have caused to the environment, and consequently to ourselves? Danilov-Danilyan: Rutskoy and Khasbulatov also talked about "genocide" and said the blame for it rested with the Gaydar government. Such ignorance may be excusable for a military man, but for a doctor of economics? Rejection of the principle of high birth rates occurred in the 1920s and 1930s. What is happening today was, if not 100 percent, then 90 percent foreordained by the preceding development of demographic processes. Traditional perceptions of a favorable or unfavorable demographic situation are flawed from an ecological standpoint. We are now confronted with the need to take into account the factor of relative overpopulation. It is not enough to simply look at the ratio of the able-bodied to non-able-bodied population; we must take into account the possibility of higher productivity on the part of the able-bodied segment of society, something that will be able to support more "dependents." Our problem is that Russia, while experiencing relative overpopulation as expressed in overconsumption of resources, does not have an efficient economy or efficient production. Frolov: But modern science-intensive, energy- and resource-conserving technologies are the primary means of protecting the ecosphere from the onslaught of civilization. In this respect Russia doesn't have too many chances. Danilov-Danilyan: Nonscience-intensive production is dying out, regardless of what anyone might like. For the simple reason that it is worn out. Its continued use is becoming either physically impossible or economically ruinous. More and more money is needed for repairs, and such production consumes more and more raw materials and energy and produces more and more wastes, for which we are also having to pay today. In addition, it is no longer profitable to produce obsolete equipment today--it is extremely materials-intensive, and enterprises that produce such equipment are the main ones that are failing economically. And so we see here a mechanism of natural selection, even though, of course, one might like to artificially stimulate it. The claim that nothing is being modernized or built in our country is nonsense. Last year alone, environmental experts analyzed 64,000 design documents. We sent only 4 percent of them back for further work. Not one of the others failed to meet environmental-protection requirements. And so in contrast to many people, I see no grounds for deep pessimism. Frolov: So the current state of our science, which is instrumental in the emergence of new technologies, doesn't make you pessimistic? Danilov-Danilyan: In recent months all I hear is that science is dying. The same thing was said over and over in the United States about American science 30 to 35 years ago. At that time the USSR launched the first satellites, and the Americans panicked. They calculated that we had 10 times more people going into science that they did. Then they began talking in utter seriousness about the intellectual death of the nation. People in our country are saying in horror that scientists are going into business. I don't see anything wrong with that. Now when they leave the country--that is indeed dangerous. Moreover, we have an enormous backlog of research projects. And even if we are experiencing a pause--so what, we'll survive. In general, we underestimate the role of social self-organization. We are used to regimentation and rigid planning, but no society lives like that in a transitional period. Frolov: Unfortunately, not only do we have an obsession with planning; we have also failed to outgrow our passion for classifying anything and everything. We have learned the truth about the environmental situation in Russia thanks to the fact that many documents have been declassified. Now a presidential edict has authorized the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources itself to be a "classifier." How do you intend to exercise that right? Danilov-Danilyan: First, we never petitioned to obtain that right. Second, we view it not as an opportunity to classify things, but on the contrary, to lift the ban on publishing information that does not constitute a state secret. For example, we intend to publish the declassified section of the Russian register of radiation objects. But it would be absolutely naive to think that the text is utterly devoid of secrets. In general, environmental information can be used to gather a great deal of information affecting national security. For example, a great deal can be learned from satellite surveillance of the behavior of birds carrying sensors about the size of a thimble. Naturally, more traditional methods are also widely used. So the decision adopted doesn't surprise us in the least.
