"We are against any form of dual recognition," a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. In a major policy switch, Taiwan said Tuesday that it would not seek to cut official ties with South Africa if Pretoria switches diplomatic recognition to Beijing. The announcement by Foreign Minister Frederick Chan marked the first time Taiwan had indicated it would be prepared to tolerate dual recognition with China. However, the Chinese spokesman was adamant such an arrangement would be unacceptable to Beijing. "We firmly oppose any attempt aimed at creating two Chinas, or one China one Taiwan," he said. China refuses to permit countries with which it has diplomatic relations to recognise Taiwan, which it has regarded as a renegade province ever since Nationalist forces fled to the island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists on the mainland. Similarly, Taipei has previously broken ties with any country which switches formal recognition to Beijing. Beijing and South Africa's new government of national unity are widely expected to establish diplomatic relations later this year. China, a long-time supporter of the black majority's struggle for political rights in South Africa, had previously refused to establish ties with the white government in Pretoria until the country's apartheid system had been completely dismantled. "We believe that relations between China and the new South Africa will enjoy all-round development in the future," the spokesman said. In October last year, China resumed economic and trade links with South Africa which were suspended in 1960. Taiwan currently maintains official ties with only 29 countries, including South Africa, but has in recent years launched a diplomatic offensive -- especially in Southeast Asia -- to cement ties with other governments.
