What does Serbian public opinion think about the shipment of Bulgarian goods? [Smilkovic] I have no reports on anyone wanting to block the transit of Bulgarian goods. As far as the Serbian people are concerned, I can say that have nothing against anything that is to the benefit of the Bulgarians. We know that the transshipment of these goods is of vital importance for you. However, it is difficult for me to say whether some organization may appear that wants to block the convoys. Nevertheless, public opinion in Yugoslavia is in favor of Bulgaria shipping its goods. [passage omitted] [STANDART NEWS] If the conflict in Bosnia dies down, do you think that the FRY will undertake operations in Kosovo and Macedonia? [Smilkovic] Kosovo is part of Serbia, and the problem is an internal one, of concern only to the FRY. It is being resolved according to the Constitution and the laws of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia, while, of course, observing world standards regarding minority rights. As for Macedonia, it is an independent state. In the SFRY it had the status of a republic, just like the other republics, and this was never disputed. We have never opposed the notion that the Macedonians are a nation and, most important, the Serbian people have never disputed this either. Thus, the issue of the recognition of Macedonia as a separate state and of the Macedonians as a separate nation is not a matter of dispute for the Serbian public. Regarding the actual act of recognition, this is an issue of practical politics that will be settled when it arises on the agenda. In general, the recognition of the former Yugoslav republics has been postponed until such a time as all the issues between them and the FRY are settled. [passage omitted] [STANDART NEWS] Does this mean that you consider that there are no obstacles to Serbia recognizing Macedonia, if we leave aside the war between Serbia and Bosnia, which is delaying this? [Smilkovic] In the first place, the FRY has not been in a state of war with Bosnia. As regards Macedonia, I have even gone further than what I know as an official representative of my country, because I am well acquainted with the view of the Serbian people. [STANDART NEWS] We are not sure whether we have understood you correctly. Are you asserting that in essence there are no obstacles to Serbia recognizing Macedonia? [Smilkovic] I have already given a straight answer to this question, and I repeat: Yugoslavia and the peoples of Serbia and Montenegro have no dispute concerning the Macedonians as a nation and Macedonia as a state. The issue of recognition is a political one and will be decided when the time comes. At the moment, during these years, Yugoslavia has many other urgent issues that have to be decided. Furthermore, during the whole of the period of transition since Yugoslavia began to split up, Belgrade has had the fewest problems of all with Macedonia. In essence, no unresolved problems exist here. [passage omitted] [STANDART NEWS] According to reports from Bulgarian correspondents in Yugoslavia, the newspaper of the Bulgarian minority in the Western Outlands [in Serbia], which resumed publication with such a fuss, produced only two issues before shutting down again. The appearance of the newspaper is interpreted as part of the election campaign waged by the official authorities. What is your comment on this? [Smilkovic] Such an assessment is not based on facts and sounds rather ill-intentioned. The difficulties with the printing of the BRATSTVO ["Brotherhood"] newspaper, as in the case of other newspapers, are primarily a result of the economic situation. Unfortunately, the unjust UN sanctions are having a negative effect on the press as well. Apart from this, recently some of the Bulgarian mass media have been politicizing the situation of the Bulgarian minority in Yugoslavia. A problem is being artificially created. I am surprised that this is happening at a moment when all the citizens of the FRY are fighting to survive, because the unjust UN sanctions that I mentioned are threatening the very basis of human existence. Incidentally, I know much more about the situation of this minority than the others for the simple reason that I have many friends among its representatives. A few days ago I was in Bosilegrad. I wanted to ask how many members of the Bulgarian minority hold positions in the leading structures. However, I found there was no reason to ask, because the membership of these leading structures was entirely composed of Bulgarians. For example, every third person in Dimitrovgrad has a post. There are not many Bulgarians in Yugoslavia. They were not numerous even when they entered the country. Nevertheless, they have been preserved. Do you think that they would have remained if anyone had been oppressing them? Incidentally, as we are talking about this issue, do you realize how bad the Bulgarians in Yugoslavia feel when someone comes from Bulgaria and hands out aid only to them? I, for example, would find it insulting to receive medicine or anything else, while my neighbor gets nothing merely because he belongs to another nationality. For this reason, individual efforts to donate aid on a purely ethnic basis are unacceptable, because such aid has no humanitarian purpose and can only cause harm.
