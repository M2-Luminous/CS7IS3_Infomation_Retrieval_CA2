Officials from the State Administration of Exchange Control said yesterday that a national inter-bank foreign exchange trading system was expected to be established around April, replacing the old swap markets. They spoke at a seminar in Beijing organized by the China Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment. In general, enterprises will find it easier to obtain foreign exchange by going directly to banks instead of swap markets, which have been based on the two-tiered foreign exchange rate mechanism. China unified foreign exchange rates in January at $1 to 8.7 yuan. The impending inter-bank markets will use the single-rate system. Seven such markets will be established on a trial basis toward the end of this month, the officials said. But they did not say where the experimental markets would be located. "Enterprises, including those with foreign investment, will find it easier to exchange between foreign currencies and the renminbi yuan via banks," an official said. For example, a newly-formed joint venture with foreign investment can buy foreign currencies directly from banks if it is approved by the State Administration of Exchange Control to do so. The approval yardstick is that the venture must be engaged in projects encouraged by the State Planning Committee, such as power stations, railways and wharfs. The bulk of these ventures' income will be in renminbi. Also, foreign-invested leasing companies are allowed to settle their business in foreign currencies, as an exception to China's latest regulation ruling out such settlement starting this year. One official said the leasing companies can sign payment contracts with domestic clients in foreign currencies to avert possible losses from the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates. China's leasing companies have complained in recent years that limited access to foreign currencies has hurt their business. The officials also elaborated on new regulations that would govern opening banking accounts and the capital movement of foreign investment enterprises. China will restrict such enterprises from remitting their dividends and bonuses overseas if they fail to put in their share of registered capital on time. The action is in light of the continuous downward spiral of the actual input of foreign capital over the past few years. The actual input has accounted for less than 20 percent of what was promised by foreign investors last year. The figure compares to around 60 percent about a decade ago. The officials also said that foreign investment enterprises would be free to open banking accounts where they are located, provided they have registered with the State Administration of Exchange Control. But they would face stricter inspection when it comes to opening accounts in the other parts of China and overseas.
