Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will play a special role in this connection, because the NATO allies, the Americans in particular, have entrusted Germany with a crucial role for shaping relations between the members of the North Atlantic alliance and the states or successor states of the former Warsaw Pact. Typically, the diplomats will act more cautiously than the defense ministers, who tend to prefer a clear language. According to internal preliminary discussions, in Istanbul Kinkel will defend the principle that participants will not be treated differently within the Partnership for Peace scheme, not even Russia, which has still not signed the framework agreement. In diplomatic circles in Bonn, it has been pointed out that one must understand the claims of an international and nuclear power such as Russia to an outstanding position in European foreign and security policy. However, it has been said that one could not formalize such a position, but, at the most, "institutionalize" it. Yet, so far nobody knows exactly how this can be done without upsetting the other members of the program and making them call for full NATO membership immediately. In Bonn the question marks that determine the discussion on the future European security policy are by no means being ignored. In such cases, the diplomats tend to bank on the time factor -- and this is what they are doing now. From the period of transition, Russia has belonged to the NATO Cooperation Council, which was conceived as a bridge to NATO. Some members of this council were seeking early full membership, which caused controversial debates. That Russia should not and would not become a NATO member was obvious to everybody. This is what generated the American idea to create a kind of preparatory program through Partnership for Peace for countries that will one day achieve the political and economic conditions for full NATO membership. Strictly speaking, Russia does not belong to this group, because it wants to remain outside NATO. However, out of political considerations, nobody would or could exclude Moscow from participation either, which has created an almost schizophrenic situation. Officials in Bonn meanwhile know to what extent Moscow is anxious, for reasons of domestic policy, not only to make the North Atlantic Cooperation Council superfluous but to devalue NATO in general by upgrading the CSCE to an umbrella security institution. Yet, this plan should not work out, something on which the Federal Government and its Western partners all agree on. "In these insecure times of change we still need NATO," they say. Whether the Russians will jump on the tightrope of noncommittal declarations of intent, which the NATO foreign ministers intend to put up in Istanbul, remains, however, uncertain.
