FBIS4-28500 "dreas112_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 South Korea Envoy: North To Reject Inspection Calls Envoy: North To Reject Inspection Calls SK0806012994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0116 GMT 8 Jun 94 SK0806012994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Vienna, June 8 (YONHAP) -- North Korea reaffirmed Tuesday that the dispute over its nuclear program can be settled only through dialogue with the United States, clarifying that it will not accept an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) resolution calling for special nuclear inspections in North Korea. The chief North Korean delegate to the IAEA, Yun Ho-chin, who is attending an IAEA Board of Governors' meeting, held a press conference to warn that his country may withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Yun said, "If the IAEA adopts a resolution again, it will be as much as telling us to leave the NPT system." He then criticized the IAEA, claiming it is manipulated by powerful nations and has distorted the technical problems related to replacement of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon in order to pressure North Korea. North Korea has already proved through experiments that it is possible to recount the history of the reactor operations, Yun said. Pyongyang notified the IAEA of the technical point at issue in an earlier letter, but the U.N. watchdog agency is ignoring the notification, he added. North Korea sent a message to Hans Blix, director-general of the IAEA, on Monday saying it would quit the NPT if it came under U.N. pressure over its suspected drive to develop nuclear weapons. The message, signed by Pak Yong-nam, general-director of the General Department of Atomic Energy, warned that if the IAEA took the North Korean nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council and continued to resort to pressure, Pyongyang would no longer feel the need to subject itself to the "unreasonable binds" of the NPT. Meanwhile, the IAEA Board of Governors met for a second day Tuesday to discuss nuclear safeguards. Delegates from the United States, Japan, Australia and Canada are likely to draw up a draft resolution Wednesday urging Pyongyang to accept special inspections, according to a diplomatic source here.
