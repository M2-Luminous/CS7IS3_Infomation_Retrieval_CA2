FR941216-0-00009 FR941216-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;210&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9097; AD 94&hyph;26&hyph;01] Airworthiness Directives; Learjet Model 24, 25, 31, 35, 36, and 55 Series Airplanes, and Learjet Model 28 and 29 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Learjet Model 24, 25, 31, 35, 36, and 55 series airplanes, and Learjet Model 28 and 29 airplanes. This action requires a revision to the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to prohibit flight above an altitude of 41,000 feet. This action also provides optional terminating action for that AFM revision. This amendment is prompted by a report of failure of a safety valve in the pressurization system on a Learjet Model 31A airplane and reports of cracks found in the poppets of certain outflow/safety valves due to an improper molding process. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent such cracking and subsequent failure of the valves, which could result in rapid decompression of the airplane. DATES: Effective January 3, 1995. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 3, 1995. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before February 14, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;210&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Walter Eierman, Aerospace Engineer, Systems and Equipment Branch, ANM&hyph;131L, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3960 Paramount Boulevard, Lakewood, California 90712; telephone (310) 627&hyph;5336; fax (310) 627&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Recently, the FAA received a report of failure of a safety valve in the pressurization system on a Learjet Model 31A airplane. Failure of the valve resulted in depressurization of the cabin. Investigation revealed that the poppets of certain outflow/safety valves were cracked. These discrepant valves, including the safety valve installed on the incident airplane, had been manufactured since January 1, 1989. Certain valves manufactured since that date have been found to be susceptible to cracking due to an improper molding process. Cracking in the poppets of the outflow/safety valves in the pressurization system can result in an open valve with an effective flow area of 4.4 square inches; additionally, the valve may close and remain closed. These conditions, if not corrected, could result in rapid decompression of the airplane. The FAA has reviewed and approved Allied Signal Aerospace Alert Service Bulletins 130406&hyph;21&hyph;A4011, Revision 2, dated September 28, 1994, and 102850&hyph;21&hyph;A4021, Revision 2, dated October 6, 1994. These alert service bulletins describe procedures for replacement of certain outflow/safety valves in the pressurization system with serviceable valves. Further, the alert service bulletins recommend that the maximum altitude for operation of airplanes that may be equipped with these outflow/safety valves be limited to 41,000 feet as an interim measure until the affected valves are replaced.
