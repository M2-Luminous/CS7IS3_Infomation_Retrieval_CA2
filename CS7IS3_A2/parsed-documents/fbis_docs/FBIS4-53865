As reported in the national government's local financial plans, the outstanding balance of loans of all local governments will exceed 100 trillion yen in the fiscal year 1994 for the first time in history. With a drastic reduction in tax revenues, more local municipal bonds are steadily being issued to respond to requests from the national government for more locally financed projects. Although the economic outlook has somewhat improved, a rapid economic growth cannot be expected in the future. Local governments with large debts began to feel the sense of fiscal crisis. Restructuring of operations, including a review of personnel requirements, is likely to intensify. Debts Equaling 40 Percent of National Debts A forecast of financial conditions compiled in mid-March by the Tokyo Bureau of Finance was truly a "nightmarish scenario": "Eight years from now in 2002, the financial condition of Tokyo will fall down to that of associations with restrictions imposed on their issuance of bonds." According to this estimate, ratio of the cost of municipal bonds over the total amount of general revenues will become double-digit in the fiscal year 1995, moving up to 10.8 percent from 7.7 percent for the original estimate for the fiscal year 1994. It is estimated to increase gradually, reaching 20.6 percent in the fiscal year 2002. Metropolitan Tokyo, which was once regarded as an affluent self-governing community, is suffering from dwindling tax revenues. According to its original budget, tax revenues for the fiscal year 1994 will decrease by 7.7 percent from the previous year. At their peak in the fiscal year 1989, funds for fiscal adjustments and for redemption of bonds amounted to 450 billion yen, but these are expected to be depleted entirely. An executive at the Finance Bureau of Tokyo says, "To make cautious estimates, we assumed a lower level of tax revenues and a higher amount of bonds issuance." However, he looks worried, saying, "During the Minobe administration when the fiscal condition deteriorated most, ratio moved up more than the 10 percent range." As the estimate indicated that "ratio of municipal bonds issuance in 2002 would exceed 20 percent target range set by the Ministry of Home Affairs for imposition of restrictions on issuance of bonds," its announcement was postponed. Those having difficulty in collecting tax revenues are not limited to local governments in large cities that were directly hit by the recession following the bubble economy. According to budget for the fiscal year 1994 of each of four prefectures -- Akita, Shimane, Kochi, and Oita -- the cash flow from issuance of municipal bonds exceeds that from tax revenues. This is equivalent to a household that borrows money more than it earns in salaries. According to local governments' financial plans for the fiscal year 1994, the balance of loans, including bonds for public enterprises (which are born by local governments) and loans from the special account for tax allocated to local governments, increases dramatically to 102.83 trillion yen from 81.09 trillion yen for the fiscal year 1993. This means that local governments will bear close to 40 percent of nation's long-term liabilities of approximately 161 trillion yen. Distrustful of the National Government The total amount of municipal bonds to be issued in the fiscal year 1994 will be 10.39 trillion yen, an increase by 66.9 percent from the previous year. As a result, the degree of dependence on municipal bonds is 13.1 percent, exceeding 12.6 percent registered in 1979 following the second oil shock. The increase in issuance of municipal bonds is due to the fact that local governments expanded the scope of their independent projects in order to stimulate the economy and to share the burden of the national government's fiscal crisis. Ibaraki Prefecture increased the amount of its independent projects by 23.5 percent, saying that "An economic recovery is the first priority for the nation as a whole." Thirty-two prefectures in total, including Hokkaido, Gunma, and Yamanashi, had a double-digit increase in the amount of their independent projects. According to fiscal plans for local governments, annual growth rate for independent projects was 12.0 percent in both fiscal years 1993 and 1994, surpassing greatly that of total expenditures. Governor Morihiko Hiramatsu of Oita Prefecture, whose 1994 budget shows more cash inflow from issuance of municipal bonds than from tax revenues, says, "Many independent projects of local governments should be carried out by the national government through issuance of construction bonds. Local governments are taking care of these, and municipal bonds are like national bonds in disguise." For the first time in 18 years, the Ministry of Home Affairs has approved issuance of deficit-covering municipal bonds in the amount of 1.6 trillion yen so as to make up for reduction in income and resident taxes. Also, it has been providing "guidance" to local governments to secure needed funds in various ways -- bonds to supplement revenue reduction, loans from the special account for tax allocated to local governments, and so on. However, most of these loans are liabilities of local governments, except for the portion that is to be paid by tax allocated to local governments. The Ministry of Home Affairs pretends to be calm about the current financial conditions of local governments, saying, "Aside from the question of medium- to long-term prospects, we don't think current conditions to be deteriorating." However, a local governmental official doesn't hide his feeling of distrust toward the national government: "Under the guidance of the national government, local governments are forced to make public investments. However, there is no guaranty that these investments will stimulate the economy, increase tax revenues, and help pay for the cost of municipal bonds." Tax Revenues Can't Be Expected Among local banks, which are the partners of local governments, the following view is gaining strength: "The scenario for redemption of municipal bonds that relies upon an increase in tax revenues from an economic recovery will eventually come to a halt." It has been suggested that potential growth rate for the Japanese economy is becoming smaller. Therefore, even though the prospect for an economic recovery is gradually improving, a big increase in tax revenues as experienced in the past cannot be expected. As a result of the issuance of municipal bonds to expand the scope of their independent projects to stimulate the economy, local governments will be likely to face tight financial conditions in the mid- to long-term future. They have become reflective: "We can't follow the same old pattern of doing whatever the national budget dictates" (per Governor Daijiro Hashimoto of Kochi Prefecture). [13 Apr 94 p 1] [Text] Administrative Reform Using Corporate Methods As their fiscal conditions are affected by the recession and getting tighter at an accelerated speed, some local governments began to undertake restructuring of their operations. Kobe City, which has been called "Kobe, Inc." because of its corporation-like skills in managing its municipal affairs, established a Headquarters for Promotion and Improvement of Administrative and Fiscal Reform at the end of March [1994]. It aims at consolidating offices with similar functions by making a thorough review of its organization, which has become too fragmented due to an expanded demand for administrative services. It plans to make a massive cut in the number of management positions. As the budgeted amount of revenues from city taxes for the fiscal year 1994 decreases from that in the previous year for the first time in 39 years, Mayor Kukitoshi Sasayama says, "This time, we are going to be as cost conscious as a private enterprise in tackling with our administrative reform." Governor Yoshinobu Ishikawa of Shizuoka Prefecture is also aiming for an administrative reform by applying corporate management methods. In January he established a "Conference to Discuss the Ideal Way of Administration and Finance," inviting representatives from the industrial circle. Based on suggestions gathered from the conference, he eliminated 23 posts that were judged to be "unnecessary" in the organizational reform in April. The wave of restructuring is also pressing in on those local governments that used to be considered affluent a few years ago. In compiling budgets for the fiscal year 1994, Kanagawa Prefecture has adopted a stringent standard that would cut the budget for each section by 20 percent in principle from the actual amount of spending in the previous year. In February [1994] it decided to consolidate eight extra-governmental organizations, including the association of prefectural parks. Some officials in the prefectural government ask with a sigh, "Do we really have to shed our blood to this extent?" Some local governments are experiencing friction with their labor unions over their restructuring plans. Matsumoto City in Nagano Prefecture is the case in point. Late last year the city revised its broad policies on administrative reform, and announced its plan to reduce the number of work-site employees gradually, including those in charge of collecting garbage and preparing school lunches. Although the plan calls for a gradual shift toward the use of private companies by not hiring new employees to replace those who are retiring, negotiations with the labor union became difficult. In March the Prefectural and Local Labor Relations Commission became involved for the first time in 32 years to mediate between the two parties. According to the estimate by the city, garbage disposal per ton costs 12,000 yen when done by the city, but it will cost 7,000 yen, about 60 percent of the current cost, when commissioned to a private company. Although the friction with the labor union still continues over the contents of an agreement proposed by the Labor Relations Commission, Mayor Tadashi Ariga went ahead with the original plan of not hiring new employees to replace retirees in his personnel and recruitment policy in April. He is determined to improve efficiency by using private companies for their services. Common among the local governments that began to implement administrative reform is a belief that "If we don't make a decisive action on administrative reform now, it will be too late" (per Mayor Ariga). This belief is enforced by a critical reconsideration of the bloated size of administrative organization and the sense of crisis over increasing administrative costs due to the aging society. The Swelling Number of Employees The number of employees at local governments declined after the fiscal year 1982, but it began to increase since the fiscal year 1989, exceeding 1.16 million in general administrative fields--the largest number in history. Although this increase was caused in part by advance orders for public works and an increase in work load required by the nation's laws and regulations, some people say that "the bloated personnel cost is putting a cap on an increase in the expenditure for general construction projects" (per the Finance Division, Kanagawa Prefecture). The same is true for extra-governmental organizations. Hokkaido began reviewing the extra-governmental organizations it helps finance. One of the factors that prompted this review is a research report compiled last fall by the Hokkaido Economic Association. Out of 88 organizations, 39 had operating losses, and 49 had been unable to eliminate their cumulative deficits. Two organizations had been accumulating losses over 20 years since their inception. Some people say that "there are some public corporations whose operations are quite unclear to us" (per the Hokkaido Economic Association). As of January 1993, there were 6,659 extra-governmental organizations financed for more than 25 percent [of their equity] by respective local governments. The number of organizations has increased by 40 percent over six years. Many of these organizations had a bleak prospect for profitability even at the time of their inception. One organization in Kochi Prefecture, for example, retains 22 directors per a staff member. Unnecessary Operations Abound In addition to the bloated size of organization, financial conditions of the local governments have been rapidly deteriorating due to a difficulty in increasing tax revenues and a large increase in issuance of municipal bonds. The outstanding balance of municipal bonds as of the end of the fiscal year 1993 reached a historic high: "The balance in ordinary accounts alone exceeds well over 70 trillion yen" (per Finance Research and Guidance Division, Ministry of Home Affairs). Local governments seem to have driven themselves into a state where they must carry out restructuring, including cuts in the number of employees, which they have avoided so far. Some people point out critically, however: "Although local governments are ripe for administrative reform, only a handful of them feel a genuine sense of crisis" (per Norio Sakata, professor at Toyo University). Because of fiscal crises at the national and local levels, there have been discussions on tax increases, including consumption tax. However, residents are keeping a watchful eye because they are the ones who will be burdened by such tax increases. Professor Sakata believes: "Local governments have many operations that are not necessary today. If they have a courage to eliminate those operations, they will be able to slim down futher their administrative entities." The move toward restructuring, which has already been taken up at some progressive local governments, is likely to be widepread from now on.
