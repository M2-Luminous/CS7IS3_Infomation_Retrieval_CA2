Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) Spokesman Glenn McDougall said staffers from counting stations which had completed their tally would be moved to slower stations to beef the process up. He said Durban was among the slowest stations, because of its late start after a labour dispute on Saturday. By late afternoon, over 600,000 votes had been counted in KwaZulu-Natal, but this represented only about 12 per cent of the total ballot. At this stage the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] led the electoral race with 53 per cent. But the African National Congress was still confident of a victory in the province, saying support would swing in the party's favour as counting drew to a close. The ANC had 30.7 per cent at the time. Spokesman Themba Rubushe said he was confident the ANC would gain more than 50 per cent of the vote. "We expect to come back comfortably." IFP Spokesman Peter Smith said it was still too early to predict the outcome of elections in the province, with a relatively small percentage of the regional vote counted. Meanwhile, the counting process in Natal was labelled as "chaotic", by the National Party's [NP] Natal InFormation Chairman Renier Schoeman. "It's thumb suck. In KwaZulu/Natal there is an endless irritation about the way (counting) has been handled. This is gross inefficiency." He said the current figures were "mickey mouse" and did not reflect even remotely what his party would achieve when counting was completed. At the time the NP enjoyed just over nine per cent support in the province. The Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC], which emerged with two per cent of the provisional results on Monday afternoon, boasted it would win as much as five per cent support in KwaZulu/Natal. Spokeswoman Siphiwe Sithole said the PAC -- not recognised as much of a contender in the regional race -- had benefited from rural support because of its land policies. The PAC was on Monday afternoon ahead of the Democratic Party [DP], which was largely expected to pick up good support in this historically progressive province. But it had 1.7 per cent on Monday afternoon. Following the DP in sixth position in KwaZulu/Natal was the Freedom Front with 1.1 per cent.
