Nearly three years ago when the USSR still existed the jets arrived in the city of Baranovichi for repairs. They could not be sent back because of the UN embargo that was imposed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Tushinsky said that they jets could be taken over by Russia when the former USSR's military hardware was divided between its republics but Russia did not want them.
