After fully affirming the achievements scored by the province in opposing corruption, Zhao Zhihao pointed out: This year, the task on maintaining stability is extremely arduous, and corruption is one of the major factors affecting stability. Failing to effectively punish and check corruption will cause complaints among the masses, is liable to provoke disturbances, and will affect overall stability. For this reason, all departments at all levels, principal leading comrades in particular, must have a full understanding of anticorruption work, keep sober-minded, and guard against negligence and slackness. Zhao Zhihao stressed: The priorities for this year's anticorruption work are to make leading cadres administratively honest and self-disciplined, to investigate and deal with related cases, and to correct unhealthy trends. All departments at all levels should strengthen the supervision by the masses, by the press, and by special organs, and should consciously subject themselves to supervision by people's deputies and members of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, with a focus on resolving the prominent problems of their own units, in accordance with the new contents and new demands set by the three tasks and in line with their respective realities. Governments at all levels and all leading cadres should not only take the lead in being self- disciplined but also pay attention to opposing corruption and support functional departments perform duties and do their work well. The conference was presided over by Zhang Ruifeng, vice governor of the province. Attending the conference were Tan Fude, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial discipline inspection commission; Wang Jiangong, vice governor of the province; and Han Bangju and Ma Changgui, special advisers to the provincial government.
