Chairman Chong Chae-mun and five other committee members visited Vietnam from May 2-7. Chong, speaking to reporters about his tour of the Southeast Asian country, said, "the Vietnamese leaders made clear that nuclear weapons should not exist on the Korean peninsula and even though Vietnam has a communist system like North Korea, it does not support North Korea's lines."

During their trip the Korean lawmakers met with senior Vietnamese leaders, including former Chief Secretary of the Communist Party Nguyen Van Linh, House Speaker Nong Duc Manh and First Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Khai, and discussed expanding economic cooperation, supporting children fathered by Koreans, locating Korean soldiers lost during the Vietnam war and returning the remains of Korean soldiers.
