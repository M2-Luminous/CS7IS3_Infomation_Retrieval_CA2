The branch has been promoted from a representative office, set up in August 1992, under the Korea-China financial agreement. The Korea Exchange Bank already opened a branch in Tianjin, China, in December last year. Capitalized at 15 million U.S. dollars, the Bank of China's Seoul branch is expected to focus its banking services on companies dealing with China. It will also provide counseling services to businesses planning to invest in China. The Bank of China, which is capitalized at 5.2 billion U.S. dollars has 6,183 branches in China and 448 overseas. Two other Chinese banks -- the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the People's Construction Bank of China -- now maintain a representative office each in Seoul.
