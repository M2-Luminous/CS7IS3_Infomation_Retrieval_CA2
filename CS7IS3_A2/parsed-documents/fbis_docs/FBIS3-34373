But little did they know that the bait is an American hamburger on an Israeli hook. This could not have been due to goodwill or naivete, because some of them have swallowed the bait despite their knowledge of the hook and its origin. There are also those who, from the time of their grandfathers, have yielded to the humiliation of slavery and have actually vied with one another in order to win the favor of the American master. But those rushing to the White House have been truly deluded, because the American master is no longer his own master. He has lost control of his affairs to the Zionist lobby and placed all his eggs in the Israeli basket. Still, the devotees of the United States have formed an Arab lobby that is not for, but against, the Arabs and their nation. Let us now seriously compare the endeavors of the new lobby with those of the established Zionist lobby. The Arab lobby, if it is correct to call it by such a name, is a generous lobby. For we have not heard of a single occasion on which it has secured anything. On the contrary, it has conceded everything with contentment and satisfaction. And as the saying goes: Contentment is an inexhaustible treasure. On the other hand, the Zionist lobby has secured everything without becoming content or satisfied. The Arab lobby specializes in increasing pressure, cooling down hot spots, and loosening knots in order to clear the way for the Americans. Conversely, the Zionist lobby specializes in creating those hot spots for the Americans, both president and officials, by all possible means. The Zionist lobby controls the most crucial areas of American society -- power, money, and the media -- and holds the keys to every door. Thus, most of the decisions made by the U.S. Administration come in attractive Zionist dress. The Arab lobby makes blood sacrifices for the Americans, even if it is the blood of kinsmen and brethren, while the Zionist lobby is among the leading guests to waste more Arab blood. Let us now compare the most significant achievements made by the Zionist lobby for Israel with those of the Arab lobby for its nation. The former has made the mighty United States a secretary serving in the office of the Zionist prime minister, and has subjected U.S. will to the decisions of the Knesset. On the other hand, the latter has reduced Arab states, governments, and officials to employees in a small section of the U.S. State Department, begging for visas and identity cards from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. At the same time, it has subjected Arab countries' will to the future and comfort of the U.S. President, whether Republican or Democrat. We all know that the Zionist lobby controls the United Nations and its Security Council resolutions. As for the miserable Arab lobby, the lame lobby, it is no more than a folkloric group fit to decorate and add color to conference tables (with their head gear, beards, and mustaches) or become another number in a list of signatories. The Arab lobby is destroying the Arab structure and dwarfing the nation, from the ocean to the Gulf, and burning its history. It is a stupid lobby, which has been charmed by blond America, and it has disowned its mother, its father, and its homeland for the sake of its love -- because America is its only love. It is a short-sighted lobby, which does not view its national wealth as lawful unless it is first blessed by the U.S. treasury. It also does not consider its nation's problems fully diagnosed unless they have been seen through the U.S. microscope. The United States knows everything about the nation. It is a very tiny lobby that derives strength from the Zionist lobby and looks taller, stronger, and more treacherous in the shadow of that lobby. The Arab lobby continues to claim that it works for the nation and its interests. This is why it has offered its territory as a bridge for the dirty infidel masters to come occupy the homes of the poor faithful, who have performed absolution for prayer. An Arab lobby, a Zionist lobby, a Zionist Arab lobby. Bless you, O Iraq, for you have been, and you will continue to be, the nation's pivot, pure heart, and the banner under which the nation seeks cover from the disgrace of the so-called Arabs. Bless you, for they have formed a lobby against you. But you are stronger and more lasting, because you seek the help of God. They heard you praying: O God, O Helper.
