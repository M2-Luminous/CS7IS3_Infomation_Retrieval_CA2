"If the democrats had been united and had run the election campaign better, the president would be in a better position now," he said. Gaydar, who intends to concentrate on parliamentary work now, emphasized that Russia's Choice had to formulate a clear-cut position for itself. "There was uncertainty about the position of our parliamentary group when it could not be said for sure if we are in power or in opposition and we were held responsible for decisions which we did not make," he said. Now, he said, the group was in constructive opposition and could criticize the cabinet. Gaydar dismissed rumors of a split in the group. Only two men, Andrey Makarov and Boris Fedorov, left for the December 12 Union, a group "which votes almost the way we do." He thought that for a group of 78 this did not amount to a split. Commenting on the latest Duma decisions Gaydar said: "It is funny that the Duma discussed so thoroughly the well-being of the deputies and 'lavish' provisions for them were advocated by the communists and other left-wing parties. Despite the resistance mounted by Russia's Choice and my own speeches they secured a resounding victory in this issue."
