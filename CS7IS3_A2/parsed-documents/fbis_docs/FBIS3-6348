On the 14th and the 15th, overseas-based KC-135s refueled more than 30 fighter-bombers and assault planes in an air war exercise above Kunsan and Kapyong. Meanwhile the Kim Yong-sam group staged a war rehearsal on the 15th with the mobilization of many warships, attack helicopters, artillery pieces, tanks and armoured vehicles. At that time, a "civilian defence training" was under way in Seoul. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets would be well advised to act with discretion, clearly mindful of the grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless belligerent moves increasing tension on the Korean peninsula.
