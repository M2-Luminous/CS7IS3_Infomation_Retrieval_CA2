Which Way Will It Go?"] [Text] It is exactly two months since the elections. The first results can be summed up. The main one is that for two months now the government has been undergoing reorganization, rushing about aimlessly, and essentially doing no work. Not a single decision that could be described, even if you stretch the point, as reformist has been adopted. On the other hand we have had a reorganization which dragged out over many weeks and culminated in the departure of three people and the demotion of Shokhin and Shakhray. Some members of the "new" government have been beating their breasts for weeks and loudly trying to persuade everybody, themselves included, that they are reformers. Others are saying day in, day out that they will not wind up but will deepen and expand the reforms. At one moment the goal is to combat inflation, at the next it is to repay debts. It is symptomatic that Soskovets and Grachev in concert are now criticizing A. Zaveryukha. The premier did not think that by "reacting" to the election results by making gestures toward the sectorial lobbies he would be opening a "Pandora's box" whereby a wave of demands would threaten to sweep aside absolutely everything. Many people have now gone crazy on hearing talk of "payment of debts." They have decided: The time has come, we must extract everything we are entitled to and more. Coal industry workers, oil industry workers, agrarian workers, and communications workers are threatening to strike. Give us mutual offsetting of debts and indexation of circulating capital, cheap loans and selective support for bankrupts, the country must feed agrarian workers! The government is running scared. On the one hand, the reaction to the government changes is forcing it to swear loyalty to the former course. On the other, its instincts are pushing it in the other direction. The debt problem caused by the lack of financial discipline, the constant adoption of more and more new expenditure decisions, and the lack of the political will to cancel nonpriority spending is gradually finding expression in an orgy of hysterical demands, and beneath the hail of demands Moscow is losing its ability to calculate and is hoping to change things by means of partial sops. The agrarian lobby had only to flex its muscle and the decision on duties was revoked. They are promising everything to everyone, but they are afraid to deliver. The delay in making public the guidelines of the government's economic policy, the frantic conferences and statements -- all this is out of place and going on for an intolerably long time. The diagnosis is clear: The government has no clear line, has lost its bearings, and is aimlessly rushing about. The quarterly session of the enlarged government that has been postponed until 24 February will resolve nothing. Clearly, they are expecting a speech by the president so as not to make fools of themselves. But only the submission of the budget to the Duma will dispel the doubts. Unless they make fools of us. The government can save face only if it obtains results that are better than those in 1993. Initial reports about the budget have not increased optimism: expenditure of around 170 trillion rubles [R] and income of R120 trillion. Given that a month ago the Finance Ministry was estimating income at R80-90 trillion, there is a clear attempt to embellish the picture. It is doubtful that the government will be able to approve expenditure of R170 trillion unless the measures to revoke expenditure decisions that have been proposed for seven months are taken. Is there the political will for this? In reality it is a question of a deficit not of R50 trillion, but of R100 trillion, which will destroy the economy. Add to that the so-called united monetary system with Belarus and other countries, and financial disaster is inevitable. If the figures are "massaged" for the IMF and you and me, the result will be more chronic underpayments from the budget. We should also fear methods of decreasing the deficit like the sale of precious metals and gems by the government to the Central Bank without notifying parliament and the channeling of so-called Central Bank "profits" into budget needs -- all this is sheer emission, the deficit figures go down but inflation increases. The new year began with the loss of one-third of the Central Bank's currency reserves in order to maintain the ruble exchange rate for purely political purposes -- to prove that the departure of one or two people does not mean a U-turn. That way it won't be long before all the reserves have been wasted and then an exchange rate fixed, which is something they are already talking about. The government should prove its social orientation by setting tough targets for economic parameters such as inflation, the ruble exchange rate, the population's real income, average wages in dollar terms, real retail trade turnover, housing construction, and food consumption. These indicators were better in 1993 than they were in 1992, and they are the ones that determine living standards and social orientation. Is the government prepared to give specific pledges and to report back in January 1995? It remains only to place your bet. By the beginning of 1994 a situation had emerged where it had become impossible to move forward with the same "quality" of government. It was even impossible to hold on to the position that had been achieved -- it was possible only to lose ground. Because a reorganization had been launched that substantially worsened the "quality," a U-turn was inevitable. The premier was scarcely seeking this, but a fundamentally new situation emerged. There is no alternative to the policy pursued in 1993. Having said that, there is a need for greater consistency and unity on the part of the government and the whole of the executive branch. It is especially sad to hear academicians whom the premier's volte-face has roused to produce another opus setting out "conceptual approaches" but lacking specific prescriptions or any hint of knowledge of the real state of affairs. Does this stem more from a sense of being unwanted or from honest delusion? What is happening today was probably inevitable. The proud "red directors" probably have to have an opportunity to show everybody what they are actually capable of. Otherwise the myth that there is a real alternative, that there is an alternative road to the market whereby you can ignore macroeconomic realities and stage pseudocommunist experiments on living people, will remain forever. My hope is pinned on the president. I do not believe that B. Yeltsin, who began real political and economic reforms after 70 years of stagnation, can turn back. But I would like to believe that the prime minister, who for a year pursued, albeit inconsistently, a particular course, also will not venture to head for disaster. It is better to think again in time than to carry out more experiments on Russia.
