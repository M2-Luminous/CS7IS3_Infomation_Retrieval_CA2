He said the Korean people in the North and the South and abroad and the world's revolutionary people are significantly celebrating the birthday of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as a great auspicious fete of the nation and as a common revolutionary holiday of mankind. The whole course of the revolutionary activities of Comrade Kim Il-song is shining brilliantly as decades of tremendous struggle and creation in which he has devoted his all to the national liberation and prosperity and to the people's freedom and happiness, the reporter said, and went on: Comrade Kim Il-song is an unexcelled great man and an elder in the world revolution who has brought about a fundamental change in the destiny of our nation and made immortal contributions to the human cause of independence, the cause of socialism, covering the whole course of his life with the 20th century which witnessed a new epoch in the history of the struggle for human liberation and great changes on the world political map. Human history records many high-reputed leaders of the working class, but it knows no such a leader as respected Comrade Kim Il-song who has adorned the most profound, diverse and long annals of heroic epic with the greatness of his leadership and the rich content of his exploits in triumphantly paving the path of the revolution through raging storms and with his influence on the times and the development of history. Comrade Kim Il-song is the great leader of the working class and other working masses with extraordinary ideological and theoretical wisdom, leadership ability and virtues. He is a great master of thought and theory who founded the chuche idea reflecting the demand of our era, the era of independence, indicated the path of the Korean revolution and provided the working class and other working masses with an invincible weapon for freedom, liberation and socialism. Basing himself on the chuche idea, he propounded theories, strategy and tactics for all stages and fields of the revolution to realise the independence of the popular masses and systematized the leadership method to guide the people's cause of independence to victory, thus developing the revolutionary thought of the working class to a new, higher stage. He is a great statesman and a genius of creation and construction. With an unexcelled clairvoyance, scientific penetration, iron will and rare leadership ability, he trained the Korean people into a revolutionary people with a strong sense of independence through the application of the chuche idea and victoriously led the difficult and arduous Korean revolution in reliance on the inexhaustible strength of the people and built a powerful country of chuche, an impregnable fortress of socialism, in the East of the world. He wisely guided the work to strengthen the driving force of our revolution and enhance its role, pushing through manifold trials and crossing the deathline and thus liberated the lost country, founded the Workers' Party of Korea, a new type party, and consolidated it into a steel- like party. He made much effort to firmly equip our people with a revolutionary idea of independence and train them into an invincible combat unit harmoniously united with the party by giving definite precedence to the ideological revolution and consolidated the driving force of our revolution into an unbreakable socio-political organism. His clairvoyance finds expression in that he perfectly prepared the inheritance of the revolutionary cause as required by our revolution and people's desire from long ago with an insight into its historical necessity and gave guidance in firmly establishing the organisational and ideological basis and leadership system of the party to carry forward the revolutionary cause of chuche to a brilliant completion through generations. In Korea today, the invincible Workers' Party of Korea firmly stands in the centre of the revolutionary ranks, and the popular masses, who have withstood all trials, sharing their destiny with the party in the protracted course of revolutionary struggle, are unreservedly displaying their creative ingenuity in the revolution and construction, united around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in one mind, upholding the noble intentions of the great leader with loyalty. The whole party, the entire army and all the people has formed a mighty driving force to successfully carry forward the revolutionary cause of chuche to accomplishment through generations, firmly united around the dear leader in one idea and purpose on the basis of revolutionary obligation and noble comradeship. This shines as the most precious feat which will remain recorded forever, which Comrade Kim Il-song has performed for the party, the revolution and the people, putting forth all his energy till this day. Comrade Kim Il-song has resolved all the problems independently and creatively in conformity with the specific conditions of our country from the chuche-based stand in the whole period of his revolutionary activities, carried out the anti- imperialist, anti-feudal democratic revolution and the socialist revolution successfully and in a unique way and accelerated socialist construction to perform feats for the century in building socialism of chuche on this land where independence, self-sustenance and self-reliance in national defence have been definitely realized. Noting that he is a tender-hearted father with a noble virtue of holding the people dearest, the reporter said: The idea "believing in the people as in heaven" is the great ideological source of popular politics which he has applied consistently as the maxim of his life. The feats performed by Comrade Kim Il-song in leading the revolutionary struggle and constructive work of our people along an ever-victorious road are a most precious revolutionary wealth which is of immortal significance in the revolutionary cause of the working class and other popular masses for independence. They will shine forever along with the onward movement of history and the revolutionary cause of our party and people advancing under his guidance will be always invincible. The whole party and the entire people should hold tighter the socialist banner of chuche, upholding the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in order to defend the socialist cause from the anti-DPRK, anti-socialist moves of the imperialists and reactionaries and further develop it. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said: "The whole party and the entire people must fully support the leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il to defend our socialism centred on the popular masses and successfully accomplish the revolutionary cause of chuche. Herein lies the firm guarantee for carrying forward the socialist cause to accomplishment." In order to firmly defend and accomplish the socialist cause of chuche started by Comrade Kim Il-song and promote the reunification of the country, big efforts must be continuously directed to the strengthening of the singlehearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks around the leader and uninterrupted innovations be effected in socialist construction, the reporter said. Noting that the United States and its followers, the South Korean authorities, are rushing headlong along the road of confrontation and division and bringing the situation in Korea again to the perilous brink of war, committing all manner of perfidious acts, the reporter said: This only reveals their vulnerability. He further said: We do not like empty words. The entire people and officers and men of the People's Army will maintain a more mobilized and strained posture than ever before in face of the prevailing situation and, if the enemy unleash a reckless war of aggression, ignoring our patient peaceloving efforts, the army and people will unite in one body and mete out a stern punishment to the enemy and resolutely defend our socialist motherland and the sovereignty of the nation under the ever- victorious leadership of the supreme commander of our revolutionary Armed Forces Comrade Kim Chong-il so that it could not tread on an inch of our land and a blade of grass. Then a speech was made by the head of the congratulatory group of Koreans from Japan visiting the homeland to celebrate April 15.
