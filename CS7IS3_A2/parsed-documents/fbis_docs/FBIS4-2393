This means that beginning today the interrelation between supply and demand reflected on the national foreign exchange open market with this center as the core will become the authoritative basis for deciding exchange rates in China; and that the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Market, which was established in 1988 as a regional trading center, has been promoted to a national foreign exchange trading center. This national unified foreign exchange trading system, which links up with such big cities as Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou, began operation at around 0900. Only the dollar was traded today. On a huge computer screen, the opening rate was displayed as 8.681 yuan to the dollar; the day's high, 8.7265 yuan; the day's low, 8.681 yuan; and the weighted average, 8.6967 yuan. At 1100, trading closed for the day at a rate of 8.6908 yuan to the dollar. Dressed in yellow vests, traders representing some 70 brokerages and operators [zi ying shang 5261 3602 0794] took part in the first trading session today. Liu Guanghua [0491 0342 5478], a trader from the international business division of the Agricultural Bank of China's Shanghai City branch, told this reporter in the trading hall: "Trading was relatively smooth and steady throughout the day." As a broker, he concluded on behalf of his clients two buying contracts amounting to $50,000 at the respective rate of 8.68 and 8.69 yuan to the dollar, and 17 selling contracts worth a total of $840,000 at rates ranging from 8.71 to 8.72 yuan. According to an authoritative person from the center, the official inauguration of trading at the CFETC is a major step of substantive significance in China's financial reform this year and has laid solid material groundwork for establishing in China a single, managed floating exchange rate system based on supply and demand. The reform of the foreign exchange system launched at the beginning of the year has passed its transitional period smoothly in the first quarter. With the unification of the dual-track renminbi exchange rates, steady market operations, and stable exchange rates during the transitional period, the transitional goal has been basically attained. Coming into the second quarter, we are to carry out full-scale reform of the foreign exchange control system and implement a system of interbank exchange settlement and selling. The CFETC was officially inaugurated in conjunction with this process. According to a briefing, the CFETC, adopting an independent accounting system and a membership system, is a nonprofit, self-managed market organization, in which designated foreign exchange banks act as the main traders. With its advanced communications network and computer system, the center becomes the first of its kind in the world to be able to simultaneously conduct transactions and settlements based on the principle of "separate price quotations -- matching and transacting -- centralized settlement." The U.S. and Hong Kong dollars are the two currencies traded there for the time being. It has been learned that 13 major domestic banks and more than 80 other Chinese and foreign banks and nonbank financial institutions will become members of the CFETC. Existing foreign exchange swap markets at various localities across the country remain open after the trading center was put into operation.
