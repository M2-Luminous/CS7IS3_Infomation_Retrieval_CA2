Over the last few days, how to develop Jilin's rural economy to enable peasants to become better off at an earlier date has remained one of the central issues discussed by deputies from Jilin. Deputy Gao Yan, who is governor of Jilin, said: Enabling peasants to become better off is another leap in the vast rural areas following our success in eliminating poverty and providing enough food and clothing to them. Once we succeed in this work, we will be able to solve new and old problems and make further progress. To enable peasants to become better off, the first thing we need to do is to develop agriculture. Deputies from the province said Jilin should establish agricultural bases, develop famous brand name agricultural products, and promote agriculture-related high technologies, in order to ensure the province's agricultural development. A few deputies said the low efficiency in grain growing had dampened peasants' production enthusiasm and hampered their efforts to live a better life. They said the situation must be changed. Peasant deputy Hao Fuxia from the Dongxia Village in Meihekou City's Zhonghe Town said: "However the rural areas may develop, farming is the job of peasants. But now we really need to study some way to develop the agriculture." [passage omitted]
