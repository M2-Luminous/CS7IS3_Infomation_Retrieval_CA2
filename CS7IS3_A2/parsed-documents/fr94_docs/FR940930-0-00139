FR940930-0-00139 FR940930-0-00028 CAA section 246(f)(4) directs EPA to establish additional CFV standards for ULEVs and ZEVs (discussed earlier). These standards, shown in Table 4, should be more stringent than the CFV standards in section 243. Vehicles meeting these more stringent standards are eligible to earn credits which may be used toward compliance under the CFF program or the Pilot program, as specified in sections 246(f) and 249(d)(3), respectively. The Act requires EPA to set these more stringent standards for LDVs and LDTs so that they conform ``as closely as possible'' to the ULEV and ZEV standards established by California for vehicles in the same class. The California ULEV and ZEV standards are described below in section A.1.b. in this preamble.
