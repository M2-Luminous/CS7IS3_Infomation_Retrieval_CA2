Please examine it. I. Implementation of the 1993 Budget In 1993, while Anhui enjoyed sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development, total provincial revenues overfulfilled budgeted amounts and total provincial expenditures basically guaranteed normal requirements and supported economic and social development. Anhui improved the balance between its financial revenues and expenditures. (1) Anhui Province's Implementation of Its Budget Of the 1993 budget approved by the First Session of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress for Anhui Province, revenues reached 6.63038 million yuan and expenditures 5.89159 million yuan. After adding funds carried over from the previous year and special additional funds appropriated from the central treasury, the budgeted expenditures must be adjusted to 8.27229 million yuan. The implementation of the 1993 budget for Anhui is as follows: Revenues amounted to 7.3209 million yuan, or 110.4 percent of the budgeted amount. The figure exceeded the budgeted amount by 690.54 million yuan and posted a 32.8-percent increase over 1992. Calculated in accordance with the current financial system, total funds available for use amounted to 6,337.24 million yuan. Expenditures amounted to 7.20085 million yuan, or 87 percent of the budgeted amount after adjustment. When funds available for use were set against expenditures, there was an accumulated deficit of 863.61 million yuan, less than the previous year by 185.93 million yuan. Anhui succeeded in maintaining a balance between revenues and expenditures in 1993. (2) Implementation of the Provincial-Level Budget Of the provincial-level budget approved by the First Session of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress, revenues reached 126.23 million yuan and expenditures 1.2856 million yuan. After adding funds carried over from the previous year and special funds appropriated from the central treasury and after deducting funds appropriated by the province for prefectures and cities, the total budgeted expenditures must be adjusted to 2.8691 million yuan. The implementation of the provincial-level budget is as follows: Revenues returned to the treasury was 217.18 million yuan, more than the approved budget by 343.41 million yuan [as published]. Calculated in accordance with the current financial system, total funds available for use amounted to 1.6985 million yuan. Expenditures amounted to 1.6678 million yuan. When funds available for use were set against expenditures, there was some surplus. Generally speaking, the 1993 budget for Anhui was successfully implemented. Anhui's financial revenues exceeded the two levels -- 6 billion and 7 billion yuan; and its expenditures were effectively brought under control. Anhui's revenues covered the year's expenditures. A number of prefectures and cities also eliminated some deficits posted in previous years and somewhat improved the situation of their revenues and expenditures. Last year, closely revolving their efforts around the objectives of making financial revenues reach 7 billion yuan and enabling revenues to cover the year's expenditures proposed by the provincial party committee and government, financial and taxation departments in the province did a large amount of painstaking and fruitful work under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels. (1) Continuing to expand sources of revenues and increasing revenues of counties and townships to a new level. Having continued to support the 16 key counties (cities) selected in 1992, Anhui gave support to 19 additional counties (cities) last year. With efforts by various levels of authorities, the revenue of the 35 key counties (cities) enjoying government support is 17.3 percent more than the target set in contracts of support for 1993, an increase higher than that of ordinary county revenue. The number of counties (cities) with revenue over 50 million yuan increased from 13 in 1992 to 23; among them, Chaohu and Suzhou cities have joined Fuyang and Bozhou cities to become cities with over 100 million in revenue. In the meantime, 36 townships and towns have increased their revenues. (2) Strictly enforcing tax laws, strengthening the collection and management of revenues, and striving to achieve and overfulfill the revenue target. Last year, all localities vigorously took effective measures to rectify financial and taxation order, strengthen budgetary management, and conscientiously screen and check unauthorized tax reduction and exemption and violations of tax laws. To some extent, this has redressed the practices of contracting turnover taxes and leaving some revenues unregistered. Meanwhile, great efforts were made to clear tax and interest defaults. The incomes of prefectures and cities as a whole increased above the target set in the budget in 1993. (3) Strictly controlling general expenditures, strengthening capital management, and ensuring the needs of key projects. Last year, all localities significantly enhanced their consciousness of the balance of financial revenue and expenditure and actively cut down and controlled general expenditures, mainly meeting-related spending, telephone charges, auto fuel charges, public health service spending, and others. Meanwhile, they collected funds through all possible means to ensure the expenditures for key projects and particularly did a great deal of work in ensuring wages, striving for more funds for agriculture and educational investment, and others. This has greatly supported agricultural production as well as the development of education and scientific and technological undertakings. (4) Intensifying the work of financial and taxation supervision and management. Anhui has conducted a general financial and taxation inspection, a general inspection of the implementation of discipline for purchasing control, and a series of inspections of the use of special funds; further strengthened the management of capital not included in the budget; appraised properties of some selected administrative institutions; and launched the work of appraising assets. II. Draft Fiscal Budget for 1994 The guiding ideology for the budgetary arrangements for 1994 is: vigorously promote the reform of the financial and taxation system, rationalize distribution relations, and strive to ensure the smooth implementation of all measures for the reform of the economic system; actively create sources of revenue and strengthen tax collection and management according to laws to ensure a greater increase in revenue; firmly cut down general expenditures; give priority to the consideration of wages for staff and workers and indispensable expenses for case investigation and normal operations of organs, and continue to attach importance to the investment in agriculture, science and technology, education, and others; and make efforts to achieve a balance of financial revenue and expenditure to bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development as well as social stability in Anhui. (1) Draft Provincial Budget The 1994 draft budget submitted to the session for examination and deliberation is compiled by the provincial authorities. The total provincial revenue is targeted at 8.538 billion yuan, a 16.6- percent increase over the figure registered in 1993 and up 9.2 percent in terms of comparable constants [ke bi kou jing 0668 4024 0656 1777]; this includes 3.886 billion yuan in local revenue. Estimating and calculating on the basis of the revenue-sharing system, Anhui's available funds as well as its expenditures for the year are both budgeted at 7.006 billion yuan, striking a balance of revenue and expenditure for the year's budget. 1. Draft Current Budget The revenue is set at 3.3025 million yuan, up 13.8 percent in terms of comparable constants; adding the revenue subsidized by the central authorities and deducting the sum to be turned over to the central authorities, the current available funds for the year are 6.442 billion yuan. With the current expenditures for the year set at 5.8009 million yuan, the balance of current account is 641.01 million yuan in the budget. 2. Draft Construction Budget The revenue is set at 583.5 million yuan; adding the balance of current revenue for the year and others, the available construction funds for the year is 1.20501 million yuan. This strikes a balance of revenue and expenditure, with the same year's construction spending set at 1.20501 million yuan. (2) Draft Provincial-Level Budget Revenues in the provincial-level budget total 14.9 million yuan. As the financial system governing the provincial authorities' policies toward their subordinate organs has not been finalized yet, the available funds in the provincial budget for the year can only be roughly estimated at 1.4655 million yuan; a balance of revenue and expenditure is achieved in the budget, with expenditures of the year set at 1.4655 million yuan. In addition to ensuring normal expenses, this year's draft provincial and provincial-level budgets have emphatically increased the investments in agriculture, education, science and technology, and other areas. The operating expenses for agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy as well as outlays for supporting rural production and expanses for educational and scientific and technological undertakings in the provincial and provincial-level budgets are all set higher than the revenue increase in the current budget. The proportion of three scientific and technological expenses to total expenditure in the budget exceeds 1 percent. The budget for the aforementioned expenses has met the requirements of the central as well as the provincial regulations. III. Strive To Accomplish the Tasks in the 1994 Fiscal Budget Comprehensively achieving the tasks in this year's fiscal budget is an important guarantee to bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and social stability and unity in Anhui. Financial and taxation departments at various levels around the province should, under party committee and government guidance, actively promote financial and taxation reform, strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, vigorously increase revenues and control expenditures, strictly enforce financial and economic laws and discipline, and strive to promote Anhui's financial work to a new level. (1) Concentrate efforts on carrying out financial and taxation reform. Leading comrades in all localities and departments must earnestly enhance the leadership and coordination in financial and taxation reform, conscientiously organize the implementation of reform, promote it steadily, and make sure it will be successful. Presently, they should properly deal with two tasks: 1. accelerating the organization and establishment of local taxation organs, strengthening the collection and management of local revenues, and ensuring the normal operation of the new financial and taxation mechanism; and 2. studying and drafting a program for reforming financial system governing the provincial authorities' policies toward prefectures and cities as soon as possible. Meanwhile, attention should be paid to intensifying investigations and studies as well as summing up new experiences, discovering new situations, and resolving new problems in time; problems concerning the link-up of policies while shifting from one system to another should be particularly handled properly to ensure the implementation of various reform measures. (2) Continue to attach importance to expanding sources of revenues to enhance the momentum for financial development. It is necessary to actively readjust our way of thinking for creating sources of local revenues based on the changes in the distribution structure of financial resources after the revenue-sharing system is instituted, to create and expand sources of local revenues. We should continue to make the expansion of sources of county-level revenues our work focus, collect funds from various quarters, and support one more group of counties (cities) with promising conditions. (3) Strengthen revenue collection and management and make sure to increase revenue to a new level. No matter whether it's central revenue or local revenue, every penny must be collected. From this year on, state enterprises must pay income taxes to the state strictly according to applicable tax rates. The practice of leaving some revenues unregistered under the system of "distribution of total revenue" must be redressed and all receivable revenues must be collected and recorded in the budget. Agricultural and special agricultural products taxes account for a significant portion of the fixed income of localities, all localities must intensify the construction of the collection and management system in view of problems such as scattered sources of tax revenue and great difficulties in collection and management to improve collection and management. (4) Rationally arrange for and strictly control expenditure to strive for a balance between this year's revenue and expenditure. In arranging for this year's fiscal expenditure, we should first emphatically guarantee finances for personnel wages, essential case-handling expenditures, and government offices' normal operating expenses. We must try hard to ensure prompt and full payment of wages for personnel in administrative undertakings and units -- teachers in particular -- and to avoid back pay. Under this precondition, we will try hard to increase investment in agriculture, education, and science and technology. It is necessary to resolutely cut expenses on meetings, maintenance, post and telecommunications, and others and vigorously promote the fine tradition of diligence and frugality. Efforts should be made to accelerate reform of the expenditure control system; comprehensively implement zero-based budgeting; and, in conjunction with institutional reform, earnestly appraise and decide the establishment of administrative undertakings and units, fix the number of personnel according to the establishment, and check and ratify payroll against the number of personnel. (5) Take effective measures to support economic development. First, we will continue to increase investment in agriculture and, with an aim to raise peasants' income, develop the rural economy. Second, we will support state-owned enterprises in terms of policy and finances to upgrade their reserve strength of development. Third, we will vigorously support the development of the tertiary industry to foster new finances. (6) Strengthen state property management and deepen reform of the property rights system. We should center on changing state-owned enterprises' operating mechanisms, establishing a modern enterprise system, implementing a supervisory system for state property, and other central tasks to actively explore a system and methods of state property management suited to the socialist market economic system. It is necessary to take realistic and effective measures to prevent and rectify acts that are detrimental to state property rights, firmly end the drain of state property, and ensure conservation and appreciation of the value of state property. (7) Administer finances and taxation in accordance with the law and enforce financial and economic discipline. Various departments at all levels should earnestly study and implement in depth fiscal and taxation laws and regulations, persist in administering taxation and finances in accordance with the law, and manage to ensure strict observance and enforcement of the law as well as punishment of all law violations to truly carry out fiscal and taxation work within the scope of law. Fiscal and taxation departments at all levels in particular should fulfill their duties, exercise strict self-discipline, fight corruption, and promote clean administration to ensure that fiscal and taxation work is carried out properly.
