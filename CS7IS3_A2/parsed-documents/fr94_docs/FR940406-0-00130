Where a paragraph in §86.096&hyph;9 or §86.097&hyph;9 is identical and applicable to §86.004&hyph;9, this may be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved].

For guidance see §86.096&hyph;9. (b)(6) Vehicles certified to the refueling standards set forth in paragraph (d) of this section are not required to demonstrate compliance with the Fuel Dispensing Spitback standards contained in §86.096&hyph;9 (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(iii): Provided, that they meet the requirements of §86.001&hyph;28(f). (c) [Reserved]. For guidance see §86.097&hyph;9. (d) Refueling emissions from 2004 and later model year gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle and petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle light duty trucks shall not exceed the following standards. The standards apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles. (1) Standards _(i) Hydrocarbons (for gasoline-fueled Otto-cycle and petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles) . 0.20 gram per gallon (0.053 gram per liter) of fuel dispensed. (ii) Organic Material Hydrocarbon Equivalent (for methanol-fueled vehicles) . 0.20 gram per gallon (0.053 gram per liter) of fuel dispensed. (2)(i) The standards set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section refer to a sample of refueling emissions collected under the conditions as set forth in subpart B of this part and measured in accordance with those procedures. (ii) For vehicles powered by petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle engines, the provisions set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section may be waived: Provided , that the manufacturer complies with the provisions of §86.001&hyph;28(f) of this subpart.

(3)(i) All light-duty trucks of a GVWR equal to 6,000 pounds or less (100%) must meet the refueling emission standard. (ii) A minimum of the percentage shown in Table A04&hyph;09 of a manufacturer's sales of the applicable model year's gasoline- and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle and petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle light-duty trucks of 6,001 to 8,500 pounds GVW shall be tested under the procedures in subpart B of this part indicated for 2004 and later model years, and shall not exceed the standards described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Vehicles certified in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, as determined by the provisions of §86.001&hyph;28(g), shall not be counted in the calculation of the percentage of compliance.
