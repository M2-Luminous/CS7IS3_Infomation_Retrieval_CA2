We are talking straight today, here on Radio Rebelde, with journalist Renato Recio of the newspaper TRABAJADORES. The topic: the workers assemblies that are being held the length and breadth of Cuba. Renato? [Recio] Well, the assemblies are not yet being held throughout the country. Forgive me for contradicting you. [Roque] Yes, but they are indeed being held, in the sense that the pilot assemblies have been held in all provinces. That is why I say that these assemblies are already covering almost the entire country. [Recio] The process is now beginning; and, especially, what is called the preparation of the union cadres is beginning in order to improve the process of holding the meetings that have come to be called Parliament in the Workplace. So, by chance -- or rather, not by chance; because of my job, of course -- I attended yesterday the cadre-preparation assembly in Matanzas. And, well, to a certain extent, I have some fresh ideas, fresh suggestions regarding this matter, which is a very important one. [Roque] Comrade Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government, participated in that assembly. [Recio] As did Pedro Ross, secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation. Both were there the whole time, and they were very interested; and, well, they talked, participated, made important statements. In any case Juan Carlos, I am not going to try to report on that, which is a bit of news that has already been reported this morning in various media; but, rather, I am going to think a little, reflect a little, on this matter of the assemblies -- which as you know are on Cuba's financial problem, on the nation's situation -- which is quite critical from the financial point of view. And, initially, I would like to think about this matter that is being spoken of: how the measures will represent a certain amount of sacrifice. They are measures that need to be understood, and they are not measures the majority will find pleasant. Not at all. [Roque] Is that why this popular consultation is being held? [Recio] Of course, because a consensus is being sought. What is being sought is, let us say, for everyone to aspire to the same thing, despite the fact that there is a certain measure of sacrifice involved. However, I want to reflect upon this aspect: Is it a matter of a real sacrifice or of a sacrifice that is only apparent? I say this without having a conclusive answer to this question -- simply because I think that if through these measures the peso recovers, and if through these measures salaries also recover, then the problem is not how many pesos I lose through any other measure, such as, let us say, prices, taxes, etc. Rather, the question is how much can I acquire with the pesos I have, that is, with the salary that I receive. And then we see that an action can either be a sacrifice or not. It depends. If we recover the value of the peso, if the buying power of the salary is recovered, then we will all feel we are benefiting. [Roque] However, here what we call the equilibrium between supply and demand comes into play. [Recio] Exactly. [Roque] Such equilibrium does not exist at the present time. [Recio] Exactly. What we have at present is a big imbalance, that is, a very low supply and an excessive, solvent -- expressed in money -- demand. And in this connection, since you are talking to me about this, I find it interesting that now, at this Parliament in the Workplace, there are two aspects. There are two well-defined aspects, and the assembly also has to take into account equilibrium as regards these two aspects. Look. First of all, there is the fact that being discussed at the different work centers is the economic and financial situation of the work center itself, of that very place itself. And thus one has to notice how the costs are running; how the billing and paying among the different enterprises is done; whether or not there is an excess of personnel; whether resources are being diverted, whether there is any disorder in that regard; to what extent the place is being subsidized; to what extent that subsidy can be decreased; etc. And I want to tell you, Juan Carlos, that that aspect is of the utmost importance, even when the other aspect, which I am going to describe for you next, seems to be more sensational, seems to be more pleasant. [Roque] Well, let's pause a moment, and then we will describe that other aspect, here on the Straight Talk program. [Roque] We have with us today journalist Renato Recio of the newspaper TRABAJADORES, with whom we will be discussing workers assemblies -- that is, this so-called workers parliament -- which are to take place throughout Cuba, and which are at the present time being held, more or less as pilot assemblies, at several important work centers, within various important sectors of the economy. [Recio] I was saying that there are two important points. I already mentioned the first one. I repeat: The first point is the economic and financial situation of the very work center in question; and the second, which I said was perhaps more sensational. People are tempted to devote more time to this point. But the other one is very important. [Roque] Yes, of course. [Recio] It has to do with discussing and proposing possible financial measures of a general nature to reduce the budget deficit and excess liquidity that exists in the streets, in society. Now, these two points, both of them, have to do with economic and financial streamlining, because, as you recalled, there is a problem of imbalance between supply and demand. I will myself give a brief explanation, if you will so allow. [Roque] Yes. [Recio] That enormous excess of circulating currency, calculated at some 11 billion pesos, has been rising because of the imbalance between supply and demand. Everyone knows what supply is. It is the products, the articles, the services that people consume or enjoy, and which they buy. Now demand is expressed in the amount of money that people have, with which to acquire those products and services. What is happening now is that the supply is extremely limited, while the demand is gigantic. The ideal thing, and everyone realizes this, would be to resolve the imbalance by having a larger supply. That is, for there to be more products, more things to buy, more services to offer. That, of course, is solved through more work, more production, with the entire economy functioning properly, harmoniously. [Roque] Indisputably. Work creates wealth. And through work, only through work, through sacrifice, through serious production, can we get out, to a great extent, of this rut we are in. [Recio] However, -- and this must be clear -- the supply cannot at present be increased, abruptly, or quickly because, in the first place, Cuba has no external financing. [Roque] Of course. [Recio] It is well known that we are in our current crisis due to external causes. [Roque] Nor can we recover immediately. [Recio] No, we cannot do that either, because we lack hard currency. We have little hard currency, so we can provide little input to make our factories and service centers produce. In addition to this, there is this same business of excess monetary liquidity, a factor that, as everyone knows, does not exactly contribute to recovery. It is a factor that contributes instead to labor indiscipline, lack of spirit, and lack of incentive to work. We therefore must solve this problem of excessive amounts of circulating currency in order to seriously aspire to economic recovery for the nation. In that connection, I think the assemblies are making their opinions strongly known. [Roque] I believe that these base-level assemblies somewhat enhance the analysis of concrete aspects. In other words, the base level is itself seeking to solve problems at the level where responsibility for production exists. This is an important aspect of this entire debate, which will be conducted throughout the country. [Recio] In addition, we know there is room for efficiency everywhere. Unfortunately, as everybody knows, our efficiency dropped not only in the last few years; it was an ongoing process which gave rise to the rectification process. There was a process of decline in efficiency. Therefore, since we have and have had low efficiency, there is room for improvement. The problem now is to exploit our reserves, bring to them to light despite the difficult situation. [Roque] How can we encourage this? [Recio] The workers know what is happening. An experienced worker knows what is being done at his work center. He knows what should and should not be done. If we can again create an economic awareness among the workers, if we can create a political and moral awareness among the workers, we can increase production and reduce expenditures. This would be a great contribution to the streamlining of our economy. [Roque] I agree. I also believe that this process of encouragement, when the worker is being asked to produce more, must also take something important into consideration: We must create the minimum conditions in which the workers can produce. Many times this is not done because someone does not want to. The special period is blamed for many things that can [5-second break in reception] workers. [Recio] Without overlooking that there are many problems that are caused by the situation we are experiencing. [Roque] Problems caused by inefficiency, by negligence. [Recio] There are other problems that we must attack. These are problems caused by inefficiency and negligence. These are problems caused because people do not want to work. [Roque] These problems affect the situation we are talking about. [Recio] We spoke earlier about the meetings being held at the work centers. At those meetings they are discussing the problems that arise as a result of excess currency. If we were to adopt the overall measures suggested, they would only serve to alter the consequences; however, the reason for the problem is in the inefficiency at the work centers. [Roque] TRABAJADORES reporter Renato Recio is here with us on "Straight Talk." We have three minutes left to analyze what we have talked about on this program. [Recio] As I have already said, we cannot ignore the importance of the first point. Each work center must discuss its own problems. I believe this is more important than discussing whether prices go up or not, whether this or that product is taxed, whether we should seize the money the hoarders have. Now regarding the measures, we must not only listen to the workers' ideas, but also the suggestions they are making. Many of these suggestions are very good. For example, a suggestion made by La Corona Cigar Factory workers is very good. I believe it is a logical measure and worthy of discussion. The workers suggested that sick leave be restricted to a specific number of days a year. You may recall that back in the days of capitalism, some companies paid for nine days of sick leave a year and anyone who was sick for more than nine days had no rights whatsoever. [Roque] I agree with you that it is a suggestion that should be studied. However, there are some people who have certain illnesses for which nine days' sick leave would just not be enough. If this system were implemented, then the worker would not be taken care of.... [Recio, interrupts] No. [Roque] No? Then explain it to me. Explain this to me because I am against that measure. [Recio] The suggestion does not specify nine days. The suggestion does not specify the number of sick-leave days. However, if a worker is sick for longer than the authorized number of sick-leave days, then he will be covered by social security. If this suggestion was adopted, we would put an end to the problem of the medical certificates. Anyone can get a medical certificate. You can get them wholesale. Everyone uses medical certificates. Everyone has a friend or relative who is a doctor who can get the certificates. It is really a mess. [Roque] I have to agree with you on this, but we have to study this well. We must protect the rights of the worker. [Recio] I agree. Now that we are at the end of the program, we can emphatically state that the goal of the labor and social laws is to help those who need help. In our system if you need help you will get help. What we must avoid is people using the paternalistic laws to rob the other workers and the country as well. I do believe the suggestion is good. If the worker does not take any sick leave in a year, he will be paid for those days. In other words, the worker will be rewarded for not taking sick leave. Many times workers do not show up for work for reasons other than illness. They have a headache and they do not go to work. Take an aspirin and in approximately 30 minutes you will be rid of the headache. But you know what that is like. The idea is not to help for the sake of helping. The idea is to help those who truly need help. [Roque] I believe that people, people who have always supported the Revolution, know what they want and are capable of studying the appropriate measures during the parliaments and in the workplace. [Recio] I agree with you. [Roque] Renato Recio was our guest on this program.
