Miroslaw W., who was a chauffeur at the Zairean Embassy in Poland for 14 years, was taken into custody in July 1993 on the Polish-German border. The 4.7 kg of heroin was found in a suitcase supposedly covered by diplomatic immunity, and which was to go to Brussels. The drugs are estimated to have a street value of roughly 3 million German marks. Miroslaw W. testified that he was totally unaware of the contents of the suitcase, and was transporting it on orders from Boekwa Lokolo Okombe, councillor at the Zairean Embassy in Warsaw.
