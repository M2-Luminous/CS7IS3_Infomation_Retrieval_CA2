Addressing a news conference in Pretoria, Mr De Klerk said there was still hope an accord might be struck between the Alliance, the government and the African National Congress [ANC], adding there were some "sensible" proposals on the table. His indications after Tuesday's extraordinary cabinet meeting for a report-back on Monday's trilateral talks were that "they have moved relatively nearer to each other and that the differences are bridgeable". "We will continue to make every possible effort to ensure through negotiations their participation is ensured," Mr De Klerk said. He stressed there were time constraints but added the government was doing its utmost to avoid negotiations coming to an end. Failure to reach an agreement did not mean negotiations would necessarily come to an end. "If there is firm multiparty agreement, amendments to the constitution can then after the election become part of the law of the land," Mr De Klerk said. Turning to a possible boycott of the elections by the Freedom Alliance, Mr De Klerk said it would be a "most unwise" decision. The ANC had tried that with the elections of the tricameral parliament and had succeeded in bringing down the voting percentages but could not stop the three-chamber parliament which had made a tremendous contribution to the transition process, he said. "Boycotting is an 'alien' method to use for political parties when it comes to elections." The ANC had on its election list a number of people who had been "trained" in that very parliament, he added. Mr De Klerk said he intended to probe the "weak spots" reflected in the ANC's election candidate list but would not elaborate further. He said he would proclaim the elections at the "earliest possible moment".
