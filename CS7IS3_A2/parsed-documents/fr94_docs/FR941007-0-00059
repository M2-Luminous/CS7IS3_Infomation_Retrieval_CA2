ACTION: Final rule with comment period. SUMMARY: This rule establishes, for fiscal years 1994 and beyond, a minimum level of funding for grants made to States, Commonwealths, and Territories to provide individuals eligible to receive benefits under the Medicare program with information, counseling, and assistance related to obtaining adequate and appropriate health insurance coverage. It also sets forth the following in regulations: A description of the methodology used to determine the total amount of the grant award; the conditions for eligibility for the grant; limitations on the use of grant funds in certain circumstances; reporting requirements; and an opportunity to appeal our determination regarding a State's grant application. The provisions of this rule are in accordance with section 4360 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. In addition, this rule eliminates the supplemental coordinated care grants program. DATES: Effective Date: October 7, 1994. Comment Period: Comments must be received at the appropriate address, as provided below, no later than 5 p.m. on December 6, 1994. Because we intend to make grant awards before October 1, 1994, it is not possible for us to consider the comments with respect to the fiscal year (FY) 1994 grant awards. We will, however, consider the comments for grants made available in future years and, if appropriate, for the revision of the regulations established by this rule.

Background Section 4360 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101&hyph;508, and applicable appropriations authorize us to make grants to States, Commonwealths, and Territories for health insurance advisory service programs for Medicare beneficiaries. (Hereinafter, unless otherwise indicated, the term ``State'' or ``States'' includes the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.) Grant funds are available to support providing information, counseling, and assistance (ICA) relating to Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare supplemental policies, long-term care insurance, and other health insurance benefit information. Thus, this funding activity is known as the Health Insurance ICA Grants Program.
