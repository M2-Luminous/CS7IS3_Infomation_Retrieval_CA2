The demonstration, which coincided with U.S. Democratic Representative Robert Torricelli's visit to Chiapas, was intended to demand the lifting of the more than 30-year-old U.S. restrictions against the island which harm the Cuban people. Spokesmen for the solidarity organization reported the "interventionist nature" of Torricelli's presence in the country, which is intended to harm traditional relations between Mexico and Cuba. In this regard, they urged the Mexican Government not to forget the traditional policy of friendship that has been maintained with the Caribbean nation for years and they stressed that "to struggle for Cuba is to struggle for Mexico." Several of the demonstrators protested Torricelli's attitude of meddling in Mexico's domestic affairs. Torricelli stated recently that with the signing of NAFTA, the United States acquired not only the right, but also "the responsibility" of evaluating what occurs in Mexico. In a communique released this Sunday, the solidarity group also rejected the so-called "Cuban Democracy Act" of 1992 because the group considers this document to be contrary to international law. In this regard, Jose Carrillo, coordinator of the organization, told PRENSA LATINA that as part of the strategy of support for Cuba, they have presented to the Mexican Congress a petition with 13,000 signatures asking for the sale of petroleum to Cuba under preferential terms. We also seek, Carrillo added, negotiations to refine Mexican crude in Cuban installations because it is a transaction that would benefit both countries. Slogans such as "Jump if you are not a Yankee" and jeers against Torricelli characterized the rally, which ended with the symbolic burning of the law sponsored by the U.S. representative. The rally was watched by several U.S. embassy officials who refrained from going outside the diplomatic mission.
