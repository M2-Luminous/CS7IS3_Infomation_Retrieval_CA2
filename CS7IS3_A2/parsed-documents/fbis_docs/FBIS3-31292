UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Bill Aikman said 170 reinforcement troops from the UN Nordic battalion had arrived in Visoko, 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of Sarajevo, and a British battalion of some 150 soldiers equipped with about 15 armoured vehicles was on stand-by in the central Bosnian town of Vitez. He said the reinforcements requested by Rose would double the number of UN troops currently deployed in Sarajevo. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Wednesday in a BBC radio interview that Britain would not object to any of its troops being transferred to Sarajevo. "It's essentially a matter for General Rose to decide if some some troops would be more useful in Sarajevo," Hurd said. The troops would oversee a ceasefire agreement reached last week between Bosnian Serb and Moslem military leaders under the threat of a NATO ultimatum for Serbs to remove their heavy weaponry from around the Bosnian capital by midnight Sunday or face air strikes. But Russia's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Vitaliy Churkhin, said in Zagreb late Tuesday that Russian troops would not go to Sarajevo to support the NATO ultimatum, which was issued over Moscow's protests. [passage omitted] Aikman said that four sophisticated radar systems capable of detecting a mortar were also being sent here this week by France and Britain ahead of a NATO deadline for air strikes. He said France and Britain are each supplying two radars that are expected to arrive in the Bosnian capital by Sunday, the deadline for Bosnia's warring parties to surrender their heavy weapons or face NATO air strikes. In Paris, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe reiterated Wednesday that France was determined to follow through with the NATO ultimatum. He told a meeting of cabinet ministers that his trip to Sarajevo over the weekend was aimed at stressing that point to the belligerants, government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said. [passage omitted]
