FR940926-0-00020 FR940926-0-00006 We intend to recover the cost of hyperbaric treatments provided to beneficiaries as part of a course of treatment. For example, high pressure oxygenation treatments, burn treatments and decompression treatments in response to diving incidents are frequently provided. We only intend to recover the cost of providing these treatments which includes the operating cost of the chamber, i.e., labor costs, (operators and attending medical personnel), supplies, and overhead. We do not intend to include amortization of either the actual or replacement cost of the hyperbaric chamber or the building. Dental services are provided to beneficiaries on a space available basis and in remote locations. Dental services may include oral diagnosis and prevention, periodontics, prosthodontics (fixed and removable), implantology, oral surgery, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry and endodontics. The Department also provides a wide range of immunizations to Military Health Service beneficiaries, including immunizations against common childhood diseases such as measles, smallpox and diphtheria and regional endemic diseases such as yellow fever, plague and cholera. We also administer a variety of medications and test beneficiaries for allergic conditions. Immunizations costs are not included as part of the reimbursement rates for either inpatient or ambulatory care. We intend to seek reimbursement for immunizations against childhood diseases and diseases characteristic of the United States and its Territories. We will also seek reimbursement for the administration of all medications or allergy extracts, when the medication or extract is purchased by the medical treatment facility, and for the testing for allergic conditions. We do not intend to seek recovery for immunizations administered incident to overseas travel or transfer, or for those medications purchased by the beneficiary and simply administered at the medical treatment facility. The reimbursement rate shall be based on the average fully burdened cost of an immunization and a separate charge shall be applied for each immunization which is administered. D. Other Revisions We received one public comment on the proposed rule. It was from a group of organizations who objected to the provision in the proposed rule concerning PRIMUS and NAVCARE clinics. In the proposed rule, we proposed to eliminate from the Third Party Collection Program regulation the special rule regarding PRIMUS and NAVCARE clinics, which are contractor owned, contractor operated freestanding clinics under contract with DoD. Under special demonstration program authority, these clinics have functioned under rules applicable to military medical treatment facilities, including Third Party Collection program rules. With the conclusion of the demonstration project, these clinics are no longer authorized to bill third party payers under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1095 (but will continue to bill under other authority). Therefore, the change set forth in the proposed rule is necessary, and has been included in the final rule. The organizations who objected to this proposed change did so on the belief that this would terminate features of PRIMUS and NAVCARE clinics that they strongly support, including access to primary care visits without deductible or copayment requirements, and eligibility for military beneficiaries who are not CHAMPUS eligible (such as active duty members and Medicare-eligible beneficiaries). These organizations can be assured that the adoption of this final rule has no impact on those aspects of the PRIMUS/NAVCARE program. We have added one other revision to the regulation, a technical correction to section 220.8(d), which had incorrectly referred to paragraph (j) concerning a matter for which paragraph (k) is the appropriate reference. III. Regulatory Procedures This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. It will not have an impact of $100 million or other significant economic impacts. Similarly, the rule does not significantly affect a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. As stated above, for the most part, this final rule simply incorporates into the third party collection program regulation more precise cost calculation methods. In addition, this rule does not impose new information collection requirements for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 220 Claims, Health care, Health insurance. For the reasons stated in the preamble, 32 CFR Part 220 is amended as follows: PART 220_COLLECTION FROM THIRD PARTY PAYERS OF REASONABLE COSTS OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES 1. The authority citation for part 220 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 10 U.S.C. 1095. 2. Section 220.8 is amended by revising paragraph (a), the heading and first sentence of paragraph (c), and paragraphs (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (k) and (l) as follows: ยง220.8 Reasonable costs. (a) Diagnosis related group (DRG)-based method for calculating reasonable costs for inpatient services. (1) In general. As authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1095(f)(3), the calculation of reasonable costs for purposes of collections for inpatient hospital care under 10 U.S.C. 1095 and this part shall be based on diagnosis related groups (DRGs). Costs shall be based on the inpatient full reimbursement rate per hospital discharge, weighted to reflect the intensity of the principal diagnosis involved. The average cost per case shall be published annually as an inpatient standardized amount. A relative weight for each DRG shall be the same as the DRG weights published annually for hospital reimbursement rates under the Civilian Health and Medicare Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) pursuant to 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1). (2) Standardized amount. The standardized amount shall be determined by dividing the total costs of all inpatient care in all military medical treatment facilities by the total number of discharges. This will produce a single national standardized amount. The Department of Defense is authorized, but not required by this part to calculate three standardized amounts, one each for large urban areas, other urban areas, and rural areas, utilizing the same distinctions in identifying those areas as is used for CHAMPUS under 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1). (3) DRG relative weights. Costs for each DRG will be determined by multiplying the standardized amount per discharge by the DRG relative weight. For this purpose, the DRG relative weights used for CHAMPUS pursuant to 32 CFR 199.14(a)(1) shall be used.
