The sources said the angry Chinese are not satisfied with Nagano's resignation and are demanding an official apology from the Japanese Government. The Chinese are also seeking a specific guarantee from Tokyo to avoid a repetition of such remarks questioning Japan's wartime aggression, the sources said. The sources said the war victims have decided to employ the telephone tactic because it is difficult for Chinese to stage demonstrations. The sources were alluding to the arrests of over 100 Chinese for trying to demonstrate near the Japanese Embassy at the time of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to Beijing in March.
