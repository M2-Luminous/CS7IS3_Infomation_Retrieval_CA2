FR941021-1-00033 FR941021-1-00009 Discussion of the Proposal The FAA proposes to amend part 67 to incorporate additions and changes in the specific medical standards and scope of examination and in the administrative procedures pertaining to airman medical certification. The FAA also proposes to recodify and partly reorganize part 67 to improve readers' accessibility to specific standards and procedural requirements. Additional changes are proposed to improve syntax and correct errors. Section and sub-section references are adjusted as necessary to reflect additions, deletions, and reorganization. Because the proposed medical standards are not meant to be exhaustive in naming all medical conditions that are disqualifying, the word ``includes'' rather than the word ``are'' is used in each section of the medical standards. Disqualifying medical conditions are not limited to those representative conditions listed in the proposed standards. Medical conditions may be identified during an examination which are related to a specific medical category of a section in the proposed standards but are not specifically named in the standards (e.g., respiratory malignancy). These medical conditions would be considered under the General Medical Condition section of the medical standards. The proposal is based on the FAA's review of part 67, on the FAA's judgment regarding the AMA Report recommendations, and on public comment relevant to those recommendations and to the standards generally. The following discussion of the proposal presents under each subject heading a discussion of the current rule, the AMA recommendations, and the proposed rule. Also included in this preamble is a response to the comments received on the review of part 67 (Docket No. 23190). Distant Visual Acuity The current standards for applicants for first- or second-class airman medical certificates require that the uncorrected distant visual acuity be not poorer than 20/100 and the corrected acuity not poorer than 20/20 in each eye, separately. Applicants for third-class certificates are required to meet a standard of distant visual acuity of 20/50 or better in each eye, separately, without correction; or, if poorer than 20/50, a corrected distant visual acuity of 20/30. For third-class airman medical certification there is no standard for minimum acceptable uncorrected distant visual acuity. The FAA practice for many years has been to grant any class certificate requested, regardless of uncorrected distant acuity, if the required minimum vision is present or achieved through conventional corrective lenses (spectacles or contact lenses), there is no evidence of significant eye pathology, and the person is otherwise eligible. For first- and second-class certification, this has been accomplished through the special issuance process. Thousands of airmen exercising airline transport pilot, commercial pilot, private pilot, student pilot, and air traffic control tower operator certificates have demonstrated their ability to safely perform their jobs while using corrective lenses for distant visual acuity that is poorer than 20/100 in each eye. The AMA Report recognizes that the uncorrected distant visual acuity standards for first- and second-class certification may be too stringent and recommends that they be changed from 20/100 to 20/200 without offering a rationale for the specific recommendation of 20/200. The FAA notes that this recommended standard is consistent, in part, with the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In response to the AMA recommendation, in mid-1986, the agency simplified the procedure for special issuance of certification in cases where the applicant for a first- or second-class certificate demonstrates uncorrected distant vision worse than 20/100 but not worse than 20/200. AME's were given permission to evaluate applicants without further referral to eye specialists or to the agency for decision. In the absence of significant eye pathology, the AME may, after telephone coordination with the agency, issue any class certificate. Individuals whose distant vision is poorer than 20/200 can be granted certification only by the FAA, after evaluation by an eye specialist. The FAA has found through experience that safety is not adversely affected by permitting medical certification at any level of uncorrected acuity. Little, if any, disqualifying eye pathology is found through the special evaluations of applicants whose vision corrects to acceptable levels, and AME's are able to identify those whose findings suggest the need for further examination by specialists. Therefore, the FAA proposes under §§67.103(a) and 67.203(a) the deletion of the current uncorrected acuity standard for first- and second-class certification, thereby administratively simplifying the certification process and reducing costs to airmen and to the agency. The FAA intends, however, to retain the current requirement for first- and second-class certification that distant visual acuity be, or correct to, not poorer than 20/20 in each eye separately. For third-class certification the FAA proposes under §67.303(a) that the standard be amended to require a distant visual acuity of not poorer than 20/40 in each eye, separately, with or without correction. This amendment eliminates the confusing current minimum acuity standard (20/30 if corrective lenses are used and 20/50 if not used) and is consistent with safety and with the standards commonly used by state automobile driver licensing authorities. It also reflects the ICAO standards for private pilots, and it includes the AMA Report recommendation for minimum distant visual acuity without correction. Near Visual Acuity The current near visual acuity standard for first-class medical certification is expressed as ``*␣*␣* at least v=1.00 at 18 inches with each eye separately, with or without corrective glasses.'' The near visual acuity standard for second-class medical certification is based on the ability to pass a test showing that the applicant can read official aeronautical maps. Currently the rules for third-class medical certification have no near visual acuity requirements. The AMA Report recommends several revisions to the near visual acuity standards. The AMA Report points out that the current vision terminology of first-class medical certification is antiquated and unfamiliar to most AME's and ophthalmologists. The AMA also notes that the Near Vision Acuity Test Card, FAA Form 8500&hyph;1, contains letters that are to be used at 16 inches while the current standards are established for 18 inches.
