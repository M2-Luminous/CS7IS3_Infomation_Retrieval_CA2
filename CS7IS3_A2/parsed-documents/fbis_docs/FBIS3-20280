In times of crisis the Union is seen to have let its peoples down, notably by failing to act to stop the killing in Bosnia; at other times it is cast as a secretive, self-inflating bureaucracy bent on over-regulating the lives of its citizens just to keep its staff in business. It is at once too powerful and yet not powerful enough, a beast showing the strength of a bear and the timidity of a door-mouse, and both on the wrong occasions. For many, Europe has temporarily lost its bearings. Recent history helps explain why: the painful reunification of Europe has collided with the deepest recession since the 1930s, leaving the shining emblems of a bold and prosperous Europe in the 1980s looking tarnished alongside the unemployment of the l990s. As the Danes rejected Maastricht and the money-changers gambled on France doing the same, it seemed the dominoes of Europe's delicate consensus in favour of integration were falling one by one. Europe must rebuild the confidence shaken from it by recent history to face the tough decisions that history has now thrust upon it. The countries of Central and East Europe, fearful of backsliding in Russia, are knocking ever louder at the Union's door; the vexed question of monetary union is now resurfacing; Bosnia has exposed the need for a shared foreign and security policy but also the immense obstacles to achieving it; the interdependence of the world economy is calling on Europe to restore its industrial competitiveness, and seemingly unstoppable growth in Asia is telling it to do so fast. If the Union is to confront these issues with unity and resolve, it needs to carry the people with it. This, above all, means putting the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in law for the first time in the Maastricht treaty -- to work. Subsidiarity, properly practised, should defy the pro- and anti-federalists alike, for it means striking a balance between intervention and abstention, allowing decision-making to settle at the most appropriate level. It is not a static principle but one which should allow for the ebb and flow of responsibility between regional, national and European authorities, according to the need for Europeans to act alone or together at any moment. If it is to stall excessive centralisation, the burden of proof must fall on those arguing for decisions to be taken by the Union itself, and the least restrictive instrument should be used. All legislation should be screened accordingly, and no powers should be set in stone -- indeed, there may be cases where national governments have acquired the expertise to perform the task hitherto allotted to the Union just as adequately, and the reins could then be handed back to them. Knowing when to stop will, therefore, be instrumental in restoring the Union's credibility. But equally, the true application of the principle of subsidiarity means that, where acting together at European Union level enables something more desirable to be achieved more effectively, the Union should not hesitate to take the necessary action. Europe's collective achievements -- the creation of a unified market and effective single policies on competition and trade, for example -- should have proved to its detractors by now that team work at European level can enable each country to score more highly for itself than it could have done alone, however tiresome its team-mates may seem at times. Yet widespread distrust persists. The Union's duty, therefore, is not simply to accrue power when times are good and wash its hands of those responsibilities when times are bad: it is to assist governments in the search for the best level at which to take each decision, and draw ordinary people into that process. To do that, the democratic element in the European Union must be reinforced. With 12 national parliaments and one European Parliament all empowered to scrutinise European laws, Europe has considerable means of democratic expression, but much of that potential is wasted. National parliaments seldom analyse European laws with the degree of scrutiny those laws deserve. They appear to exert little influence over their ministers when the latter meet at Union level to adopt new laws. Often national and European MPs are locked in opposition, one suspecting the other of tugging policy too far towards, or away from, the centre of Europe. This need not be. For, if harnessed jointly to the decision-making wheel, they would complement each other. Through a Committee of Parliaments, national MPs could be assigned specific powers alongside their counterparts in the Strasbourg assembly, so reassuring voters that power over their lives is not ebbing abroad to bodies they did not elect. The Committee of Parliaments could ensure power was exercised at the right level and on the right legal grounds: it could watch over subsidiarity, with the power to ask the European Court of Justice to adjudicate if necessary; ensure laws have the correct legal base (a common battleground among governments fearing the Union may be growing by stealth); and check when governments consider extending the Union,s authority. Only if it realises its democratic potential can the Union face the greatest challenge: the drive to maintain efficiency as it takes in more countries. The Union,s decision-making machinery, which has hardly changed since the Community began, is already creaking under the weight of 12 countries. It will creak more loudly with 16, and grind to a halt if Europe enlarges thereafter. But to lock out Central and East European countries on these grounds is inexcusable. Instead the inter-governmental conference that is to be held in 1996 should centre on the simple, but intractable question: how should we change the way the European Union is run to enable us to admit a substantial number of new countries without the Union grinding to a halt? This involves looking at how the Union's institutions work: the Commission and the Parliament, as well as the Council of Ministers and a fresh look at the voting questions which have caused such agonised debate. But we would also have to widen our analysis if the countries of East and Central Europe were to be absorbed into the Union in due course. The collapse of communism is forcing a more sharply focused consideration of Union policy towards its Eastern neighbours. The question is no longer one merely of foreign policy -- it is central to the future of the Union itself. The loss of Soviet markets made East Europeans look west for business but the threat of Russian nationalism is sharpening their demand for membership of the European fold, in economic, political and security terms. War in Europe, too, is forcing Nato to confront the need for its European members to develop a more autonomous security policy within the alliance, as Soviet might gives way to smaller, less easily identifiable security threats closer home. The old dichotomy between reinforcing the European pillar of Nato and maintaining the transatlantic link is withering away as the U.S. encourages Europe's autonomy within the Western European Union [WEU] and France begins to shed its staunchly independent view of defence. Developing a true European pole within Nato, but one also capable of acting outside it under the WEU, is now realistic and should be encouraged. The European Union should also gradually lift its remaining barriers to trade from the East, while urging East Europe to adopt competition and other market rules similar to its own. Yesterday those countries needed aid and advice on how to build a market economy; today they also need investment and the infrastructure and economic stability to attract it as painful reforms take root. The West's role must also be made more visible, to help prevent people turning their back on those reforms. Ultimately it is economic prosperity that will weld the continent together, leading to a joint political future in one Union, each country in its own time. Prosperity is also the most effective agent of integration in West Europe -- a lesson apparent from the lack of support for European integration as the recession and unemployment bite. The Union will sink or swim on its ability to restore the competitiveness of its economy. Through its role as "steward" of Europe, the Union must establish order among a series of often competing priorities -- for example, the protection of Europe's rural communities while encouraging agriculture to compete without excessive subsidies; or the creation of a social safety net which does not stifle industry; or the need to close the wealth gap by bringing poor countries up to richer ones, and not vice versa. Any attempt to muddle through -- merely to "manage" these issues rather than to introduce real reform where necessary will not work. The reason is that one priority thwarts all others: the need to compete on world markets. Only a detailed and dispassionate analysis of Europe's economic woes can find a common cure. This process has begun with the Commission's white paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment. It is clear the Union must pursue existing policies with renewed vigour, for example by completing the single market; loosening the grip that monopolies still hold over Europe's transport, energy and communications networks, while channelling private capital more smoothly into those networks; and ensuring that we and our competitors abide by the stringent new trade rules agreed in the Uruguay Round. We also need improved research to turn good ideas into market-beating exports; to encourage the growth of small companies and entrepreneurship; to reduce state subsidies to ailing enterprises; and to ensure more efficient spending of the Union budget, not just by quashing fraud but also by shifting staff more quickly to confront new challenges. Of the cures, two of the most potent are also among the most controversial. First Europe has to improve the versatility of its workforce. This does not mean neglecting health and safety, or hiring and firing for short-term gain; rather, it means removing rigidities which discourage employers from creating jobs, and correcting the mismatch between the skills people learn and those they require for the posts available. The Union itself can remove barriers to workers seeking jobs abroad; provide "marriage guidance" for industries looking for the most suitable training schemes in Europe; and help distill conflicting national views on social policy into common principles upon which European industry can rely, not through coercion but through debate. This will help governments shift their focus away from merely protecting old industries towards propagating new ones. Secondly, the European currency crisis has not destroyed the Continental consensus in favour of a single currency, although it has shifted the debate over how to achieve it and by when. Far from exploiting their monetary freedom after the crisis, most EU countries have followed fiscal and monetary policies consistent with the approach laid down in Maastricht. In fact they have not used the greater freedom given to them by the wider band in the revised ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism]. It might be however, that the best way of achieving EMU [European Monetary Union] would be to seek agreement on a trans-Union non-inflationary monetary target, and for each country to be able to lower interest rates provided this would not risk breaching that target. This might mean more rapid emergence from recession and a pattern of exchange rates based on economic fundamentals which could, in due course, provide the basis for a single currency. That goal seems to me to be as valid and as attainable as ever, even if by slightly different means. It is ironic that people are most tempted to spurn the European Union when their countries, need for it is greatest. Grafting a split continent back together is no mean feat, particularly when it forces radical change to the structure of the European house and brings fresh competition to an economy grappling with recession. The overarching aim must be to achieve that unity while assuring Europe's place in an ever more competitive world. It can only be done by a Union that is democratic, transparent and restrained enough in its actions to be confident and deserving of the public support it needs.
