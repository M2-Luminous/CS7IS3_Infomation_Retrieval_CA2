He said in part: [Begin Kravchuk recording in Ukrainian, fading into English translation] The 1993 year was a difficult year for all of us. However, we succeeded in preserving three priceless things: peace, the integrity of our land, and democracy. Thanks to our peace-loving policy, flexibility, and wisdom of our people, we managed to preserve good neighbors and friends abroad. And now we have every ground to say that peace reigns supreme under each Ukrainian roof, in every Ukrainian home, throughout our great Ukrainian land. Although we cannot boast of much success in economic reforms, but [as heard] the first serious steps have been taken. For instance, we succeeded in building the efficient armed forces which are capable of defending our sovereign state. Serious reforms have taken place in education, as well as in other spheres of our life. The Ukrainian Government and the Verkhovna Rada [Supreme Council] have done their best to stop the further development of crisis in economy and policy. In this connection I would like to call upon all the Ukrainian people, political parties, and movements, as well as the structures of executive and legislative power, to unite their efforts for a successful settlement of the crucial problems in our life. First of all, we have to find a just solution to the nuclear arms problem. We have to settle the issue concerning the Black Sea Fleet, which prevents us from establishing good-neighborly relations with Russia. I am sure that our northern neighbor will have enough wisdom and goodwill to continue cooperation with us in the name of the successful solution of these acute problems. Let's unite our efforts in our striving for peace, democracy, and friendship. I wish every Ukrainian family strong health, happiness, and well- being. Happy New Year! [end recording] [Announcer] That was a New Year address to the people of Ukraine made by President Leonid Kravchuk.
