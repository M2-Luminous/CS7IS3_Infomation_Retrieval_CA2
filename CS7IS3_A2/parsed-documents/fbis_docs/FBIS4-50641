U.S. President Clinton sent a special envoy to China to exchange views with the Chinese side a few days ago. It is believed that this is helpful for China and the United States to understand better each other's stances and for the solution of the issue. The most-favored-nation statue was originally only a common practice in international trade and was not related to politics. The United States has given the most-favored-nation status to many countries on the basis of mutual benefit. Some of these countries have a political system quite different from that of the United States, and their concepts of culture and values are also entirely different from those of the United States. In some of these countries, for example, the women still have no right to vote even today. The legal procedures of some of these countries are also different from those of the West. However, the United States has never linked these questions with the most-favored-nation status of these countries. It can thus be seen that the United States has linked the issue of human rights or the Tibet issue with China's most-favored-status entirely out of the political need of exerting pressure on China. This is an expression of hegemony and power politics, and this has naturally met with China's resolute opposition. Chinese Premier Li Peng told visiting Brzezinski, former U.S. National Security Advisor, a few days ago, that China does not seek a sphere of influence in the world and does not practice hegemony, and China resolutely opposes other countries practicing hegemony and power politics toward China; China does not export its ideology or value concepts to other countries, nor does it allow other countries to impose their ideology and value concepts on China; and China respects the internal affairs of other countries and does not agree to practices of other countries of interfering in China's internal affairs or their attempts to change the course of development of China. These remarks by Premier Li Peng have explicitly expressed the stance of the Chinese Government. The U.S. Government should seriously study their meaning, proceed from the overall situation of peace and development of the world, and properly handle U.S.-Chinese relations. The "Shanghai Communique" signed between China and the United States in 1972 put forward in an international diplomatic document for the first time the idea of opposing hegemony, and it has a far-reaching significance. Opposing hegemony is an important principle of China's diplomacy. China does not seek hegemony and also opposes other countries seeking it. A country which keeps talking about human rights should first of all not practice hegemony in international affairs. Hegemony is the most serious infringement on human rights. The United States, for example, involved itself in the war in Vietnam in the past and brought great hardships to the Vietnamese. The American people also suffered a great deal. Other examples were the invasions by the USSR of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan in the past. They were denounced by the whole world. This kind of large-scale hegemonic acts of aggression seriously hampered the normal social and economic life of the invaded countries and encroached upon the national dignity of other countries. The cold war is over, but hegemony has not disappeared from the scene. It has been expressed in different ways, particularly in the field of economy and trade. In his talks with Brzezinski, Li Peng put forward a viewpoint that the fact that China takes economic construction as the center and pursues an independent foreign policy of peace should be the basic starting point for foreign observers to understand China. China has a population of 1.2 billion people, and the governing of such a big country should naturally be based on the interests and desires of the overwhelming majority of the people. Only in a stable social environment will China be able to concentrate its attention on economic construction, and this is China's greatest contribution to the world's development and peace. If the views of an individual personality are taken at every turn as the basis for observing China, the view of the important will be overshadowed by the trivial and an erroneous conclusion will be made. Since Clinton assumed office, his policy toward China has appeared to be more realistic than at the time of the election. Last year, he again held a summit meeting with China, which has created conditions for seeking common ground, while reserving differences, and for developing relations between the United States and China. At a meeting with Vice Premier Zou Jiahua not long ago, Clinton expressed the hope of seeing a strong, stable, and prosperous China. More and more people in U.S. political and commercial circles demand that the authorities unhook the human rights issue from trade and give China long-term most-favored-nation trade status. The Chinese Government has also stated clearly that the channels for exchanges between China and the United States are open, and the two countries also often exchange views on various issues. So long as the U.S. side gives up hegemony and power politics, Sino-U.S. relations will improve and develop and this conforms to the interests of the international community.
