Finance Minister Cesar Robalino said: We must pay financial organizations whether we have a crisis or not. Asked what will happen to the debt with commercial banks, the minister said: We will see what happens but at this moment, we are not paying the commercial debt or its interest. Ecuador has an overall foreign debt that surpasses $12.550 billion of which $6.5 billion are contracted with commercial banks and the rest with Western governments and international financial organizations. For the past year, Ecuador has been negotiating a program to reduce and refinance the debt. It has also been negotiating an adjustment agreement with the IMF, but it has been unsuccessful in both cases. Meanwhile, government officials predicted that the impending fiscal crisis prompted by the drop in crude prices will not have grave effects on the foreign debt negotiations. On Wednesday, Finance Minister Robalino told reporters that Ecuador will continue to pay what it owes international financial organizations regardless of a crisis. Robalino, who heads the debt negotiations team, added that one will have to see what happens in the relations with the creditor banks. However, he stressed, the suspension of debt payments that became effective in May 1992, will remain in effect. In addition, Central Bank Manager Augusto De la Torre said that the government strategy is to avoid, at any expense, a fiscal imbalance and the reactivation of inflation. He noted that this will allow Ecuador to guarantee a good understanding with creditors. De la Torre said that he hopes that the fiscal crisis will not affect the debt negotiations. The government is bent on avoiding a fiscal imbalance and in the wake of Congress' approval of the budget, it will have to think of more profound cuts in expenditures. He added that the government is firm in its objective to avoid a fiscal imbalance and if this is attained, and I hope it will be, he said, then we will get IMF approval for our country's economic program.
