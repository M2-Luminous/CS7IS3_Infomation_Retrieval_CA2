We have enough banks today too. But a bank for the publishing sector is a unique phenomenon. The major publishers of the past--Sytin, Sveshnikov--relied on their private capital. And indeed, Izdat-Bank is the one and only financial institution of publishers today in the world. Why do they have a bank? With this question we began our conversation with Ivan Petrovich Korovkin, president of Izdat-Bank. [Korovkin] The entire old system of banking services collapsed in five years, and the mass media confronted the problem: With what do we go to the market? Usually people go there with their intelligence and a ruble in their pocket. But where is the poor publisher to obtain money? So the concept was born of establishing a sector bank. The founders were the Russian State Committee on the Press, Ukraine State Committee for Publications, Republic of Belarus Ministry of Information, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA publishing house, and others. They attempted to take into account the specific interests of the sector, developed a mechanism for supporting publication programs, created conditions for protecting the interests of investors, and gradually the editorial offices of 400 newspapers and magazines began opening up current accounts with us. [Levina] What about the banks that used to hold their money? [Korovkin] Some 114 banks were just about all at once deprived of steady clients--this does not come easy. We are trying to justify such a decision on the part of editorial offices and provide high-quality service. According to data from the Reyting agency, our bank is in the top 100 of Russia's largest banks. The annual balance-sheet turnover of Izdat-Bank is just short of half a trillion rubles. But this is not the main service we provide. Our assistance has enabled publishers to safeguard themselves from landslide devastation and bankruptcy. We have made conscientious outlays, and if a choice was presented whether to aid "our own" or "others," preference was shown to those connected with printing and publishing. They were afforded credits on preferential terms. We do not receive payment for opening current and settlement accounts. The interest rate for deposits in our bank is 300-310 percent. A client has the right to withdraw a portion of his investment at any time. [Levina] It is said about banks that they are the circulatory system of the economy. Our economy is gravely ill. Are the banks not at least somewhat to blame for this? [Korovkin] Banks constitute the only genuine market element of our economy. And for some reason it is they the state is ruining, choking them with taxes, leaving them no funds for investments. And this is one reason for the current wave of bank collapses. A second reason is reciprocal nonpayments. Banks are bearing tremendous losses due to untimely return of extended credits--they themselves are turning into debtors. The delinquent indebtedness of Izdat-Bank has increased 5.7-fold as of 1 January 1994, although the bank is replete with professionals who used to work in the Ministry of Finance, USSR Gosbank [State Bank]... [Levina] Sometimes it seems that all our bankers and other prominent individuals in the business world--they all originate in the ministries... [Korovkin] A misplaced irony. The system of bank formation we have in Russia is just now being established. We are sending young and willing specialists for instruction and on-the-job training in the United States, Austria, and Japan. [Levina] Forgive me, but what is the benefit to us journalists by virtue of the fact that there is an Izdat-Bank in Russia? [Korovkin] We opened up accounts for the families of journalists who died in Moscow during the events of 3 and 4 October--accounts of one million rubles per family. Through financing we have supported the international book fair. We allocated funds for publication of the Russian-French magazine VIS-A-VIS. Until the Fund for Financial Support for Needy and Novice Authors is established, writers and journalists need not be ashamed to turn to us for assistance. Right now we are materially supporting the Russian classicist Leonid Leonov, who is 95 years old. He continues to work. He is writing a philosophical novel and is in critical need of funds. [Levina] To the best of our knowledge, you yourself are now in need of money? [Korovkin] I would not put it so strongly. We assumed responsibility for the accounting operations regarding budget financing of newspapers and magazines. We tried to establish control over the use of these funds and get an effective arrangement for knocking these funds loose from the Ministry of Finance. And then--we encountered opposition from officials of the Operations Directorate of the Russian Central Bank. They have been doing everything possible to impede the transfer of budget funds to the legal disposal of the sector bank. Intervention by the Ministry of Finance, the government, and even the president himself--have failed to produce a positive result. The Central Bank usurped the right to dispose of your money and ours. And this is R70 billion. Will we get this money? [Levina] And after you--will we journalists get any money? And after us--will our readers get their newspapers and magazines? At the end of this rhetorical question let us not put a period, but an ellipsis...
