French Prime Minister Balladur had suggested such a pact to help defuse border and minority problems that could lead to conflicts in Central and East Europe. Following initial doubts about the use of such a comprehensive stability pact for the Central and East European states wishing to join the European Union [EU], the EU agreed to the French proposal last December. Now the EU considers this to be one of its first "joint actions" since the Maastricht Treaty came into force. The pact will not take the form of an international legal document, but of a declaration of intent. Bilateral and regional negotiations are to precede the document and will be completed in about a year. Taking part in the Paris conference will be the foreign ministers of the EU, Central and East European states, the United States, Russia, and other members of the CSCE. Prior to Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's departure for Paris, the Foreign Ministry in Bonn said on Wednesday that basically all 53 CSCE member states could participate in the pact. But the EU will first concentrate its efforts on those Central and East European states that can expect to join the EU in the foreseeable future. After the opening conference, national minority issues and cross-border cooperation are to be discussed at "regional desks." The EU and other interested countries will have to participate in these. The CSCE will have to fulfill a special task in this, the Foreign Ministry said. Bonn said the Federal Government regards the French proposal as supporting measures to move Central, East, and southern European states closer to existing European structures, such as the EU and the Council of Europe. Balladur is right in considering border and minority issues as the key problem in European unification. The events in former Yugoslavia illustrate this. What will be difficult, however, is putting the plan into practice. So far, the ideas are still somewhat vague. Prime Minister Balladur is thinking of a system of agreements between neighboring states, like the one that was established in West Europe after World War II. It is a matter of combining individual bilateral agreements that are binding under international law into a "stability pact for Europe" that would not be legally binding as such. Germany will have the task of helping to achieve this during its EU presidency starting on 1 July. German efforts in Europe continue to concentrate on moving the states of Central and East Europe closer to the EU; the enlargement of European authorities should not delay this process. The "stability pact" is only part of the aspect. It is obvious that border and minority questions have to be clarified before new members can join the EU, the Foreign Ministry said.
