Large proportions of this money will be spent to pay for the vote itself. The strategies being followed for the information campaigns vary tremendously in the three countries concerned. In Sweden, it is expected that the "Yes" campaigners will contribute most in the form of support from the SAF [Swedish Employers' Confederation] and also the business sector. In Norway, it may be the "No" voters who free up the most funds in the form of contributions from the Norwegian farmers' movement. Meanwhile, in Finland both the "No" and the "Yes" camps are encouraging restraint with regard to campaign funds. Low Finnish Budget "Low budget" is the watchword when Finland votes on the EU on 16 October. The vote itself will cost the state Kr135 million, and only Kr17 million will be split up between more than 30 different organizations which are fighting for or against membership, or merely want information about the EU. More than 30 organizations fighting for "Yes," "No," or merely wanting information about the EU have so far received state subsidies for their activity, albeit not much, for a mere Kr3 million has already been distributed. However, a further Kr14 million will be released this summer. In addition to the Kr17 million which the state will give to the campaign organizations, the "Yes" campaigners can count on receiving substantial support from the Finnish business sector's employers' and industrial organization, TT. "However, there will not be any larger sums than that," said TT President Johannes Koroma, who has already paid out Kr7 million for various publications. This surprising piece of news on the "Yes" side is well-founded, partly because industry is terrified of repeating the abortive nuclear power lobbying of last year, and partly because it has learned from the mistakes made at the time of the first EU referendum in Denmark. In both cases, industry's massive lobbying backfired and led to the opposite result to the one intended. "I think Sweden began the whole EU debate too soon," said Leif Fast, who is president of the business sector's "Ekonomiska Informationsbyran" [Economic Information Office] in Helsinki, which is handling lobbying and information about the EU on behalf of the TT: "The people will not be interested so many months from now," he maintained. Most for Norwegian "No" When the Norwegian people wake up on 29 November, a good Kr150 million will have been spent in an attempt to convince Ola and Karl to vote -- and how to vote -- regarding Norway's membership of the European Union. It will cost one half of this sum, a good Kr70 million, to hold the referendum in Norway. The rest will be gleefully spent by the "Yes" and "No" movements on their campaigns over the six months between now and the vote. Today, Friday [27 May], the government will present its proposal on the EU. It will contain the date for the referendum, 27-28 November. The proposal will also suggest the state's contribution to the various groups of campaigners. This has been estimated at being as high as between Kr15 and 20 million to be evenly distributed. The "No" movement is the rich cousin from the countryside, whereas the three "Yes" groups are having a rough time of it with thin wallets. The farmers -- both privately and via their organizations -- are the largest contributors. Recently every member of Norges Bondelag [Norwegian Farmers' Union] was asked to cough up Kr400. The money will virtually all go into the coffers of the "No" campaigners. In some counties [fylkar] the dairies are giving their employees time off to work for the "No" campaign, and the contributions of the 130,000 members have already been used up. "Every county [fylke] (administrative province) has its own organization which receives its own money from regional contributors. It is hard to estimate what that will produce. Our campaign is costing us approximately Kr40 to 50 million, including the funds provided by the state. We have around Kr18.5 million saved up," said Kjell Erik Kallset, the information chief of the "No to the EU" movement. "We are hoping to drum up a total of Kr30 million, one third of which will come from the state, another one third from the NHO [Norwegian Employers' Organization], and the rest from other contributors," said Frank Rossavik, speaking on behalf of the three "Yes" groups. Swedish SAF Campaign In Sweden, the "Yes" and "No" campaigns for the referendum on the EU will cost considerably more than in the other countries, and even more than the information campaigns associated with the referendum on nuclear power did -- where the information costs totalled approximately Kr98 million. By the time of the referendum on 13 November, the "Yes" and "No" campaigners will have spent a little more than Kr100 million of state money. On top of this comes the contribution to the "Yes" campaigners from the SAF and the business sector, for which the figure of Kr200 million has been mentioned. According to the proposal that has just been tabled, the state will hand out Kr60 million in direct information funds. Other state funds for information purposes include the Falldin delegation, which has so far distributed Kr50 million in general information resources.
