They were reacting to an open letter received on Tuesday [April 12] by Zieleniec from the Vietnamese Renewal Party whose main goal is installing democracy in Vietnam. The Czech section of the party added to the letter a list of almost 150 people imprisoned in Vietnam for their religious convictions or for expressing disagreement with the Vietnamese government. The section expressed its disappointment that articles in the Czech press about Czech leaders' recent visits to Vietnam did not mention human rights breaches in that country. Swedish Premier Carl Bildt and Australian Premier Paul Keating, during their recent visits to Vietnam, pointed to the violation of human rights and freedoms in Vietnam. Keating who was a subject of pressure from the strong Vietnamese community in his country, pointed to the Vietnamese leadership approach towards religious and political dissidents. Nevertheless Keating made it clear that human rights were only one topic for discussion and that they should not influence relations between Australia and Vietnam. Hanoi is usually irritated when this side of the life of Vietnamese society is pointed at and considers it interference into its internal affairs. Zieleniec will start his three-day official visit to Vietnam on April 16. From Vietnam he travel to Malaysia and Australia.
