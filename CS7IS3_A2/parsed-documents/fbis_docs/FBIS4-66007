The commissioner for external political relations said "this Security Council should supply planning and analysis at an EU level. This would then form the basis for the decisions taken by ministers in foreign and security policy fields." "The Council should supply means to deal with crisis situations which threaten the EU," Van den Broek said. Van den Broek made his proposal at a seminar about the future of the EU's joint foreign and security policies. The seminar was organized by the Clingendael Netherlands Institute for International Relations. "An adequate planning and analysis mechanism is," Van den Broek stressed, "a requirement for foreign policies which not only react, but also anticipate." The absence of such a mechanism is in his view one of the causes of the EU policies' failure in the former Yugoslavia. Another cause is too many "declarations which promise more than can be realized," the commissioner said. Van den Broek also proposed a more effective working method for the so-called "troika." At present, the "troika" comprises the foreign ministers of the past, present, and future presidencies of the Council of Ministers. The commissioner said that "the troika can become more effective if it comprises the ministers of a large and a small EU country and a representative of the European Commission." "Such a set-up can be achieved by a change in the classification of the EU member states," according to Van den Broek.
