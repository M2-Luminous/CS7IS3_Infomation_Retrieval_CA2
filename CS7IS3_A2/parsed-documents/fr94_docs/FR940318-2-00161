FR940318-2-00161 FR940318-2-00091 Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations; Notice of Meeting AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, Labor. ACTION: Notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: The Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations was established in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) Public Law 92&hyph;463. Pursuant to section 10(a) of FACA, this is to announce that the Commission will meet at the time and place shown below. TIME AND PLACE: The meeting will be held on Wednesday, April 6, 1994 from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in room N&hyph;3437 A&hyph;D, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC. AGENDA: In the face of increasing public regulation of the workplace, and in view of the level of conflict, the meeting will be concerned with the extent to which workplace problems can be directly resolved by the parties themselves, or through alternative dispute resolution methods, rather than through recourse to litigation and regulatory bodies. The morning panel will be comprised of representatives from management and labor and from civil rights and civil liberty organizations. The afternoon session will be comprised of academics concerned with alternative dispute resolution of private disputes and those under public recognition. A period has been reserved between the two panels for a presentation on pay equity concerns of women's organizations. The members of the panels will each be allotted ten minutes of prepared presentations and then engage in discussion of the issues with each other and with members of the Commission. Public Participation The meeting will be open to the public. It will be in session from 9:30 a.m. until 12 noon when it will adjourn for lunch and will return at 1:30 p.m. Seating will be available to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.
