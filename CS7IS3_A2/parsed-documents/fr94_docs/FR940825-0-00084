FR940825-0-00084 FR940825-0-00016 IV. Regulatory Impact Analyses Executive Order 12866 In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. ( Note: HHS had previously listed this rule as a significant rule in its ``Semiannual Regulatory Agenda,'' published in the Federal Register on April 25, 1994, 59 FR 20325. When OMB issued the revised final Circular A&hyph;110 in November 1993, HHS originally considered the possibility that its rule adopting the Circular's provisions might constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined in Executive Order 12866, especially in view of HHS's general policy of following the APA's notice and comment procedures even when that statute does not require us to do so. Upon further review of the Circular, this implementing rule and its long regulatory history, and before the April 25, 1994 Federal Register notice, HHS had determined that this rule is not ``significant'' because it essentially updates HHS grant administration rules which have been in place for many years. Regrettably, HHS was unable to delete this item from the regulatory agenda before publication of the notice. Notwithstanding its inclusion in that agenda, this rule is not a ``significant'' rule within the meaning of the Executive Order.) Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this interim final rule before publication and, by approving it, certifies that it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act In keeping with the requirements of 44 U.S.C. 3504(h), the information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by OMB as Standard Forms or HHS adaptations of Standard Forms with the following assigned clearance numbers: SF&hyph;269: 0348&hyph;0039; SF&hyph;424: 0348&hyph;0043; and PMS&hyph;270 and 272: 0937&hyph;0200.
