"The representative office is expected to be inaugurated very soon," Aleksey B. Remizov said. "We've discovered a suitable office here in Taipei." The commission is authorised to handle private exchange [words indistinct] Russia and Taiwan in the absence of official diplomatic ties. Initially, the representative office will not be authorized to issue visas directly to Taiwan citizens wanting to visit Russia. All the visa applications it receives here will be forwarded to Russia's consulate in Hong Kong for approval, according to Remizov. The office will have approximately eight employee, with half of them locals, Remizov said. There was earlier talk of setting up the long-awaited representative office, but none of the reports turned out to be true due to financial difficulties. "The budget to finance the establishment of the office was approved about a month ago," an elated Remizov said. Remizov, who arrived here last Friday and will stay here for three weeks is concurrently the president of the privately funded Scientific-Technical Center [word indistinct] in Russia.

He is optimistic about bilateral economic ties. Two-way trade between the two countries hit a record US$450 million in 1992, and that's doubled to US$900 million in 1993. The figure is anticipated to top US$1 billion this year. Still, he was reluctant to cover the slow progress on the other spectrum of bilateral ties, repeatedly stressing that Nikolai I. Ryzkov, the former prime minister of the Soviet Union, was visiting Taipei to handle that aspect of the relationship. Remizov also ruled out the possibility of any arms deals between Taipei and Moscow, apparently for fear of affecting ties with Beijing. "The export of weapons from Russia is under tight control," he emphasized.
