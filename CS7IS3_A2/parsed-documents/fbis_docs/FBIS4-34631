FBIS4-34631 "drlat120_s_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 Uruguay Roundup of Economic Reports Roundup of Economic Reports PY2006161194 PY2006161194 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 16 June. According to the Central Bank, the central government registered a $15 million deficit in April compared with a $24 million surplus in the same month last year. Tax revenues declined 2.2 percent and export earnings fell 5 percent due to tariffs cuts. The government's surplus in the first four months of the year shrank to $14.1 million compared with the $103 million surplus in the same period in 1993. The reason is that government spending increased 11.7 percent in real terms in the first four months of the year compared with the same period last year. Social security expenditures, which represent 41.3 percent of the government's current expenditures, showed the highest increase -- 23 percent. Investments rose 45 percent, totaling $120 million in four months.

They increased $21.2 million in May, thus totaling $1.28 billion. This performance indicates that despite the growing trade deficit the balance of payments continues to show a surplus, which amounted to $78 million in May. The two main factors that accounted for the rise in reserves were a $35 million increase in banking system deposits in the BCU and the net purchase of $23.5 million in foreign exchange by the BCU. Despite the increase in net international reserves in May, the BCU foreign exchange position registered a $4.5 million contraction last month, declining to $44.6 million. The BCU Monetary Balance also reported that the money supply contracted in May due to a reduction in net domestic credit, which was prompted by the increase in the banking system deposits in the BCU. (Montevideo BUSQUEDA in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p 31) Industrial production was down 18.1 percent in the first quarter of the year. Excluding oil refining, which has been paralyzed since April 1993, the contraction in industrial production was 5.9 percent by volume. The sharpest decline was in "chemical substances," mainly due to the aforementioned paralyzation. The drop in the employment rate is seen in both the 12.6 percent decline in hours worked as well as the 13.6 percent shrinkage in hired workers. This is especially significant in the "textiles, garments, and leather industry."

The gross debt, however, increased $77 million, totaling $4.369 billion at the end of March. Liabilities in the nonfinancial public sector were $3.7466 billion. Loans to the central government and government-owned enterprises accounted for more than half this amount while liabilities from the issuance of public securities in foreign currency accounted for the remaining $1.558 billion.
