The leader of the Crimean Republicans, who won approximately 40 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential elections, while speaking in favor of an independent Republic of Crimea "which would maintain multi-faceted ties with Ukraine and, independently of these ties, would determine the forms of economic relations with Russia," thought that the sympathies of the population of the peninsula are on the side of the "Russia" opposition bloc which he represents. Yuriy Meshkov pointed out that the rest of the votes were distributed between the supporters of the Communist and Russia Parties. He noted that "not a single external force is capable of upsetting our progress toward closer relations with the republics of the former USSR and uniting the Russian and Ukrainian peoples." Yuriy Meshkov is convinced that his voters would be able to consolidate their positions in the second round of the elections and ensure a victory in the presidential race for the leader of the Crimean republicans. Replying to the ITAR-TASS correspondent's question about the reasons behind the increase in crime in Crimea since the murder of Andrey Lazebnikov, head of the Black Sea Fleet's press service at the end of 1993, Yuriy Meshkov said that these "are the consequences of the full atrophy of the present Crimean leadership and its inability to maintain law and order in the region." In the event of his victory in the presidential elections the leader of the Crimean republicans promises "to establish order and eliminate organized crime in the peninsula." In Yuriy Meshkov's view, the implementation of the tripartite agreement on the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine signed in Moscow on 14 January by the presidents of Russia, the United States, and Ukraine, would make it possible "to significantly reduce tension in the world and contribute to strengthening nuclear security throughout the world." Commenting on the removal of Ivan Yermakov from the post of the Ukrainian president's representative in Sevastopol, Yuriy Meshkov told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that this decision was made by the Ukrainian leadership "out of political motives." At the same time, he noted, "Yermakov who has been enrolled in the staff of the Black Sea Fleet, should be proud of this appointment." It is known that Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander of the fleet, issued an order on 20 December enrolling under his command the former representative of the Ukrainian president in Crimea.
