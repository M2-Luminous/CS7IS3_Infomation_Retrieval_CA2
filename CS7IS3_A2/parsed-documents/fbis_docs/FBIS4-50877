Addressing an American Chamber of Commerce lunch here Friday [20 May] following his recent Beijing trip, Howe also said China's economic progress had given some assurance to the people of Hong Kong about their future. Meanwhile, he warned that a decision by the United States to revoke China's most-favored nation (MFN) trading status would hit Hong Kong much heavier. "Curtailment of MFN status would provoke China as much as a bee-sting, and damage Hong Kong as much as a sledgehammer," he said.
