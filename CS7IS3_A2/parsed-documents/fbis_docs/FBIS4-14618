(Jeurling), World Bank representative in the Baltic states. According to him, the World Bank is determined to extend new credits, the first of which will be for the restructuring of the banking and finance system. At a press conference on Wednesday [23 March], L. Jeurling denied the rumor that the World Bank had ceased the preparation of a new loan for the finance sector. According to him, the key goal of the bank is to prepare the environment for all foreign credits coming into the country. The reorganization of the central and commercial banks is a long process, and the World Bank has decided not to wait until the entire system changes. The World Bank will select a few, in his opinion, most suitable commercial banks and participate in lending World Bank finances to enterprises. L. Jeurling maintained that the activities of the World Bank in Lithuania were the most dynamic among all former USSR countries. Currently, the World Bank is actively working on five or six new credit projects to finance important efforts in agriculture, energy, finance, and environmental protection (a water and waste treatment plant in Klaipeda), as well as in construction.
