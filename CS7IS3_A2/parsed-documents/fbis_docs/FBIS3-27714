But sooner or later the premier is going to have to take action to resolve the case which has stirred the nationalistic fervor of Cambodians and scared foreign investors. The dispute centers around Thai Bun Rung, a Hong Kong based- company which has been portrayed as a-Thai concern and was awarded a 15 year contract by the former Phnom Penh-based regime to renovate the state owned Olympic Market. Vendors who used to operate at the market for nominal fees have expressed outrage at the company's demands for rents that run from $400 a year to several thousand dollars. To press their demands, the vendors have staged noisy demonstrations in the capital Phnom Penh and have won varying levels of support from Finance Minister Sam Rangsi and King Norodom Sihanouk. The row also has far reaching political implications and threatens to further strain relations between the two largest coalition government partners, Ranariddh's Funcinpec Party and the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), which has been a large beneficiary of company owner Teng Bunma. Ranariddh himself has also been touched by Teng Bunma's largess and was the recipient of a $1.5 million airplane last year. The gift has raised eyebrows and questions over Ranariddh's motives in seeking to quell the protests. But with the political temperature rising to dangerously high levels, action was needed to cool down tempers and restore the confidence of both existing foreign investors or the potential ones, who are vital to the development of this economic backwater. By attacking the Thai Bun Rung consortium and many other existing foreign companies over dubious deals that were struck with the CPP, and pressing for the revision to their contracts, the Funcinpec side of the government is capitalizing on nationalist sentiment to enhance its popularity. At least one of three protests against Thai Bun Rung was believed to have been engineered by a Funcinpec minister. However, this political strategy which effectively sent the party to victory against the rival CPP in the UN-supervised elections last May will this time work against Funcinpec and consequently the government's stability if it is allowed to continue. There is good reason to believe that there is something in the coup rumours which began circulating less than a month after the coalition government assumed office in August. It is true some of the foreign businessmen in Cambodia have behaved like "cowboys" who came to unscrupulously exploit the Farwest and need to be replaced by good investors as Finance Minister Sam Rangsi recently advocated. But sadly, they are also the only things holding together Cambodia's fragile economy at this stage. In a worse case scenario, what will happen if they all abruptly withdraw their business from Cambodia? Funcinpec ministers are playing a dangerous game by attacking foreign businessmen while the country desperately needs investment in all the economic sectors. Like it or not, Ranariddh was right when he said in a television broadcast on Sunday to try to resolve the Thai Bun Rung case: "We can seek popularity after three or four years when the next election comes but popularity is not the issue. The issue is to help the people by providing medicine, food, and schools." And whether or not Ranariddh was being pressured by the CPP leaders who fear they may lose the ill-gotten gains they are alleged to have amassed, it is the entire government's responsibility to tackle this troublesome issue in a frank and fair manner. Such talks are necessary to instill a habit of working together and a test of their sincerity to the world and the nation. The trade dispute brought to the simmering conflicts between members of the two coalition partners. Moreover, it demonstrated there was also a level of conflict within Funcinpec itself. At this delicate stage, the government should be expanding its energy on securing unity within and working together towards establishing a conducive environment to attract "good investors". Once economic development has been assured with strong and sound investment, the selfish businessmen can be wiped out.
