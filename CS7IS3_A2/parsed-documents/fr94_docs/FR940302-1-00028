FR940302-1-00028 FR940302-1-00012 (b) For any hours proposed against which an effective hourly rate is applied, the Offeror shall identify in its proposal the hours in excess of an average of 40 hours per week, at the same level of detail as compensated hours, and the effective hourly rate, whether at the prime or subcontract level. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are in indirect cost pools for personnel whose regular hours are normally charged direct. The proposal shall include the rationale and methodology used to estimate the proposed amount of uncompensated overtime. (c) The Offeror's accounting practices used to estimate uncompensated overtime must be consistent with its cost accounting practices used to accumulate and report uncompensated overtime hours. (d) Proposals which include unrealistically low labor rates, or which do not otherwise demonstrate cost realism, will be considered in a technical and cost risk assessment and evaluated for award in accordance with that assessment. (e) The Offeror shall include with its proposal a copy of its policy addressing uncompensated overtime, including a description of the timekeeping and accounting systems used to record all hours worked by FLSA-exempt employees, and the historical basis for the uncompensated overtime hours proposed.
