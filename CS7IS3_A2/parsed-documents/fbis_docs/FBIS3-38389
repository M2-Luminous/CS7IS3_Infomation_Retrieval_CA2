The Conservative Party has declined by as much as 1.9 percentage points and has the support of only 16 percent of the voters. Last Friday [8 January] the TV news program "Dagsrevyen" announced that Kaci Kullmann Five wanted to withdraw as party leader. This was confirmed on Saturday by the Conservative leader who cited strong, personal reasons for her choice. Speculation surrounding the Conservative Party's leadership situation dominated the media. The Opinion poll was started on Monday afternoon and thus includes the reaction of the voters to the situation within the Conservative Party. Opinion's background material shows that voters are beset by confusion: Some Conservative voters who sat out the election last year say that they will vote for the Conservative Party next time. The Conservative leader's conduct has created sympathy for the party within this group of voters. But a far larger portion of Conservative voters belong to the group of voters who today are unsure of which party they will vote for. Some Conservative voters will vote for the Labor Party, while others will vote for the Progress Party which, thanks to the problems of the Conservatives and not to their own efforts, advanced 0.9 percentage points in the January polls. The crystal-clear trend in the polls is the fact that a focus on what is being called the Conservatives' leadership crisis is creating a feeling of uncertainty among Conservative voters. However, Opinion's background material also shows that the Conservatives today take advantage only to a small degree of its voter potential. The Conservative voters feel uncertain and frustrated, but only a few are defecting in favor of another party in the first round. That is why it is crucial for the Conservatives to clean up their own house. Voter response to the present-day Conservative Party is very low, but it is still better now than it was three years ago when the Conservatives had a record low of 14.4 on Opinion's party barometer. That was in January 1991, a short time after the fall of the Syse government. In June 1993, support was at 27 percent, while it is 11 percent lower today. In other words, it is worth noting that the support of the Conservative Party has shown enormous fluctuations in the last few years. Of most interest today is the fate of the Conservatives, but it is worth noting that the Labor Party continues to improve its standing, achieving a response of as much as 41.6 percent--progress of 1.8 percentage points. The Socialist Left Party is struggling hard, and has slipped by 1 percentage point, to 7.4. The Center party has improved by 1 percentage point and has achieved a record of 18.1 percent.
