[pauses] Mr. Charles David, who was appointed this week by the military regime in Port-au-Prince, has refused to resign from his post as journalist of the daily LA PRESSE in Montreal, according to the newspaper's management. The appointment of Mr. David, 53, to a government not recognized by Ottawa, has led the Canadian Government to freeze his Canadian assets. LA PRESSE, which has employed him for 22 years as journalist in charge of international issues, cannot dismiss him for the moment. Under the provisions of the newspaper's collective convention, he obtained a six-month leave without pay so he could devote himself to his political activities. The LA PRESSE management advises that if David returns to the newspaper before the expiration of the six-month period, he can no longer work in international service. After this period, he will lose his job. In an editorial published on 18 May, LA PRESSE condemned the unofficial government in power in Port-au-Prince, which it labels illegitimate, unelected, and antidemocratic; and disapproves of Charles David's decision to be a part of it.
