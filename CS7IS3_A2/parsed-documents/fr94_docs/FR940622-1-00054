FR940622-1-00054 FR940622-1-00019 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Office of the Secretary 43 CFR Part 11 RIN 1090&hyph;AA43 Natural Resource Damage Assessments AGENCY: Department of the Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: On May 4, 1994, the Department of the Interior issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 23097) to revise the natural resource damage assessment regulations. The natural resource damage assessment regulations establish procedures for assessing damages for injury to natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil into navigable waters under the Clean Water Act, or a release of a hazardous substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The Department is extending the period for comment on the proposed rule. DATES: Comments will be accepted through October 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent in duplicate to the Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance, ATTN: NRDA Rule_Nonuse Values, room 2340, Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC 20240 (regular business hours 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., Monday through Friday). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary C. Morton or David Rosenberger at (202) 208&hyph;3301, or MMORTON@IOS.DOI.GOV on Internet. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The natural resource damage assessment regulations establish procedures for calculating damages for natural resource injuries under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) and the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). The regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments as well as two types of technical procedures for the actual determination of injuries and damages. ``Type A'' procedures are standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation in cases of minor discharges or releases in certain environments. ``Type B'' procedures are site-specific procedures for detailed assessments in other cases. On May 4, 1994, the Department issued a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing the assessment of damages for lost nonuse values of injured natural resources using type B procedures. 59 FR 23097. Nonuse values are those economic values that are not dependent on use of a resource and include the value of knowing that the resource exists and knowing that a resource will be available for future generations. The only method currently available for the express purpose of estimating nonuse values is the contingent valuation (CV) methodology. Two provisions of the original natural resource damage assessment regulations restricted the use of type B procedures to estimate lost nonuse values to cases in which lost use values could not be determined. 43 CFR 11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii) (1993). State of Ohio v. United States Department of the Interior ( Ohio v. Interior ) held that these restrictions were inconsistent with section 301 of CERCLA. 880 F.2d 432, 464 (D.C. Cir. 1989). The court remanded these provisions, along with several other issues, to the Department and ordered the Department to promulgate new rules on the remanded issues. On March 25, 1994, the Department published a final rule addressing all aspects of the court remand except the estimation of lost nonuse values. 59 FR 14262. The Department's March 25, 1994, final rule renumbered 43 CFR 11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii) (1993) as new §§11.83(c)(1)(iii) and 11.83(c)(2)(vii)(B), temporarily leaving the existing invalid rule language ``on the books'' without substantively addressing in any way that language or the use of CV for estimating nonuse values. The May 4, 1994, Federal Register notice proposed standards for the use of CV to estimate lost nonuse values. Pending the completion of this rulemaking, the existing restrictive rule language concerning the estimation of lost nonuse values, which was struck down in Ohio v. Interior, remains invalid and ineffective. The comment period on the May 4, 1994, proposed rule was originally set to expire on July 7, 1994. The Department has received several requests from the public for additional time to comment on the proposed rule and has decided to extend the comment period to October 7, 1994. The Department is coordinating this rulemaking with a rulemaking being conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA has published a proposed natural resource damage assessment rule under the Oil Pollution Act (33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.). 59 FR 1061 (January 7, 1994). In a separate notice in today's Federal Register , NOAA is also announcing an extension of the comment period on its proposed rule. The proposed standards for the estimation of lost nonuse values contained in the Department's May 4, 1994, Federal Register notice are identical to those contained in NOAA's January 7, 1994, Federal Register notice. 59 FR 1182&hyph;83. Commenters on the Department's proposed rule are encouraged to submit copies of their comments both to the Department, at the address specified at the beginning of this notice, and to NOAA, at the address specified in its notice appearing elsewhere in today's Federal Register . Dated: June 13, 1994. Bonnie R. Cohen, Assistant Secretary_Policy, Management, and Budget. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15190 Filed 6&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;RG&hyph;M
