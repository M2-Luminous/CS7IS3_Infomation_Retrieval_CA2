Zhao Changfeng said in his report: In the past year, the procuratorial organs at various levels across the province took Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th party congress as a guidance; conscientiously exercised the legal supervisory functions under the leadership of the provincial party committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, under the supervision by the people's congresses at various levels and their standing committees, with the support of the governments, and closely in line with the central link of economic construction; strictly enforced laws; paid firm attention to handling cases; comprehensively carried out the procuratorial work; and made positive contributions to promoting economic development and administrative honesty. Zhao Changfeng said: Last year, we constantly and persistently unified our thinking with a series of instructions made by the party Central Committee and the provincial party committee on opposing corruption and advocating administrative honesty, strictly enforced laws, firmly attended to handling cases, attached prominent importance to investigating and handling major and appalling cases, and made outstanding achievements. The province accepted 6,034 economic criminal cases of various categories; put 3,720 economic cases, including cases of corruption and bribery, on file for investigations and handling; and investigated and handled 1,769 major and appalling cases of various categories, showing an increase of 82 percent and setting a historical record. Zhao Changfeng said: From the beginning of last year, we continued to persistently take the struggle against serious criminal activities and the overall improvement of social order as another important task for safeguarding social stability and guaranteeing the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. We resolutely implemented the principle of "strictly and rapidly handling various criminal activities" and sternly dealt blows to various kinds of serious criminal activities. Last year, we accepted the reports on arresting 26,365 criminals submitted by the security organs and arrested, with approvals, 23,156 criminals, respectively increasing 4.4 percent and 4.5 percent over the previous year; handled 25,359 criminals whose lawsuit cases were submitted by the security organs; and brought prosecutions against 20,443 persons to the people's courts through examinations. Zhao Changfeng said: Last year, the procuratorial organs across the province strengthened the supervision over the enforcement of laws and disciplines and comprehensively carried out civil administration, the work of prisons, accusations, and appeals. In coordination with the struggle against corruption, we strengthened the examinations of the enforcement of laws and disciplines and concentrated energy on investigating and handling the criminal cases of state working personnel "violating power" and neglecting functions. We also strengthened the examinations of prisons; conscientiously examined and corrected various unlawful activities within prisons and reformatories, particularly the unlawful activities of replacing punishment by money and wantonly collecting money; ensured the accurate implementation of state laws and the party's policies on reform-through-labor and reeducation-through- labor; and ensured the strict enforcement of laws and the management in a civilized manner. We should attach prominent importance to the trial of civil cases and the examination of administrative lawsuits and make positive efforts to handle cases. We conscientiously received and appropriately handled visitors and incoming letters from citizens and strictly investigated and handled accusation and lawsuit cases. Zhao Changfeng said: Over the past year, we persisted in the principle of "building procuratorial organs according to laws and sternly administering procuratorial work" and continuously regarded the building of contingents as an urgently strategic task. Procuratorial organs helped party committees to accomplish the elections of procurators at three levels and strengthened the leading bodies' ideology, organizational ability, and work style. At the time of positively engaging in the struggle against corruption, the procuratorial organs at various levels strengthened administrative honesty. According to the central authorities and the provincial party committee's regulations on being honest in performing official duties, the procuratorial organs conscientiously launched the self-investigation and self-correction activities; resolutely eliminated the problems that a small number of units exceeded their power to handle cases, took part in economic disputes, and wantonly collected funds and charges; strengthened the in-service training of cadres and policemen; and upgraded the cadres and policemen contingents' political integrity and professional abilities. Under the circumstances where tasks were arduous and work conditions were comparatively arduous, the broad masses of procuratorial cadres and policemen demonstrated extremely good mental outlook, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of fighting indomitably and making selfless sacrifice, tempered themselves in the course of waging the struggle against corruption, and experienced the grim tests of justly enforcing laws under the market economic conditions. A group of advanced collectives and individuals emerged. Zhao Changfeng said: The year 1994 is an extremely important year to deepen reform. The new situation of reform and opening up sets higher demands on the procuratorial work. We should continue to persistently take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a guidance; persist in the principle of taking a two-hand approach and ensuring both hands are tough; attach primary importance to safeguarding social and political stability; and further investigate and handle major and appalling cases of corruption and bribery, the illegal cases of not strictly enforcing laws, and the illegal cases involving legal persons; take the overall procuratorial work situation into consideration by strictly enforcing laws and firmly handling cases; press forward the work in a down-to-earth manner; and crate a good social environment and a good legal environment for reform, opening up, and economic construction.
