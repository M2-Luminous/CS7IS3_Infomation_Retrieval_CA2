Nampol [Namibian Police] spokesperson Edwin Kanguatjivi yesterday told reporters that the six were arrested by members of the Namibian Police Drug Enforcement Bureau with the co-operation of the Zambian police. [passage omitted] Asked whether drug traffickers considered Namibian security poor, Kanguatjivi said Namibia happened to be on a recognised drug route. Nampol's Inspector Louis Mensah said the tablets were manufactured in Bombay, India, and, according to information, also in Zambia. He said the drug was banned in South Africa in 1976. Previously it was prescribed as sleeping tablets.
