He has already lodged the appropriate diplomatic protest. Negotiations with Argentina over the signing of an agreement on the dredging of the Martin Garcia channel have been enhanced. Other very important issues like border agreements to remove environmental pollution and the pollution of border rivers like the Cuareim River, the Yaguaron River, and the Merin Lake will be discussed with the Brazilian foreign minister and the Rio Grande do Sul governor during a meeting to be held within the next few days in the city of Canela. Minister Sergio Abreu and a small group of advisers yesterday held a working breakfast with journalists to thoroughly inform them of the developments of current diplomatic work and negotiations, not just with the neighboring countries, but specially with the EU, Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The meeting served to become better acquainted with the development of all these important issues and to confirm the new style implemented by Abreu in his role as the "manager of our foreign policy," as he described his activities at the Foreign Ministry. A basic element of his activities involves "developing our land and river borders" with Brazil and Argentina. Abreu discussed the recent GATT conference, the results of which were unsatisfactory for many countries. This was called the Uruguay Round. It took more than seven years to complete. He pointed out that even though no concessions were received directly from the great powers, positive results were achieved laterally and a trade war which would have had "regrettable consequences for the entire world" was prevented. Abreu specifically discussed the developments of a Rio Group meeting held in Sao Paulo during which the member countries agreed to enhance their relationship with the EU. In a brief review, he mentioned the new international political agreements on security issues, the new OAS policy and the election of the OAS secretary general, and especially the relationship with the political blocs of Asia where Uruguay has been enhancing its presence and its direct relationship policy. The foreign minister harbors no doubts that all countries were dissatisfied with the GATT results. Nevertheless, there is a greater willingness to negotiate--a willingness that did not exist before--following the inclusion of groups that were not GATT members. This represents the beginning of a multilateral approach for a global trade relationship that used to be governed by group agreements. This involves a new relationship, even though it does not include the agricultural and livestock-producing countries. The current protectionist apparatus will be dismantled within six years, following the closure date of the Uruguay Round. [passage omitted] A proposal that is still being studied by the area countries seeks to link Alaska with Tierra del Fuego. This proposal aroused great expectations among NAFTA countries and countries from other existing blocs. It is similar to the new European Union which has been developing with internal problems that include an extremely high unemployment rate, growing economic recession, and the need to increase its area of influence following the socialist collapse. The foreign minister emphasized that the EU's firm goal is to reach our area through Mercosur [Common Market of the South] to which it ships a significant quantity of manufactured products and from which it receives agricultural products and raw materials. Another significant point is that 40 percent of the banks operating in Latin America are European. [passage omitted] Discussing Argentina's initial contact with NAFTA--which Argentina intends to join--Abreu emphasized that it is impossible for Argentina to join NAFTA because the current rules prevent it and because Argentina would have to grant all the advantages to the other ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] and Mercosur countries. Discussing increased trade in the Mercosur area, Abreu emphasized that trade grew from $3 to $9 billion, which gives an idea of the dynamics among the four member countries. Brazil was the great beneficiary of this trade growth. The foreign minister emphasized that a protest has been lodged with the Brazilian Foreign Ministry over the attitude on tariff reductions for milk and milk by-products. This represents a clearly competitive attitude that is harmful to other Mercosur partners, as in our case. A response is expected within a short period of time. The foreign minister believes it will be favorable to our claims. Otherwise, other negotiations that are under way may be delayed and our producers, who have already been warned about all this, may be harmed. [passage omitted] Concerning the particular issues Uruguay has pending with its two neighbors, Abreu briefly pointed out that a contract for dredging the Martin Garcia Channel will be signed within a few days and notes on the advanced payment of the binational Salto Grande hydroelectric dam project will be exchanged soon. The issues pending with Brazil include the Cuareim and Yaguaron Rivers and the Merin Lake, the cleaning up of the cities linking our two countries, environmental protection, and the joint development of the Merin Lake and Yaguaron River basins and a new bridge linking Rio Branco with Yaguaron.
