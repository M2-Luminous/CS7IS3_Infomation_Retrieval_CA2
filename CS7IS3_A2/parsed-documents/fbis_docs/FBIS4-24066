French troops have arrived in Goma in eastern Zaire, and Jaguars have landed in the northeast, at Kisangani; but for the moment no troops have crossed the border with Rwanda. Several cargo planes are expected at 125 air base in Istres in Bouches-du-Rhone: They are to load up with men and military equipment bound for Bangui. Francois Lecazeau reports: [Lecazeau] Three large Antonov cargo planes already landed this morning at 125 air base in Istres in Bouches-du-Rhone. They are to be joined by one or two more. During the day, they will take on several tonnes of military equipment, and units bound for the Rwandan border, including 80 troops from the Mediterranean Air Region. For the moment the authorities are being cagey about the exact mission of these men. The planes are to take off at about midday for Bangui, in the Central African Republic, and then for Goma and Bukavu, on the border between Zaire and Rwanda, to join the bulk of the troops of Operation Turquoise whose job is to help the people of Rwanda.
