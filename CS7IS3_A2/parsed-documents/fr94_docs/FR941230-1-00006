FR941230-1-00006 FR941230-1-00002 The APA contains two provisions relating to communications with agency decisionmakers. The APA's ex parte communication provision restricts communications between ``interested person[s] outside the agency'' and the agency head, the administrative law judge (ALJ), or the agency decisional employees. 5 U.S.C. 557(d) (emphasis added). Intra-agency communications are governed by the APA's separation of functions provision, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). That section prohibits enforcement staff at an agency from participating or advising in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review of an adjudicatory matter pursuant to section 557 of the APA except as witness or counsel. The same separation of function provision provides that the ALJ in an adjudicatory matter may not consult any party on a fact in issue unless the other parties have an opportunity to participate. 5 U.S.C. 554(d)(1). The separation of functions provision does not prohibit agency enforcement staff from seeking the amendment of a notice or the settlement or termination of a proceeding. Section 747.9 of the Uniform Rules as proposed and adopted in 1991, however, commingled the ex parte and separation of functions concepts, thereby allowing the ex parte communication prohibition to be applied to all communications concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding between the agency head, ALJ, or decisional personnel and any party, the party's counsel, or another person interested in the proceeding. The NCUA and other agencies did not intend this provision to limit agency enforcement staff's ability to seek approval of amendments to, or terminations of, existing enforcement actions. As drafted, however, the provision could be misinterpreted to expand the ex parte communication prohibition beyond the scope of the APA. The proposed amendment clarifies that the regulation is intended to conform to the provisions of the APA by limiting the prohibition on ex parte communications to communications to or from ``interested persons outside the agency,'' 5 U.S.C. 557(d), and by incorporating explicitly the APA's separation of functions provisions, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). This approach is also consistent with the most recent Model Adjudication Rules prepared by the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS). ACUS, Model Adjudication Rules (December, 1993). II. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the NCUA hereby certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. This proposal would make a minor amendment to a rule of practice already in place and affects intra-agency procedure exclusively. Thus, it will not result in additional burden for regulated institutions. The purpose of the proposal is to conform the provisions of the regulation to those imposed by statute. III. Executive Order 12612 Statement This proposed rule, like the current provision of Part 747 it is replacing, will apply to all federally insured credit unions. The NCUA Board, pursuant to Executive Order 12612, has determined, however, that the proposed rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. Further, the proposed rule will not preempt provisions of state law or regulations.
