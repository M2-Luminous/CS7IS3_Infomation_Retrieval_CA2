The editor said that the jamahiri system is a contradiction of the system of representation and parliamentarianism - there is nothing in Libya which is termed a `parliament'. Power in Libya is vested in the people, all the people are involved in decision-making, and it involves everyone of 18 years and over. The peoples committees are appointed through [words indistinct] of direct selection to act on the decisions of these people through peoples committees in all matters related to both foreign and internal policy of the Great Jamahiriyah. The General Peoples Congress is the general forum of basic peoples congresses, peoples committees, trades unions, federations and vocational syndicates. It does not have the right to take decisions or to discuss things on behalf of others but instead formulates the final product of what is originally decided upon by the basic peoples congresses, the peoples committees and the secretaries of the trades unions, the federations and the vocational [words indistinct] syndicates. They are the members of the [words indistinct] attend the meeting of the congress carrying with them [passage indistinct]. There is no such thing as a president in the jamahiri system. There is only the people. It is they who are the `president', the `ruler' who themselves have power vested in them, who determine their own destiny. The peoples congresses are the `president'. Furthermore, there are no `ministers' in the jamahiri system who represent the government but there are secretaries of peoples committees whom are elevated from the base through the basic peoples congresses throughout the Great Jamahiriyah with the methods of direct democracy embodied in the direct, free jamahiri choice. The secretaries of their peoples committees do not make decisions nor do they formulate foreign policy on behalf of the masses but instead are entrusted with only the implementation of foreign and internal policy which is drawn up by the masses. This insistence by the media to use incorrect and contradictory terms and descriptions to report events in the Great Jamahiriyah. [sentence as received] It is not ignorance on their part, of the true nature of events taking place in Libya, involving the popular system and genuine democracy, practiced by a sovereign free people through the unique jamahiri system where peoples congresses make decisions and peoples committees act on these decisions, but is a deliberate attempt to cover up this great achievment by the Libyan people, who are heralding a new era where all forms of repression, tyranny, exploitation and subjugation are eliminated. It is the era of the masses where the people have power vested in them, and are self determining, without representation or go-betweens, whether an individual or government, whether political party or faction or tribe. This fallacious appraisal can only be considered as part of a powerful muscle flexing war against the aspirations of a small nation, making a mockery of its freedom aspiring attempts. It is thus a war against humankind where the powerful tyrants are trying to deprive humankind from benefitting from an important experience such as Libya's. At this time, where the world is experiencing destructive conflicts and protests, which never cease due to the conventional systems' inability to solve the political problems they are facing, namely the problem of power, economic problems and the resulting social ills and disasters.
