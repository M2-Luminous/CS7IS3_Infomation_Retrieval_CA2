[Gur] No. Unfortunately, Damascus is still unyielding. So far the Damascus attitude has been projected through the actions of Hizballah, rather than peaceful advances. That is why I attach such great significance to the Jordanian awakening. [Gazit] Do you really believe Jordan awakened of its own accord, that it was not affected by the green light it has reportedly received from al-Asad? [Gur] It is my opinion that it was an independent Jordanian decision. I do not know how far-reaching their decision is, but it is definitely not the result of Syrian prodding. I hope it will mature and progress. If it affects Syria in a positive direction, it will be doubly welcome. For myself, I see it as a new line adopted by Jordan, which does not want to be left out of the process -- which could happen, what with the continuing implementation of the arrangement between us and the Palestinians. [Eylon] What they do want, Mr. Gur, is 320 square km between the port of al-'Aqabah and the Dead Sea. [Gur] I am very well acquainted with the disputed issues. All these issues can be settled. I can tell you in no uncertain terms that there is no reason why Israel and Jordan should not reach an understanding quite quickly for the benefit of both sides. As far as Israel is concerned, such an understanding is important for the future of the negotiations with the Palestinians too, because it opens up new, important, and very consequential options for the next phases of negotiations.
