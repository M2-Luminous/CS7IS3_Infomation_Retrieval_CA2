If the peace process fails," al-Husayni asserted, "this will not be good for the future of democracy in Israel or for the country's very existence." Al-Husayni explained that "Israel may be able to enforce its presence to a certain degree in the future by using force; however, it should bear in mind that whoever lives by the sword is also destined to die by the sword." At the news conference, Israel was accused of systematically expropriating land in the territories and expanding settlements, even after the signing of the Declaration of Principles with the Palestinians on 13 September. The news conference was organized by four bodies, including the Palestine Geographic Research and Information Center, which belongs to the East Jerusalem association of Arab studies headed by al-Husayni; the Palestine Human Rights Information Center; The Saint Ives Society for Human Rights (a Catholic organization); and the committee for land research. The representatives of these bodies accused Israel of expropriating 46,000 dunams along the Green Line and around Jerusalem for military and public use after the document of principles had already been signed, of expanding the settlements of Daniyel and Bet El by another 1,025 dunams. They also claimed that Israel had set up eight nature reserves on the West Bank, paved eight roads leading to settlements; initiated two development projects, encompassing 5,520 dunams, in settlements in the Hebron area; and forcibly evicted 46 extended families from the expropriated lands as well as destroying 63 houses. The Palestinians claimed that Israel was employing three main methods to implement its settlement policies, which indicated that it had no intention of withdrawing from the territories. One of these methods focuses on development activity and on formulating new master plans to expand existing settlements (for example plans that were prepared for the settlements of 'Anatot, Tapuah, Qedumim, and Qiryat Arba'). Another method is defining certain areas as "nature reserves," "green areas," and "open areas," in order to prevent the Palestinians from using the land for agriculture and construction purposes. The areas that were so defined, the Palestinian representatives claimed, are later used to build settlements. The Palestinians gave Rekhes Shu'fat as an example. This settlement was first defined as a "nature reserve" and later used to construct homes for ultra-Orthodox Jews. The Palestinians complained that since the signing of the Oslo agreement, numerous wide-ranging plans for an Israeli "Greater Jerusalem" have been formulated in a similar fashion, while the Palestinians are being prohibited to build in these areas. They pointed out that since September 1993, eight areas near Ramallah, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron, and Nabulus have been declared natural reserves. The third method used by Israel is based on laying the infrastructure for the future expansion of settlements and their linkage with Israel.
