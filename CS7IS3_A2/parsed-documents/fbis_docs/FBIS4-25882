For nearly 10 years since the signing of the Joint Declaration, China, Hong Kong, and the world have undergone enormous and profound changes. Reviewing the Joint Declaration and the background to and process of its signing at this important moment will help people obtain a more profound understanding of the great significance of preserving Hong Kong's value to China under the great principle of "one country, two systems." What changes have happened in China, Hong Kong, and the world over the past 10 years or so? On the world scale, the biggest change is that the Cold War has ended, peace and development have become the theme of the times, and international relations have switched to a track dominated by economics. As far as mainland China is concerned, reform and opening up have further unfolded on an overall scale since the mid-1980's. Although it experienced the 1989 disturbances [feng bo 7364 3134] and the dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in the international arena, China's great undertaking of reform and opening up has managed to continue to develop and flourish amid acid tests and has become an irreversible historical trend. China has become the engine of Asia's economic development. As far as Hong Kong is concerned, it entered a transitional period upon the signing of the Joint Declaration. The Chinese Government's basic principles and policies toward Hong Kong laid down in Annex 1 of the Joint Declaration material.
