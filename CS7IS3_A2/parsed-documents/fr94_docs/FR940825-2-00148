I. Introduction On January 5, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of index options on the Phlx Semiconductor Index (``Semiconductor Index'' or ``Index''). The Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on January 14, 1994, 3 Amendment No. 2 on April 26, 1994, 4 and Amendment No.; 3 on May 20, 1994. 5 Notice of the proposal, as amended, appeared in the Federal Register on July 12, 1994. 6 This order approves the Exchange's proposal, as amended. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). 3 In Amendment No. 1, the Phlx proposes: (1) To correct the description of the formula for calculating the value of the Index; (2) to set the exercise prices at 5 point intervals instead of 21/2 point intervals; (3) to provide that if the number of components in the Index increases to more than 21 components or decreases to less than 11 components, the Exchange shall submit a rule filing to the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b)(4) of the Act; (4) to require that the components of the Index will be required to be listed for trading on the New York Exchange (``NYSE'') or the American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') (non-ECM), or traded as National Market (``NM'') securities through the facilities of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ''); and (5) to list long-term options on the Index that expire 12 to 36 months from the date of issuance (``LEAPS''). See Letter from William Uchimoto, General Counsel, Phlx, to Richard Zack, Branch Chief, Office of Market Supervision (``OMS''), Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), SEC, dated January 14, 1994. 4 In Amendment No. 2, the Phlx proposes to: (1) Provide that the index will be updated during the trading day at least once every 15 seconds, rather than once every minute; (2) specify that the expiration cycle applicable to options of the index will be three expiration months from the March, June, September, December cycle plus two additional near-term months; (3) provide that additional exercise prices will be added pursuant to Rule 1101A rather than Rule 1012; and (4) clarify the Exchange's obligations with respect to delisting and replacing components of the components of the Index. See Letter from Michele R. Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, OMS, Division, SEC, dated April 26, 1994. 5 In Amendment No. 3 to the proposal, the Exchange provides that the Index will be maintained so that if any time, less than 90% of the component issues by weight are eligible for exchange options trading, the Exchange will submit a Rule 19b&hyph;4 filing to the Commission before opening any new series of options on the Index for trading. See Letter from Michele R. Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, Phlx, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, OMS, Division, SEC, dated May 20, 1994. 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34307 (July 5, 1994), 59 FR 35549 (July 12, 1994). II. Description of Proposal A. General The Phlx proposes to list for trading options on the Phlx Semiconductor Index, a new securities index developed by the Phlx and based on U.S. stocks representing the semiconductor industry that are traded on the NYSE or the AMEX, or are NM securities traded through the facilities of NASDAQ. The Phlx also proposes to list LEAPS on the full-value Index (``Index LEAPS''). Semiconductor Index LEAPS will trade independent of and in addition to regular Semiconductor Index options traded on the Exchange; however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index LEAPS and regular Index options will be aggregated. The Phlx will use a price-weighted methodology to calculate the value of the Index. 7 7 See infra Section II.E, entitled ``Calculation of the Index,'' for a description of this calculation method. B. Composition of the Index The Index was designed by the Exchange and is presently composed of 16 highly capitalized and widely held common stocks of U.S. companies that are primarily involved in the design, manufacture, sale, and distribution of semiconductors used in computer and other electronic device manufacturing. Six of these securities currently trade through NASDAQ as NM securities, and ten trade on the NYSE. All component stocks are ``reported securities,'' as that term is defined in Rule 11a3&hyph;1 of the Act. 8 The Index is price-weighted and will be calculated on a real-time basis using last sale prices. 8 See 17 CFR 240.11Aa3&hyph;1. A ``reported security'' is defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this rule as ``any listed equity security or NASDAQ security for which transaction reports are required to be made on a real-time basis pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan.'' A ``transaction reporting plan'' is defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this rule as ``any plan for collecting, processing, making available or disseminating transaction reports with respect to transactions in reported securities filed with the Commission pursuant to, and meeting the requirements of, this section.''
