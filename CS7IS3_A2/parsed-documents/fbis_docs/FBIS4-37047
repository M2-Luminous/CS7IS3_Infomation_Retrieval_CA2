The Commerce Minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, who had been in the forefront of doughty defenders and did much to put heart into doubters, is himself raising questions which ought to have been thought through before the event, rather than being debated after it. Inaugurating a workshop in New Delhi on `Impact of GATT Accord on Indian Economy', Mr. Mukherjee has called for an extensive debate on several issues going into the very heart of the matter. The questions he listed were: whether there would be efficient reallocation of world resources as a result of the pact; whether a rule-based multilateral trading system like the World Trade Organisation (WTO) would really provide a level playing field for all the countries to compete on fair ground: whether the 10-year transitional period should be rolled over or rolled back; whether the agreement would expose the Indian small-scale sector to unfair or uneven competition; and whether the new trade blocs such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would in any way affect the multilateral trading system. It would be readily seen that each and every issue that Mr. Mukherjee has posed has a vital bearing on the entire rationale and relevance of the Uruguay Round, and indeed on the very justifiability or otherwise of India's participation in it. As such, one would have presumed that extensive studies would have been undertaken by the Government on all the aspects now brought up by Mr. Mukherjee and the official negotiators would have fully armed themselves with the necessary conclusions to enable them to protect India's interests in the course of the Round. It is really puzzling that Mr. Mukherjee should wring his hands and pass the buck at this belated stage to the general public to debate these issues and thus take himself off the hook. Assuming that (but perish the thought), the debate he seeks shows the Government's decision to subscribe to the Final Act in a damaging light, it would only mean that instead of doing its homework while there was still time, the Government is casting about for excuses for locking the stables after the horses have been stolen. Equally inexplicably, Mr. Mukherjee throws the onus on the public to debate and advise what legislative changes are needed for incorporating the GATT requirements and provisions within the Indian legislative framework. Specifically, he wants to know whether a law on plant breeders' rights should take the route of extending the patents or of a sui generis system or of both. As regards the lines along which India's laws should be brought in conformity with the Final Act, whether by fresh enactments or by amendments, one would have thought that the whole leviathan of a Law Ministry would have put Mr. Mukherjee wise by this time. And as for plant breeders' rights, Mr. Mukherjee's poser is yet another sad reminder of the Government's policy of preferring the bliss of ignorance to the folly of being wise about what happens right under its nose. As long ago as March 1990, the Standing Policy Planning Committee of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research had gone in great depth into the nature and scope of safeguards for gene patenting and plant breeders' rights and after a comparative analysis of laws in other countries, made detailed recommendations for a sui generis system. In January 1994, following a wide-ranging, four-day, interdisciplinary dialogue, the Dr. M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation at Madras, had forwarded a comprehensive sui generis draft of a Plant Varieties Recognition and Protection Act. Mr. Mukherjee's colleague in the Central Cabinet, Mr. Balram Jakhar, had heartily welcomed the contribution of the dialogue towards formulating an effective sui generis system. Thus, Mr. Mykherjee already has all the answers on this specific question. All he needs is to ensure that the right hand of the Government knows what the left hand is doing. The one major policy issue that is still remaining, unresolved is the one whereby the US in particular, is insistent on linking trade with social issues such as labour standards, environment, human rights and the like. Mr. Mukherjee is right in warning that this will lead to needless discussion and confusion, and distract the WTO from substantive trade issues which should be its prime concern, especially at a stage when the foundation of a new world trade order is being laid. Ways of preparing an enduring design and architecture of that edifice, rather than frills like the colour of the ink making up the drawings, should consume all its attention.
