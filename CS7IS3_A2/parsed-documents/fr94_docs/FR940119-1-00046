FR940119-1-00046 FR940119-1-00012 Federal Highway Administration 49 CFR Part 393 [FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;94&hyph;1] RIN 2125&hyph;AD27 Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation; Lighting Devices, Reflectors, and Electrical Equipment AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM); request for comments. SUMMARY: This document announces that the FHWA is considering proposing measures for reducing the incidence and severity of collisions with large trailers during conditions of darkness or reduced visibility. Specifically, the agency is considering issuing a proposal to establish requirements for the use of retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors for certain trailers manufactured prior to December 1, 1993, the effective date of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's final rule on conspicuity for newly manufactured trailers. DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written, signed comments to FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;94&hyph;1, room 4232, HCC&hyph;10, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Highway Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. All comments received will be available for examination at the above address from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. Those desiring notification of receipt of comments must include a self-addressed, stamped postcard. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jeffrey J. Van Ness, Office of Motor Carrier Standards, (202) 366&hyph;2981, or Mr. Charles E. Medalen, Office of Chief Counsel, (202) 366&hyph;1354, Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Office hours are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., e.t., Monday through Friday, except legal Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 10, 1992, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a final rule (49 CFR 571.108) requiring that trailers manufactured on or after December 1, 1993, which have an overall width of 80 inches or more and a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 10,000 pounds, be equipped on the sides and rear with means for making them more visible on the road. 1 Trailers manufactured exclusively for use as offices or dwellings are exempt. 1 A copy of the NHTSA final rule and NPRM are included for inspection and copying in FHWA Docket No. MC&hyph;94&hyph;1, room 4232, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Trailer manufacturers may install either retroreflective sheeting or reflex reflectors. Manufacturers of retroreflective sheeting or reflectors are required to certify compliance of their product with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 108 (49 CFR 571.108) whether the product is for use as original or as replacement equipment. NHTSA Rulemaking The NHTSA first requested comments concerning the use of reflective material to make heavy vehicles more visible on May 27, 1980 (45 FR 35405). Forty-two comments were received, most of which favored the concept. Between 1980 and 1985, the NHTSA conducted a fleet study in which retroreflective material was placed on van-trailer combinations in a manner designed to increase their conspicuity during conditions of darkness or reduced visibility. The treatment of trailers consisted of outlining the rear perimeter, and delineating the lower side. No reflectorized mud flaps were used. The study concluded that truck-trailer combinations equipped with this material were involved in 15 percent fewer crashes (in which a trailer was struck in the side or rear) than combinations lacking the material. A copy of the report, ``Improved Commercial Vehicle Conspicuity and Signalling Systems_Task III Field Test Evaluation of Vehicle Reflectorization Effectiveness,'' September 1985 (DOT HS 806 923) is included in the docket. On September 18, 1987 (52 FR 35345), the NHTSA published a notice of request for comments. The notice presented results of NHTSA's fleet study and sought comments on the test results as well as experiences motor carriers may have had with the use of reflective material to enhance conspicuity. Thirty-seven comments were received, most agreeing that a 15 percent reduction in accidents could be expected when all large vehicles were so equipped with reflective material. As part of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1990 (sec. 15, Pub. L. 101&hyph;500, 104 Stat. 1218), the Congress included a provision directing the Secretary of Transportation ``to initiate a rulemaking proceeding on the need to adopt methods for making trucks or any category of trucks more visible to motorists *␣*␣*'' not later than February 3, 1991, and to complete the rulemaking proceeding not later than November 3, 1992. On December 4, 1991, the NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) at 56 FR 63474. The NHTSA regarded its NPRM as responsive to the congressional mandate and the final rule as the completion of the rulemaking. Prior to the issuance of the final rule, the NHTSA published the results of additional research on heavy vehicle conspicuity. The purpose of the research program was to define a range of minimally acceptable large vehicle conspicuity enhancements that could be used as a basis for revised Federal regulations. A number of laboratory and field studies were carried out to assess the value of using a pattern in the marking material, the form the pattern should take, the placement of the treatment on the trailer, the effect of retroreflective markings on the detection and identification of stop and turn signals, and the trade-off between the width and retroreflective intensity of the treatment material. In addition, field surveys were conducted to assess the effect of environmental dirt on the performance of the marking systems and the durability of retroreflective materials when used on trucks.
