Paydar: "Tehran, Beijing, New Delhi: ASEAN Plus the ECO"] [Excerpts] Early last week, only a few hours after the visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Tehran, Indian External Affairs Minister Dinesh Singh arrived in Tehran. Singh stated that the objective of this visit was to continue and expand the warm and cordial talks between India and Iran. [passage omitted] Both India and Iran are large regional countries with a special role in Asian security, both because of the vastness of their territories, their command of maritime areas, their erudite work force, their history and culture, and above all, the fact that they belong to the Third World. [passage omitted] The only weak point is India's differences with Pakistan, which has become a problem as far as stability in the Indian Ocean is concerned. At any rate, there is no doubt that if Islamabad is excluded from security dealings, the logic behind any regional political-security forecast or planning will collapse. For various reasons stemming from its understanding on its own national interests, Iran naturally wants some breathing space for its foreign policy. By nature, the Islamic Republic of Iran cannot limit itself to a small political, economic, and security sphere. Therefore, it has always tried to expand its strategic horizons in relationship to its position. It is natural that the Indian subcontinent, stretching as far as China's borders, is of special importance in this sphere of interest. Logically, in the effort to develop this area, it is practically impossible for Iran to ignore or exclude Pakistan. Of course, this part of the process may be delayed but it cannot be ignored. Therefore, any solution that ends the Indian-Pakistani dispute is not only to Iran's benefit but will also open up the last remaining door to cooperation among the south-central Asian countries and the Indian subcontinent, stretching from South Asia to east Asia. In other words, it would make possible the final steps for uniting the ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] and ASEAN [Association of South East Asian Nations]. In this regard, ASEAN's Permanent Secretary General Singh, who is in Bangkok for a meeting of the organization's top officials, has stated that he will pay a visit to Tehran soon. Pointing out that this visit is very important, Singh stated that the ECO is extremely interested in expanding its relations with ASEAN. But will the expansion of Iran's relations with some regional countries be contingent on the internal relations in ECO? No definite answer can be given to this question yet; the answer depends on to what extent ECO will allow its members--namely Iran--a free hand in regional cooperation. Naturally if the ECO acts as a cartel like OPEC, members will face limitations, not only vis-a-vis India but also other countries and other economic-political alliances. Political and economic observers believe that if the ECO acts like a regional cartel, it will fail because none of the ECO members currently is economically competitive, with all its members facing economic problems. Iran, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the six Central Asian republics that were recently admitted to ECO all face extensive economic problems. Even in the most optimistic view, this alliance will only benefit the member countries themselves, and to an extremely limited extent. Therefore, it has no benefits for the Asian continent as a whole. Also, the increase the ECO membership poses a problem because it is not clear what benefits countries like Afghanistan and Tajikistan bring to it apart from absorbing the organization's limited capital, which mostly comes from Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan. ECO's counterpart ASEAN consists of countries located in south and southeast Asia; and despite the fact that it is a regional body, it has also become an active and successful political and economic group of worldwide significance, and it also welcomes new members. It is natural for ASEAN to want to expand its influence and for the ECO to seek an effective atmosphere in which to operate. But can these two alliances absorb each other? Fortunately both sides have reasons enough to give a positive answer to this question. During the recent visit by Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Iran as well as the visit by Indian External Affairs Minister Dinesh Singh, the topic of cooperation between the ECO and ASEAN was seriously discussed. Qian Qichen said that ECO-ASEAN cooperation and even the formation of a new organization from the two is important, adding that he had discussed the topic with Iranian officials. India too welcomes the formation of a new organization in the region because this would free it from unilateral dealings with each and every ECO member, notably with Pakistan. It now appears that the formation of a new alliance in the region is an extremely necessary and inevitable fact and that the coming visit by the ASEAN secretary general to Tehran will be a very good opportunity for serious preliminary consultations on this topic. Apart from according Iran, India, and China outstanding roles in Asia, a new alliance would also endorse the Islamic Republic's supremacy over a large part of Asia--from Asia Minor to western China. And as stated by a Chinese diplomat of the region: "The formation of a new alliance in Asia would, first and foremost, divide the region among three immense political and economic poles. Iran and China would be the poles on either side, with India in the middle linking the other two. "The first pole's scope would include Turkey, Afghanistan, and the newly-independent countries; and Iran will have full supremacy over this pole because of the vastness of its area, its seacoast, its air and land routes, its immense and relatively skilled manpower, its membership in OPEC and access to financial resources, its political stability, the general inclination of its economy toward capitalism, its membership in the Nonaligned Movement, and its fully independent policy." Asked why Turkey would not assume such supremacy, the diplomat answered: "It is clear that Turkey lacks all these factors. Also, the absence of political stability at home and its dependence on NATO are problems that cannot be ignored. This is extremely important to Iran, China, and India. Therefore, the western sector extending to the central area of this alliance will be, or should be, in the hands of Iran. "Similarly, India can organize the middle section of the alliance because of its technical and economic potentials, its vast area, its supremacy over the Indian Ocean, the general inclination of world capitalism to invest in India, very cheap labor, and an annual economic growth rate above 8.5 percent, ranking second only to China. So it can be a bridge between Iran and China in this alliance. And, who knows, maybe this alliance can play a part in ending the differences between India and Pakistan, in which case Iran will gain another trump card." This Chinese diplomat added: "The eastern front is also very important. Actually, the balance between the central and the western fronts is in China's hands. Because of its high economic growth rate of more than 11 percent, its high technical and agricultural levels and because of its generally favorable economy, it is impossible for ASEAN to make any decisions without taking China into consideration. Also, the regional economy is greatly affected by China's economy. In 1997, when Hong Kong is returned to China, this influence will increase. Therefore, China will seek ways to expand its economic influence." Some political experts fully agree with the views of this Chinese diplomat and say that regardless of the reason, the formation of such an alliance at a time when countries are showing preference for political, economic, and security groupings and alliances rather than going it alone and at a time when the meaning of national development is synonymous with regional development, membership in supra-regional alliances appears to be imperative. And forming and belonging to regional and supra-regional alliances is now considered an important factor in international relations and stances. A general glance at the all aspects of Iran's domestic and foreign policies shows an inclination toward such a polarization in this region. Both the Chinese and the Indians have much experience in workings and the uses of big alliances. Therefore, Iran should prepare its diplomatic machinery to participate in such an organization. The ECO is approaching the end of its traditional role, and because of world economic reality it will have to play a new role within a new entity; and the winner will be the one that adapts the best.
