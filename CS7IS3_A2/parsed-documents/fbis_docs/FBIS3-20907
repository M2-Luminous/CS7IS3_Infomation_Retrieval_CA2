Vosen, the research policy spokesman for the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] group in the Bundestag, said in Bonn that a social consensus on this domain does not at present exist in Germany, as demonstrated by the examples of genetic engineering, nuclear power, or the transrapid. "We need a great coalition of reason for research that cuts across all party boundaries," Vosen insisted. The SPD politician conceded that this consensus did not exist in his party either on a good many issues. Thus, unlike Social Democratic traffic politicians, he came out in favor of a transrapid application line in Germany. The call for "more boldness in technology!" is also aimed at the SPD. Vosen presented a 10-page "blueprint for a research and technology policy for the SDP-government program." Agreement on the paper has not, to be sure, been reached with Glotz, the member of the election campaign team responsible for education and research, but it will have some influence on the program. In the paper he says that the existing obstacles to innovations in law and administration must be eliminated. Vosen demanded that the research budget, which in past years has served as a "piggy bank," be clearly increased from 1995 on. If the budget had grown since 1986 as the entire national budget has, DM3 billion more would be available for research in 1994 instead of just the actual DM9.47 billion. The SPD differs from the coalition in its assessment of nuclear energy. The SPD lays stronger emphasis on the development of renewable sources of energy and energy conservation technologies. Moreover, it focuses chiefly on the "humanization" of working conditions, research on peace and conflicts, and the humanities. The government has come more into line with the SPD's criticism of the costly manned space programs because of the shortage of funds. Additional major focal points cited in the SPD plan are the development of research on the environment and health, the strengthening of stat-of-the-art technologies like information technology and telecommunications, genetic engineering and biotechnology, research on materials, and the development of new fuels and ideas for dealing with traffic. Vosen came out in favor of the reintroduction of tax support for research and demanded legally established rights for the Bundestag to take part in government decisions on research programs. Vosen attested to Minister of Research Krueger's (CDU [Christian Democratic Union]) good intentions. But he said that Krueger had been unable to assert himself up to now, as the budget debates demonstrated. He does not even have much to say in his own house. He said that the "secret minister of research" is Krueger's secretary of state, Ziller.
