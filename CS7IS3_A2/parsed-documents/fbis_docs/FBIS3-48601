Taking advantage of the permission given by the royal government allowing all fishing groups to carry on their activities, Vietnamese settlers -- who have been fishing in Cambodia since 1979 and fled to live along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border for fear of massacre by the Khmer Rouge -- have returned with their fishing boats. This is not legal at all. According to sources in the Khmer Royal Armed Forces in the 4th Military Region, the Khmer Rouge [KR] has strongly reacted to the return of illegal Vietnamese settlers. The sources also said that the Khmer Rouge have accused the government of colluding with Vietnam and allowing many Vietnamese fishing boats into the country without any strict restrictions against these Vietnamese. According to other reliable sources, however, Khmer Rouge leader General Chhit Choeun alias Mok -- who has gone to the border intersection of Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand for medical treatment -- has ordered Division 980 under the command of "Muon" to resume its operations, particularly the Tonle Sap unit which is believed to be the Khmer Rouge's special military unit. This Khmer Rouge official based his remarks on the return of Vietnamese fishermen. This source also specified that the Tonle Sap unit, most of whose members are young, courageous, and violent, are preparing for action in and along the Tonle Sap. This source went on to say that except for the Tonle Sap unit, the Khmer Rouge command has dispatched small groups to the Anlung Veng or Pailin areas to assist in the defense of these two regions against the royal government troops. It should be recalled that last year nearly 40 Vietnamese lost their lives in the Khmer Rouge attack on the village of Chong Khneas in Siem Reap. This was a racist act on Vietnamese fishermen in boats. It forced these fishermen to hastily leave their shelters. Now such racist acts are continuing. This is why the Tonle Sap unit is preparing to launch operations in the Tonle Sap to coincide with the arrival of Vietnamese fishing groups in the areas where they used to do business.
