Good day! [Koljevic] Good day! [Jerotijevic] Professor Koljevic, I will not ask you anything as we have here our expert, foreign affairs' commentator Dragan Colovic. [Colovic] Good day from me, Mr. Koljevic. [Koljevic] Good day, Mr. Colovic. [Colovic] How do you view the latest development of the situation around Gorazde? [Koljevic] I believe that after today's meeting that we have had in Pale, that is, after yesterday's meeting with Mr. Akashi, to be precise, this dilemma of which our Foreign Minister Buha spoke is nevertheless verging more to the side of peace than to the possible side of escalation. Namely, after yesterday's meeting with Mr. Akashi and the appeal that he issued on that occasion, our authorities decided to immediately implement or assist in the implementation of the following measures as sign of goodwill: We agreed that the Serbian forces would stay outside the 3-km zone on the left bank of the river at Gorazde and that we would agree to an as speedy as possible deployment of UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] troops on the left bank in order to restore peace there as quickly as possible. Namely, it is well known that there have been more attacks from the Muslim side after we had agreed to instantaneous peace yesterday. Yesterday, we also agreed on medical assistance and evacuation by helicopters. Unfortunately, the Muslim side did not accept this evacuation this morning for political reasons, so it seems, because they wanted to dramatize the situation in Gorazde in the media. However, we did agree on this and it is important that the international public is aware of this -- the assistance and evacuation from Gorazde and other settlements -- as well as all humanitarian organizations, primarily the Red Cross. We also agreed that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR], the Red Cross, the Medicins sans Frontieres, and the Handicap International should resume humanitarian convoys as soon as possible, that all humanitarian workers be guaranteed free movement throughout the territory of the Srpska republic, and that our republics' police units would accompany these convoys to safeguard their safety. This was agreed and I believe that these are the signals that, above all, show the improvement of the relations between the UN civilian sector and our authorities, prove that there is goodwill on the Serbian side to stop all other activities, and above all ensure correct information about Gorazde, where plenty of disinformation has been coming from. Therefore the presence of UNPROFOR on the left bank of Gorazde could be a major step toward peace in Gorazde and later also toward proliferation of peace if the Muslim side would be willing for this in other areas. [Colovic] Yes, Mr. Koljevic. The implementation of this agreement will definitely depend on the behavior and reactions of the Muslim side. Are there any indications regarding this? [Koljevic] You know that for any agreement at least two, and for many agreements such as ours, three our four sides are needed. For the time being we have no indication [words indistinct] that these helicopters have been rejected this morning, however, I believe that it is now up to the agencies of the international community, primarily the Red Cross and the UNHCR, and we shall see whether they will succeed and be accepted. The only question remaining now is whether the Muslim side would accept them on their territory, too. [Colovic] There have been reports that Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian President Yeltsin, is returning to Moscow. How do you interpret this, bearing in mind everything that this mediator has done and accomplished over the last few days in pacifying this dramatic situation. [Koljevic] Well, I do not know the precise reasons for his return to Moscow, however, I presume that he was recalled for consultations in order to accomplish as soon as possible not merely this transitional solution for Gorazde, but also an agreement that would guarantee a general end to hostilities, and to obtain the Russian position toward this document, which we need most urgently if we do not want the war to really escalate. [Colovic] I shall read you a REUTER report. Namely, in Zagreb, Churkin said, as REUTER quotes, that the defense of Gorazde has broken down and the town, as it is quoted, continues to be under Serbian siege. The only thing demanded from the Serbs is to stop the attacks on Gorazde but, unfortunately, they are not in a position to do so, Churkin said and added that a solution could be found if the world would agree to the abolition of sanctions against Serbia. As he said, the principles of the abolition of sanctions are important for the Serbs. How do you comment on this? [Koljevic] I believe that this, especially the second part referring to the sanctions, is very accurate. We cannot embark on any further negotiations before the issue of sanctions, and not only their abolition, is accepted and also specified. Well, because things are changing by the hour, I believe that we have demonstrated out goodwill by agreeing to UNPROFOR presence on the left bank of Gorazde and the start of demilitarization. Therefore, this is slightly different today then it was yesterday when he was here. [Colovic] Mr. Koljevic, you have said that the things are changing by the hour. I, therefore, ask you what steps can be expected from the Serbian side in the next few hours? [Koljevic] In the next few hours we will try -- we will remain in contact with the UNPROFOR civilian sector -- to secure as speedy as possible a realization of this agreement, and then we will strive to improve other liaisons with UNPROFOR. For instance, the Ukrainian battalion in Zepa needs to be replaced and this would be a sign of goodwill. Namely, they need logistical support and we must resolve this in the afternoon. Naturally, we must inform all our agencies to carry out preparations for the continuation of the humanitarian work as early as possible. Tomorrow morning at approximately 1000 we shall see when the deployment of UNPROFOR forces, as the most important issue, will be possible. [Colovic] Does this mean that a change will occur in the liaison with the military section of UNPROFOR? [Koljevic] Well, probably it will occur, however, it cannot happen immediately. We must... [pauses] for the time being we only have the authority of our supreme command to communicate via the civilian sector, however, numerous issues, even the military ones, can be resolved through the civilian sector. [Colovic] At the end, Mr. Koljevic, let me ask you, what do you expect in the Gorazde sector, what further development of the situation? [Koljevic] I do not know whether even those who are currently in the direct vicinity of Gorazde could give a precise answer to your question. However, judging by our information here we expect the abatement of the situation, unless significant propaganda military provocations by the Muslim side take place in Gorazde. In such a case it would be very difficult to restore peace in Gorazde, for which we were willing. [Colovic] Yes, and the aforementioned agreement with special envoy of the UN Secretary General Akashi, too. Mr. Koljevic, thank you very much. [Koljevic] Thank you, too.
