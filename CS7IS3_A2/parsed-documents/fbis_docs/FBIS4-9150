[Klaus] This provides yet another means of communication with neighboring countries. We desire this communication, we are striving for it, and we are pleased that it is going to happen. Moreover, the meeting has another important aspect--breaking down the incessant polarization of the world into West and East. The fact that the presidents of Austria and Germany will also be there is, I think, a step in the right direction. [Martinkova] In the wake of Wednesday's [13 April] government session, do the ambiguities within the coalition over the jurisdiction of the higher territorial units still persist? [Klaus] There is no fundamental dispute among the coalition parties in the actual issue of jurisdiction. When we begin to discuss whether the new regions may conclude international treaties or announce their own taxes or smog alert levels, or build their own theaters or galleries, any overpoliticized dispute will evaporate. The government coalition ministers, in closed ranks, are looking for ways to define jurisdiction. The problems lie somewhere else. In the political game, that is being played beyond the matter-of-fact element of this issue. I repeat: This is not a matter-of-fact dispute. Some parties are still pulling false cards from their sleeves. I would hope that they do not play with them. [Martinkova] The unemployment rate in the Czech Republic is one of the lowest in the world. Apparently, only Luxembourg, Japan, and New Zealand are doing better. Nevertheless, the government is often the target of criticism because of this. Can we in the Czech Republic talk about false employment, employment that interferes with natural economic relations? [Klaus] Unemployment in our country is the way it is; no one is holding it back or speeding it up. Each month the government awaits with anticipation the figures on its movement, without in any way attempting to manipulate it. Its low level is a major success, which, on the other hand, is the subject of various worst-case scenarios and elaborations on the artificial curbing of unemployment. What I mean is the criticism from some economists from the postcommunist countries. However, even Western states are a little envious of our low unemployment rate. The current level is a consequence of our economy's exceptionally high absorption capability. For example, in the Louny District, where the unemployment level is one of the highest--it is touching 8 percent--there are about 3,000 unemployed. However, three years ago, 7,000 people lost their jobs due to the collapse of the large agricultural enterprises. Where are they? In new jobs. [Martinkova] You say that the enterprise sphere is the trade unionists' domain, not collective bargaining at the macroeconomic level. The Maastricht Treaty, however, even takes into consideration supranational collective bargaining within the framework of the European Union. [Klaus] I have never made a secret of my criticism of the Maastricht Treaty. The social democratic authors who participated in drafting it have left their mark in certain points. The social sphere is one of them.
