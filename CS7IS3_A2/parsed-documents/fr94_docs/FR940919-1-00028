FR940919-1-00028 FR940919-1-00011 * * * * * (d)␣*␣*␣* (1)␣*␣*␣* (i) A longline may not be used to fish for fish in the snapper-grouper fishery in the EEZ_ (A) South of 27 ○10 ’ N. lat. (due east of the entrance to St. Lucie Inlet, FL); (B) North of 27 ○10 ’ N. lat. where the charted depth is less than 50 fathoms (91.4 m), as shown on the latest edition of the largest scale NOAA chart of the location; or (C) Without a permit for snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, on board. (ii) A person aboard a vessel with a longline on board that fishes on a trip in the EEZ south of 27 ○10 ’ N. lat., north of 27 ○10 ’ N. lat. where the charted depth is less than 50 fathoms (91.4 m), or without a permit for snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, on board, is limited on that trip to: * * * * * (e) Powerheads off South Carolina. In the EEZ off South Carolina, a powerhead may not be used to harvest fish in the snapper-grouper fishery. The possession of a mutilated fish in the snapper-grouper fishery in or from the EEZ off South Carolina and a powerhead is prima facie evidence that such fish was harvested by a powerhead. (f) Rebreathers and spearfishing gear. In the EEZ, a person using a rebreather may not harvest fish in the snapper-grouper fishery with spearfishing gear. The possession of a fish in the snapper-grouper fishery while in the water with a rebreather is prima facie evidence that such fish was harvested with spearfishing gear while using a rebreather. (g) Authorized and unauthorized gear. _(1) Authorized gear. Subject to the specific gear limitations in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section and in §646.26, the following are the only gear types authorized in a directed fishery for snapper-grouper in the EEZ: (i) Vertical hook-and-line gear, including hand-held rods and rods attached to a vessel (``bandit'' gear), in either case, with manual, electric, or hydraulic reels; (ii) Spearfishing gear; iii) Bottom longlines; and (iv) Sea bass pots. (2) Unauthorized gear. All gear types other than those listed in paragraph (g)(1) of this section are unauthorized gear and the following possession and transfer limitations apply: (i) A vessel with trawl gear aboard that fishes in the EEZ on a trip may possess no more than 200 lb (90.7 kg) of fish in the snapper-grouper fishery, excluding wreckfish, in or from the EEZ on that trip. It is a rebuttable presumption that a vessel with more than 200 lb (90.7 kg) of fish in the snapper-grouper fishery, excluding wreckfish, aboard harvested such fish in the EEZ. (ii) Except as specified in paragraph (h) of this section, a person aboard a vessel with unauthorized gear aboard, other than trawl gear, that fishes in the EEZ on a trip is limited on that trip to: (A) Species for which a bag limit is specified in §646.23(b)_the bag limit; and (B) All other species in the snapper-grouper fishery_zero. (iii) A vessel with unauthorized gear aboard may not transfer at sea any fish in the snapper-grouper fishery_ (A) Taken in the EEZ, regardless of where the transfer takes place; or (B) In the EEZ, regardless of where such fish were taken. (iv) No vessel may receive at sea any fish in the snapper-grouper fishery from a vessel with unauthorized gear aboard, as specified in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section. (h) Use of sink nets off North Carolina. A vessel that has on board a permit for snapper-grouper, excluding wreckfish, that fishes in the EEZ off North Carolina on a trip with a sink net aboard, may retain otherwise legal fish in the snapper-grouper fishery taken on that trip with vertical hook-and-line gear or sea bass pots. For the purpose of this paragraph (h), a sink net_ (i) Is a flat net, designed to be suspended vertically in the water to entangle the head or body parts of fish that attempt to pass through the meshes; (ii) Has stretched mesh measurements of 3 to 43/4 inches (7.6 to 12.1 cm); and (iii) Is attached to the vessel when deployed. 10. In §646.23, paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) are removed; paragraph (a)(4) is redesignated as paragraph (a)(3); new paragraph (a)(2) is added; and paragraph (c)(2) introductory text is revised to read as follows: §646.23 Bag and possession limits. (a)␣*␣*␣* (2) Special limitations on possession and transfer of fish in the snapper-grouper fishery apply to a person fishing with unauthorized gear in the EEZ. See §646.22(g)(2). * * * * * (c)␣*␣*␣* (2) Provided each passenger is issued and has in possession a receipt issued on behalf of the vessel that verifies the duration of the trip_ * * * * * §§646.26, 646.27, and 646.28 [Redesignated as §§646.27 through 646.29] 11. Sections 646.26, 646.27, and 646.28 are redesignated as §§646.27, 646.28, and 646.29, respectively.
