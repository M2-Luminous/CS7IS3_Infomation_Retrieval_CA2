"This is not the day on which the German chancellor would be in the right place there," Kohl said in Munich on Friday [3 June]. The meeting in northern France next Monday will be attended by heads of state and government of the former anti-Hitler coalition. As an example of how this occasion should make "one look forward," Kohl cited the meeting that he and French President Francois Mitterrand have agreed to hold in Heidelberg two days later. There "a festival of friendship will take place with thousands of young people," he said at a lecture at the Christian Democratic Union's Economic Advisory Council.
