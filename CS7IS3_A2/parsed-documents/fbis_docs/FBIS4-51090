In line with the "Decision on Several Tasks to be Seriously Carried Out in the Anticorruption Drive in the Near Future," adopted by the party Central Committee and the State Council, and with the guidelines of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the regional party committee and regional government, as well as the regional discipline inspection commission and regional supervision department, mapped out specific plans for intensifying the anticorruption drive and promoting the construction of party work style and a clean government. Party committees and governments at all levels have attached great importance to the anticorruption drive, adopting a resolute attitude and taking prompt action; while large numbers of party members and cadres and the masses have energetically supported and actively participated in the drive. As a result, certain achievements have been made in the fight against corruption. These achievements are manifested in the following: Leading cadres have earnestly carried out self-examination and made prompt correction in accordance with the five requirements for clean standards and self-discipline. To ensure a good job of self-examination and correction, all prefectures (cities) and departments held democratic meetings, during which leading cadres voluntarily accepted supervision by the masses. According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of 1993, 76 percent of leading cadres at and above the county (section) level had conducted self-examination and correction and found problems in the following aspects: While screening economic entities affiliated with party and government organizations and concurrent jobs held by party and government cadres, some found themselves to have been involved in compensated intermediate activities, or sightseeing trips in a disguised way outside the country (territory). A fairly large number of party and government cadres found themselves to have taken part in gambling or accepted dinner invitations, gifts, or cash while attending weddings or funerals or performing official duties. A number of cases involving violations of the law and discipline were investigated. As of the end of 1993, discipline inspection and supervision organs in the region had received a total of 681 tips on such cases from the masses. Of these, 349 were accepted initially. After investigation and verification, 58 persons were punished according to party and administrative discipline; and 10 were turned over to the judicial organ for further investigation of their criminal responsibilities. As a result, the state and collectives recovered 1.145 million yuan in economic losses. Meanwhile, quite a few departments and units took the initiative to investigate and solve some serious problems reported by the masses. To lighten the burdens on farmers and herdsmen at large, fees collected by various localities and departments were also screened. After screening 177 fees and the standards of 1,337 fees, a total of 1.761 million yuan were found to have been collected in violation of discipline and were turned over to the treasury. As a result of the screening, the regional government abolished 31 unreasonable fees, while various prefectural (city) governments abolished 216 unreasonable fees.
