The economy minister stressed: "The increase in imports does not constitute a problem if it helps to increase our productive capacity." Cavallo conceded that the unemployment number is "worrisome," while snapping out that "1.5 million new jobs have been created over the last four years." He argued: "During October 1989, there were 11.5 million people employed. This figure increased to 12.5 million in October 1993 while in the last six years it had grown by only 600,000." [passage omitted] The minister said one should wonder "why more new jobs are not being created." He said many small- and medium-scale entrepreneurs "are afraid of the law on accidents on the shop-floor and current labor laws." This prompted him to reiterate his request for the enactment of the Labor Flexibility Law because "we must have more realistic labor laws, at least for the Pymes [small- and medium-scale enterprises]." To conclude, Cavallo pointed out that over the last three years the country has grown "25 percent," which means Argentina "has recorded the third largest growth rate in the world." [passage omitted]
