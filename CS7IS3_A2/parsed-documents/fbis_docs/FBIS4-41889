Russia in Partnership and Cooperation with the European Union. A Successful Choice, It Seems"] [Excerpt] Corfu-Moscow -- Russian foreign policy has made a headlong rush into the West's embrace. Confirming by his signature in Brussels Russia's agreement to take part in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, Andrey Kozyrev picked up a new document and headed immediately for the Greek island of Corfu. The following day the 12 leaders of the European Union [EU] and Boris Yeltsin signed the agreement on partnership and cooperation. Emerging from the solemn ceremony into the throng of waiting journalists with a smile as dazzling as the sun over this stunning Greek island, Boris Nikolayevich gave the following reason for that smile: "The agreement is good for us. Because it removes Europe's discriminatory approach toward economic ties with Russia and thereby averts a new `cold war' -- an economic one -- which was looming." I think that we ordinary Russians should share the president's joyful satisfaction. Why? First, we have every reason to be proud of the fact that we signed this document not as some poor relative who had suddenly turned up but as equal partners. True, we were not the first of the former brothers from the former Union with whom Europe has officially formalized its ties. That was Ukraine. However, for Russia, which is now experiencing far from the happiest times in relations with its independent [samostiynyy] neighbor, this is certainly no cause for sorrow. The laurels that the EU bestowed on Ukraine for coming first does not mean that the EU is banking on Kravchuk, for whom the agreement undoubtedly was a trump card in the election campaign. In the past the EU had quite a few criticisms of Kravchuk's economic course. The Europeans were also alarmed by the Ukrainian saga over the non-nuclear status. But by offering Ukraine partnership and cooperation, the EU secured a means of influence over it. The latest example of that is the decision adopted on Corfu on the closure of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. In addition, the agreement with Ukraine does not promise it the degree of equality which is envisaged by the agreement with Russia. To be fair it has to be noted that we did not get our equality easily. Initially the EC (as it then was) offered us something that was more the illusion of equality. Gradually and -- paradoxically as it may seem -- under the pressure of our domestic political confusion, the Europeans succumbed. But at the talks that were held two substantial stumbling blocks remained -- uranium and banks. France, which accounts for 60 percent of the stocks of enriched uranium in the EU market, was afraid of an "explosive" influx of cheap nuclear materials from Russia. Just 10 days before the signing of the agreement a compromise was reached whereby Russia's nuclear materials were included in the agreement along with other commodities while the EU retains the right to use certain instruments of commercial protection until 1997. Finally, Boris Yeltsin's recent edict lifting the ban on the activity of five foreign banks in Russia also removed the final question mark over the Greek accord. So what are we getting out of it? In the political sphere our relations with the Europeans are moving toward the kind of level that they have with the United States and Japan. It is envisaged that the EU and Russia will coordinate their positions on the main international questions and, if necessary, will put forward joint political initiatives. Then there is the economy. First and foremost, the EU is ceasing to consign us to the category of countries with a "state trade system" (that provision, incidentally, is absent from the agreement with Ukraine). And this means that the opportunities for using tough antidumping measures against us are limited. Unfortunately, while accepting certain concessions in the trade sphere, our partners remained inflexible on many other questions. Europe is still afraid of a "Russian invasion" and therefore our fellow citizens will still have to wait in line for visas and, having got one and finally reached their desired foreign land, they will have to spend a long time looking for work. Unfortunately the European Investment Bank, which finances major projects including those in the infrastructure, remains closed to us. Incidentally, one of the questions at the meeting on Corfu was the European program of "grand construction projects." This program envisages the construction of 11 projects within the general European transportation system, such as high-speed rail links, combined road and rail links across the Alps, and a highway which will link northern Europe and southern Greece. The amalgamation of the EU countries' energy systems falls into the same category. And even though Chancellor Kohl recently expressed in public his dream of the time when "it will be possible to board a train in London, cross the whole of Europe, and get out in Moscow," that dream remains unrealizable at present. We have not been invited to take part in those projects. Generally speaking, even though Boris Nikolayevich spoke eloquently on Corfu about the fact that "we are opening the door wide to peaceful and fruitful contact between our states and peoples," that door, albeit a wide one, has not been flung open to us -- rather, it is merely ajar. However, that is also understandable. After all, in its level and structure the Russian economy will long differ from the European economy, which means that it will be difficult for us to keep in step with "big-league Europe." Nevertheless, that is no cause for sorrow. Who said that Europe must mean the EU? Why not strive for broad, pan-European cooperation while remembering to keep our eyes on the boundless expanses of the CIS. [passage omitted]
