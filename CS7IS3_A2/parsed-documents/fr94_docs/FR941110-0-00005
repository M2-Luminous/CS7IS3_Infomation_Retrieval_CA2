FR941110-0-00005 FR941110-0-00001 The committee recommended authorizing establishment of minimum sizes for use in the production of limited use styles during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. The sizes are specified in terms of minimum weights for individual olives in various variety groups and are the same for both domestic and imported olives. An extra category is continued in the import regulation to apply comparable requirements for varieties not grown domestically. The minimum sizes for import requirements are as follows: Variety Group 1, except the Ascolano, Barouni, or St. Agostino varieties_1/90 pound Variety Group 1 of the Ascolano, Barouni, or St. Agostino varieties_1/140 pound Variety Group 2, except the Obliza variety_1/180 pound Variety Group 2 of the Obliza variety_1/140 pound Olives not identifiable as to variety or variety group_1/180 pound Each of the categories includes a 35 percent tolerance for olives weighing less than the specified minimum size. Continuing to permit the use of smaller olives in the production of limited use styles will allow importers to take better advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Importers will be able to import and market more olives than would be permitted under regulations prior to the interim final rule that relaxed size requirements. This additional opportunity is provided to maximize the use of the available olive supply and facilitate market expansion. Prior to the interim final rule, the smaller fruit could not be imported for limited uses, and would have to be disposed of through less profitable, non-canning uses under the supervision of the inspection service, exported, or utilized in exempt outlets. Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this final rule. After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the committee's recommendation, and other available information, it is found that this final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
