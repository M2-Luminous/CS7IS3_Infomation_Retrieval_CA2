I would like to comment only on the following points: 1. In all my statements, I have never put the blame fully on "former state officials" and said that "everybody else was always wrong; no one was right" as you wrote. You have made these statements up entirely because I clearly understand that among the previous and current administrators there are good and bad persons. I have a large number of colleagues in whom I fully have consideration and trust; all of them served the nation in the previous administration of the "State of Cambodia." 2. The luck I have to "step on Cambodian soil" again did not come from the deed of the "former government" as you said; it was due to the clear-sighted national reconciliation initiative of His Majesty [H.M.] the King, combined with the struggle of an overwhelming number of nationalists inside and outside the country, and because of the will of the entire Cambodian people who have voted for a change of regime in the country in May 1993. Despite this, I am a genuine Cambodian, born in Cambodia of Cambodian parents and as such I have the right to come back and live in my ancestors' land. 3. I would like to thank you for clearly showing your conscience and the degree of your cultural knowledge in accusing me of being a person who does not know how to "think ahead and in reverse" and for being a "half-wit." Furthermore, you called me "minister of economic and financial destruction." I would like to inform you that: -- The positions and honors that I have received so far came from H.M. the King and from the confidence in me of the Cambodian people who are Cambodia's sole owners. -- Recently, I was appointed by H.M. the King, with the consent of all political parties, member of Cambodia's Supreme National Council which represents Cambodia's sovereignty. -- Furthermore, I was elected people's representative in Siem Reap constituency. -- Lastly, I have been appointed by H.M. the King state minister and minister of economy and finance in the royal government that was set up in accordance with a royal decree dated 1 November 1993. -- You can despise me, but you should not express this through the use of improper words against the king and the Cambodian people who have made their judgment, selected, and appointed me to my current position. Therefore, according to what you said, this means that in your opinion the king of Cambodia and the Cambodian people lack correct judgment in electing their representatives and leaders. It also means that only Theng Bun Ma knows how to assess the qualities of the country's leaders. -- Perhaps the fact that you do not have Cambodian blood explains why you do not know how to respect Cambodia's king, people, and customs. 4. You wrote that I "malign the former government" with which I am "currently in cooperation" and that I want to "cause division in the Royal Government." Who appointed you lawyer of the "former government"? What right do you have to appoint yourself spokesman of the new government? Let the people judge your character as "lawyer" and "spokesman." 5. I would like to thank your company for allowing me and for being "always prepared" to let me "inspect its books." Regardless of this, in my position as the one responsible for managing the national economy, particularly in the fields of taxes and customs duties, I have full right to inspect all companies that I suspect or about which I have sufficient evidence that these companies have not correctly abided by the law. I have the honor to inform you that your company is among the above category of companies that are improper or would-be improper. Therefore, I will send a number of economic and financial officials to check your company in the near future. 6. Concerning the economy and investment, I have lived and studied and have been an investor myself for a fair number of years in liberal and developed countries in which there are proper laws and good order, which is an important factor enabling their economies to develop. It is my view that such conditions do not yet exist in Cambodia. This has led to the fact that a number of "investments" made in the past three or four years have not really promoted Cambodia's economy and society toward genuine progress. On the contrary, a number of illegal "investments," not in conformity with the nation's interest and with the people's will, have created a troubled atmosphere, corruption, embezzlement, and injustice toward a large number of poor and innocent people. In my view, as long as Cambodia does not have proper law and order and a number of leaders still do as they please, Cambodia cannot attract proper investors with good conduct to contribute to the country's progress in the long run. On the contrary, in the troubled atmosphere that has prevailed over the past three or four years, a large number of "investors" doing business in Cambodia tended to be bad foreigners who came to rob or destroy property and interests to pilfer and to serve their own interests with the support of some corrupt leaders as their partners. This type of investor and bad businessman has infiltrated and taken over many exclusive rights in the national economy. Investors and proper and legal businessmen (those who have paid taxes and customs duties and who refused or did not know how to bribe) cannot do business to compete with the bad guys. So, as long as I am in the current position, I will do my best to enable the country to have proper law and to get everyone, be they small or big, poor or rich, to abide by law and to respect national interest. Only in such condition can Cambodia attract good investors to do business in the country to make the national economy genuinely prosper and at the same time raise social justice. I am convinced that before too long good and law-abiding investors with respect for Cambodian interest and customs and traditions will replace bad investors, the ones we have so far encountered. In economic science, there is a law, which in English is called The Gresham Law [preceding three words in English], saying that "The bad money drives out the good." [preceding sentence in English] It means that "spoiled bank notes drive out the good ones from the market." This is the same in business in general. In other words, in a troubled atmosphere bad investors and traders drive out good investors and proper traders from the market. However, with all nationalists, I will strive to do my best to reverse this tragic and unjust current soon, namely to attract and encourage world-renowed investors with formidable means who are willing to abide by law and respect the nation's interest, to replace and drive out bad investors from the Cambodian market "The good investors will drive out the bad." [preceding sentence in in English] 7. After the election, the Cambodian people in general, like myself, rejoiced because we had put an and to a heavy foreign colonial yoke. However, the Cambodian people, like myself, have suffered and realized that our country is under the colonial economic yoke of the "Thai Boon Rong" company with a number of foreign criminal traders (mafia) [preceding word in English] behind it. Everyone knows that the "Thai Boon Rong" company is the real manager of our national economy because it has immense resources acquired through the Cambodian people's sweat and blood. It has used dollars to buy the conscience of some of our national leaders, enabling it to do as it pleases. We cannot count the number of plots of land, buildings, factories, houses, farms, forest, coastal stretches that Theng Bun Ma has embezzled and made his own with the collusion of a small number of old leaders who were corrupt and who have sold off the nation. Earlier, the question we should have asked those around us was: "What does Thai Boon Rong own?" because of Thai Boon Rong's already extensive ownership. Now the question we should ask is this: "What does not belong to Thai Boon Rong?" This is because almost the whole of our Cambodia in under Thai Boon Rong's influence. 8. I still remember that at the end of December 1991 following a brutal repression of students who demonstrated against corruption, I dared to openly and officially express my support for nationalists who dared to stage demonstrations against the old government for which Theng Bun Ma is now acting as "lawyer." My statement and message of support for compatriot demonstrators at that time was carried by a number of international newspapers worldwide. Now I have no fear whatsoever in expressing my nationalist sentiments which have forced me to expose and heavily stress on the colonial economy Thai Boon Rong is practicing in my revered motherland. Until the last drop of my blood I will show that I remain loyal always to the nation, religion, and the king. Phnom Penh 17 January 1994 Sam Rangsi
