FBIS4-6035 "dreas074_d_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 South Korea DPRK's Proposal for National Meeting Analyzed DPRK's Proposal for National Meeting Analyzed SK1604055694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0522 GMT 16 Apr 94 SK1604055694 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has again proposed a grand national meeting that smacks of a mass rally in an effort to solve inter-Korean problems. The proposal was made by Supreme People's Assembly (parliament) Speaker Yang Hyong-sop at a meeting of government and political party leaders held in Pyongyang on April 11. Yang offered to hold a grand national meeting in Seoul or Pyongyang on Aug. 15, the 49th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese rule, to discuss ways of achieving grand national unity. Among the big shots taking part in the April 11 meeting were Premier Kang song-san, Vice Premier Kim Pyong-sik and Workers' (Communist) Party Secretary Kim Yong-sun, to name but a few, according to the official North Korea watcher here, NAEWOE press. Yang also proposed that invitations be sent to leaders of the government, political parties and social organizations in South Korea as well as well-known Koreans overseas asking them to come to the grand national meeting. The proposed meeting, in its style and agenda, is similar to the all-Koreans' sessions the North Koreans have proposed in their propaganda offensive against South Korea over the years. Yang, saying the meeting should discuss achieving unity among all Koreans for national reunification, proposed the creation of a preparatory committee comprising five figures apiece from North and South Korea and overseas Korean communities. Pyongyang's fresh offer on a grand national conference is considered by many North Korea watchers here as an attempt to renew its unification front scheme, with a view toward turning its defensive position in inter-Korean relations to its advantage. Means of solving such inter-Korean problems as tension over the nuclear issue must be discussed at government-level talks. But the North Koreans want to hold an all-Koreans' meeting smacking of a mass rally in an apparent move to confuse South Korea, analysts say. It should be pointed out that the proposal came after North Korea ruptured the working-level inter-Korean dialogue on exchanging special envoys by threatening to turn Seoul into "a sea of flames" if war breaks out. It should also be noted that whenever inter-Korean relations reach an impasse, the North Koreans come up with a unification front scheme disguised as an all-Koreans' meeting to change the situation in their favor. In May 1990, President Kim Il-song presented a five-point unification program to the Supreme People's Assembly during its plenary session. The program envisioned forming a unification front, among other things, widely seen here as a scheme to cause social confusion in a South Korea that was then in a fever for unification. And in April last year, North Korea's parliament adopted President Kim Il-song's 10-point program for national unification through grand unity, which also called for a unification front. The unification front scheme camouflages the North Korean unification strategy to stir up revolution in South Korea. The recent grand national conference proposal should be seen in the context of this strategy because it came just a year after the North Korean parliament adopted the 10-point unification program. The proposal is thus seen by many analysts of North Korean affairs here as a tactical variation of its unification strategy. The proposal may also be regarded as an attempt by the North to solve its problems with the South and the United States over the nuclear dispute, by seeking a consensus of all Koreans around the world on the issue. With the U.N. Security Council-set deadline for additional inspections of its nuclear facilities approaching, North Korea needs a breakthrough and the grand national meeting proposal may be seen as a way out through unofficial dialogue with South Korea. Analysts say the North Koreans must feel the all-Koreans' meeting will help solve the nuclear issue in their talks with the Americans. They observe that Pyongyang will intensify its propaganda offensive against Seoul by publicizing its grand national conference proposal.
