The sources said that the idea of sending Jordanian disengagement forces was conveyed to Amman by Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Mujahid Abu-Shawarib when he visited the Jordanian capital a while back and held talks with King Husayn of Jordan on the latest developments in the Yemeni crisis. The sources said they believed that King HUsayn understood from Abu-Shawarib that the idea of sending Jordanian forces to the border between the two parts of Yemen had the approval of Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and that is why he ordered the relevant authorities in the Jordanian Army command to prepare these forces for immediate departure for specified areas in Yemen. The force, consisting of a number of officers and warrant officers, boarded a military aircraft which took off for Sanaa but did not complete the journey, returning halfway through the flight after receiving orders to do so from the Jordanian command. According to the sources, it seems that King Husayn, in a telephone conversation with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, discovered that the idea of sending Jordanian disengagement forces to the border areas was a "northern" idea only, and so he ordered the force to return to Amman.
