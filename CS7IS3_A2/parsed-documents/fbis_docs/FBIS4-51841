The planned repatriation of all the Vietnamese refugees is based on an old agreement between the two countries. Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh, who visited Indonesia recently, agreed to speed up the repatriation. Replying to reporters on the refugee protests on Galang Island where some have died from self-immolation, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said the protests had been staged by a group of refugees who failed to pass the screening test for resettlement in third countries. The protests were not directed at the Indonesian Government but rather at the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. According to Ali Alatas, about 140 out of the estimated 8,000 refugees are prepared to return to Vietnam.
