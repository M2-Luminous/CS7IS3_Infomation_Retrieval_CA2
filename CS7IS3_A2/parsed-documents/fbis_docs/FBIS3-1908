In a sharp exchange with Wu Yi, China's Foreign Trade Minister, during a press conference in Beijing, Sir Leon said: "Any action that discriminated against one member state on political grounds would be a very serious matter -- not just for that country, but for the European Union as a whole. "I want to make quite clear that the foundation of the relationship between the European Union as a whole and China is one of non-discrimination." When Wu jokingly suggested that Sir Leon had issued his warning because he was a Briton, he replied this had "nothing to do with it. "I speak as the commissioner whose task it is to represent the interests of the European Union as a whole. And if Madame Wu doesn't fully appreciate that, I'm glad to make it clear now." He did not say how Brussels might react to any discrimination. But Community officials have hinted they could take retaliatory action against China, which runs a big trade surplus with Europe. Sir Leon, visiting Beijing to discuss various trade issues, was responding to remarks by Wu that suggested the row over democratic reform plans in Hong Kong would inevitably affect Sino-British trade. British businessmen have been concerned by China's threats to exclude firms from lucrative contracts.
