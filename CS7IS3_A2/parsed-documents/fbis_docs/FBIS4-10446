Some deputies have begun to react to this proposal by the Senate. Edner Jean, after questioning some Haitian deputies on 11 April, filed this report: [Begin Jean recording] First of all, the president of the Chamber of Deputies was in a stew on 11 April because the office of Bernard Sansaricq not only disregarded his warnings, but forced the parliamentary gates in order to hold their exceptional session on 10 April. In fact, it was by breaking into the parliament, blowing up the institution's lockers, that the 18 January elected senators were able to enter the Legislative Palace. After the session, in the euphoria of the moment and the satisfaction of an accomplished feat, they did not even take the time to close the doors behind them, leaving the parliament's premises open to the night. In response to this, President Monde was so angry that he could not stay in his office on 11 April. We were able to make contact with the few deputies present in the Legislative Palace, and please understand that the legislators of the lower chamber have not budged one inch from their official position, meaning they simply reject any solution that does not take into account the interests of the various parties involved in the crisis. National Front for Change and Democracy, FNCD, Deputy Serge Jean-Louis did not hesitate to say that the men Senator Bernard Sansaricq is leading are irresponsible men. [passage omitted] We learned from reliable sources that the BP-FNCD will, within the next few hours, publicly issue its common position on this decision. The same is true for the socialists, who have been in consultation since 11 April. Everything leads us to believe that those political blocs are simply going to renew their support for the parliamentary plan, as pointed out by Deputy Milou Laguerre, a veteran among the deputies, who confessed to Radio Metropole that he does not know much. [passage omitted] The decision, unanimously reached by the office of Bernard Sansaricq, could, however, receive the support of some deputies. But there again, nothing is really relinquished to Bernard Sansaricq because those deputies seem to want to impose their own conditions. [passage omitted] All things considered, the deputies might need to take a stand during their Tuesday session on this resolution proposed by the branch of the Senate led by Sen. Bernard Sansaricq.
