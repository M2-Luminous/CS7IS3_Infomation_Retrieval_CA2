Although the name of the Crimean president will not be known until 30 January, when round two is due to be held, there is hardly any doubt that Yuriy Meshkov, who supports the peninsula's separation from Ukraine, will win. His rival in round two will be Nikolay Bagrov, the present chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council, and the only one of the six candidates who has consistently advocated that the peninsula remain in Ukraine. The popularity of this idea among the population there can be judged from the number of votes cast for Bagrov -- 17.5 percent. What will happen next? The future president's first step has already been decided -- Meshkov plans to organize a referendum on the peninsula's future on 27 March, the same day as the parliamentary elections in Ukraine. The outcome of that referendum is virtually predetermined. After 27 March Meshkov, backed with the people's support, will in all likelihood launch the campaign to change the status of Crimea. Russian diplomacy is going to have some serious problems to tackle. On the one hand, public opinion cannot be ignored: The majority of Russians cannot accept the loss of Crimea, which was won for Russia by Catherine the Great's military commanders. The State Duma, under the influence of the Communists and liberal democrats, will surely follow the example of Khasbulatov's Supreme Soviet and adopt a resolution taking under Russian jurisdiction not just Sevastopol but the whole peninsula. In Crimea, of course, this will cause an explosion of exultation and will trigger a wave of demonstrations under red flags and tricolors. At the same time, by casting doubt on the territorial integrity of its neighboring state, Russia will set a most dangerous precedent, canceling out the Helsinki accords and its own commitments within the CSCE framework. In addition, the affiliation of Crimea can at best bring moral satisfaction but will not improve either the economic situation in Russia or relations with the CIS countries, which will interpret this as visible confirmation of Moscow's "imperial ambitions." Nor should it be forgotten that the agreement on scrapping Ukraine's nuclear weapons has still not been ratified by parliament, and a sharp deterioration of relations between Moscow and Kiev could make President Kravchuk change his position too. Judging by the initial statements of Russian diplomats, the Foreign Ministry prefers not to draw far-reaching conclusions from the Crimean election results. Unless it clearly and unambiguously states that it renounces its territorial claims on Ukraine, Moscow could repeat the sorry experience of Belgrade. By giving unconditional support to fellow countrymen in Crimea, Yeltsin runs the risk of becoming a hostage to separatist leaders, as happened with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Moscow's open interference in the emerging conflict between Kiev and Simferopol will do irreparable damage to the reputation of Russian democracy. The question is whether the Kremlin's leaders will manage to resist the temptation of trying to boost their own popularity at their weakened neighbor's expense.
