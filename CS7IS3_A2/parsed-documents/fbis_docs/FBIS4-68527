The investigation was triggered by the appeal of the former chief of the state tax service in St. Petersburg, Dmitriy Filippov, to the chairman of the State Duma. The Committee on Security performed a preliminary investigation of the questions raised in the appeal, and presented for review a packet of documents testifying to the fact that a number of state officials are inflicting tremendous loss upon the economic security of Russia, and counteracting the receipt of considerable ruble and currency revenues by the federal and state budgets. The St. Petersburg State Tax Service, which was headed by Dmitriy Filippov up until 9 October 1993, uncovered these facts. This seriously affected the interests of commercial structures, joint enterprises and the state property fund, which had been concealing huge profits from taxation, directing them not their intended purpose but in the interests of enriching private individuals and foreign states. Under their pressure, Filippov was dismissed from his duties on 9 October 1993. As evident from the report prepared for the hearings by the Committee on Security, Filippov's dismissal was facilitated by Mayor A. Sobchak, RF Goskomimushchestvo [Russian Federation Committee on State Property] Chairman A. Chubays, former Acting Prime Minister Ye. Gaydar, former RF Minister of Finance B. Fedorov, and the chief of the Russian State Tax Service, V. Gusev. Members of the Committee on Security, Viktor Mironov, Aleksey Sarychev, Vladimir Baryshev (all representatives of "Russia's Choice") immediately made efforts to undermine the parliamentary hearings, citing various excuses. Their desire to narrow the problem to an elementary labor conflict whose review, they said, was not within the competency of the Committee on Security, did not find support among the overwhelming majority of the deputies. Both sides of the so-called "labor conflict" were presented at the parliamentary hearings. Unfortunately, the representatives of the St. Petersburg procurator's office which, according to the facts uncovered by Filippov, had instituted the criminal case, were unable to be present at these hearings. "It all began," Dmitriy Filippov told the deputies, "as soon as our service undertook a serious investigation of the joint enterprises. Our hair stood up on end! As it turns out, many of them are created primarily through Russian currency credits, using our cheap work force. But the products are shipped abroad, leaving the currency profits in foreign banks and not even paying tax to Russia. This is double and triple robbery of the state. The Russian-Swiss enterprise `Europa-Hotel' `bilked' our budget out of $24 million. The Russian-Finnish enterprise `Lenraumamebel' shipped 90 percent of its finished product for sale in Finland, where the money earned was used in the interests of the Finnish economy. And there are many such examples in the documents which were submitted. Our service was able to return part of the dollars. But then the pressure started from the mayorality and the government. They said we were hindering the investment of foreign capital. But tell us, please, where are the investments?!" "There was even greater pressure exerted by the power structures when we undertook an investigation of the property fund. It became apparent that a large part of the money obtained from privatization does not go to the budget, but is used in the circulation of commercial banks for preferential 2-percent credit. In other words, here too there is a gigantic rip-off of the state and stuffing of the pockets of businessmen, who are protected by state bureaucrats. As soon as they sensed a threat to themselves, they dismissed me from my duties on 9 October of last year. In the words of the deputy chief of the State Tax Service, the reason for my dismissal was a letter from Sobchak and pressure from Gaydar. In his conversation with me, Sobchak did not hide the fact that he had sent such a letter because, he said, there had been great pressure exerted on him from the government of Russia, and Chubays played the most active role in this." "The capital's Sverdlovsk Rayon Court reinstated me to my position. But then a directive from Chernomyrdin appeared, regarding the elevation of its status to the level of deputy chief of the RF State Tax Service. Appointed to this position was a specialist in... agriculture. I was once again dismissed due to staff cut-backs, even though there were no cut-backs. I again filed a claim with the Sverdlovsk Rayon Court, where a hearing will be held on this case on 26 April." The chairman gave the floor to the chief of the RF State Tax Service, V. Gusev. He spoke at length about the general problems of the department, but did not have the courage to approach the question of the "Petersburg conflict." Only the specific questions of the deputies forced him to do so. "On what grounds did you dismiss Filippov in October of 1993?" "The court reviewed this question and rescinded my order. I have nothing to add to the court's decision." "Was there pressure exerted upon you?" "I do not recall such a thing..." "What was the reason for Filippov's second dismissal?" "On 26 April there will be a trial on this matter. It will clarify everything." "But can you explain the motive for your second order?" "The trial will be held on 26 April, and this will be clarified at that time." That is the level of explanations given by the official... The members of the committee, who carefully studied tens of documents on the question under review, were for the most part synonymous in their opinion. Stanislav Govorukhin spoke bitterly of the fact that the Petersburg "Russia's Choice" reflected, like the world in a drop of water, the entire grave criminal situation in which Russia finds itself. Under the guise of investments and all kinds of privatizations, it is being plundered on an unprecedented scale. And, if there are not enough people in the Duma willing to oppose this, then the imminent collapse of the state is inevitable. No less bitterness resounded in the words of Yuriy Vlasov as he spoke about that most outrageous situation which has arisen in the state mechanism of Russia: He who steals or helps to plunder the country gets respect and a position, while he who courageously stands up in defense of state interests is cast aside by the system. If the Duma is unable to defend Filippov, he stressed, then there can be no discussion of its capacity to stop the plunder of the country. The previously mentioned representatives of "Russia's Choice" once again tried to obstruct the parliamentary hearings. They called for the committee not to make any decision, to wait for the trail, or at least to create a parliamentary commission. However, the decree was adopted by an overwhelming majority of votes. It contains a proposal to the head of the RF government for immediate reinstatement of Dmitriy Filippov to his duties. It recommends that, in the first half of 1994, the Russian State Tax Service conduct an investigation into the activities of Goskomimushchestvo. A packet of documents on cases of gross violation of the tax and labor legislation will be forwarded to the procurator general for resolution of the question of bringing the guilty parties to responsibility. It was decided that the problems raised at the parliamentary hearing should be brought to the plenary meeting of the State Duma.
