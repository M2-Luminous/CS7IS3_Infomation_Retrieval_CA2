The economic route to prosperity as the party sees it is set out in a 36-page manifesto released at its federal congress at Kempton Park's World Trade centre on Thursday [3 February]. Punting the NP as "the party for peace and prosperity," the manifesto states that peace can be achieved only if all people enjoyed prosperity. People and families could not be happy and prosperous without jobs, homes, education and proper health care. "Only a free and strong economy can make jobs, houses, schools, hospitals, clinics and other good things possible," the NP says. It then sets out its view of the prerequisites for such an economy as being: - proper protection of private property; - investor confidence to build factories and create jobs; and - reasonable taxes as an incentive to harder work. Dealing with the broad economic aspects in some detail, the manifesto stresses that a strong economy requires peace and justice in the workplace with the rights of both workers and employers properly protected. Socialism and communism, as proved in Eastern Europe and in Africa, destroyed the economy, prosperity and jobs. "Organisations and parties who still want socialism and communism do not really understand economics," the NP says. Dealing with jobs, the NP claims credit for having created job opportunities by giving millions for small business development, deregulation, reduced taxation, bringing down inflation and export promotion. "The economic policies of the new National Party are attracting foreign investment, thereby creating more jobs. "Only the NP can create more jobs," the manifesto claims. On housing the party claims credit for making huge portions of land available for new urban settlement, helping more than a million families with a R[Rand]7,500 discount on buying a home, spending R550 million on subsidies for first time home owners and making R2,500 million available for housing in 1993 alone. Furthermore, the manifesto claims credit for the government having introduced site and service schemes for a million families to build and upgrade homes in informal settlements. Its housing edownment scheme, launched last month, would motivate the private sector to participate in eliminating the underdevelopment of the past and deal with the needs of a growing population. On education the party bemoans the fact that the nation had for too long been hampered by discrimination, a lack of discipline and a political struggle being waged in schools. Again it claims credit for the new NP government having increased education funding by leaps and bounds in recent years, eliminating or significantly reducing discrepencies in funding, working towards a single department with regional decentralisation and the creation of a more autonomous school management system with parental participation. The NP stood for a stable system which was just and equal for everyone and which provided for: - compulsory schooling for at least nine years; - vocational training; - relevant learning material and curricula; - international certification standards; - choice of mother tongue education; and - the option of language, culture and religion based state funded schools. Dealing with the health aspect of prosperity, the NP claims credit for the advances and achievements of the present system and says the highest priority must remain on primary health care and the basic service be a function of local authorities. Setting the year 2000 as a target, it then pledges to: - set up a local health committee for each community; - ensure there are enough clinics to provide access to health facilities for all; - affordable health care in public and private sectors; - immunisation programmes to provide 100 percent coverage; - extending feeding development programme; and - ensuring constructive cooperation between the public and private sectors. The manifesto also contians a chapter on "prosperity and affirmative action," criticising discriminating laws, schooling systems and attitudes of the past and claiming credit for removing many and much of these. The government was overcoming backlogs and opened up equal opportunities for all in the civil service. It pledges itself to ensure that all individuals have equal access to opportunities for self-development and making the best possible contribution to the economy. "People who in the past did not have equal opportunities must receive special training, education and support so that they can develop fully and make their full contribution," is the party pledge to affirmative action. Finally, the NP says, prosperity depends on relations with the world outside, on foreign investors building factories and creating jobs. The NP's economic policies pleased the outside world and its reforms had lured trade and investment delegations and rejuvinated its sports ties and tourism. The National Party would make South Africa a leader in southern Africa and the continent as it had much "to offer our brothers to the north."
