The Presidential Race in Ukraine Has Begun. But the Elections of the New President Might Not Take Place"] [Text] Odessa -- The presidential elections in Ukraine are surrounded by sensation inadvertently triggered by Leonid Kravchuk. Long before the presidential race began he said in a radio interview with a foreign correspondent that he will not be standing in the future elections. The nomination of election contenders took place in the traditional, smooth way. At the allotted time the Central Electoral Committee accepted the documents and issued signature lists to Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the Socialist Party; Leonid Kuchma, former prime minister; Vladimir Lanovoy and Viktor Pinzenik, former vice premiers; Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the last Supreme Council; and Nikolay Rud, a teacher at Kiev Technical University and a complete unknown. On the last day Education Minister P. Tapanchuk and V. Babich, president of the Ukrainian Financial Group joint-stock union, entered the race. Admittedly, it was known that in one rural rayon the assembly had nominated Leonid Makarovich but he did not respond to that at all. It should be explained to the non-Ukrainian reader that the presidential elections were initiated by Leonid Kravchuk himself. This happened in a situation of deep crisis when the country was inundated by a flood of demands for the resignation of the president and the Supreme Council. Now a new parliament has been elected. There are eight contenders prepared to fight for the right to save Ukraine from imminent catastrophe. But the newly elected deputies are beginning to be canvassed by enterprising free agents who come bearing a letter proposing that the presidential elections be postponed. June 26 is not the right time. The old Supreme Council got its calculations wrong and did not think things out well. Leonid Makarovich has also issued a statement agreeing that the elections simply must be postponed to a later date for the sake of preserving political stability in the country. Be that as it may, the sociologists are claiming that Leonid Kuchma has the highest popularity rating among Ukrainian politicians today. People remember his speeches as premier when he simply screamed out loud about Ukraine's imminent catastrophe. Ivan Plyushch said candidly in a recent TV interview that he had not intended to stand for the presidency but had decided to do so only after Leonid Makarovich had assured him that he would not be putting his own nomination forward. "Since he is not standing I have decided to!" I personally would have been more impressed by the ambitious stance and hard-won convictions and plans of the political leader had they not been dependent on Kravchuk's decision. But that is the kind of man Ivan Stepanovich is -- an energetic, somewhat rough and ready man who plays the part of the kindly village uncle but who controls his audience magnificently, steers the necessary decisions through brilliantly, and demolishes the unnecessary ones expertly. I. Plyushch was sincerely confused and did not hide his resentment at Leonid Makarovich's sleight of hand. L. Kravchuk does not have to account to anyone why he said one thing yesterday but is doing something different today. In Ukraine the president's legendary ability of being able to go out in the rain without an umbrella and not get wet has been confirmed once more. He worked things out with precision and bided his time perfectly before entering the campaign to retain the presidency. The nomination is not the main move but his insurance, his fall-back position. Just in case the elections are held. L. Kravchuk believes that the present Ukrainian Constitution does not contain a statute on the early election of the president. There is a statute on the early termination of power as a result of impeachment and -- on the initiative of the citizens -- through a referendum. Thus the old parliament exceeded its powers. And Leonid Markovich [as published] was forced to accept that. In Kravchuk's opinion the violation of the aforementioned articles makes the new elections illegitimate. And the blame for this situation rests on the old parliament which during four years' work did not find the time to adopt a constitution -- the only parliament in the Commonwealth not to do so. If the new parliament confirms the decision of the old one, all the responsibility will rest on it. Not for the elections but for the fate of Ukraine as a whole. That is the president's view. And he is absolutely right. In the new Supreme Council 120 deputies have signed their names to the protest letter against the presidential elections. The rest have doubts. There is not a single fortune teller prepared to guess how events will develop at the first session. When setting out the deck of cards showing the presidential contenders the voter can work out in theory which card is the ace, but how can he tell which suit the trump cards will be?
