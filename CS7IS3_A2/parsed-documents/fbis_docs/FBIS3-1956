Such an important arrangement gave expression to regularity in the building of the armed forces in the new period and represented a major step toward enhancing the quality of our armed forces. Why should troop management be placed in an important position in the building of the armed forces? This is because troop management is the foundation for all activities of the armed forces, and the existence and development of the armed forces cannot be maintained with rigorous and scientific troop management. In a broad sense, troop management refers to the organization, coordination, control, and regulation of the special working and living order and method, and to the subordinate personnel and equipment of the armed forces according to relevant regulations and rules. So we may say that troop management covers everything and has to be conducted at any time. It is the basic work in the military units, and must be conducted most frequently, intensively, and extensively. It constitutes the precondition and provides the guarantee for the rallying force, combat effectiveness, consolidation, and development of the military units, and is also closely linked with the revolutionization, modernization, and regularization of the armed forces. Without unified, rigorous, and scientific management of troops, there will be an undisciplined, loose, lax, and disorderly condition, and military units will become just a plate of loose sand and will lose their combat effectiveness. At present, the building of the armed forces is situated in a new historical period, and the work of troop management is getting more and more important. Properly managing troops is also an important point in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideas about building the armed forces in the new period. Along with the in-depth development of reform and opening and the development of the socialist market economy, profound changes have occurred in the overall social environment for the building of the armed forces. On the one hand, this will fundamentally lay a solid material foundation for the modernization of the armed forces, and will further encourage officers and men to update their mentality, seek more knowledge, and make achievements. This will thus give new vitality and dynamism to construction and reform in the armed forces. We should grasp the opportunity, give proper guidance according to the development of the situation, break new ground, make advances, and raise the work of troop management to a new level. On the other hand, we should also notice that in the course of transition from the old to new systems, we have encountered and will continue to encounter many new problems that we did not encounter before in troop management, and we are required to tell our cadres and soldiers what to do and how to react and give them timely and effective answers. Thus, we should find new concepts, means, and methods to adapt the work of troop management to the changing situation. The armed forces are shouldering the military mission in the new period, and this also sets high requirements for the work of troop management. Local wars under modern conditions will not only be confrontations of high-tech weaponry and equipment, but will, more importantly, also be a trial of strength in the aspects of personnel quality and troop discipline. The more advanced the weaponry and equipment, the higher the requirements for the quality of troop management will become. Happenings in recent local wars in the contemporary world fully show that the high-tech war has made the time for the movement of troops to a stage of calculating minutes and seconds; so only with rigorous and scientific management can discipline and good combat style and effectiveness be brought about. The Army has fine tradition and scientific theory for troop management. Substantial progress has also been made in this regard in recent years. However, we should also admit that the current condition of troop management is still unsuited to the needs in the development of the socialist market economy. Strengthening and improving troop management remains an extremely important and urgent task. All units in the Army must follow Chairman Jiang's instruction: "Being politically up to standard, militarily proficient, consistent in keeping the fine style of work, highly discipline, and effective and efficient in logistics guarantees." They should study the new conditions and resolve the new problems in troop management in the new period, lay a good foundation for the building of the armed forces, and enhance the quality, efficiency, and combat effectiveness through the improvement of troop management.
