The Lai Chau provincial cadres have tried, in vain, to persuade them to grow peanuts instead of poppies. The Vietnamese authorities find themselves increasingly helpless to deal with opium plantations and severe drug addiction among ethnic minorities in mountainous regions especially Lai Chau and Son La. At the same time, increasing drug abuse in major lowland cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Hai Phong have pushed up demand for raw materials from the mountainous areas. Vietnam has just encountered scenes familiar in northern Thailand and is trying to deal with a whole set of issues through the similar approach of crop substitution programmes and rehabilitating drug addicts while boosting law enforcement. But the absence of laws relating to illicit drugs, combined with corruption among law enforcers, an erratic judicial system and a generally crumbling law enforcement situation, raise the question of how effectively the government will handle this issue for which a national programme, as well as an anti-narcotics bureau, have only been recently set up. "We have a surplus of decrees and resolutions but what's been accomplished so far shows a lack of resolve. Police in Cao Bang province found 2.8 kilogrammes of opium but the trafficker was released after posting a bail of US$20. This is not to talk about some depraved policemen receiving bribes from other drug traffickers," said a critical article on this issue carried by Lao Dong (Labour) which is published by the Confederation of Trade Union. It was not until September 1990 that the Lai Chau provincial authority took its own initiative to ban opium growing, smoking, trade and storage. "We had to introduce the ban because our education campaign had failed," said Mai Thi Ly, deputy governor of Lai Chau province. She is of ethnic Hmong origin and these people form the largest group of opium growers in the region. Last year, the Vietnamese government passed another resolution on illicit drugs which prescribed penalties for drug abuse and trafficking. "That had very little impact," on the thriving situation in Lai Chau, said Mrs Ly in an interview. "We have resorted to different methods of persuasion, urging people not to grow opium. The villagers who turn to cash crops said it was difficult for them to sell their products. The budget we received from Hanoi is strictly for seeds, but there's no money for road access," she said. Opium addiction among ethnic minorities in remote provinces, especially in the north of Vietnam, is such that "in some places, the whole villages smoke opium, the whole families smoke opium including some children under 15," according to Deputy Minister Phan Thanh Xuan of the National Committee for Ethnic Minorities and Mountainous Areas. The Vietnamese government said there were 150,000 drug addicts nationwide. Of the 12,000 drug addicts officially discovered in Lai Chau province, 1,600 of them were treated. "Drug abuse is much more difficult to do away with than poppy fields. Of those rehabilitated, we found that most of them later return to the habit," said Mrs Ly. In Lai Chau, the local authorities are grappling with the budgetary and logistical questions of relocating the provincial capital from Lai Chau to Dien Bien Phu. On the fringe of the town's only main road construction of the province's only drug addicts rehabilitation centre is under way. The centre, located on what used to be the site of a herbal medicine clinic, began service in January this year and, so far, it has come across one intravenous drug user, according to Nguyen Duc Thien, director of the centre. The opium area in Lai Chau province was more than 1,000 hectares before 1990. Officials put the current estimate at 300 hectares. Poppy field annihilation squads would roam the region during harvest time in September to wipe them out. In the past, opium production and movement had been internal in that it satisfied small-scale needs within the province. But officials were alarmed to have intercepted for the first time last November 190 kilogrammes of opium from Laos en route to destinations outside the province. Early this year, another 230 kilos from across the border was intercepted in Lai Chau. "That stuff was on transit in Lai Chau, destined for Hanoi and Hai Phong. Until last November's case, we never found locals who moved more than five kilos of opium. In the 230 kilo case, the traffickers came from Hai Phong. They started operating some rackets here," said Deputy Governor Dy. This is what causes the gravest concern for her. "Local people here don't go to Hanoi to sell, but the people from outside, for instance, Hanoi come here to buy." Vietnam is pondering accession to an international treaty on illicit drugs. Tracking down international drug cartels has been possible so far with cooperation from Interpol. The country has recently participated in two ASEAN programmes which will be implemented in Vietnam: Antinarcotics information; and the parents and children against drug abuse campaign. Vietnam, which has no diplomatic relations with the US, hoped that one day it could hook up with the vast pool of resources and intelligence network of the US Drug Enforcement Agency, said Deputy Minister Xuan. "We believe that cooperation with the US DEA would help reduce narcotics supply to their country," he said.
