The debt of the Russian Armed Forces for the supply of food products alone amounts to 60 billion rubles. Nevertheless, the financial administration of the Russian Defense Ministry continues to hold a defensive position, and shrugs off the numerous appeals -- from the Pacific Fleet among others -- for payments for provisions delivered on credit. According to a report of the Pacific Fleet press service, the fleet command wasted a mountain of paper sending requests for financing of military units to obtain the barest necessities. However, both the Russian Government and the Ministry of Defense remain indifferent to these requests.
