In today's meeting of the Moldovan Parliament, after he had reviewed the activity of the old government, Prime Minister Sangheli presented the list that includes the names of the new executive members. This list includes 22 persons, compared with the 32 persons that formed the old government. Among the ministers who were kept in office are the following: Pavel Creanga, minister of national defense; Constantin Antoci, minister of interior; Vasile Calmoi, minister of state security; and Vitalie Gorincioi, minister of agriculture. Among the new members of the government I will mention the following: Mihai Popov, minister of foreign affairs; Valeriu Chitan, minister of finance; Valeriu Bobutac, minister of national economy; Grigore Triboi, minister of industries; and Vasile Sturza, minister of justice. I should also mention that the new governmental structure includes 17 ministries and eight state departments, compared to 20 ministries and 11 state departments in the old structure.
