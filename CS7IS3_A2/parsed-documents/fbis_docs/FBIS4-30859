You have met Andrey Vavilov, first deputy finance minister of the Russian Federation. How happy are you with the attitude of our former big brother to the debt owed to our small country, particularly as this debt is not negligible, if we take into consideration the size of our country. Is there not a danger that by having our debt repaid we will get ourselves into a new form of dependence on Russia? [Klaus] Somebody keeps going on about this. I must be really arrogant, as everybody says, because since 15 May I have repeatedly said that any sort of dependence on Russia is completely out of the question. No one would dream of it. I do not know where this idea has come from. We are simply trying to get something back for our debts; this is our only aim. We have no other conditions and Russia does not attach any. I think this is really a fabrication by some politicians, perhaps Mr. Daniel Kroupa or someone. [passage omitted] Russia has enormous debts, and not only to us. Its total debt is a hundred times bigger than what it owes to the Czech Republic. It must repay it at some point. We cannot have any illusions that Russia would repay us earlier than the rest of the world -- we are not the center of the world. [passage omitted]
