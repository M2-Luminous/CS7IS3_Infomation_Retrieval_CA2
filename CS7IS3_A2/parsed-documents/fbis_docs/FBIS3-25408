Good evening, Mr. Terreblanche. I should perhaps mention here that we had invited General Constand Viljoen and Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg of the Conservative Party. They had initially agreed to appear, but later withdrew. Thank you for keeping your word, Mr. Terreblanche, and coming to the studio. Mr. Terreblanche, these are dangerous times we are living in. You know that as well as I do. I would, therefore, like us to be very direct tonight, so that people can be informed. My first question is: What do the clothes you are wearing mean? You always wear them in public these days. Why do you go around in a cap trimmed with gold and a camouflage uniform? [Terreblanche] The fact is, this is the official dress of the AWB's Victory Commando. In the beginning we wore khaki to identify ourselves as a movement with a distinct identity. A few months ago this became our official dress, especially designed for our commandos. I should mention that it is not our general wear, but there is no reason why, when one appears on the Agenda program, one has to be dressed in a suit. This is the way we dress when we hold our staff meetings, when we are in camp... [Du Preez] Clothes make a statement. What does your outfit say? [Terreblanche] If these clothes could speak, they would say there are men in South Africa, the overwhelming majority of the Afrikanerdom, who are preparing for war, a war which is being forced upon us. We do not want to find ourselves in the position of the whites in the rest of Africa, the white colonialists who were caught... [Du Preez] But as recently as January when you were negotiating you appeared in those clothes at the negotiations. [Terreblanche] I have never negotiated. I have held discussions with members of the government. [Du Preez] But you must have been hoping there would be peace, a settlement... [Terreblanche, interrupting] Yes, of course. But I never negotiated with the enemy, the African National Congress [ANC] and the South African Communist Party [SACP]... [Du Preez] But was General Viljoen not negotiating on your behalf? [Terreblanche] No, not at all. [Du Preez] But are you not a member of the Afrikaner National Front [AVF]? [Terreblanche] I am a member of the AVF, but the AWB has always reserved the right not to be part of the negotiations. You must understand that there are naturally small, very small differences within the AVF, because the AVF is made up of 19 different organizations... [Du Preez, interrupting] Are the differences really so very small, or are they growing? [Terreblanche] If you would allow me to continue, I will show you how small these differences are. The most important thing is that the issue which brought us together remains the first, the primary task of the AVF, and that is the achievement of a homeland for the Afrikaner Boer nation. Some believe that this can be achieved through negotiations. I am convinced that negotiations with a communist can never bring peace, because communists all over the world, in all their negotiations, have always showed they cannot honor their word. [Du Preez] Did you tell that to Gen. Viljoen? Did you say to him, look, General, you are going to negotiate on my behalf, and on my party's behalf, and I am part of your movement, but you are negotiating with communists, and therefore you are not negotiating on my behalf? [as heard] [Terreblanche] Gen. Viljoen is very much aware that the AWB does not believe in negotiations. That has been the case since we met, and that is how we became part of the National Front. [Du Preez] And also of the Freedom Alliance? [Terreblanche] The fact is I have not negotiated with the Freedom Alliance either, because it is not at all necessary. The task of the AWB is different, a task we have set for ourselves, years ago, 20 years ago, when we said that at some time or another this government will capitulate, as the white colonial regimes capitulated in Africa. We said we must establish a people's movement whose primary task would be to see to it that law and order is maintained when chaos and disorder breaks out. [Du Preez] What you are saying is that whenever Gen. Viljoen was negotiating, or holding discussions, or whatever term one uses -- on behalf of the AWB as a member of the AVF -- you had no faith in all that; you are saying that there are communists in the ANC, and you do not negotiate with communists. There were negotiations with Inkatha and the Bophuthatswana government and Ciskei and the Freedom Alliance, and even then you as the AWB had no faith in the talks. Is that so? [Terreblanche] I find it very strange that you could make such a statement. [Du Preez] Have I misunderstood you? [Terreblanche] No, I think you understand me quite clearly; and I believe I also understand you well. I want to point out, however, that I was the first leader of an organization which negotiated with nonwhite leaders outside parliamentary structures -- or rather, I talked with them. I, as leader of the AWB, invited Captain Diergaardt [member of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance of Namibia] to South Africa long before the fall of South-West Africa. I signed an agreement with Mr. Musa Myeni of Inkatha in the Transvaal. I also signed an agreement in Vereeniging with Inkatha's Mr. Thwala. I signed an agreement with Ciskei. As for the present negotiations, I have no part in them, because Gen. Viljoen and Dr. Hartzenberg have taken it upon themselves to shoulder that part of the attainment of a homeland. [Du Preez] And do you have confidence in them? Even today? [Terreblanche] I do. Of course, I do. [Du Preez] When your people booed Gen. Viljoen on 29 January, why did no one stand up for him? There he was, standing alone, and the people who were booing him were mainly AWB members. [Terreblanche] It is clear you were not present. I was the person who immediately went to his assistance. I walked to the platform and said, the people do not understand this point, and I then proposed that the issue be referred back to the national assembly. I made the announcement, and the situation was defused. [Du Preez] Good, but now we come to an interesting point. You say that you told the people they do not understand the point, but this was a very important point that General Viljoen tried to make. In reality, as I understand the situation, it is the closest the National Front has ever come to a settlement. In my book, as I read it from a neutral corner, this was such a good dispensation for the National Front. Can you tell me what your understanding is of that proposal offered by General Viljoen when he was heckled, because that was actually a turning point? [Terreblanche] On that Thursday, the Thursday preceding the Saturday of the meeting, Dr. Hartzenberg informed me of the situation for the first time and we had the documentation at hand. The same night I put forward the official stance of the AWB to Dr. Hartzenberg, and that is that the requirements of the Afrikaner National Front and my organization, the AWB, are not being met. I shot down that document with the greatest determination. [Du Preez] What did that document say, Mr. Terreblanche? [Terreblanche] That document merely said that the Afrikaner Boer nation has a right to propagate the ideal of a homeland after the 27 April election. [Du Preez] As I understand it, and I stand corrected, this document stated that the Afrikaner National Front should participate in the nonracial election and then all the electoral wards, or districts rather, will be counted separately and announced. People voting for the National Front will then vote for a manifesto which says: We want a homeland. As I understand the document and its contents said that they will then look at where these people are who want a homeland and how many there are, and then a clause will be added to the transitional constitution which says that when there is sufficient proof of support for a homeland, then it can be negotiated nine months thereafter, after a new government is in place. Is my understanding of this incorrect? [Terreblanche] Yes. You see, the basic issue is that the African National Congress or the government did not recognize the rights of the people, that it wanted land of its own in its own free republic. All that it said -- the modus operandi -- all that they said is just that you will have the right to pursue the ideal of a homeland. [Du Preez] But it is written into the constitution. [Terreblanche] That does not mean anything. Whether it is written into the constitution or not -- it means that the constitution is so full of shortcomings -- whether or not it is written into the constitution, then in the future we may only be able to argue about certain things. To say you have the right to ask about these things is pathetic. Recognition was not given as a right of our people. When I argue about this I am being realistic. The right of people -- the reason for the UN's existence, the reason for its existence, is to see that nations can live in freedom and sovereignty and that the one does not hinder the other's sovereignty -- all that these people are saying is that we are offering, in your own fatherland, that you will have the right hereafter to propagate this. I just want to say, later they added a tail, which said that you will have the right to speak your language and that you will have the right to practice your religion. If you look at the entire document, it says: Under a strange government, in which I am not admitting that you have the right to your own land, you will be able to cry in Afrikaans and you will be able to pray in Afrikaans -- those are the only rights you are given. [Du Preez] Then you said that this is unacceptable? [Terreblanche] Yes. [Du Preez] But that was General Viljoen's proposal. [Terreblanche] Yes. [Du Preez] But earlier you told me that you still trust General Viljoen. [Terreblanche] The fact of the matter is...I believe that General Viljoen, to the best of his ability, tried to achieve a settlement, and indeed also told me and my general staff, that he will do everything in his power to try and achieve a settlement along these peaceful lines, that he would never be able to tear himself away from the ideal or the reality of a homeland and the right of the Boer people to self-determination. Now General Viljoen has the right to try his own method. As I told you.... [Du Preez, interrupting] But is that a method you reject? [Terreblanche] It is very definitely something that I will not attempt to do, because it does not help if the people you are negotiating with are the aggressors who have already declared war. [Du Preez] But General Viljoen does not think so. Do you think he is naive? [Terreblanche] I do not think that General Viljoen should think the way I do or as any other person thinks. [Du Preez] Yes, but you feel strongly about this. [Terreblanche] I do feel strongly about this but I want to tell you again that the issues inspiring us to stand together is much bigger than the difference in method used -- than differences in modus operandi between the two groups. [Du Preez] And if he made that proposal on that day, the 29th, this proposal contained in the document, which people from other camps saw as a big breakthrough -- if he was not heckled, if the document was signed, where would you be today, because he wanted the document to be accepted. Would you not have accepted it? [Terreblanche] I would not have accepted such a settlement. If we were forced to the polls with a vague promise that the ANC, showing great mercy, would give us a homeland after the 27th, one that it does not want to give now, then I would definitely have distanced myself from the National Front. The people have decided and it does not help to say AWB supporters shouted him down. That was the voice of the people, and you know what Paul Kruger said.... [Du Preez, interrupting] And did the people reject Gen. Viljoen? [Terreblanche] No. They rejected the proposal. [Du Preez] But he believes so strongly in it. [Terreblanche] I don't think he believes so strongly in it. [Du Preez] There are many people in this country who believe that that was the best deal the Afrikaner could have negotiated; they feel that Eugene Terreblanche is dragging them into war, instead of accepting that deal. They ask, what right does he have to declare war on behalf of our descendants? They say, if we tested our votes, we could have had a very strong argument against the rest of the country, and against the world; we could have pointed to our support, to our regions, and to the clause in the constitution which says if there is sufficient proof of the desire of a group to have self-determination, it must be negotiated. [Terreblanche] Let's just look at what you have just said. We have been promised nothing. All they said is, you will have the right to propagate your homeland. When they said we can test our support, they meant a test of support against the 28 million or 30 million people in this country. They want the smaller number of white votes to be counted along with those of the black majority. We said we would very much like to show our support, either through a referendum or an election held among the Afrikaner people, which would be conducted by the state, so that we could prove to the state what the will of the Afrikaner Boer nation is. The ANC, on the other hand, proposed that they count the votes of the 4 million whites together with the rest, and then decide whether we may propagate our goal further. [Du Preez] Let's just stop there for a moment. Eugene Terreblanche and the AWB are now saying this is not acceptable, this is not a good proposal. You say you will make the country look like Guy Fawkes, and I quote, the Boers will burn down this land. Now you talk about a reasonably serious war. What about this: you take part in the elections, you show support for a homeland, and then a clause is added onto the constitution saying that now you may propagate your goals, and so on. The ANC and the communists then laugh at you. Is this not the moment you say, now I am in a corner? [Terreblanche] Mr. du Preez, one cannot give recognition to an illegitimate election. If you become part of an election, then you become part of the outcome of that election. I cannot become part of a monster of a system created to evaluate the small minority in its own fatherland. The only way of democracy is for the people to have true freedom. Democracy does not just mean the right of the individual. Democracy means the right of a people to live in freedom, and that members of that people should not be stopped from exercising its own human right. We have been offered just that; no recognition. We as a nation are not being recognized in spite of the suffering and grief, sacrifice and struggle, to civilize this country. You are now being counted as equal. When you've seen how many have voted for a homeland, you will feel you have the right to propagate that homeland, and to decide if we will get a homeland. [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche were you present when the Bosnian professor addressed the Afrikaner People? [Terreblanche] Yes I was. [Du Preez] Can you remember what she said about her experience in Bosnia-Hercegovina: Better a thousand days of negotiations rather than the first bullet? [Terreblanche] Yes. [Du Preez] The violence, are you not being too hasty? Do you not realize the seriousness of a war with which you are threatening? [Terreblanche] Mr. du Preez, let us leave the issue of violence, and my opinion of violence for later. I opposed that lady. I said to her it is precisely because of your negotiations, precisely as a result of the methods used by the enemy, that you now have a modern Stalin situation. The original Stalin did to Eastern Europe exactly what Nelson Mandela and De Klerk are attempting to do now, namely to combine small groups of people in a unitary state in order to create a type of a new Russian Republic, a democratic republic, which failed after 40 years, after the tears, grief, and death of millions of people. Now Joseph Stalin's recipe is being used in a unitary state, and under a communist authority. We know that almost 75 percent of the national executive committee of the ANC are communists. [Du Preez] You are saying the Boers will burn down the land. I do not want to be judgmental Mr. Terreblanche, but my impression as an Afrikaans-speaking South African is that you, your party, and other members of the National Front are romanticizing violence. And I do wonder if the difference between Eugene Terreblanche and Constand Viljoen is not that Constand Viljoen knows the meaning of a war. He placed our sons in body bags in Angola and Namibia. Are you familiar with that side of a war, and where will that war which you are planning begin? [Terreblanche] I am not here to write a resume about myself. But I want to say to you that at one stage, for a year and 14 days, I was on the borders of my country, and then again for six months. I know the bush, I volunteered, and I am the son of a militarist, and have never, when my country was in danger, taken cover behind negotiations or nice talk. And with due respect, you are deliberately trying to drive a wedge tonight between Gen. Viljoen and myself. Gen. Viljoen and I.... [Du Preez, interrupting] I want to get answers tonight for the viewers and the electorate? [Terreblanche] I do not believe that there is one single viewer or voter who for one moment thinks that I am romanticizing a bloody war. I also have walked along the pathway of the dangers of terrorism in the banks and deep gorges of Rhodesia for months and months, and today these same terrorists want to sit around the table with vague promises of a homeland. It is unbelievable, that a people believing in a living God should be granted vague promises from Satan himself and his peons, and his communists, this is what worries the people. Not the fact that I say I am prepared to defend my country with my life. [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche, we have about 30 seconds left. Tell me one thing, against whom is the war, and who gets the first bullet. The day you declare war, who gets shot first? [Terreblanche] The aggressor. I categorically state: We are standing on the verge of a revolution which will not be caused by the rightists of South Africa, but the chaos which will follow because of this government, the ANC, the elections.... [Du Preez, interrupting] Who in the elections? [Terreblanche] It does not matter, white or black, or technicolor, if he takes away the right of the Boer people to govern himself in his God-given country.... [Du Preez, interrupting] So it could be Mr. de Klerk? [Terreblanche] Sir, let us not.... [Du Preez] Could it be an Inkatha supporter, or the Alliance? [Terreblanche] No it cannot be an official of Inkatha, because Inkatha is not participating in the elections, and kwaZulu feels the same way I feel about my fatherland. [Du Preez] What about the current racial conflict underway? [Terreblanche] For heavens sake it is not about race. It is the rights of a people, and in this case, the rights of the Boers, the Zulus and the Tswanas, which has been signed away at the table of communists. [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche, our time is up. Thank you very much.
