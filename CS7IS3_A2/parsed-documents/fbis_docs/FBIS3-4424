In development, it is imperative to strengthen ideas to make Xining's comprehensive agricultural development mount a new plane. Vice Governor Ma Yanbiao attended the meeting and made a speech. He said: In comprehensive agricultural development over the past few years, we paid attention to the production of grain, edible oil, and meat, but failed to place the issue of rural areas working hard to become comparatively well-off in a sufficiently important position. In comprehensive agricultural development, it is necessary to pay attention to linking development to local plans for agricultural development. It is also necessary to stabilize results in project areas, stabilizing the output of grains, edible oil, and meat, invigorating diversified management, and augmenting the overall effects. It is necessary to regard increasing peasants' income as an important goal in comprehensive agricultural development. Only then will it be possible for Xining's comprehensive agricultural development to have vitality. Vice Governor Ma Yanbiao required farming areas to pay attention to developing herding, actively encourage the practice of feeding cattle with crop stalks, and regard the development of herding as a major affair for farming areas to get rid of poverty, become well- off, and improve effects. Attention should paid to the spread and application of science and technical know-how in project areas and increase input in science and technology. In dealing with the tasks for comprehensive agricultural development in 1994, Vice Governor Ma Yanbiao indicated that, regarding first-phase projects, it is necessary to grasp well some individual projects, and consolidation and improvement of work in general. It is necessary to continue to complete and perfect a whole range of projects in farmland construction, and work hard to fulfill the tasks of afforestation. First-phase project areas should further implement the contracted responsibility system and operational plans for planting so that the development of each piece of land will bring benefits. Second-phase projects should be conducted in light of funds, labor, and tasks, with arrangements made rationally so that people will benefit immediately from every project of comprehensive agricultural development. It is also learned from the aforesaid meeting that the central authorities will increase an annual investment of 10 million yuan in the province's second-phase comprehensive agricultural development to support Xining transforming medium- and low-yield farmland and building grasslands.
