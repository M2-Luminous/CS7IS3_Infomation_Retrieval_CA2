Ferhat: "Sent to the Tizi Ouzou Prison Last July, Benhadj Is Transferred to the Blida Military Prison"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] [Text] After spending six months at the Tizi Ouzou prison, the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] number-two, Ali Benhadj, was returned to the Blida military prison. He was sent to Blida prior to his trial in July 1992 and kept there for a while afterward, we learned from reliable sources. However, no information could be obtained as to the reasons of the transfer, which took place this week, a few days before the opening of the "National Dialogue Commission [NDC] Conference." Could there be a connection between this transfer and contacts with FIS leaders, announced and held in secrecy by the NDC? There is no indication that this is the case. But his return to the Blida military prison will enable Benhadj to join the other FIS leaders who were sentenced at the same time as he was: Kamel Guemazi, Ali Djeddi, Abdelkader Boukhamkham, Abdelkader Omar, and Nourredine Chigara. As for Abassi Madani, according to indiscretions echoed in the press, he would be placed in an Algiers suburban residence. Apart from that, we do not know if Benhadj's transfer has anything to do with his hunger strike of last December. This hunger strike, which was never officially acknowledged or denied, was announced by Rabah Kebir from Bonn, where he had taken refuge, in a press communique published by foreign press agencies. The communique indicated that Benhadj wanted to protest "various measures taken against him," in particular "his transfer to the Tizi Ouzou prison where he was kept alone in a cell and no longer allowed to have visitors." We were unable to obtain the slightest information concerning the conditions under which the FIS number-two is held in prison. Concerning visits, however, we recall that Hachemi Sahnouni stated that he had paid a visit to Mr. Benhadj last 17 October. On the other hand, his lawyers complained of some restrictions in this respect. But it would seem that these restrictions were motivated by the fact that Benhadj's defense lawyers were relaying his messages to the outside. Our readers will also remember that one of his previous lawyers, Maitre Brahim Taouti, who had done just that, was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Algiers Special Court last May. Maitre Taouti had smuggled out of the Blida military prison a document signed by Benhadj, in which the latter called for the death of civilian personalities, in particular Mr. Hafid Senhadri, a CNSA [National Committee for the Safeguarding of Algeria] founding member who was assassinated last March. In connection with that case, Benhadj was also supposed to be tried by a special court. But his trial, the date of which was never made public officially, has not taken place yet.
