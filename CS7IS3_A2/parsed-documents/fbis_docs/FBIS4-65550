[Leotard] This can be done, but the French troops would leave a quarter of an hour after that. We should know that supplying weapons would obviously mean extending the conflict. We cannot put in soldiers to act as a buffer force between the belligerents, and at the same time supply one of these belligerents with arms. It is clear that if weapons are supplied, in the quarter of an hour that follows, I would make the decision -- with the agreement of the prime minister and the president, of course -- to pull the French troops out.
