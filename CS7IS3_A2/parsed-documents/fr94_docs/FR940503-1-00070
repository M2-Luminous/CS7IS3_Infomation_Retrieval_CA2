FR940503-1-00070 FR940503-1-00012 For foreign refiners, EPA considered whether it should also require that all foreign refiners establish individual baselines before they could import either conventional or simple model reformulated gasoline into the U.S. However, as discussed later, EPA had considerable doubt about the ability of baseline-setting Methods 2 and 3 to accurately predict the quality of that portion of a foreign refiner's production sent to the U.S. in 1990. EPA believed many foreign refiners would therefore not be able to use these models, and mandating use of an individual baseline might therefore lead to a ban on importation of gasoline from those foreign refiners not able to develop such baselines. 6 In addition, EPA had serious questions whether it could adequately verify the accuracy of individual baselines for foreign refiners under such a scenario. The current Final Rule resolves these concerns by not allowing foreign refiners to establish individual baselines, and regulating the introduction of gasoline into the U.S. through the importer. Importers must establish an individual baseline in the manner described above. 6 EPA considered the option of banning foreign supplies of gasoline that were not produced under a verifiably accurate individual baseline. This option appeared to redress the issue of the loss of a ``netting out'' effect due to the presumed loss of ``cleaner'' than statutory baseline foreign gasoline. However, EPA believes that many foreign refiners do not possess adequate data to establish an individual baseline. It has been agreed that the consequence of banning foreign supplies of gasoline, both to the nation's energy security and to competitive pricing, would be unfair. The air quality impact of allowing foreign refiners a choice in what baseline to use, such as would result from the petition process proposed today, depends in large part on which foreign refiners ultimately would have the ability, and would choose, to produce reformulated gasoline for importation into the U.S., and on the individual baselines of those foreign refiners who would make this choice. If a significant number of foreign refiners sent gasoline to the U.S. in 1990 that was cleaner than the statutory baseline, those refiners would not be expected to choose to establish an individual baseline but would instead default to the statutory baseline. Refiners who sent gasoline to the U.S. in 1990 that was dirtier than the statutory baseline might well decide to petition for an individual baseline, assuming they could satisfy all of the conditions for establishing an individual baseline. In such a case, this might result in certain foreign refiners being allowed to degrade the emissions performance of their gasoline down from its actual 1990 quality to the statutory baseline. Under this approach other foreign refiners might be allowed to establish accurate and verifiable individual baselines that are dirtier than the statutory baseline, and thereby continue to produce at this quality. In comparison, the current regulatory provisions provide foreign refiners with no choice. As described above, foreign refiners whose 1990 gasoline was cleaner than the statutory baseline may degrade the quality of their gasoline down to the statutory baseline, while foreign refiners whose 1990 gasoline was dirtier than the statutory baseline are required to reformulate to meet the stricter statutory baseline. It is important to note that EPA does not have any clear evidence as to the actual average quality of gasoline imported into the U.S. in 1990. EPA does not know, for example, whether a significant amount of such gasoline was cleaner than the statutory baseline. While it would be reasonable to assume that at least some imported gasoline was cleaner and some was dirtier than the statutory baseline, EPA is not in a position to quantify this in any reliable manner. As such, it is not clear whether or how much providing foreign refiners with an option in establishing an individual baseline would actually skew the air quality impacts of these programs in a negative direction. As mentioned above, a second major issue EPA has considered involves the technical limits of Methods 1, 2 or 3 in predicting the qualities of that portion of a foreign refiner's 1990 gasoline production that was sent to the U.S. 7 Foreign refiners likely did not send the majority of their gasoline to the United States in 1990. Foreign refiners may not have exported the majority of their gasoline to the United States in 1990. Domestic refiners, on the other hand, are assumed to have distributed (and to continue to distribute) the majority of their gasoline within the U.S. In the absence of actual 1990 data, domestic refiners may calculate individual baselines using models developed by EPA that depend, in part, on the fact that the majority of the modelled gasoline is distributed in the U.S. However, foreign refiners typically did not distribute the majority of their 1990 gasoline within the U.S., rendering the models inappropriate for those refiners. 8 7 These technical limits have important implications for the first issue discussed above. For example, if EPA required that foreign refiners establish individual baselines, without providing any choice on defaulting to the statutory baseline, then many foreign refiners might not be able to develop such baselines and EPA would confront a situation involving whether or not it should ban the importation of gasoline from such foreign refiners. 8 EPA believes it is possible that in certain limited situations a foreign refiner may be able to establish a baseline of U.S.-market gasoline quality and quantity. For example, a foreign refiner potentially could establish that in 1990 its refinery produced only a limited number of gasoline blending components, and therefore could be capable of producing only a predictable and limited number of gasoline types from these blending components. In such a case, it is possible that a baseline could be established based on the ``cleanest'' of the gasoline types, without actually showing that this was the gasoline supplied to the U.S. market. Under this approach, the foreign refiner's baseline would be the most rigorous baseline possible given the refinery configuration.
