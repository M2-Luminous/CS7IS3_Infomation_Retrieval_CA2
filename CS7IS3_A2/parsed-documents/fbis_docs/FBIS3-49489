Hungarian deputies to the Slovak Parliament said they would make an interpellation with the interior minister. The inspections were made as part of a Slovakia-wide road check on Friday and Saturday [7 and 8 January], the spokeswoman said. Three buses heading for Komarno were intercepted on Saturday, she said. Two of them did not have a document confirming payment of the road tax, while the third driver had alcohol in his bloodstream, she added.
