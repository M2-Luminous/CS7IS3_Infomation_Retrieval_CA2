ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces will meet in closed session on October 11 and 12, 1994. The Commission is charged with providing an independent review of the roles and missions of the armed services to Congress, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The year-long review will identify changes that can be made to improve military effectiveness and eliminate unnecessary duplication among the services. At this meeting, the Commission will review the national security strategy and discuss long-range national security planning. Material to be presented and discussed will consist of both classified and unclassified information in a format that makes it impractical to separate the two. In accordance with section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Public Law 92&hyph;453, as amended (5 U.S.C. App II), it has been determined that this Commission on Roles and Missions meeting concerns matters listed in 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(1), and that, accordingly, this meeting will be closed to the public. Extraordinary circumstances created by coordination difficulties compel notice of this meeting to be posted in less than the 15-day requirement. Dated: September 29, 1994. L.M.
