Duka-Zolyomi, chairman of the Egyutteles deputies' group, added that the movement's cooperation with the new government had been good thus far. Hungarian minority parties had had an opportunity to participate in the coalition council's talks when the government's programme was drafted and Hungarian deputies would therefore support the programme, Harna said. Harna was reacting to information that some Hungarian deputies would allegedly not support the programme. Deputy Erno Rozsa condemned efforts to place Hungarian parties once more in the role of enemy. Harna said Hungarian parties, through no fault of their own, had found themselves in a position in which their votes would decide the future of the current Slovak Government. Rozsa noted that the current election law was adequate as it ensured calling early elections and that there was in fact nothing to change in it. The law guarantees the right of ethnic minorities' representatives to enter parliament and defend their rights.
