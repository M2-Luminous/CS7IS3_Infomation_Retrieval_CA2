Mihajlovic: "Time Is Ripe for Great Serbia"] [Text] Belgrade -- The Serbian Radical Party [SRS] takes the view that the present moment is the best opportunity for the unification of Serbian lands, Vojislav Seselj, president of the SRS, said at a news conference yesterday. "If the Bosnian Jamahiriyah can make a joint state with the Croats, who could stop the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK], the Srpska republic, and the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] from uniting among themselves," Seselj said, adding that one should exploit the West's stands and form a "single, unitary state that could be called Great Serbia. Its internal organization could be discussed later." The Radicals hold the view that the indecisiveness of the authorities regarding the unification is leading into new diplomatic mistakes, and that the least that should be done at present is to form a joint state of the Srpska republic and the RSK, "with one president, one assembly, and one government." The Radicals said that they would speed up the initiative they announced last fall on staging a vote of confidence in the federal government of Radoje Kontic, and an action on the replacement of Radoman Bozovic, chairman of the Chamber of Citizens in the Federal Assembly. In response to a question on the possibility of reshuffle of Radoje Kontic's cabinet, Seselj said that the reshuffle is in fact already completed: "Nikola Sainovic, the exceptionally successful head of the Serbian Government, has been made into the deputy federal prime minister. It remains to be seen whether he will be able to achieve there everything he had achieved as Serbian prime minister," Seselj said, ironically. The leader of the Radicals first refused to comment on the situation in the Democratic Party (the entry of two members of the Democratic Party into the government), but then immediately said that this was consistent with the SRS' predictions. The Democrats have entered the waters they indicated they would during the preelection campaign. They are wrong, however, if they think that they will benefit from it, as the socialists are crafty. The Democratic Party will be outplayed, Seselj said. The SRS news conference yesterday was also attended by a crew from Radio and Television of Serbia, after a six-month absence. "They are probably looking for something they can use in the campaign against our party," Seselj explained, denying rumors that there was new, secret friendship between the SRS and the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS].
