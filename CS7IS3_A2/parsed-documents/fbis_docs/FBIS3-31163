Teodor Melescanu said that the future of the economic cooperation in the area after the extinction of the conflict, the embargo consequences incurred by the economies of the neighboring countries, as well as the possibility of retrieving the losses were further themes of major interest discussed during the meeting. "Also, it was accepted for the first time now that a political-military equilibrium should be achieved in the area. And I believe that even the fact that the necessity was mentioned of continuing such contacts among the neighboring countries, including at a higher level, is a recognition of Romania's idea as to the contribution of the countries in the area to seeking a solution for the peaceful extinction of the conflict," Teodor Melescanu added. Referring to the latest decisions of the North Atlantic Alliance, the Romanian foreign minister said that "the only problem now is to find concrete possibilities for the withdrawal and especially of monitoring its observance. I am afraid there is the danger in this period of all kind of attempts to cause incidents, so I believe a very serious involvement of the UN forces will be vital."
