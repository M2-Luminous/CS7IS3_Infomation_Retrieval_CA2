FR940922-1-00075 FR940922-1-00009 As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, FDA is submitting a copy of this proposed rule to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspect of these information collection requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden, should direct them to FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above) and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, rm. 3208, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington, DC 20503, Attn: Desk Officer for FDA. VI. Environmental Impact The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. VII. Economic Impact FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is consistent on essential points with actions proposed by other agencies of which FDA is aware. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact of a rule on small entities. This rule will create costs in three areas: reporting, recordkeeping, and research. The reporting and recordkeeping burdens, which are fully described in section V. of this document, are the minimum necessary to achieve the goals of this proposed regulation. Research costs will amount to costs incurred by sponsors in validating data that is potentially compromised and are difficult to estimate because these situations can be expected to vary and will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. FDA will encourage sponsors to consult with agency staff on management of potentially problematic situations early on so that verifying the reliability of the data will be less burdensome. FDA has not proposed to prohibit certain financial interests, such as compensation to investigators in the form of equity in the sponsor's firm, nor is the agency proposing to require divestiture by the investigator of any financial interest, because such provisions could impact significantly on certain small entities and hinder their ability to bring innovative products to market. For these reasons, the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required. VIII. Conforming Amendments A. Amendments to Regulations for Human Drug Products While the proposed rule would not require sponsors to submit certification and disclosure statements until they submit a marketing application, FDA believes that sponsors should acquire financial information from investigators before starting clinical investigations. Consequently, FDA is proposing to amend §312.53(c), the regulation governing the selection of investigators, to require sponsors to obtain financial information from clinical investigators. The agency believes that early acquisition of financial information by sponsors would be prudent to enable sponsors to discover any possible bias by the investigator that might affect the conduct of the clinical investigation before the investigation begins. Additionally, this would permit sponsors to consult FDA regarding potential bias before the sponsor and the agency have devoted resources to the clinical investigation. The proposed amendment to §312.57 would require sponsors to maintain records on compensation agreements and all other financial interests of investigators and investigators' immediate families as described in part 54. The agency notes that such information would be required to be made available for inspection under existing regulations. The proposed amendment to §312.64 would require clinical investigators to provide sponsors with sufficient accurate information to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements. The agency is proposing to amend §§314.50 and 314.60 (21 CFR 314.50 and 314.60) to require that all new drug applications, amendments to applications, and supplements that contain new data from a previously unreported study include a certification or disclosure statement. FDA is proposing to amend §314.94 to require certification or disclosure statements in abbreviated new drug applications. While section 505(j)(2)(A) of the act does not specifically mention certification or disclosure statements, section 505(j)(2)(A)(iv) of the act authorizes the agency to require ``information to show that the new drug is bioequivalent to the listed drug.'' Thus, the proposed requirement would allow FDA to better judge the reliability of bioequivalence data, and is within the scope of section 505(j)(2)(A)(iv) of the act.
