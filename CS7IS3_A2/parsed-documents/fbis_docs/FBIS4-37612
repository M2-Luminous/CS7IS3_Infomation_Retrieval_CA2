The Likud says that the prime minister's remarks reflect a lack of wisdom and signal to the Syrians that Israel is capitulating to their threats and is willing to cede security assets. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the Likud is demanding that Mr. Rabin submit to the Knesset all the proposals that have been relayed to the Syrians recently. Tzomet says that the prime minister is sapping Israel's resistance. Moledet says that Mr. Rabin, who has to date talked about peace, is now speaking about war, which is a clear sign of his failure.
