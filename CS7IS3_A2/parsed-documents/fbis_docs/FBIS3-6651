Recalling that eight rounds of working contact have been held between the sides since the North side proposed the exchange of presidential envoys in may last year, the statement says: The North side made reasonable proposals on the rank and duty of the special envoys and procedures of their exchange and showed sincerity by holding working contacts year by year in real earnest to reach an agreement at an early date. The South side, however, refused even to accept our proposal for the exchange of special envoys without any justifiable reason from the very beginning and refused the working contact itself, delaying it for five months. Even after it came out to the contact under the pressure of public opinion at home and abroad, the South side hampered the exchange of special envoys by repeatedly creating artificial obstacles and difficulties in the way of the contact. What must not be overlooked is that the South Korean ruling quarters have repeatedly resorted to such insidious intrigues as abusing the working-level contact to impede and put the brakes on the DPRK-USA talks. The DPRK-USA talks and the inter-Korean exchange of special envoys are, by nature, different matters. It was an act of flunkeyist treachery against the nation that the South Korean ruling quarters abused the exchange of special envoys to hinder the DPRK-USA talks. We have approached the working contact with sincerity, patiently urging dialogue and negotiation and not abandoning our will for the exchange of special envoys even when the South Korean authorities broke off the working-level contact, antagonizing the fellow countrymen from an anti-national position and resorting to malicious moves to do harm to us in conspiracy with outside forces. At the sixth round of working contact, our side proposed to dispel the apprehensions of all the fellow countrymen for the exchange of special envoys by announcing in a joint communique that the sides confirmed again each other's intention to exchange special envoys and agreed on their early exchange, and thus took a broad-minded attitude with regard to its just four-point demand that all large-scale nuclear war manoeuvres against the dialogue partner be discontinued, the "international cooperation system" be abandoned, the planned introduction of Patriot missiles be rescinded and the remarks that they "cannot shake hands with a party possesed of nuclear weapons" be withdrawn. Even at that time, however, the South side blindly took exception to the North side's constructive proposal and, outside of conference hall, cried that "the exchange of special envoys is a precondition for the third round of DPRK-USA talks" and decided on a "policy of tough reaction" toward the North at "a high-level strategic meeting of officials concerned". The South side freely addressed itself to such extremely insolent acts as calling for the resumption of "Team Spirit" nuclear war exercises, promotion of the planned introduction of Patriot missiles and "international sanctions" against the North. Such abrupt provocative acts of the South Korean rulers were virtually a declaration of breaking off the working-level contact, a declaration of abandoning the exchange of special envoys and a declaration of all-out confrontation with us. By thus provoking the dialogue partner and declaring a unilateral breakoff of the North-South working contact at a time when the third round of DPRK-USA talks were five to six days away, the South Korean rulers committed an unpardonable criminal act of deliberately putting the brakes on the DPRK-USA talks. We strongly condemn the South Korean authorities for finally breaking up the working contact between the North and the South by consistently using the exchange of special envoys for their sinister political purpose, revealing their ulterior intention to part with us. The developments in South Korea today show that, loud-mouthed as it is about "civilian government," the Kim Yong-sam group is aggravating the North-South relations more maliciously than former military dictators, leading them to a phase of confrontation and war. Those who run amok with the sword between their clenched teeth, while advertising "civilian" rule, cannot be treated otherwise. Criminals are destined to face punishment. Those who cannot defend independence, the life and soul of the nation, but foment antagonism and confrontation within the nation and lead the situation to a phase of war by following outside forces, will get nothing but curses of the nation and destruction. No dictators who had turned their back on the fellow countrymen and engaged in anti-national moves in league with outside forces ever lived their days, and such sycophant traitors met a miserable end without exception. The North side delegation to the working contact will follow the development after the declaration of the chief delegate of the South side that they "would not hold talks with the North side any further".
