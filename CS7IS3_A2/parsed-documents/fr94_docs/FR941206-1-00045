FR941206-1-00045 FR941206-1-00007 The types of finishing materials include stains, basecoats, washcoats, glazes, fillers, sealers, highlights, enamels, and topcoats that all serve different functions. The number, sequence, and type of finishing materials varies by the type and quality of the furniture being finished. All of the finishing materials may contain HAP that are emitted during application. After the finishing material is applied, the wood substrate typically enters a flashoff area where the more volatile solvents evaporate and the finishing material begins to cure, and then enters an oven where curing of the finishing material and evaporation of the volatile solvents continues. The evaporation of volatile compounds that are HAP are the source of HAP emissions from the drying operation. In this preamble, the process of finishing and drying a piece of furniture or furniture component is referred to as the finishing operation. Gluing operations occur at most, but not all, wood furniture facilities. Gluing operations vary from plant to plant and include the manufacture of composite pressed wood products such as hardwood plywood, and applying laminates to wood products, veneers to solid wood (or composite wood products), edges to tables or desks, and foam to fabric. Four major types of adhesives are used in the industry: hot melts, polyvinyl acetates (PVA), urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins, and contact adhesives. Hot melts are not a source of HAP emissions. Polyvinyl acetate adhesives contain very small amounts (less than 0.3 percent) of vinyl acetate monomer (a HAP). The UF resins are used primarily in the kitchen cabinet and residential furniture segments. These resins are a source of formaldehyde (a HAP) emissions, both from the free formaldehyde in the adhesive and as a reaction byproduct during the cure. Formaldehyde emissions in furniture manufacturing occur during the use of these resins in the plant and also during storage, use, and cutting of composite pressed wood products that are used in furniture manufacturing and that contain these resins. (For reasons that are discussed later, the proposed rule does not address formaldehyde emissions associated with formaldehyde-based adhesive resins or composite wood products containing these resins.) Contact adhesives contain varying quantities of HAP as solvent. These adhesives are used for laminating countertops and office furniture and for upholstery operations such as gluing foam to fabric and fabric to wood. Contact adhesives used for upholstery operations are also known as foam adhesives. Cleaning activities are also common throughout the wood furniture industry. The resins typical of wood furniture coatings require a high-solvency-rated solvent to dissolve them into the coating mix. Similarly, dried coatings that must be removed in cleaning operations require such solvents. These industrial solvents sometimes contain HAP that evaporate when the solvent is exposed to the air and is subsequently discharged to the atmosphere via ventilation air. Equipment that must be cleaned within a wood furniture plant is typically that which comes in close contact with the coating material; e.g., application equipment and spray booths. Finished furniture that does not meet specification may need to be refinished; the cured coating is removed by washing off the old coating using solvent. This process is called washoff. III. Summary of the Standards The proposed standards are summarized below. The rationale for the regulatory decisions made in their development is provided in section VI. A. Applicability of the Standards The provisions of the proposed rule apply to new and existing wood furniture manufacturing operations that are located at plant sites that are major sources of HAP. A major source is defined in the General Provisions to part 63 as ``any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit, considering controls, in the aggregate, 10 tons/yr of any hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons/yr or more of any combination of hazardous air pollutants. *␣*␣*'' As noted in §63.800(a) of the proposed rule, the proposed wood furniture rule would apply only to facilities that are major sources as defined in 40 CFR part 63.2. An important consideration in the definition of ``major source'' is a given plant site's ``potential to emit.'' The ``potential to emit'' is defined in 40 CFR part 63.2 as follows: ```Potential to emit' means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the stationary source to emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is Federally enforceable.'' A key aspect of the potential to emit definition is that restrictions must be Federally enforceable. Examples of restrictions that would be considered Federally enforceable are listed in a definition in 40 CFR 63.2. The EPA believes that there are a substantial number of wood furniture facilities whose actual emissions of HAP are substantially less than ``major'' amounts (i.e., more than 10 tons per year of any single HAP, or more than 25 tons per year from the sum of all HAP emitted). Many of these facilities, however, would be considered ``major sources'' that are subject to the proposed rule because there is no Federally enforceable restriction in place that limits their potential to emit HAP. The EPA believes that the wood furniture rule should provide a mechanism for such facilities to accept and document such restrictions.
