FR940127-2-00115 FR940127-2-00074 Section 3(c) of Article VI of OCC's By-Laws permits a clearing member to maintain a combined market-makers' account. A combined market-makers' account is confined to the exchange transactions and positions of market-makers who have consented to the commingling of their positions with those of other market-makers. Currently, section 3(c) specifically prohibits the carrying clearing member from participating in its combined market-makers' account, and OCC's market-makers' account agreement prohibits non-customers of the carrying clearing member from participating in the carrying clearing member's combined market-makers' account. ``Non-customer'' is defined in Article I, Section N(1) of OCC's By-Laws to include the clearing member, any general or special partner of the clearing member, any officer or director of the clearing member, or any participant, as such, in any joint, group, or syndicate account with the clearing member or with any partner, officer, or director of the clearing member. This definition was drafted to encompass, in addition to the clearing member itself, only those categories of persons who are specifically excluded from the definition of customer in the Commission's hypothecation rules. 5 Because OCC's definition of non-customer is so narrowly drafted, OCC's rules currently permit a market-maker that is closely related to its carrying clearing member to commingle its positions with the positions of market-makers that are unrelated to the carrying clearing member in the carrying clearing member's combined market makers' account. 5 Commission Rules 8c&hyph;1 and 15c2&hyph;1 [17 CFR 240.8c&hyph;1 and 240.15c2&hyph;1]. Hypothecation is the pledging of securities as collateral for loans made to purchase securities or to cover short sells. Generally, the Commission's hypothecation rules prohibit hypothecating or arranging for the hypothecation of securities carried for the account of a customer under circumstances that permit: (1) the commingling without written consent of a customer's securities with the securities of any other customer; (2) the commingling of a customer's securities with the securities of any person other than a bona fide customer; or (3) the hypothecation of customers' securities for a sum in excess of the aggregate indebtedness of all such customers with respect to such securities. In light of its experience during the 1989 market break, OCC believes that the commingling of positions of associated market-makers with those of unrelated market-makers significantly increases the risks to unrelated market-makers, OCC, and the options markets. 6 Such associated market-makers may be financially dependent upon the carrying clearing member or may be under common direction with respect to trading strategies and risk management. In the event of the failure of the clearing member, the conditions which led to such failure may also lead to the insolvency of the associated market-maker. If the associated market-maker's positions are carried in a combined market-makers' account, OCC may be unable to separate the collateral supporting the positions in the combined market-makers' account from the collateral supporting the carrying clearing member's proprietary positions. As a result, OCC may have difficulty in transferring the unrelated market-makers' positions and supporting collateral even though those positions continue to be viable. OCC believes that prohibiting the commingling of the positions of associated market-makers with the positions of unrelated market-makers will facilitate OCC's ability to transfer expeditiously viable accounts of the unrelated market-makers to other clearing members in the event of a failure of the carrying clearing member. Consequently, OCC's and the unrelated market-makers' risk of loss should be decreased. 6 See supra note 17 and accompanying text.
