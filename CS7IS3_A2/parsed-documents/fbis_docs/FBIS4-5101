They also reaffirmed that continued political and social stability is a key factor in ensuring the further success of the country's economic reform. Responding to reporters' questions at a rare press conference here here yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Khamphoui Keobuoalapha said the opening of the bridge should make it easier for foreign visitors to see, better understand and appreciate Laotian society, culture and national identity. The press conference, also attended by Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat and Seun Phetsanghan, the minister for transportation, post, communications and construction, was in response to several requests by the foreign press for interviews with key government leaders in the lead-up to the official opening of the bridge tomorrow. Hundreds of foreign reporters were granted the entry to Vientiane to cover the event, which is seen as an important step in Laos' economic openness. In the past they have been allowed into the landed-locked country only during major events. Regular news cover of Laos has been restricted. Khamphoui also rejected fears the bridge will facilitate the arrival of bad influences from "outside" -- especially from Thailand. "Both Thailand and Laos have agreed to respect each other's laws and regulations, which are designed to protect national interest, sovereignty and cultural and national identity," said the deputy prime minister. Instead, he said, the maintenance and preservation of the bridge -- a symbol of friendship between Thailand, Laos and Australia -- would meaningfully contribute to the preservation and maintenance of good bilateral relations and co-operation, and thus towards peace and stability in the region as a whole. Khamphoui sidestepped many controversial questions including when the bridge will be opened to regular traffic after Friday's official inauguration, given that some problems remain. "We have survived without the bridge in the past, please don't rush," he said jokingly. Responding to the same question Phetsanghan said the purpose of the bridge was to facilitate border crossing by local people as well as for foreigners who want to visit and invest in Laos. However as far as cultural preservation was concerned, the government had a clear policy to preserve the country's culture and identity but not to an extent which blocked other cultures. Foreign Minister Somsavat yesterday said the date for opening of the bridge to regular use will be decided tomorrow, when a joint Thai-Lao committee meets. The minister said there were two issues still to be settled. Under the government-to-government agreement signed on April 2, three working committees were set up -- one to administer the bridge, the others to operate the bridge and to rule on legal problems and jurisdiction. Somsavat expressed optimism that the relaxation of immigration rules would bring-more investors to the country. Visa restrictions for foreigners have been eased to encourage investment and tourism.
