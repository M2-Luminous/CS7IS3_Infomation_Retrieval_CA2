The STAE is made up of 50 members, 50 percent of which are from the government, 25 from the United Nations, and the remaining percentage for all political parties excluding Frelimo. Jose de Castro said the unarmed opposition parties are ungrateful when they demand seats in the STAE, since during the debate on Electoral Law they said they renounced their right to fill the seats in that electoral organ in favor of the government. Jose de Castro stated that Renamo fought for those seats and, today, the unarmed opposition parties are demanding the seats we fought for until we achieved victory. They are ungrateful. He added that the unarmed opposition should recognize the efforts made by Renamo, beginning with the negotiations in Rome, through the donors' conference, and up to the multiparty conference, to defend the interests of the unarmed parties in the process of the country's democratization. He said that Renamo is surprised by the attitude of these political parties. Recognizing their political immaturity, however, we are going to grant them only three seats. Castro said that he had already foreseen a controversy over this issue. And for this reason, he presented to the government a draft list with 13 members. He said, we do not see any problem with this. We will have to sacrifice three of our members in STAE in favor of the unarmed opposition. Meanwhile, a source from the unarmed opposition parties yesterday told our reporter that he is not happy with the three seats granted by Renamo, and he thinks Renamo should grant a minimum of four seats. Confronted with this situation, Jose de Castro said Renamo has done its best and it will not do the impossible. He said, we have granted them three seats, this is all we can do. Meanwhile, the unarmed opposition seems to be a little divided, because Wehia Ripua, leader of Pademo [Mozambique Democratic Party], who was questioned on the issue, said his party is not interested in having seats in the STAE or the National Elections Commission. Ripua said that, for Pademo, the most important thing is ensuring that these electoral organs operate fully so that the unarmed opposition parties, which are the less privileged in this process, operate normally. Why should there be a controversy over this process? Pademo is against this. The unarmed opposition is expected to meet soon to map out its strategy over this issue.
