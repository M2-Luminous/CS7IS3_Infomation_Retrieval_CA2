The only factor that will give credibility to the elections "will be Mexican society, no one else," he noted. The chief of Mexican diplomacy explained that the Secretary of Government's request to the United Nations for electoral assistance and the current visit to the OAS, is an "act of sovereignty" by the Mexican Government. In brief statements before attending a Rotary Club meeting in Mexico City, Tello said the UN Electoral Assistance Mission that will offer advice to Mexican nongovernmental organizations for the observation of the elections will be here in response to a direct invitation and does not attack the principles of sovereignty. This mission will be led by Nguyen Huu Dong. The same case applies to the OAS mission, composed of Pedro Gordilho, from Brazil; Eduardo Ferrer, from Peru; Mario Gonzalez, from Colombia, and Ruben Perina, from Argentina -- with whom "I met on Tuesday," he added. That organization's experts -- invited by Arturo Nunez, director of the Federal Electoral Institute -- travelled to Mexico to learn about the 21 August elections. A reporter questioned Tello on the possibility of inviting international observers to Mexico. The diplomat replied: "My position remains the same: foreign visitors are not necessary." Why do you think they are not necessary? Because of the reforms that have been implemented and in the way the elections are structured, because of everything that has been done in the past years, specifically in the past months. Horacio Boneo, director of the UN Electoral Assistance Unit, mentioned that the main problem was credibility. Can it be guaranteed that there already is credibility? It is the society that grants credibility and no one else, no one but the Mexican society, he replied categorically. Later, the foreign secretary mentioned that the Foreign Relations Secretariat (SRE) is analyzing an OAS proposal to unite the diverse trade agreements in the Hemisphere for their possible merger with NAFTA. In the coming three weeks, the Mexican Government will make known its position on that multilateral organization's initiative, which by the way does not limit Cuba's participation, he indicated. During the Rotary Club work session, Tello explained that the market globalization policies open the doors for new projects of international association that are "unexplored and promising." This could be the possible establishment of a hemispheric free trade area. "If we want to optimize the benefits that a project of this type represents, we must guarantee that its design and application are compatible with the principles of open regionalism that would exclude unilateral actions. The dissimilarities in the levels of development must be taken into account and the effective distribution of the advantages among all the participating states must be assured," he noted. The Mexican Government has observed that the promotion of trade exchange and the opening of the markets foster growth in the national economy. "Nevertheless, we do not ignore nor do we put to one side the persistent and lagging social drawbacks. The undeniable benefits of free trade should translate into greater well-being for the broad majority," Tello assured. During the questions and answer session, a Rotary member took up the immigration matter with the United States: "What will the neighboring nation achieve with the iron curtain along the border?" Tello sarcastically said "absolutely nothing" because people avoid the curtain or they dig or drill holes in the walls constructed by the United States. "The SRE believes that both nations should find a joint solution to the immigration problem which will persist for many years and which could cause a conflict of greater scope."
