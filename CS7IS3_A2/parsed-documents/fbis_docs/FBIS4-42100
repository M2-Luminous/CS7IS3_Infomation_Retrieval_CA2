[Begin Nogueira recording] As the government has advocated for a long time -- fortunately the opposition now understands this, and we had to wait until a consensus was reached on this matter -- Portugal is not big enough nor does it have enough resources to have three intelligence services, as provided for by the legislation on intelligence services. Other European democratic countries of similar size have only two intelligence services. In fact recent events demonstrate this. For example, the lack of human resources in Madeira, in the secret services, shows that if we created three intelligence services, we will have even less people. Therefore, we will have the services on paper but not functional services. Furthermore, it is not easy to recruit qualified staff who understand the difficulties and complexities of an intelligence service, who are fully aware of the line dividing legitimate information gathering from illegitimate practices. All this naturally leads to having two, rather than three intelligence services. [end recording] [passage omitted]
