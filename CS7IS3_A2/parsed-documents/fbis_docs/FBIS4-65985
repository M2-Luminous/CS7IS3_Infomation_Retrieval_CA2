The brainchild of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, the conference will aim to frame a Stability Pact which would be signed by the end of the year for potential new candidates to the European Union (EU). French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the summit aimed to settle border and minority problems between "countries with the vocation of entering the EU," following the collapse of the Soviet bloc. [passage omitted] Juppe said the conference, sponsored by the EU as a whole and to be held at UNESCO headquarters here, would be an "exercise in preventive diplomacy" for future EU members. European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said the union, while prepared to accept new members, was unwilling to take on board "new sources of conflict." The aim was to "provide a political impetus" to handle good-neighbour problems "better and quicker," Juppe said. On the agenda will be the big Hungarian minorities in Romania (1.6 million) and Slovakia (600,000). [passage omitted] Juppe said he hoped an interim conference would be held by the end of the year, to be followed by a summit in the first since months of 1995 to sign the Stability Pact.
