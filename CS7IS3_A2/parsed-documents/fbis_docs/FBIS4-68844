The bombs had been placed in residential buildings on Leo Tolstoy and Zelenodolskaya Streets. As a result one person is dead, and six are seriously wounded. The terrorists were not apprehended right away. KOMMERSANT correspondents Sergey Topol, Dmitriy Pavlov, and Igor Fedorov visited the sites of the incidents. At 0800 on 16 April residents of the apartment house on 7 Lev Tolstoy Street (formerly the property of the USSR Council of Ministers) were awakened by a powerful explosion that went off on the second floor stair landing of entrance No. 3. The shock wave knocked out the doors of several apartments, shattered windows from the first to the fifth floor, and damaged the elevator. According to militia personnel who arrived at the incident site, the explosion tore off the arm of Valeriy Chernikov who happened to be near apartment No. 118. In addition, Maria Chetvertkova, the building's grounds keeper who was cleaning the stairs, ended up with a head bruise. Chernikov and Chetvertkova were taken to a hospital. Also injured was the apartment owner's dog--boxer Gretta's fur was singed on its back and sides. As KOMMERSANT correspondents were able to establish, the explosion took place under the following circumstances. The occupants of the apartment were Irina Ulyanova, a housewife, and Sergey Ostroukhov, director of Cafe Cherkizovo. Early in the morning they had a visitor--their friend Valeriy Chernikov. He noticed a suspicious plastic parcel next to the apartment (half a year ago, in November, an F-1 grenade was tied up to the door handle of the same apartment, but on that occasion the explosion was averted). Chernikov attempted to carry the package out to the street, but the bomb inside the package went off. Chernikov lost his left hand. On the same day the militia searched Cafe Cherkizovo, which is currently under repair. They were looking for explosive devices, but did not find any. In an interview with KOMMERSANT correspondents, militia personnel said that the package contained a homemade explosive device. According to them, so far there is no clear hypothesis as to the motive for the terrorist act (in the November incident, both the apartment owners and the militia assumed that the grenade had been tied to the apartment door out of "hooliganism"). A criminal case was opened on the subject of the explosion, which was transferred to the procuracy for investigation. At 2320 the same day a powerful (500 g of TNT) explosive device, secured to a first floor window bar, went off at building No. 2, 9 Zelenodolskaya Street. The impact of the explosion was such that it made a hole more than a meter in diameter in the building's bearing wall. In addition, partitions between rooms were destroyed, the apartment's entrance door knocked out, and windows broken from the first through sixth floors. The shock wave lifted a Moskvich car standing about 20 m from the point of the explosion and threw it onto a Zhiguli car standing nearby. The victims of the explosion were an Armenian family that had lived in this apartment for about three years. The head of the household, Eduard Kuzikyan, died on the spot; his mother, wife, brother, and four-year-old son were seriously wounded. The victims' neighbors told a KOMMERSANT correspondent that they pulled Mr. Kuzikyan from under the rubble and tried to resuscitate him, but to no avail. Militia personnel refrained from commentary, citing confidentiality of investigation. [begin box] KOMMERSANT Experts' Advice on Personal Safety The actions of a person who discovers an unidentified object depend first and foremost on whether he has reason to believe that this object may contain an explosive device. 1. If you do not have reason, but are not certain that the object is harmless, you can attempt to evacuate the object you have discovered from the zone of potential danger to others. Select for this purpose a nearby place not frequented by people. Lift the object very carefully and do not press against any part of it under any circumstances. If it is a briefcase, carryall, or suitcase, never lift it by the handle--it may be connected to a detonator. 2. If you have reason to believe that you have discovered a bomb, it is best not to touch it altogether. Homemade explosive devices (HED), which are the kind most often used by criminals, are the most dangerous of all types of explosive devices. Even professional explosives experts are advised to destroy them on the spot. 3. A person who discovers a bomb should take immediate steps to ensure the safety of others. If a bomb has been found in a building stairway, you need to warn the tenants to either leave their apartments or stay in them under the cover of bearing walls. Remember that the entrance door is poor protection against flying fragments and the shock wave. It is preferable to open the windows in the apartments and on the staircase--the shock wave (in the event of an explosion) will escape to the open space without doing too much damage. 4. If you are approaching an apartment and see a burning cord leading to a suspicious object, try to avert an explosion. In order to do this, hold the object in place (but do not put strong pressure on it, and with the other hand jerk the cord out and throw it away. Find cover immediately. Wait for at least 15 minutes, then leave the cover and do not forget to report the incident to the militia (make sure that your report is registered). [end box]
