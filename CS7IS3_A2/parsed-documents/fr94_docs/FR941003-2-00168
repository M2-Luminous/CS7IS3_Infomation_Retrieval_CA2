FR941003-2-00168 FR941003-2-00058 [Release No. 34&hyph;34721; File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;92&hyph;03] Self Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the Proposed Rule Change, and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 4 to the Proposed Rule Change, by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Amending Options Floor Procedure Advice A&hyph;2 and Rule 1066 September 26, 1994. On February 26, 1992, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend Phlx Options Floor Procedure Advice (``OFPA'') A&hyph;2 and Phlx Rule 1066. The Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on January 6, 1993, 3 Amendment No. 2 on June 19, 1993, 4 Amendment No. 3 on June 23, 1994, 5 Amendment No. 4 on September 21, 1994. 6 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 Amendment No. 1 clarifies that an Exchange specialist may accept or refuse contingency orders for placement on the Exchange order book, except that Exchange floor official approval is required to refuse to accept a customer contingency order. See Letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, Vice President, Market Surveillance, Phlx, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated January 5, 1995. 4 In Amendment No. 2, the Exchange notified the Commission of its intention to withdraw File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;92&hyph;37, because proposed changes to Phlx Rule 1066(c) contained therein, which would clarify the definitions of stop-limit and stop (stop-loss) orders and add definitions of all-or-none, opening-only-market, market-on-close, and cancel-replacement orders, would have duplicated the changes proposed by the Exchange in this File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;92&hyph;03. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32380 (May 28, 1993), 58 FR 31765 (June 4, 1993) (``Release No. 32380''). Also in Amendment No. 2, the Exchange proposed that Exchange specialists be permitted to accept spread, straddle, and combination orders, in addition to contingency orders, without the prior approval of an Exchange floor official. Amendment No. 2 added that Exchange specialists would not be permitted to refuse to accept customer contingency, spread, straddle, or combination orders without the prior approval of two Exchange floor officials. See Letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, Vice President, Market Surveillance, Phlx, to Michael Walinskas, Staff Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated June 17, 1993. 5 In Amendment No. 3, the Exchange deleted from its proposal its request that Exchange specialists be permitted to accept spread, straddle, and/or combination orders without the prior approval of an Exchange floor official. See Letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Phlx, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Options Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated June 23, 1994. 6 In Amendment No. 4, the Phlx revised the text of Option Floor Procedure Advice A&hyph;2 to reflect the requirement that Exchange specialists are not permitted to accept discretionary orders, including spread, straddle, and combination orders, regardless of whether they receive the approval of a floor official. See Letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Phlx, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Options Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated September 21, 1994. The proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 thereto were published for comment in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994. 7 No comments were received on the proposed rule changes, nor the amendments. This order approves the proposal and the floor amendments. 7 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32455 (June 24, 1994), 59 FR 33998 (July 1, 1994). The proposed rule change to existing OFPA A&hyph;2 relates to the acceptance of contingency orders by Exchange specialists (``Specialists''). The changes to part (ii), and the addition of part (iii), of OFPA A&hyph;2 would permit Specialists to accept contingency orders currently forwarded through the Automated Options Market System (also known as ``AUTOM'') without the requirement of approval by an Exchange floor official (``Floor Official''). Such contingency orders would include those currently listed and defined in paragraph (c) of Phlx Rule 1066, 8 as well as additional types of contingency orders that the Exchange is proposing to add to Rule 1066(c). In addition, the Exchange is proposing to make changes to the fine schedule of OFPA A&hyph;2. 8 Phlx Rule 1066 generally sets forth certain types of orders, including contingency orders, market orders, and limit orders. Paragraph (c) of Rule 1066 lists certain types of contingency orders, and specifically defines such orders. Currently, the contingency orders currently listed and defined under paragraph (c) are stop (stop-loss) orders, stop-limit orders, delta orders, and multi-part orders. Curently, a Specialist is prohibited under OFPA A&hyph;2 from accepting contingency orders, other than stop (stop-loss) and stop-limit orders, without the express approval of a Floor Official. 9 The proposed changes would make permissible the acceptance of contingency orders by Specialists without the approval of a Floor Official. The change would extend the acceptance of certain contingency orders without floor official approval beyond the currently permitted acceptance of stop (stop-loss) and stop-limit orders to include contingency orders as defined as such in Rule 1066(c), and will apply to both customer and broker-dealer accounts. Furthermore, a Specialist would be able to refuse to accept contingency orders, but may only refuse to accept contingency orders from customer accounts upon the prior approval of two Floor Officials. 9 In addition, a Specialist is prohibited from accepting option orders consisting of two or more option series ( i.e., spread, straddle, and/or combination orders). See Phlx OFPA A&hyph;2. The Exchange's proposed rule change does not affect this prohibition, which continues to apply to Specialists. See Amendment No. 3, supra note 5. The Exchange is proposing to clarify the existing definitions of stop (stop-loss) and stop-limit orders in Phlx Rule 1066, and to add new subparagraphs (c)(4)&hyph;(7) to Rule 1066. This new text would expand the existing list of the types of contingency orders and define each contingency order permitted. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to add all-or-none, 10 opening-only-market, 11 market-on-close, 12 and cancel-replacement orders. 13 10 The Exchange defines an all-or-none order as a market order or limit order which is to be executed in its entirety, or not at all. 11 The Exchange defines an opening-only-market order as a market order which is to be executed in whole or in part during the opening rotation of an options series, or not at all. 12 The Exchange defines a market-on-close order as a market or limit order to be executed as close as possible to the closing bell, or during the closing rotation, and should be near to or at the closing price for the particular series. 13 The Exchange defines a cancel-replacement order as a contingency order consisting of two or more parts which require the immediate cancellation of a previously received order prior to the replacement of a new order with new terms and conditions. If the previously placed order is already filled partially or in its entirety, the replacement order is automatically cancelled or reduced by such number. Finally, the Exchange is proposing to amend the fine schedule to OFPA A&hyph;2 to increase the penalties for infractions of those guidelines by Specialists.
