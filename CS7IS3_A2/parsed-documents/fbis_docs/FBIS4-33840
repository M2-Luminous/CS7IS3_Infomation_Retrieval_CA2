For this reason, we invited him to the "24 Hours" studies tonight. Mr. Zedillo, good evening and thanks for being here. [Zedillo] Good evening and thank you, Mr. Jacobo and kind listeners. [Zabludovsky] I would like to talk about your economic program. I would like you to tell us how this program, which has already been so profusely covered by the media, benefits the man on the street, the common Mexican citizen? [Zedillo] Jacobo, this program has been designed to create more jobs in our country. During my campaign tours, I have discovered that one of Mexico's most serious problems is the lack of opportunities for work. The only way to correct this situation is by making our economy grow again. There will be no additional jobs if no more businesses are created or if those that exist are not expanded. This is why my program is designed basically to stimulate investment and, through investment, growth and opportunities for work and higher salaries for all Mexicans. [Zabludovsky] You have said the positions of other candidates are probably prompted by demagoguery, particularly regarding spending more in some areas. Why? [Zedillo] Because I believe that one of the essential requirements for the country to develop in the future is to maintain a certain financial discipline to avoid the same situations of the past. Some candidates have proposed to spend more and more without paying sufficient attention to the country's financial problems. I propose to consolidate what was done in the past few years and, beginning from there, enter into a new state of the country's development where stimulus for growth receives the main emphasis. Our idea is for the government to actively promote economic growth and the creation of jobs that so many millions of Mexicans require. This should be done through rational instruments and without returning to past policies [Zabludovsky] So what would be the main differences between what you propose and what the other candidates, in particular the National Action Party and Party of the Democratic Revolution candidates, have proposed? [Zedillo] They have discussed problems and expressed good intentions but so far they have not presented any specific strategy to deal with the country's economic problem. I think the difference is very clear. I have a proposal for economic growth, the creation of jobs, investment, better salaries. This is the proposal I presented on Monday. The people are still waiting for the other candidates to present sound proposals. Certain adjectives have been used. One of the candidates speaks of a humane economy, but he failed to say how he will achieve this. The other candidate mixes very old recipes and some updated ideas, of which he has gradually become convinced. From my viewpoint, they have no proposals. Of course, it is the people who will have to assess this. [Zabludovsky] Do you think the proposals have been sufficiently understood by the would-be voters? [Zedillo] I am not sure the candidates still endorse their proposals. The problems have been pointed out at length, but there has not been much in terms of proposals. In this campaign, I have tried to present proposals, telling the people how I propose to solve problems. In this campaign, I have tried to listen to the people's problems. It is my duty to listen to those problems, but also to offer solutions. [Zabludovsky] Some aspects of your speech were discussions of the economy, training, and health. What is the relationship between these aspects? [Zedillo] Jacobo, economic growth depends on how much capital we invest. Not only physical capital, as manufacturing plants, roads, or dams, but human capital as well. Human capital is perhaps the most important factor in a country's development. How much we invest in men and women to make them more capable, educated, productive, and more willing to work and produce for the economy's sake, is what counts. [Zabludovsky] Mexican citizens sometimes think proposals exceed reality. How will your program make the family budget sufficient? [Zedillo] My program includes very specific aspects to promote investment. The program identifies the obstacles that at present prevent greater investment in our country. Through these stimuli for investment, new enterprises will be established and those already existing will be expanded. This will create more jobs. My proposal regarding education, training, and technology will increase productivity. With more jobs, greater economic activity, and greater productivity, salaries will increase. Wages and employment are two important factors that determine family well-being. This is why we are talking about shifting from a good macroeconomy, which must be consolidated, respected, and sustained, to a good microeconomy, which consists of suitable family incomes and large production output. [Zabludovsky] You included fiscal policies in your 10-point plan. We have heard medium- and large-scale businessmen complaining that there are too many taxes. We have also heard small-scale businessmen complaining that there is so much red tape they would rather pay fines than stand in long lines. [Zedillo] I believe they are right. Jacobo, we are proposing a number of tangible measures. First, we are suggesting larger judicial security for taxpayers and a substantial reduction of tax procedures, as well as tax reductions. For instance, we are planning to reduce the 2-percent tax on assets as well as a number of benefits to promote investments. According to my plan, new businesses and investors are granted a four-year grace period to pay this tax. In addition, those businesses that are reporting losses, but reported profits in at least one of the three previous years will not pay this tax. As for small- and medium-scale businesses, I am proposing to expand the number of businesses that pay this tax quarterly instead of paying it 13 times a year. This is a very good benefit, because it saves tax-filing time and gives liquidity to those businesses that are currently making monthly payments. Should this proposal be approved, they will pay the 2-percent tax on assets quarterly. Furthermore, we are also recommending a mechanism to directly promote investments through a more generous investment amortization system and a number of fiscal incentives for training, technology, and purchasing antipollutant equipment. These are some of the many measures we are proposing to directly benefit businesses to ensure they will be motivated to invest more. [Zabludovsky] Mr. Zedillo, in the last five years we went from an almost 200-percent inflation rate to a 8- or 9-percent inflation rate; I am not sure. This policy had a social cost. I am wondering if you are planning to have single-digit inflation rates. Is it worth it? [Zedillo] It is worth it and necessary if we want to achieve sustainable economic growth in the future. The effort that had to be made was already made; we now must consolidate this effort. This effort is letting us reach a growing economic stage, which we could not reach in the last few years, because we failed to see the country's reality for many years. Thanks to this effort, which consisted not only of controlling inflation but also of changing the economic structure of the country with a broader opening and other measures, we currently have the opportunity to begin growing. I am suggesting that the economy must grow at least 4 percent by 1995, following two years of virtual stagnation in 1993 and 1994. [Zabludovsky] Let us talk about other issues. Since we have you here, let us seize this opportunity to ask you other questions. How do you feel about your campaign? What experience have you gained since you were nominated presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party? [Zedillo] Thanks to my being in constant contact with the people, I have found two basic concerns: people are concerned because they want to improve their personal and family situation and because they want to put and end to unemployment, insecurity, and poverty. In short, people are concerned because they want to live in better conditions and in a better country. On the other hand, I can see there is hope. People believe we are about to overcome our problems, the country is capable of solving them, and the difficult times we are currently living are temporary. We are close to reach a different and better stage for all Mexicans to begin thriving. [Zabludovsky] In light of certain criticisms, do you believe the upcoming elections will be honest, fair, and free of doubts? [Zedillo] Jacobo, all political parties have been working hard to improve our electoral system. The latest reform concluded last week, and we currently have an electoral system that has nothing to do with the electoral system of six years ago, or even three years ago. We now have an electoral organization whose board of directors is made up mostly of independent citizens. We have a large number of citizens at all electoral bodies. Almost 2 million Mexicans will participate in the organization of the upcoming elections. Only a small number of them will represent my party; the rest will be representatives of other parties and citizens selected through a double-election process. I believe we have an exemplary electoral system that citizens must trust. I am sure the upcoming elections will be exemplarily legal, honest, and reliable. The country deserves and demands it, and this is the way it should be. [passage omitted]
