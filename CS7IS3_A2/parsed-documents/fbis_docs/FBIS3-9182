Kanis gave an interview to NEPSZABADSAG's Bratislava correspondent on his views on the talks. [Farkas] Why is Budapest your first destination in your capacity as minister? [Kanis] When I began my office, I decided that I would first visit the Visegrad countries, and Hungary first, if for no other reason than that Visegrad is here. [Farkas] According to the preliminary statement on your visit issued on 18 March, you will discuss the Partnership for Peace, among other things. How should we understand this? [Kanis] This is a very important element of my talks with all of our neighbors. I would like to learn about their views on the NATO Partnership for Peace program and the way they interpret the possibilities of cooperation within this. Naturally, I will also inform my colleagues--Defense Minister Fur first--of our ideas. In my view, the Partnership for Peace itself provides a serious opportunity for the Central European countries to get closer to the West European security systems. However, a more stable inner security in our region--namely, in Central Europe--can significantly contribute to this. It is definitely worth exchanging our views on this issue. [Farkas] Cooperation between the Hungarian and Slovak armies has been fairly good. It can certainly be assessed as better than our interstate relations. [Kanis] I am convinced that our states need reliable and predictable relations, including the notion of security, and this in turn affects relations between the two Armies. Naturally, in today's Europe, the armed forces and the issues of security policy are strongly related and are organically connected to the solution of our region's concrete problems or to establishing the conditions for the solutions. [Farkas] In addition to being a minister, your negotiating partner is chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the leading Hungarian Government party, while you are the first deputy chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left. Can this obvious contrast cause any difficulties in the military cooperation that you describe as good? [Kanis] In my view, this kind of meeting has primarily to be determined by professional issues and the discussion of security policy. I would add that the quality of our relations should not be influenced by what kind of government our countries have at a given moment. This can also be applied to the political affiliation of the given defense ministers. In this case, we cannot think of anything but the fact that we have to do everything we can to improve bilateral relations, and this task is irrespective of party affiliations. It is known that a broad coalition consisting of a number of parties is now in government in Slovakia, and we clarify and decide very many issues through debates. As for our foreign relations, in my view it is favorable that the parties in our government maintain good relations with the political forces close to them in several neighboring countries.
