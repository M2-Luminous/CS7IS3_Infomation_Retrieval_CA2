The Lebanese source said that Iran offered to provide a number of establishments having commercial dealings with it with official cover when necessary for employing the elements in their departments, for example, by providing official notification confirming they are representatives of known Iranian establishments. The Lebanese source noted that what he terms Iranian trade infiltration in Lebanon comes in the wake of increasing reports about the possibility that Hizballah will dissolve its military wing in the event that the Israeli forces withdraw from southern Lebanon within the framework of a comprehensive peace process in the region, and the possibility of withdrawing "Revolutionary Guard" elements from al-Biqa'. It is worth mentioning that a leading Lebanese Hizballah source announced in Beirut yesterday that the party has drawn up a plan to confront what the source termed "consequences of peace" with Israel if it is achieved. The source said that even if its military is dissolved, Hizballah will retain its social and security organs and will fight any attempt to "normalize" relations with Israel. A Lebanese ministerial source stresses that the Israeli forces' withdrawal from southern Lebanon would not be the end of Hizballah's role on the Lebanese scene, but, rather, the beginning of a new political role whose foundation is the mobilization of popular opposition against attempts to normalize unofficial relations with Israel. The source adds that Hizballah would lead the tendency calling for turning the Lebanese-Israeli peace -- if established -- into a cold peace along the lines of the Egyptian-Israeli peace.
