[Al-Zahhar] Certain yardsticks and principles govern Hamas' dealing with the PNA. The first point is that we welcome the return of every Palestinian who has lived in the diaspora. This does not mean we approve of the autonomy or that we agree to participate in it. The second point is that we are against internecine fighting and against shedding Palestinian blood at the hands of Palestinians, no matter the causes or motives. The third point is that we do not participate in the PNA. However, as sons of this homeland, we will participate in all elections that will serve the people, whether municipal, rural council, chambers of commerce, or trade union and student elections. The fourth point is that we support the freedom of action of any person who works to serve this homeland. We believe every Palestinian, after the protracted period of occupation, has the right to have his own means of dealing with the public through the establishment of party and media institutions. Every person has the right to demonstrate and to express his opinion. ['Amarah] Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, some problems emerged between Hamas and the Palestinian police at the beginning. Are there still any problems? What is Hamas' real position on the issue of security in the autonomy areas? [Al-Zahhar] We regret to say that the stand of the police was unjustified. While the police force had not yet completed its organization, the agents did their best to fabricate sedition to kill Fatah and Hamas leaders and to set the occupied territories on fire. They made confessions to this effect. While the Palestinian force had not completed its organization, it was necessary to end this sedition and put out this fire. The Palestinian police made several statements that were unacceptable to the ordinary Palestinian, and to Hamas. Matters remained as they are. We hope that in the not too distant future, these differences will be settled and that a balanced formula can be forged for dealings between the PNA and all the forces which have a presence in the occupied territories, particularly the opposition forces. ['Amarah] Where does the movement stand on the residual Israeli military presence in the Gaza strip? [Al-Zahhar] As far as we are concerned, it is not a residual presence. Occupation is present. What happened was a redeployment of occupation forces. Israel left some sections of Gaza for other sections of Gaza. If anything, Israel has stepped up its presence. It is in control of crossings and the main roads that link the Gaza strip and its villages. It is in control of livelihoods and everything. So, for us it is rationed occupation and it is unacceptable. Palestinians are entitled to defend themselves against occupation, from which they have suffered a great deal. ['Amarah] Will Hamas [word indistinct] continue the armed struggle against occupation in the occupied territory of the West Bank? [Al-Zahhar] That is what Hamas said in its latest leaflet, emphasizing its continuing jihad line. The leaflet that was issued on 15 June emphasized Hamas' and other Palestinian factions' right to defend themselves against the Israeli presence in the occupied land, whether that takes the form of soldiers or settlers. ['Amarah] Preparation has begun for [words indistinct] Palestinian elections. Are you prepared to run in these elections alongside the Palestinian Authority? [Al-Zahhar] The Islamic side, Hamas in particular, will not contest the self-rule elections. As for elections that are unconnected with the self-rule authority, as I have said, these will be contested, as has been our practice during occupation. ['Amarah] Israel recently levelled accusations that Hamas has been receiving aid [word indistinct] from Saudi Arabia and Iran, [word indistinct] the chances for a peace settlement. [Al-Zahhar] There is nothing wrong with Hamas or the other factions receiving assistance from brother Arabs or Muslims. However, Hamas has not received a single piaster from the Saudi government. An ordinary Muslim, whether in Saudi Arabia or anywhere else, contributes zakat [alms tax], which comes to 2.5 percent [of a Muslim's income] annually, and this is given to known categories in Islam -- the poor, those who handle the zakat and for those engaged in the zakat raising effort and the effort to get slaves freed and for needy strangers. As you know, the Palestinian people are going through exceptional circumstances -- poverty, [word indistinct], displacement, and deportation, and consequently, they qualify for zakat. A Saudi, Gulf, or Egyptian Muslim or any other Muslim, even in Europe and America, collects zakat so the money can be spent on Palestinians who fill the conditions of zakat. But, thus far, Hamas has not received a single piaster from the Saudi government. ['Amarah] One last question. The Palestinian opposition wants to form a broad national front to abort the settlement between Israel and the PLO. Has Hamas and the other Palestinian factions worked out an agreement? Are you truly prepared to enter into effective participation in such a front? [Al-Zahhar] [Words indistinct] the 10 factions outside [words indistinct]. I personally support the call to form a broad national Islamic front to tackle the inadequacies of self-rule, especially those with a negative impact on the national cause and Islamic sanctities and on the (?homeland) in general, provided that the formula is well-defined and not (?inconsistent) with our national cause or our religious creed and (?helps) the Palestinian street for the sake of the interests of the Palestinian people [words indistinct] and government in line with the rules I already pointed out.
