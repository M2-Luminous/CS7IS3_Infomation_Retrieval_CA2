FR940412-2-00032 FR940412-2-00019 Comments: Comments received on this proposal noted the time period allowed to identify these shipments (during the appeal cycle of the semiannual evaluation) was one of the busiest times for carriers. It was suggested carriers by allowed to identify these shipments any time up until the next semiannual performance evaluation and possibly up to 12 months longer. It was also suggested the score should apply to the most recent semiannual score. The DOD believes few shipments will fall into this category, as carriers have the option of requesting a score 120 days after delivery. The carrier must have an opportunity to appeal. Consideration was given to allowing only the 100 scores apply to the present cycle as it is unlikely those scores will have an appeal. However, there may be circumstances where it may benefit the carrier for the newly scored shipment to go into the next performance cycle. In the interest of fairness to all, each shipment will retain the right to appeal, and the score applied to the next performance cycle. D. A PPSO has up to 12 months from pickup to score shipments. However, a carrier may request a shipment score 120 days after delivery when proof of delivery is provided. A completed DD Form 1840/1840R will be the only acceptable proof of delivery. Origin PPSOs will not be limited to using only origin data for scoring, but must ensure they have received feedback from destination. (Reference TQAP, pages 20&hyph;21, paragraphs C.3.c. through f.) Comment: Those submitting negative comments on this issue suggested there was not need for the origin PPSO to contact the destination PPSO. The DOD believes it is necessary for PPSOs to communicate shipment information prior to scoring to ensure each carrier is given the score it earned. E. Unless a shipment is still in SIT, shipments may be scored under 12 months of the pickup date (see note (3) below) if all of the following criteria exists: (1) A completed DD Form 1780 (may be electronic data) or destination feedback from the destination PPSO. (2) The DD Form 1840 is present and signed by the member and the carrier representative. (3) Shipments that have been converted to nontemporary storage (NTS) or commercial storage will not require a DD Form 1840 for scoring. The destination PPSO should annotate the DD Form 1780 at the time the shipment is converted and return the form to origin. (Reference TQAP, page 24, paragraph C.5.b.) Comments: Comments against the proposal stated if shipments have not been scored within a year, the origin PPSO should not contact the destination PPSO to get the status of the shipment and the carrier should receive a score of 100. The DOD is making every attempt to ensure shipments are properly scored. By making it necessary for the origin and destination PPSOs to communicate there is less chance for an error when scoring a shipment. The DOD has no intention of giving scores of 100 that may not have been earned. This would not be fair to those carriers who do earn them. F. Carriers will not be required to respond to letters of warning, unless the PPSO specifically requests a written response. However, if the violations continue the carrier is subject to suspension. (Reference TQAP, pages 6&hyph;7, paragraph B.3.) Comments: Comments indicated the PPSOs should ensure carriers are sending the letters of warning by certified mail. TQAP already requires DD Forms 1814, Letters of Warning, be sent certified mail, return receipt requested.
