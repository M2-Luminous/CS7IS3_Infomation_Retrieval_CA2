We are ready to receive your orders, Khamene'i," and other slogans] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. On this great and auspicious day I sincerely congratulate all freedom-loving and justice-seeking people of the world, and particularly the great Iranian nation, the brave youth of this land, and the offspring of the Koran; that is, the dear guards of the revolution and you, dear participants. [passage omitted] Today Islam is flourishing in the world. Today Islam is attracting nations to itself as the most brilliant and clear source of hope. Is this a joke, after the passage of 1,400 years? It is due to the blessings of the uprising of Husayn Bin-'Ali. It is Almighty God's wish that, for the first time since the era of Husayn Bin-'Ali, the Koran should rule in the Islamic Republic. Everything that has been done since Imam Husayn's uprising has been an introduction to today for you. All those scholars, thinkers, philosophers, and speakers; all those efforts and all the Crusader wars -- throughout it all, Islam was protected and conditions were prepared for today, so that a government be created that is based on divine and Koranic values. You, the Iranian nation, were fortunate to have the opportunity to be trusted, for the first time, with that responsibility. [passage omitted] This is not something that will end. Do not think that the Islamic Republic is going to be destroyed by the utterances of a few simple-minded wishful thinkers who say it is going to end today or tomorrow. No, sir. These foundations are not going be annihilated. [Crowd chants: "God is great;" "Khamene'i is the leader;" "Death to America;" "Death to Israel," and other slogans] You and I will of course come to an end. Individuals do not go on for ever. The best are those who guard themselves until death. And some even fail to do that. There are all types. Individuals are vulnerable to damage and destruction. However, the basics continue. This Islamic revolution, this Islamic revival has its roots in history, in 10 centuries of effort and struggle. It relies on Islam, and for this very reason today -- at a time when, more than ever, Zionist and arrogant propaganda has tried to portray an ugly image of the Islamic Republic, Iran, Iranian people, us, and everyone -- popular attraction toward Islam, in all parts of the Islamic world, is growing at a greater rate than five or 10 years ago. Look at Islamic countries. Look at Muslim minorities in non-Islamic countries. Look at the harsh measures taken by the arrogant powers against Muslims. There is a reason for such severity. If the Muslims were like a body at the hands of the mortician, there would be no severity. I wish to state that the element of loneliness in the contemporary movement has created a degree of similarity between us and the movement of Husayn Bin-'Ali. Do not fear the loneliness. Do not be scared, for Husayn Bin-'Ali and his companions -- for whom we mourn and weep, and whom we love more than our own children -- reached the heights of loneliness. The result was that Islam is alive today. The events of Karbala' [where Husayn died in battle] were not limited to a small region but concern a large part of contemporary humanity. Karbala' is now everywhere. Look at literature, culture, traditions, and beliefs, and at people's hearts. Even the man who does not bow down to God respects the greatness of Husayn Bin-'Ali. That was the result of loneliness. He was the height of loneliness. And today you are lonely and today the Iranian nation is lonely and wronged. But its loneliness and meekness does not mean weakness. We are very powerful today. No other Muslim nation -- and dare to believe this -- is as powerful as the Muslim nation of Iran. No other nation, be it small, large, or with a population of 100 million. Iran is alone in the world today. The power of the people of Iran today is at its zenith; the same applies to the Iranian Government. The government is very powerful, very dear; those in positions of power in the world pay attention to the Government of Iran. The people and the government are strong and capable; they know what they are doing. At the same time, they are lonely and oppressed. We are alone in the world today. No power in the world supports us today. This does not mean that all the powers in the world are lined up against us; no, do not let our enemies get happy, thinking: Thank God, all the powers are against Iran. Even if this was the case, it would not matter. We have experienced such a situation. No, today all the governments and powers of the world are not lined up against us. There are many governments who feel that, considering the material criteria that they have, it is not in their interest to line themselves up against the Iranian people. But no one helps or supports our people. The most powerful, arrogant powers of the world confront our people, are enemies of our people. They oppress the Iranian people, they do not take their rights into account, they make accusations against our people. They do not consider our people's good points, and they make a mountain out of a molehill of our bad points. This is the oppression and loneliness of the Iranian people. This oppression and loneliness should make you stronger. I say that this is a blessing from God. Some corruption exists, but the structure of society is healthy. If we were like one of those so-called revolutionary countries of the previous era -- today they do not exist...[pauses] There used to be certain countries and governments that were so-called revolutionary, they were supported by one of the bullying powers of that era, the Soviet Union, which supported them. If we were like them, our people and government would have been corrupted. You see today that the people and government have, thank God, remained healthy. This does not mean that there is no corruption among the people or officials; there is to a certain extent, but the structure is healthy, the composition is healthy, the main elementsare healthy; members of the society who occupy sensitive positions are healthy. This is a great blessing. This blessing comes from being alone, from relying on no one but God. There are two trends. One is the trend of Islam, the Koran, divine values, and spirituality, with the Islamic Republic at its zenith. Officials of this system are standing up under this enormous pressure, strongly and without fear or hesitation. They are happy and do not bow down. This is one trend. The other trend consists of all the satans of the world, all the evil ones of the world. All the mischievous ones of the world belong to the other trend. There exists a division here. If anyone has any energy, where should he expend that energy? If anyone has anything to say, if anyone can take the initiative, where should he be? If someone inside this faction of righteousness, or outside this faction of righteousness, starts to wage a war on this faction -- which is fighting mischief and evil to such an extent -- based on the premise that this faction of righteousness has not paid attention to a particular point, or committed a small mistake, error, or even sin, can this be right? Is this not weakening divine power in the line of blaspheming against the blessings of God? Those who have nothing to say apart from utterances that weaken the front of righteousness, weaken the officials, weaken the government, the president, the judiciary, the Majles, using any excuse ... [pauses] For example, they say: The judiciary issued the wrong sentence in such and such a case; such and such a judge said this; such and such a government official acted in such and such a way. Rather than expending their energy to confront the faction of evil, they use these excuses and use the same energy to fight against the faction of righteousness. Are they not blaspheming against the blessings of God? Don't they deserve divine punishment?
