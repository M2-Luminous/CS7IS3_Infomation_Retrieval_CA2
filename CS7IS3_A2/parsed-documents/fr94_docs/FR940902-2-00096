FR940902-2-00096 FR940902-2-00047 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,720] Sola Optical, USA, Inc., Muskogee, OK; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On July 19, 1994, the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on June 27, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36792). The petitioners claim that they were affected by a shift in production to Mexico and consequently, increased imports. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, DC, this 22nd day of August 1994. James D. Van Erden, Administrator, Office of Work-Based Learning.
