As the final adjustments before the sale were only approved by the government last week, the PND Executive Committee only managed to establish the method and the minimum price for the state-run company during yesterday's meeting. The auction had initially been scheduled for 24 March. The PND Executive Committee thus hopes to have enough time to release the privatization's resolution. The auction will be held at the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa), where 60 percent of Embraer's capital will be auctioned for about $200 million. The privatization will be completed if 85 percent of the stock offered, involving 51 percent of the company's capital, is sold. The Federal Government (Aeronautics Ministry) will retain 20 percent of the stock, employees will be entitled to 10 percent, and the rest will be sold to the public. The recommendation of the PND Executive Committee, which must be approved by President Itamar Franco, does not require payment in currency and does not exclude the participation of foreign capital. The PND Executive Committee's proposal contemplates for the first time in the privatization program the pre-selection of bidders by the Aeronautics Ministry, which will also be entitled to golden shares [preceding two words in English] (special stock) that carry the right to veto issues described as strategic -- like corporate changes, changes in and the drawing up of military programs, and transfers in the control of majority stock. PND Executive Committee Chairman Andre Franco Montoro Filho said these rules have been established because Embraer is a strategic aviation company. Montoro Filho reported that the value of the company is estimated at $510.3 million, plus $215 million in debts that must be accepted by the future majority stock holders. Thus, the state-run company's minimum price has dropped to $295.3 million. Montoro Filho added that the capital will be increased by $30 million, but the federal government will not underwrite the stock. Buyers will also have to commit themselves to purchase this stock because the auction will take place during the stock subscription period.
