Why did you not fight al-Bashir's coup? [Sa'id] I will go back a little to talk about the memorandum handed to al-Sadiq al-Mahdi's government. In this memorandum we spoke about the neglect suffered by the Armed Forces. We asked the government to pay attention to our Armed Forces, and to achieve that we demanded that all parties participate in government and that a solution to the problem of the south should be found. The memorandum was signed by all officers of the Armed Forces command. And everyone pledged not to embark on any coup attempt. Because we believed that some officers might seize the opportunity to seize power. At the same time the National Islamic Front [led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi] began to criticize the Army's command on the pretext that the Armed Forces command was working to remove the Front from government -- which was untrue, because we did not speak about one party in particular. Actually we broached Sudan's problem and the civil war in the south. Even though some officers spoke openly about the need to seize power, our position as a command was the need to safeguard democracy and protect the democratic experiment. [passage omitted] [Jibril] As the Legitimate Command, what are your means to restore legitimacy? [Sa'id] In September 1990 we issued the political declaration, through which we addressed every member of the Armed Forces. We told them that what had happened was a trick aimed at the Armed Forces. So now that matters have become clear, the Army elements must work with us to get rid of this situation so that the Armed Forces' dignity can be restored. The statement encountered a great response inside the Armed Forces. We pointed out in the statement that we as the Legitimate Command favor changing the regime from within the Armed Forces, not from abroad or with foreign assistance. And indeed a large number of officers and noncommissioned officers responded to us. We were about to finish the regime off, but some mistakes caused the plan to be foiled and aborted. So the first option remains to change the regime through the Armed Forces. As for the second option, it is to work with the Democratic National Grouping to restore democracy. This is why we spoke to the officers inside the Armed Forces or those officers who have been dismissed about the need to remove the regime through mass action and military action. We did not say which should happen first. [Jibril] Do you take into account the possibility of the popular defense militias' aborting any move designed to change the regime? [Sa'id] True, it will not be easy to change it, and the Popular Defense Forces must be taken into account. But you should also know that the forces trained by the regime are not all loyal to the National Islamic Front. Independent elements have also joined the Popular Defense Forces. We have all the details relating to the popular defense forces, whether with regard to their camps or armament. And when the change process begins, we will work to neutralize these forces. But we must expect losses and casualties, because we are aware of the regime's viciousness. We will confront them with the same viciousness. [passage omitted] [Jibril] There is talk about the existence of camps inside Sudan to train fundamentalist groups from various parts of the Arab and Islamic worlds. What is your information in this connection? [Sa'id] We have comprehensive information about this issue. We warned about the existence of such camps a long time ago. We submitted maps showing the places where these extremist groups receive their training. We have our sources inside the country and inside the Armed Forces. They supply us with this information. We have handed this information to the quarters concerned. But some of these quarters have concealed this information. When the regime discovered the accuracy of our information, it moved the camps to other places. [passage omitted]
