FR940825-1-00130 FR940825-1-00009 Dated: August 18, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator. Addendum A to Preamble_General Description of Clean Air Act Programs The Clean Air Act is codified in the United States Code (U.S.C.) at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. There are six different Titles that comprise the Act as codified. 1 The following discussion contains a broad overview of each Title with the objective of providing a general road map to the Clean Air Act. The discussion is not, and is not intended to be, a comprehensive and detailed discussion of Clean Air Act requirements. 1 The Clean Air Act is Chapter 85, Title 42 of the U.S. Code. The Titles of the Act are actually subchapters of the Code. To avoid confusion, these subchapters will be referred to herein as Titles of the Act. To help illustrate the potential effect of today's proposal, the discussion at times refers to Tribes as if the authority proposed today was in effect. However, this authority will not be in place until EPA takes final action on today's proposed rule. The process preceding final action includes the consideration of public comments on today's proposal that may alter the final rule. Title I_National Ambient Air Quality Standards and Stationary Source Requirements. EPA has established national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for certain air pollutants for the protection of the public health (``primary'' standards) and welfare (``secondary'' standards). CAA section 109, 42 U.S.C. 7409. EPA establishes these standards after a thorough review of the latest scientific studies and literature indicating the kind and extent of identifiable effects on public health or welfare which may be expected from the presence of such pollutants in the ambient air in varying quantities. CAA section 108, 42 U.S.C. 7408. EPA has established health and welfare NAAQS for six different pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and lead. These standards are codified in 40 CFR Part 50. Areas nationwide are ``designated'' based on whether they meet the NAAQS. Areas that do not meet the NAAQS are designated ``nonattainment.'' CAA section 107, 42 U.S.C. 7407. States containing such areas are required to develop State implementation plans (SIPs) which must bring the areas into attainment as expeditiously as practicable. If EPA finalizes today's rule as proposed, Tribes may submit such implementation plans (``TIPs''). Title I contains general requirements that SIPs and, as appropriate, TIPs must meet (CAA section 110(a)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)) as well as planning provisions ( e.g. , inventorying of emissions) and control requirements applicable to existing stationary sources in nonattainment areas. CAA sections 171&hyph;192, 42 U.S.C. 7501&hyph;7514a. EPA has issued detailed guidance that sets out its preliminary views on the implementation of the air quality planning requirements applicable to areas that are not in attainment with the NAAQS. This guidance is titled the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990'' (or ``General Preamble''). See 57 FR 13,498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18,070 (April 28, 1992). The General Preamble has been supplemented with further guidance on Title I requirements. See 57 FR 31,477 (July 16, 1992) (announcing the availability of draft guidance for lead nonattainment areas and serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas); 57 FR 55,621 (Nov. 25, 1992) (guidance on NO x RACT requirements in ozone nonattainment areas). EPA will likely issue further supplements to the General Preamble. Title I also contains control requirements applicable to new (or modified) major stationary sources. ``Major'' sources are those emitting more than a certain amount of pollutant per year. Sources subject to the New Source Review (``NSR'') or Prevention of Significant Deterioration (``PSD'') requirements may not initiate construction, as it is defined under the law, without obtaining an NSR or PSD permit from the State or Tribe (or from EPA, if the State or Tribe has not been authorized by EPA to administer the program). The nonattainment NSR permit program applies only in nonattainment areas. The Act directs EPA to require States and authorizes EPA to permit Tribes to develop NSR permit programs as part of their SIPs or TIPs. The NSR permit program requires strict control technology and emissions reductions from nearby sources to ``offset'' emissions released for proposed new (or modified) major stationary sources in nonattainment areas. E.g. , CAA section 173, 42 U.S.C. 7503. The PSD program applies to certain new or modified major stationary sources in areas that currently have air quality meeting the NAAQS. To prevent the air quality in these areas from significantly deteriorating, the Clean Air Act requires States in such clean air areas to develop permit programs that impose control requirements on new or modified major stationary sources. The permit program must also require an assessment of the air quality impacts of proposed sources to ensure that new sources will not cause or contribute to an exceedance of the NAAQS or certain allowed ``increments'' of air quality degradation. CAA sections 160&hyph;169, 42 U.S.C. 7470&hyph;7479. Since all areas of the country meet at least one of the NAAQS, all States are required to have a PSD program for areas within their jurisdiction. EPA administers PSD programs for States that have failed to submit approvable programs. In today's action, EPA is proposing to authorize Tribes to submit PSD programs for EPA approval.
