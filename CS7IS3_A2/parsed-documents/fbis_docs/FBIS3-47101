The telegram reads as follows: Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, FUNCINPEC president, Phnom Penh Respected Samdech Krompreah: I would like to acknowledge receipt, with deep and sincere thanks, of Samdech Krompreah's letter of 1 January 1994. May I be permitted to make the following clarifications? I. The points we agreed upon at our meeting on 17 December 1993 discussed the basis (?that) the cause to be pursued must be the five-point guideline set forth by His Majesty [H.M.] the King. As Samdech Krompreah is fully aware, this five-point guideline clearly stipulates the following: 1. An immediate and complete cease-fire over the whole territory of Cambodia; 2. An immediate and unconditional transfer of the Preah Vihear temple, Pailin, and other Democratic Kampuchea-controlled zones to the state and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia; 3. The dissolution of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] and its partial inclusion into the Royal Army of Cambodia; 4. The government shall in return give the post of co-ministers, co-vice ministers, co-secretaries of state, and advisers to acceptable personalities of the DKP. H.M. the King would appoint a Democratic Kampuchea high-ranking personality as his senior personal adviser; 5. The DKP and the government must hold talks to settle all the issues. The points of the five-point guideline cannot be separated one from the other. These five points form a single body to be simultaneously dealt with altogether. H.M. the King has pointed out that the DKP alone cannot make any progress. The government, for its part, must do something through talks. The essence is clear, that is, the first three points are what the DKP must give to the other side, and the last two points are what the government must give to the DKP in return. Altogether these five points make national reconciliation possible. On the contrary, if one side insists on the other three points, then the other two points cannot be fulfilled. By the same token, if the DKP demands only the two points for itself, then the three points cannot be fulfilled either. In so doing, the five-point guideline cannot be [as heard] materialized. II. As Samdech Krompreah has been fully aware all along, the Vietnamese communists and the Phnom Penh party have for a long time insisted on their points, namely: 1. An unconditional cease-fire by the national resistance forces; 2. The handing over of Democratic Kampuchea-controlled zones to the Vietnamese-controlled Phnom Penh party; 3. The dissolution of the NADK, which is an important component of the national resistance forces. Samdech Krompreah may also be well aware of the the fact that our Cambodian nation and people, like the DKP, have not accepted, nor can they accept, these conditions set by the Vietnamese communists and the Phnom Penh party. Our tripartite national resistance forces have also unequivocally rejected them, for they are like a guillotine beheading the national resistance forces enabling the Vietnamese communists and the Phnom Penh party to perpetuate their occupation of Cambodia. This would amount to blotting out our Cambodian nation and people. The three points of the Vietnamese communists and the Phnom Penh party are the opposite of the five-point guideline of H.M. the King. The former are a scheme aimed at continuing the war in Cambodia, while the five points would lead to national reconciliation. The five-point guideline aims at true national reconciliation without excluding any national force. The DKP would (?thus) be included so that there would be sufficient national forces within the army and the government in order to make them truly national forces. And all the national forces would work together to tackle the present situation, which is worsening day by day, so that peace, independence, national unity, and territorial integrity could be restored. I sincerely believe that Samdech Krompreah personally wishes to support the five-point guideline of H.M. the King as well. However, the Vietnamese communists and the Phnom Penh party have been resorting to all sorts of maneuvers and pressures to ensure that only the three points are singled out, the aim of which is to dismantle the DKP according to their dark and dirty scheme. They categorically oppose Cambodian national reconciliation since the strategy of the Vietnamese communists and their lackeys is to swallow up Cambodia through a military war and a war conducted by sending massive Vietnamese nationals into the country and to the state power they installed in 1979, which is now running Cambodia. Thus, as far as the technical group is concerned, and as Samdech Kromopreah is fully aware, we had reached an agreement according to which that group should have no name at all. I would like to recall that at that time I proposed that the technical group be formed by the representatives of the DKP and FUNCINPEC. However, in case the representatives of the Cambodian People's Party are also included, then those of the [words indistinct] democratic parties should be brought in as well. The content of Samdech Krompreah's communication of 1 January 1994 has departed from this point of agreement we reached on 17 December last and did not give an answer to my letter of 28 December which I addressed to you. I would like to propose that we should proceed as fast as we can on the basis of what we achieved on 17 December 1993, that is, the points of agreement which I have recalled above. Please accept, Samdech Krompreah, my high and respectful consideration. [Signed] Khieu Samphan, president of the DKP [Dated] 6 January 1994
