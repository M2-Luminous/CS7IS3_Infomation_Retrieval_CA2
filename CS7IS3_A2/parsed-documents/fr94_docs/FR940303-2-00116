The administrative law judge found that in March 1991, the deceased's sister, acting as a confidential informant, attempted a controlled purchase of cocaine from the Respondent. Prior to going to Respondent's home on March 29, 1991, the detective searched the sister's clothing and car, and provided her with $100.00, however, the sister was not searched because there were no female officers on duty.

The sister was observed going into Respondent's home where she remained for 20 to 30 minutes.

The search revealed an amber glass vial that contained a white powder resembling cocaine. Respondent was then arrested, and allegedly stated to the arresting officer, that, ``I'm just a recreational user. People don't go to jail for using cocaine.'' Respondent later stated, ``its not my cocaine. I just store it for someone. He gives me cocaine for allowing him to store it in my house.'' A search was then conducted of Respondent's house which revealed a safe which contained, among other things, two one-gram scales commonly used to weigh and package cocaine, a clear plastic bag containing a substance which was later confirmed to be two ounces of cocaine, as well as cocaine residue on various other items. A quantity of cocaine was also obtained after scraping screens, grinders, and scales found in the safe. In addition, 19 grams of marijuana were seized from the bedroom. Respondent was arrested and charged with the transportation and possession of cocaine.

The Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles convicted Respondent and sentenced him to 180 days in county jail, and three years probation.

The Respondent testified at the administrative hearing that he first experimented with marijuana and cocaine in the 1970's and became a regular cocaine user during the 1980's. Respondent further testified that during the years of his cocaine use, his house served as a gathering place for himself, his live-in girlfriend, her sister, as well as several of their friends. Respondent testified that he never sold cocaine to anyone, and that those individuals that stated that Respondent sold them cocaine, all had a motivation to lie, and make Respondent appear responsible for his girlfriend's death. Respondent testified that he briefly participated in the California Medical Board's diversion program for impaired physicians, however he stated that he was rejected from the program because of pending criminal charges against him.
