Kamal al-Janzuri, 'Atif 'Ubayd, and Yusif Butrus Ghali, has returned from extensive negotiations with the World Bank, the IMF, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Discussions naturally revolved around the "paper" drafted at the end of last March by Egyptian and World Bank experts and signed for Egypt by Dr. Yusif Butrus Ghali and for the World Bank by Ram Shapra, head of its Middle East Department. The "paper" is the outcome of an evaluation of the [current] structural reforms. The reforms are undertaken in the context of the second stage of the Economic Reform Program and the Structural Adjustment Program, and the reforms involve the areas of finance, privatization, and the timetable for implementation. The "paper" contains three major elements--the positive results of the economic reforms program in light of agreed recommendations; defining the issues that should have been already resolved but remain pending; and the actions to be taken by the government this year and through July 1995 when the program expires. As far as the overall economy is concerned, the "paper" reports that implementation proceeded as planned and achieved tangible results in all aspects of performance and standards through the end of 1993. The government committed to continue planned fiscal measures intended to reduce the budget deficit to 2.6 percent of GDP by the end of June 1994, and to narrow it even further in the 1994/95 budget. The government committed to bringing down the rate of inflation from 15 percent in 1992/93 to 7.4 percent by January 1994. The $900 million balance of payments surplus realized in the first six months of the year came close to the $2 billion target for the year. The report also states that the current account deficit has been reduced at a faster rate than planned. That deficit currently stands at 1.3 percent of GDP. The Uniform Tax Law has been promulgated in the hopes of improving current budget revenues. The law prevents the double-taxation of corporations and economic activity. It also reduces the burden of those of limited means. Trimming government subsidies helped contain the growth in public spending and in wages as well as stabilize investments at the targeted level of 7 percent of GDP. The ceiling for expenditures has been set at 7.2 percent of GDP. The government has acceded to World Bank recommendations to limit public sector investments to infrastructure projects and leave other investments to the private sector. Egypt must continue to channel credit to the private sector and to lower interest rates. The latter have indeed dropped in the second half of last year from 15 to 13.4 percent, thereby reducing inflationary pressures. Exchange rates stabilized at about 3.39 pounds per dollar despite inflows of currencies and remittances. Intervention by the Central Bank helped set that rate. The government reduced customs duties to a maximum of 70 percent. Other tariffs in the 30 to 40 percent range have been reduced by 10 percent as previously agreed in the program. Duties on capital goods have also been reduced from 10 to five percent. As a result of government discussions with World Bank experts, a GATT consultant was named to help the government "purge the legislative climate" of anti-dumping policies and to put safe and secure mechanisms in place. It has also been agreed that the government will introduce into the People's Assembly a bill that would allow foreign companies to engage in foreign trade side by side with domestic export/import firms. The draft-law would abolish all remaining restrictions on private sector trade in cotton and would allow non-Egyptians to engage in the cotton trade on par with Egyptians. It would also allow foreign banks to open on-shore branches and would encourage competition by allowing insurance companies to operate within the country. It was agreed as well on the need to expedite the introduction into the People's Assembly of a rental housing bill that would abolish all rent controls on new or vacated housing units. The discussions also touched on the need to lift all restrictions on industrial investments such as eliminating the need to obtain permits from the Investment Authority or the Industrialization Authority in order to construct factories in new communities. The Bank's delegation commended the decision to abolish the prior sanction requirement for investments of 5 million pounds or less. That ceiling has been raised to 10 billion pounds under the decree issued by President Mubarak on labor day. Also discussed was the underwriting of privatization costs by the general state budget or through the resources of the companies being privatized or restructured. Even though the World Bank gave satisfactory performance evaluations to public sector companies, a list was made of 35 companies that were due for divestiture under the 1992/93 program but will be privatized under the 1993/94 program instead. Discussions also dealt with the delayed "liquidation" of certain companies, because the government supplanted them by other companies with a book value of 475 million Egyptian pounds, even though only 355 million pounds in liquidations were actually realized by the end of 1993. Still on the subject of privatization, the delegation commends the existence of a full-time cabinet portfolio dedicated to the public business sector. The ministry implements programs to encourage worker participation in privatization programs through more than 50 investor/worker federations. Many privatized company shares have also been made available on the stock exchange. The discussions also dealt with reforming the banking sector and with reducing the Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves requirement from 15 to 10 percent of each bank's aggregate earnings redeposited interest-free with the Central Bank. The talks touched on whether banks meet the capital requirements set by the Basel Committee and on whether they allocate adequate reserves to cover non-performing loans. World Bank experts commended the implementation of the agreement to sell public bank equities in banks and private firms, otherwise known as joint banks or joint investment companies. In a different area, the discussions focused on the delayed implementation of certain aspects of agreed programs such as boosting the GDP rate of growth which remains weak in certain instances, causing unemployment to rise to 17 percent. Other shortcomings in program implementation that were discussed included: - People's Assembly failure to impose a 5-percent tax on savings earnings. - The imposition by the government of a 2-percent customs duty over and above the current fee which is 1-percent higher than the customs duties set by recent customs conventions. - The consumer price of electricity remains at 80 percent of marginal cost when the government had promised to implement higher rates. - The entry of foreigners in the cotton market remains restricted, in that cotton trade is restricted by law to Egyptian nationals. The World Bank delegation criticized the government for setting a minimum selling price for an interim period that is yet to be defined. - World Bank experts would rather do without certain investment formalities in the governorates. Examples are defining areas suitable for investments and issuing local government permits. - World Bank experts criticized the manner of privatizing the insurance and Social Security sectors by not factoring in options for reforms in social security, especially in view of the propensity to combine the Insurance, Social Security, and Pension departments. It was agreed to expedite the introduction into the People's Assembly of the new insurance bill, which would allow foreign firms to operate within the country and would provide for monitoring "private funds" in order to raise their investment standards. At this point, the World Bank criticized the government for seizing insurance surpluses, amounting so far to 33 billion pounds, and for the low interest rate it pays on them. The talks established goals for 1994, including the completion of a study to set up an autonomous organizational structure for utilities. They also stressed the need to sell more shares of banks in which public sector banks have equity ownership; to encourage the formation of employee associations to help workers obtain bank loans to acquire shares; and to expedite the drafting of a uniform law on corporations and economic activity which would govern such eventualities as bankruptcies, anti-trust cases, mergers, and arbitration. The World Bank expressed willingness to help get this bill drafted before the current session of the People's Assembly adjourns. The Bank also emphasized the need to eliminate Ministry of Supply sugar and cooking oil subsidies by the end of 1995; to fully liberalize the cotton trade by the end of 1995; and to liberalize housing rents by the end of this year. It was also learned that those recommendations on the course of economic reforms notwithstanding, both World Bank and IMF presidents commended the rate of Egyptian reforms, which exceeded expectations. The government, meanwhile, has been keen on facing up to the expected negative aspects of the reforms program by paying careful attention to its social consequences in order to safeguard the livelihood of those with limited incomes. Even though the Bank and the IMF have both recommended that wages be contained, the government has approved auxiliary wage increases year after year in order to safeguard worker quality of life. It has also continued to subsidize most basic commodities and such public services as education and health and to make financial contributions to pensions and social insurance.
