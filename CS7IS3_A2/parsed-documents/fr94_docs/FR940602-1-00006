FR940602-1-00006 FR940602-1-00003 The alternative to this proposed action is to withhold certification of this new design and give a site-specific license to each utility that proposed to use the cask. This alternative however, would cost the NRC more time and money for each site-specific review. In addition, withholding certification would ignore the procedures and criteria currently in place for the addition of new cask designs. Further, it is in conflict with NWPA direction to the Commission to approve technologies for the use of spent fuel storage at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors without, to the extent practicable, the need for additional site reviews. Also, this alternative is anticompetitive in that it would exclude new vendors without cause and would arbitrarily limit the choice of cask designs available to power reactor licensees. Approval of the proposed rulemaking would eliminate the above problems. Further, the proposed rule will have no adverse effect on the public health and safety. The benefit of this proposed rule to nuclear power reactor licensees is to make available a greater choice of spent fuel storage cask designs which can be used under a general license. However, the newer cask design may have a market advantage over the existing designs in that power reactor licensees may prefer to use the newer casks with improved features. The new cask vendors with casks to be listed in ยง72.214 benefit by having to obtain NRC certificates only once for a design which can then be used by more than one power reactor licensee. Vendors with cask designs already listed may be adversely impacted in that power reactor licensees may choose a newly listed design over an existing one. However, the NRC is required by its regulations and NWPA direction to certify and list approved casks. The NRC also benefits because it will need to certify a cask design only once for use by multiple licensees. Casks approved through rulemaking are to be suitable for use under a range of environmental conditions sufficiently broad to encompass multiple nuclear power plants in the United States without the need for farther site-specific approval by NRC. This proposed rulemaking has no significant identifiable impact or benefit on other Government agencies. Based on the above discussion of the benefits and impacts of the alternatives, the NRC concludes that the requirements of the proposed rule are commensurate with the Commission's responsibilities for public health and safety and the common defense and security. No other available alternative is believed to be as satisfactory, and thus, this action is recommended. Regulatory Flexibility Certification In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule affects only the licensing and operation of nuclear power plants and cask vendors. The companies that own these plants do not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities'' set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act or the Small Business Size Standards set out in regulations issued by the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR part 121.
