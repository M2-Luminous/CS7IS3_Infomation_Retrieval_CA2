The mutually beneficial trade between the two countries should have developed unceasingly. In recent years, however, thare has been political controversy every year between spring and summer, and the reason does not lie on the Chinese side. The original purpose of the U.S. linkage of human rights to China's MFN trading status was to exert pressure on China. But China was not overwhelmed by such pressure. Conversely, the United States became caught in a dilemma designed by itself. There are now strong criticisms of the erroneous U.S. policy from within the United States; Asia, including Hong Kong; and even traditional U.S. allies in Europe. If the United States revokes China's MFN trading status, it will have to pay a huge political and economic price. To extricate itself from the embarrassment caused by the linkage, the Clinton administration, following Secretary of State Christopher's visit to China in March this year, recently sent Michael Armacost to Beijing as the President's special envoy, to seek a way out with Chinese cooperation. China's sincerity in this regard is beyond question. It wants to steadily develop friendly ties with the United States, promote cooperation, and reduce difficulties. Nevertheless, China cannot abandon its sovereignty or sacrifice social stability to meet U.S. demands. The differences in human rights concepts between China and the United States are quite natural. Human rights, which involves value judgments, belongs to the category of ideology. The late political leaders of the two countries, Mao Zedong and Nixon, could facilitate Sino-U.S. diplomatic ties precisely because they proceeded from a strategic height, surpassing their ideological differences, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and reaching cooperation based on mutual benefit. More than 20 years have elapsed since Nixon's world-shaking visit to China. If the ideological differences on human rights today lead to a retrogression in Sino-U.S. ties, it will be an adverse current in history. Despite the adverse current, we believe that the historical tide will continue to surge forward. It is noticeable that while talking about China's MFN recently, U.S. President Clinton also stressed the importance of U.S.-PRC economic and strategic cooperation. Following the Beijing political disturbance in 1989, the U.S. administration linked the question of human rights with China's MFN. Apparently, the "linkage" policy proceeded from a mistaken estimate. Five years have passed and China's political situation is more stable and its pace of reform and opening up has been steadier and quicker. As stated by President Jiang Zemin last week, "a bad thing has turned into a good one." If we had failed to adopt resolute measures five years ago, the steady situation in China today would be impossible. During an interview given to the U.S. "FOREIGN AFFAIRS," Singaporean statesman Lee Kuan-yew also pointed out: "Anyone who attempts to set up another government in China cannot be steadier than the current Beijing regime. Just imagine what would have happened if the students in Tiananmen Square could have attained their goal and formed their government. These Tiananmen students went to France and the United States later. They have never ceased quarreling there. What would China be like if these students were in power? The situation would be worse than that in the Soviet Union. China is a huge and complicated country and it needs a powerful central government." The development of events has proved that the United States' "linkage" policy is on the verge of bankruptcy. International observers have noted that it will be impossible for the U.S. Government to use the MFN issue to pressure China into accepting its human rights concept. If the United States revokes China's MFN trading status and fights a trade war, it will lose China's huge and potential market. In the current sharp economic competition between the developed nations, it is unlikely that the United States could bear the consequences. Information from Washington shows that the Clinton administration is considering a readjustment of this policy. It is now time to change its course. Many countries in the world have supported China's resumption of its status as a GATT signatory. Once China's status as a signatory of GATT is resumed, it should naturally be granted MFN trading status. If the United States wants to fundamentally change its policy, it should not obstruct China's reentry to GATT. Whether the question of MFN is settled or not, the difference of views between China and the United States on human rights will exist for a long time to come. This should not hinder cooperation between the two countries. The Chinese Government has held discussions and exchanges with a number of foreign governments on the question of human rights. Last year, China set up a nongovernmental China Human Rights Society, which probed Chinese and foreign theory and practice on human rights, maintained contacts with foreign human rights organizations, and participated in international human rights conferences. When the question of human rights is "separated" from trade, China can similarly carry out fruitful exchanges with the United States in this field, based on mutual respect, equality, and justice, so as to constantly improve the situation of human rights.
