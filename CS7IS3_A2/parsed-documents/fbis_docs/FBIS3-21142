This, in combination with the technology for concentrating NO[.sup]X[/] and carrying out absorption and desorption that is being developed by the Industrial Technology Research Institute, Osaka Prefecture (Shiro Akita, head), is aimed at construction of an NO[.sup]X[/]removal system for automobile tunnels, etc. The development of this system is being pushed forward by Prof. Anpo and the Industrial Technology Research Institute under consignment from the Osaka Prefecture Coordinating Council for Global Environmental Problems, and the outlook is for its becoming practical in two years. When a catalyst in which copper ions are fixed to zeolite (ZSM5) is vacuum exhausted at high temperatures, the copper ions are reduced. Anpo et al. conditioned an new optical catalyst in which these reduced ions are fixed to zeolite. When this optical catalyst has absorbed NO[.sup]X[/] and was exposed to light, the NO[.sup]X[/] was separated into oxygen and nitrogen. Attention has been drawn to the fact that catalysts in which copper ions are carried by zeolite can directly separate NO[.sup]X[/], but in such cases high temperature heating is necessary. The main feature of this optical catalyst is the direct separation of NO[.sup]X[/] at room temperature. In NO[.sup]X[/] removal systems, after the exhaust is sucked up by fans and absorbed and concentrated using activated carbon, it is heated and desorbed. The desorbed NO[.sup]X[/] is transferred to a separation unit that uses the optical catalyst and purified through separation into and discharging of nitrogen and oxygen. Development is being promoted with the goal of making a single practical unit that combines these operations within two years. In addition, the idea is to install this system in road tunnels and the like, but it is also theoretically possible to install them as exhaust processing systems for automobiles, such as busses and trucks, that have diesel engines; if small sized systems can be made, these can be seen as becoming practical.
