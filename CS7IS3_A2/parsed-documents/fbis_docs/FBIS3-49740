Jarmila Tosecka, our reporter, was there and she compiled the following report. [Begin recording] [Tosecka] Questions put by many journalists, including foreign ones, were answered by President Michal Kovac, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, and Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak. These questions could be summed up in the following basic areas: prospects for the future cooperation among the Visegrad four countries, the importance of the Partnership for Peace project for the countries involved and specifically for the Slovak Republic, Slovakia's relations with Hungary, the problem of the Hungarian minority as well as Slovak relations with Russia, and future contacts between Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In reply, Prime Minister Meciar again confirmed closeness of views whether on the project "Partnership for Peace" where, as the Czech side, Slovakia regarded individual approach as being realistic. He also assessed positively other areas of mutual relations. According to Meciar, Slovakia was interested in good and useful cooperation among the Visegrad four countries, but the existing course and results were not as we have expected. It is necessary to intensify cooperation, otherwise this group would disintegrate only to be replaced by bilateral relations. Asked whether a visit to Bratislava by President Clinton was discussed, President Michal Kovac replied: Yes, we have repeated our invitation to the celebrations of the 50th anniversay of the Slovak national uprising. We have presented to the U.S. President an album containing documentary evidence. Bill Clinton promised that if he himself could not come he would certainly send his envoy to Bratislava. Minister Jozef Moravcik confirmed, among other things, that the Slovak Republic was ready to sign immediately a framework agreement on Partnership for Peace. This was also confirmed by Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak. Foreign Minister Moravcik also replied to questions concerning the minorities problem. After the news conference ended, I put to him the following question: Before the Prague summit, the Hungarian daily NEPSZABADSZAG said the meeting in Komarno of Hungarian minority representatives last Saturday was taking place in the shadow of the Prague summit. At the same time it cast a shadow on that summit. During your talks with your Hungarian partner, could you also detect this shadow? [Moravcik] In my view, one should not overestimate the importance of that event. In a democratic environment, it is on the whole usual that somewhat more extreme views are presented. We appreciate the way that event passed off, the fact no anti- constitutional step was taken, and that everything is a subject of discussion [passage indistinct]. [Tosecka] How would you characterize your talks today with the Hungarian side? [Moravcik] The talks were of a general character, as we had little time. Problems raised were rather numerous. There was not enough time to enable us to devote ourselves to individual questions. Both sides, however, demonstrated strong political will to reach a consensus very quickly so that we would not have to spend too much energy on tackling certain problems and instead concentrate rather on issues tackled here. [Tosecka] As a government representative, how would you assess the conclusions of this Prague summit. What does it means for Slovakia? [Moravcik] For Slovakia it means opportunity, and one has to make use of that opportunity. [end recording]
