Samadov, chairman of the Council of Ministers of Tajikistan, took place in Moscow. As the head of a government delegation, he had many meetings, consultations, and negotiations here. Nevertheless, this busy working visit remained outside the attention of the press--probably undeservedly. Major policies are not made in front of television cameras or receptions filled with pomp. [Chernyshev] Abduzhalil Akhadovich, what was the main thrust of the meetings and negotiations you had in Russia? [Samadov] It is not, of course, meetings per se that are important for the fate of the people. What follows is important. To summarize the results briefly, they reinforced the feeling in me that Russia not only shares the pain and hopes of Tajik people. Just like us, Russia is sincerely ready for mutually beneficial cooperation at the new level of our relations. The totalitarian past is behind us, and what is ahead is an era of the civilized market and respect for human rights and dignity. So we came with the intention of working in this era. In Moscow we made an important comparison of viewpoints--they are similar across the entire spectrum of Russian-Tajik relations. Russia, Uzbekistan, and other CIS countries have been and will remain our main partners in the foreseeable future. Up to 80 percent of the Tajik economy is contingent upon CIS countries. And it hardly makes sense for the Commonwealth, with Russia as its centripetal center, to reject the economic opportunities of the Tajik market. In terms of not only raw materials but also finished products. [Chernyshev] The opinions has been voiced in the Russian press that bringing a number of CIS states back into the ruble zone will cause a new round of inflation in the economy. What can you say on this subject? [Samadov] Such a viewpoint has a right to exist. But let us look at this phenomenon from another angle as well. Expansion of the ruble zone will boost, launch, develop, and strengthen production, economic, and many other ties. Tajikistan, for instance, is ready to supply cotton, fruit, vegetables, and other products. But we need metal, equipment, petroleum products, and many other things. In the situation of separate "zones," that is, disrupted ties, Russian textile enterprises began to experience a dearth of cotton; the trade sector needs cheap fruit, vegetables, canned products; other consumers need the variety of products previously supplied by Tajikistan. In the Russian market all this was being made up for by shipments of goods mainly from West Europe. For hard currency, of course. Because the West does not want to buy those Russian products that in the past went to Tajikistan. Which means that having broken the ties with the CIS countries, the Russian economy and society were subjected to a great cataclysm, a shock. But this did not translate into therapy; in a number of places production declined sharply. Has the ruble become stronger for this? Has the people's situation improved? Has domestic production gone up? We heard these kinds of biting questions and opinions from competent Russian specialists in finance, economics, and production. This means that we need different mechanisms to carry out the tasks we have set for ourselves. Therefore we noted with great satisfaction the position of a number of deputy groups and factions in the State Duma and the Federation Council, the leadership of the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance and Central Bank of Russia, and ministries and agencies--a position that is close to the way we see things: The way to strengthen the ruble should be sought not in narrowing down its sphere of circulation but, on the contrary, in expanding it. We cannot look at this problem from the position of a small merchant. Which is: obtain ruble credit in one place, turn it over in another, then pocket the profit and pay off debts. The state economy works according to a different scheme. We have to look at this process more broadly. For instance, if Russian rubles begin to flow into the Tajik zone, a certain shortage of rubles will emerge in Russia itself, as you might easily guess. The rising demand for the ruble will in turn affect the exchange rate--it will go up. Of course, not everything is this simple in real life. This aspect and many others related to Tajikistan's entry into the ruble zone will be considered soon by a group of authoritative Russian experts, whose arrival we are expecting in Dushanbe. We, in turn, also intend to establish appropriate control to keep our economy from living on cheap rubles. The point is to make financial resources reflect adequately in the movement of many other resources, assist in their forward movement. It is clear that we do not intend to play the role of spongers in the ruble zone. I will ask you a teaser. What do you think: Will the position of the American dollar become stronger or weaker if the zone of its circulation becomes limited only to the territory of the United States? I doubt that even one American economist will answer this question in the affirmative. So I also believe that the ruble zone can and should expand, and the ruble should become a full-fledged international means of payment. [Chernyshev] This means that to the relief of business circles of two countries we may say that after Tajikistan joins the ruble zone the problem of nonpayments will also become a thing of the past? [Samadov] Undoubtedly. Mostly we have inherited nonpayments as a legacy from the Soviet past. But there is a time for everything. You do not start building a house with the roof. The same goes for us: We have to create the proper conditions for normal economic relations, their legislative foundation. Be our guests--trade, work, build. Our government will be only too glad to help. But any particular deals and operations are a prerogative of the parties to the agreement. Since as a result of the crisis Tajik society has experienced a textbook case of force majeure across the entire complex of production, trade, financial, and other ties with CIS countries, we see it as one of our vital tasks to prevent this sort of event happening in the future. When the economy begins to grow, there will be no reason for people to gather at rallies. They will be busy with the business at hand. It is like a system of communicating vessels. We are very grateful to all those partners in Russia and CIS countries who, at a difficult time for our motherland, supplied us with food, clothes, petroleum products, raw materials, and parts... Behind this stream of rather costly resources was and is the labor of tens of thousands people. Although we are living through a very difficult period, I dare say that the time will come when not a single person will regret helping Tajikistan in its hour of hardship. This is not in our national character. [Chernyshev] In your opinion, which directions of Russian-Tajik cooperation are most promising today? [Samadov] Practically any sphere. Our traditional export products. The development of mineral deposits, in which we have nearly all the elements in the Mendeleyev table. The extensive potential of agricultural production. But we have to start small. Areas that can bring tangible returns in the near future, establish solid ties. Tajikistan has, for instance, great places for health spas and recreation. We have many resort zones, including those with curative hot springs. This is a launching pad for the development of prestigious 7,000-meter-high mountain resorts. I could spend hours telling you about our land of plenty, blessed by sun and nature. Spring will come soon to the southern parts. Valleys will be covered with emerald greenery and a sea of flowers. Better come and see for yourself. But it is better still to come to work rather than vacation. We will do everything to bring people's living standards up to commonly recognized norms, to establish their direct economic interests. This applies to a full extent to Russians as well. Especially those who were literally forced to leave Tajikistan. As to certain concerns regarding political instability, I can tell you unequivocally: Life is getting back to normal. Today there are no more dangers facing you in our land than in any other country. "Isolated incidents" can happen anywhere, and they do not happen by the will of governments or peoples. [Chernyshev] How will the economic reform that is underway in your country affect Tajikistan's export potential in the near future? [Samadov] The economic reform is a component of our merging with the Russian economy. We have laws on property, enterprise, and investment that are similar in many respects... Moreover, we envisage additional steps that will create a most favorable status for Russian entrepreneurs. We do not envisage any obstacles or barriers to the movement of capital. The formula of our reform is to put in motion productive forces in Tajik society, to put into action most effectively its rich economic, scientific, and spiritual potential. To ensure the formation of a dynamic market economy and the priority of human rights and dignity, which are deeply consonant with fundamental values and views in the East and the sociopsychological traits of our peoples. We are striving to manage without a ponderous administrative apparatus and red tape in dealing with various matters. And most importantly, to create conditions for the forward development of society while not permitting the state to interfere in the life of its citizens and entrepreneurs. Our economy must have a "Tajik face." We do not have any other path to revival.
