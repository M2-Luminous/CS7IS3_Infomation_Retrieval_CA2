Description of Units Right-of-Way Clearing Units: R1&hyph;10. The unit is 1,000 feet in length and 10 feet in width (to be measured on one side of the pole line) of actual clearing of right-of-way. This includes clearing of underbrush, tree removal, and such tree trimming as is required so that the right-of-way, except for tree stumps which shall not exceed XXXX in height, shall be clear from the ground up of the width specified on one side of the line of poles carrying primary conductors. This unit does not include clearing or trimming associated with secondaries or services which is included with conductor units. The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between stakes and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the ground line. All trees and underbrush across the width of the right-of-way, as designated by the Engineer shall be considered to be grouped together as a single length in measuring the total length of clearing. Spaces along the right-of-way in which no trees are to be removed or trimmed or underbrush cleared shall be omitted from the total measurement. All length thus arrived at, added together and divided by 1,000, shall give the number of 1,000-foot R1&hyph;10 units of clearing. This unit includes the removal or topping, at the option of the Contractor; of danger trees outside of the right-of-way when so designated by the Engineer. (Danger trees are defined as dead or leaning trees which, in falling, will affect the operation of the line.) The Contractor shall not remove or trim shade, fruit or ornamental trees unless so directed by the Engineer. R1&hyph;20. This unit is identical with R1&hyph;10 except that width is 20 feet (to be measured 10 feet on each side of the pole line). R1&hyph;30. This unit is identical with R1&hyph;10 except that width is 30 feet (to be measured 15 feet on each side of the pole line). R1&hyph;40. This unit is identical with R1&hyph;10 except that width is 40 feet (to be measured 20 feet on each side of the pole line). RC1&hyph;10, RC1&hyph;20, RC1&hyph;30, RC1&hyph;40. These units are identical to the respective R1 units except that chemical treatment of stumps is required in addition to the clearing of underbrush, tree removal and tree trimming.
