This was indicated here by the Yugoslav Charge d' Affairs, Ms Milena Vlahovic. Speaking to this correspondent on the eve of the Foreign Minister's visit (he arrives here on Sunday, Ms Vlahovic said the purpose was to inform the Indian leadership "about the situation in the Balkans, propose possible solutions as well as explore the possibilities of future interaction, including cultural exchanges." Itself a victim of ethnic infighting, Yugoslavia is expected to back India on the Kashmir issue. Ms Vlahovic said Yugoslavia "completely and unconditionally supports the stand that Kashmir is an integral part of India." However, the emphasis on the sanctions issue is indicated in the Foreign Minister's itinerary. Apart from calling on the President, the Prime Minister and holding discussions with his counterpart, the External Affairs Minister, parleys between Mr. Jovanovic and the Commerce Minister are also slated. Mr. Jovanovic's visit coincides with the European Foreign Ministers proposing a wideranging settlement on the Yugoslav question. Covering Croatia as well as Bosnia Herzegovina, this plan urges Serbs to offer land to the Bosnian Muslims more than what they conceded in the talks which broke down last summer. In return, an easing of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro is being promised. In addition, aiming to provide relief to the affected population, European negotiators want safe passage for U.N. relief convoys. Wanting to create another link to central Bosnia, the Europeans hope to send technicians to reopen the airport at Tuzla. Urging the removal of sanctions, the Yugoslav Charge d' Affaires said their negative impact was felt in the Balkans. Referring to the geographic centrality of the country, she said the sanctions had also been detrimental to Greece, Romania and Hungary.
