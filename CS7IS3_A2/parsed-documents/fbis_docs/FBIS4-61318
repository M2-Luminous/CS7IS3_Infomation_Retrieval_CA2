The law is urgent in the present situation of growing competition between Baltic sea ports because it will help to improve the main legislative drawbacks concerning national and municipal port ownership, Gutmanis said. The planned revenue from port operation in 1994 is 15.5 million lats from which 1.1 million lats will be transferred to local budgets to develop port territory infrastructures. Under the law, port duties are covered by owners of cargo.
