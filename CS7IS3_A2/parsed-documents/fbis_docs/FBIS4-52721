Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a press conference on May 10 that Japan was examining "emergency legislative arrangements" for a counteraction of the "self-defence forces [SDF]" to a possible "emergency situation" on the Korean peninsula. The "emergency legislative arrangements" examined by the present cabinet are aimed at laying a legal foundation for sending "SDF" forces to the Korean peninsula any moment and paving the way for a legal comeback to Korea. In talking about a possible "emergency situation" on the Korean peninsula, they want a propaganda effect to build up public opinion favoring "emergency legislative arrangements" by fostering the consciousness of crisis among the people. Truth to tell, the Japanese reactionaries are watching for a chance to invade Korea, having made legal, ideological and military preparations. In crying over the "nuclear threat" of the DPRK and connecting it with the "security" of Japan, they are trying to invent a pretext for reinvasion. If Japan dare embark upon reinvasion, it will be digging its own grave.
