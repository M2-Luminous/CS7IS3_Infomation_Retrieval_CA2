Soon after the "analysis of the situation" of the social movement became known, everything seemed to indicate that the prevailing argument is that it is useless to continue wasting time and money on a losing ticket which does not have the consensus of the people to represent the interests of the workers. Perhaps this is why in the 20 March elections the social movement's support was so weak. But the story goes back much further. It stems from the "General Command's" alienation of labor leaders and peasants, who supported the FMLN organization for 12 years, hiding many clandestine "commanders" who -- like Zamora -- were engaged in political undercover actions. The madness of the leadership of the former guerrilla movement and the vertical command structure that imposes its decision from within the FMLN have been the main cause of the break between union members and the political committee of what is now a political party. This has reached such a point that the "coalition" cannot find persons to observe the polls or individuals to serve on the Voting Table Boards on 24 April. This has further demoralized Zamora's team. The union movement, intelligent and in step with democracy, does not want to become involved in the leadership problems of an FMLN that is deeply divided, that has made use of confrontation and the Marxist practice of slandering its opposition. The social movement has suggested, if not a change in leadership, at least a renewal of its strategies, more in keeping with the aspirations of the majority. The workers and peasants demand from their leaders a serious dialogue, without demagoguery, in order to better define their positions. They question the arrogance of those "commanders" who passed to "a better life" after the peace accords. They want an explanation for the new ideological posture adopted in favor of imperialism by those who betrayed the revolution in Santa Marta. The want a new leadership born of the rank and file, with a different vision, that will allow freedom and democracy within the organization, and that will eliminate fundamentalist and "bourgeois" vertical command structures that are destroying what little is left of the revolutionary mythology. But there are those who not want to give up their positions because if they did they would have to return their armored cars and sumptuous homes to the revolution. They would be inhibited from rubbing elbows with the capitalist "bourgeoisie" that they are serving and would lose their "class" privileges, which has alienated them from the rank and file and the labor-peasant movement. The unions no longer want reprimands from the FMLN leaders. Perhaps they are a long way from fulfilling their dreams, but they have reached the conclusion that it is easier to achieve them by talking directly with the democratic right wing. They are renouncing, prematurely, any manipulation by the FMLN, because they proved the "front" was never a reliable link between the impoverished population and businessmen, between the middle class and the power of the state. Doubtlessly, the rectification of the social movement may once again attract the sympathy of the new government. They understand that if they are sincere and know how to ask for things, they may reintegrate into the democratic mainstream and contribute to strengthening important national objectives. The breach they opened to undermine the foundation of the Republic during their 12-year alliance with Marxist terrorism did not improve the rank and file's living conditions. Now, in peace and harmony, they can procure a better future for their fellow union members within the system. We are sure that good judgment will be the norm for the social movement to follow. Let's hope this is not merely rhetoric born of the contradictions of the left wing. El Salvador will be a great and sovereign nation when the strategy of brutality, blackmail, and Marxist dogmatism gives way to sincerity and good judgment. We hope this will happen on 24 April.
