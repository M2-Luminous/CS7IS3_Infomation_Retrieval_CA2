The turbocharged, 10000-cc engine is 10 percent more fuel efficient than similar large-scale diesel engines without sacrificing power and torque, the NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN said. The engine, called P11C, uses pistons made of a new material mixed with heat-blocking graphite to raise thermal efficiency, in the first application of this new technology, it said. The use of the new material makes it possible to raise combustion efficiency to 46 percent from the previous ceiling of 43 percent for similar engines, the daily said. Hino has used the engine in some of its large-size trucks and has no plans to sell the engine by itself, it said.
