Klaus arrived on Thursday [28 January] in Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum. Construction of the plant, located in southern Bohemia, started in 1986, and from the very beginning it has been strongly criticized by environmental organizations, especially in neighboring Austria. American banks and manufacturers are involved in the project. "It is another reply to those who are falsely accusing us both back home and among our southern neighbors," Klaus stated. The bank certainly took this step after careful consideration, he said, adding that he had expected the bank to make the decision.
