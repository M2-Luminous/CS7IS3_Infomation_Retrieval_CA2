FR941104-0-00018 FR941104-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Office of Foreign Assets Control 31 CFR Part 565 Panamanian Transactions Regulations; Termination of Residual Blocking of Government of Panama Assets AGENCY: Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule; amendment. SUMMARY: The Office of Foreign Assets Control is amending the Panamanian Transactions Regulations to terminate the residual blocking of Government of Panama assets, effective November 4, 1994. This action terminates the Panamanian program of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Authority to take enforcement action for sanctions violations is not affected by this action. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven I. Pinter, Chief of Licensing (tel.: 202/622&hyph;2480), or William B. Hoffman, Chief Counsel (tel.: 202/622&hyph;2410), Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20220.

Background Executive Order 12710 of April 5, 1990, 3 CFR, 1990 Comp., p. 282, terminated the national emergency declared on April 8, 1988, with respect to Panama, and lifted sanctions imposed against the Noriega regime. Pursuant to section 207(a)(2) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1706(a)(2), however, the order continued the blocking of certain Government of Panama assets in the United States, with the understanding of the Government of Panama, to facilitate resolution of claims of U.S. persons. Because all such claims known to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') and arising prior to the lifting of sanctions have either been settled or provided for by the Government of Panama, including its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities such as Air Panama, the residual blocking has fulfilled its purpose. Therefore, FAC is revising ยง565.510 of the Panamanian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR part 565 (the ``Regulations''), to authorize, November 4, 1994, all transactions otherwise prohibited by the Regulations with respect to property and property interests in which the Government of Panama has an interest. Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

Approved: October 11, 1994. R. Richard Newcomb, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary (Law Enforcement). [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27345; Filed 11&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4810&hyph;25&hyph;F
