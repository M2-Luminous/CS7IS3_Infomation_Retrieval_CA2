In their talks, Li spoke highly of the bilateral relations, noting that Sweden is the first western country to establish diplomatic relations with New China after it was born in 1949 and the two nations have no outstanding problems to settle. The two countries share many common interests in the maintenance of world peace and promotion of common development, Li said. Li added that so long as both sides pursue the principles of mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, mutual benefit and equality as well as seeking common grounds while reserving differences, the relations between the countries will be promoted constantly. Ugglas said in the talks that her country has paid great attention to Li's current visit. She said Sweden appreciates the economic and social successes achieved by China in recent years. The Swedish Government supports broader economic and trade cooperation between the two countries, said the foreign minister. Ugglas expressed her belief that Li's visit will boost the existing bilateral ties in the political and economic fields. Li arrived in Sweden's second largest city of Gothenburg last Friday to begin a visit to the Nordic nation, the second leg of his current five-European-nation tour, which has already taken him to Finland. Li will proceed to Norway, Denmark and Belgium.
