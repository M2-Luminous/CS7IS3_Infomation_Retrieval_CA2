For Austria, which had 40 billion schillings in claims in export credits, the redemption of these debts means a burden on our budget of between 2.5-2.8 billion schillings a year. In the meantime, however, Poland's credit rating has significantly changed. As Gerhard Praschak, managing director of the Austrian Control Bank (OeKB), told DIE PRESSE, guarantees for Poland credits are available again. "Experience in new transactions is excellent, the Poles are fully rehabilitated," Praschak said by way of explaining this decision in terms of economic policy. Although export guarantees are handled by the OeKB, it is the Federal Government, and thus ultimately the taxpayer, that assumes the liability. Still, liability fees for Poland are relatively high, namely 3 percent, while for exports to Slovakia they are only at 1.5 percent. There are still no guarantees for exports to Russia, while Iran and Algeria have become new "problem cases." In both countries, credits granted by Austria amount to some 12 billion schilling. In the case of Iran, which is paying back debts only very slowly, Praschak expects a "de facto rescheduling of debts," since, owing to political resistance from the United States, an official one is hardly possible. Algeria is also again and again being regarded as a rescheduling candidate, even though Austrian credits have hitherto always been serviced. In the past few years, the OeKB had to put up with a 50-percent reduction of its export guarantee turnover. In 1990 the figure was still 95 billion schillings, and in 1991 81 billion schillings. The loss of exports to the USSR and Yugoslavia, the decrease in project deals and exports to the Arab countries, which declined as a result of lower oil prices, resulted in a reduction of the guarantee turnover to 48 billion schillings in 1992. Guarantees went down further to 45 billion schillings in 1993, Praschak said. [passage omitted]
