Deputy Economy Minister Irma Toledo said on 10 March that, based on a study by the Finance Ministry, the government would have to allocate 700 million additional quetzales in 1994 to grant public employees the 300 quetzales salary increase they are demanding. Toledo stressed that: "Public employees have been told that it is impossible to meet their demands because to do so would mean setting aside social investments, which the government is not willing to do." (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 94) An official source said today that the Guatemalan monetary authorities agreed to make the exchange system more flexible by liberalizing the public sale of foreign exchange, which is regulated by the Central Bank. Willy Zapata, president of the Guatemalan Central Bank and the Monetary Board, indicated that the new measure will go into effect on 17 March. Zapata rejected the possibility that the measure will trigger an increase in the exchange rate or a flight of foreign currency. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2305 GMT 15 Mar 94)
