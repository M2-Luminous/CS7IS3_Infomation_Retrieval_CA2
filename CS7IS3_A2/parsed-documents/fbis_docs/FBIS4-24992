Although boasting a 3,300-kilometer coastline, Fujian has few cultivated areas, averaging 0.033 hectares per capita. The provincial government has taken the lead in the country in reforming its fishing system and lifted prices on aquatic products since 1990. As a result, its aquatic products output reached 1,903 million kilograms last year, ranking third in the country and averaging 60.5 kilograms per capita. According to Zhang Wenliang, director of the provincial bureau of aquatic products, the output value of Fujian's fisheries will lead in Fujian's agricultural output value in the year 2010. In addition to aquatic production, Fujian is paying attention to the development of deep-water fishing, offshore oil pumping, mining and tourism.
