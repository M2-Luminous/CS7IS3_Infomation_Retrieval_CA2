Security Council [UNSC] imposes sanctions on North Korea over its alleged nuclear arms development program, a senior Foreign Ministry official said. Hata made the remarks at an emergency meeting convened following weekend consultations of Japan, the United States and South Korea in Washington to discuss the North Korean nuclear issue, the official said. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Chief Cabinet Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito and Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau who attended the Washington get-together -- were present at the meeting Monday. Hata told the meeting that if the Security Council decides to take measures, including sanctions, to put pressure on North Korea to change its position, Japan will support the move and cooperate as much as possible within the framework of the Constitution, the official said. Hata also instructed the government to study measures the country would take in case the Security Council adopts the resolution. Hata strongly urged North Korea to fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to eliminate international suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons. He said Japan will make every diplomatic effort to solve the problem peacefully, through international coordination, the official said. The diplomatic efforts include close consultations with South Korea, China and other relative countries, the official said. In a related development earlier in the day, government officials indicated Kakizawa may visit Seoul as early as this weekend to hold talks with his South Korean counterpart Han Song-chu. The date of the foreign ministerial meeting, however, has not yet been decided due to the Diet schedule. Kakizawa may also visit China, according to government sources. Yanai, U.S. Assistant secretary of State Robert Gallucci and Kim Sam-hun, South Korea's special envoy on the nuclear issue, agreed over the weekend to adopt a united front on the North Korean nuclear issue. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the three nations called on the United Nations to take prompt action against Pyongyang, including the consideration of sanctions.
