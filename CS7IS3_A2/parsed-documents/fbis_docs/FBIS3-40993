The accords aim at scrapping the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine. A Russian military spokesman has told Interfax that Ukraine's Defence Ministry has warned the strategic missile forces personnel that the officers refusing to swear allegiance to Ukraine will be dismissed. The spokesman described these Ukrainian actions as the start of a seizure of strategic nuclear weapons. He stressed that in these conditions the Russian military could not bear responsibility for the nuclear ammunition's control and service. He did not rule out that pressed by Kiev, quite a few missile forces officers would have to leave Ukraine with "unpredictable consequences." He is convinced that the fate of the nuclear weapons in Ukraine must concern primarily Kiev and western countries. "The loss of proper control over nuclear weapons may be disastrous," he stressed.
