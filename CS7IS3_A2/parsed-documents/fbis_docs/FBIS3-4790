Based on studies carried out since the 1970s the Minister of Research and Technology/Chairman of the BPPT [Research and Technology Development Agency] B. J. Habibie stated that it will be difficult for Indonesia to overcome its electricity crisis without incorporating nuclear power. "Whether we want to or not, it will be difficult for Indonesia to overcome its energy problems without nuclear power. Up to now we haven't known how to do it. But we must be aware that nuclear power has the lowest priority. If there is no other way, we will take that path," he said here yesterday after giving a speech during the program of Choosing National Figures 1993 in the FORUM KEADILAN magazine version. Habibie said this in response to various policy statements made by a number of national figures about the development of the Muria I Nuclear-Powered Electric Generator. Habibie said that even though nuclear power has been given the lowest priority, construction will continue on the Muria I Nuclear-Powered Electric Generator project. This will be done, he continued, to get ready to face an electric energy crisis. Preliminary feasibility studies carried out by Newjec Inc (Japan) were completed in December 1993; they concluded that constructing the PLTN in Muria is quite feasible. Further feasibility studies will not be completed until 1997. However, projections are that it will be opened to construction tenders in 1995. The Muria I Nuclear-Powered Electric Generator will be the first nuclear-based electric generator built in Indonesia; it will have a capacity of 2,600 MW. The results of site studies show that Ujung Lemahabang is in first place, followed by Ujung Grengengan and then by Ujung Watu. These three sites are located on the north shore of the Muria peninsula in Central Java. Is it necessary to hold a referendum to obtain the agreement of the populace? Habibie said that he is only helping the MPR's [Parliament] mandate by gathering scientific and technological information. His strategic goal is to create job opportunities. "The GBHN [Broad Outlines of the Nation's Direction] demands these job opportunities. But job opportunities need factories and factories need electricity. Some people say no, just build up the tourist industry, build hotels. But hotels also need electricity, you know. So we can't build without electricity," he said.
