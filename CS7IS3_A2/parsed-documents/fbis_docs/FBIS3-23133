A very high state of alert was declared in the Mate Binyamin settlements, and the IDF has dramatically beefed up its forces in the region. A particularly sharp pamphlet published yesterday by the Palestinian command in the territories, which includes PLO representatives, said: "The Zionist enemy must be aware that no crime goes unavenged. Those who spill the blood of our people will not go unscathed. We will set the ground under the feet of the Nazi occupiers on fire." The Palestinian leadership in the territories has renewed the activities of the Unified National Leadership of the Intifadah, in cooperation with Fatah, and called for the resumption of intifadah activities, including violence against IDF forces and settlers, in order to cause as many casualties and as much damage to property as possible. As will be recalled, the command was disbanded after the signing of the Washington agreement in September, but it was reestablished on Sunday. Sources in the territories noted that the command was reestablished with the cooperation of Fatah representatives and that its demands are a signal to 'Arafat that conducting negotiations does not mean control on the ground. The sources said that as a result of the erosion in 'Arafat's status, he has no choice but to radicalize his positions and to accept the demands of the leadership in the territories.
