FR940127-2-00175 FR940127-2-00098 (2) Established connections with partner institutions; (3) The capacity to organize and conduct the program, including appropriate orientation activities for the participants; detailed work plan for all phases of the project; tentative agendas for study tours, workshops, and internships; letters of commitment from internship hosts; and selection procedures. USIS post consultation by applicants, prior to submission of proposals, is recommended. Address inquiries to Assistant Cultural Affairs Officer, AmEmbassy (USIS) Bangkok, Box 48, APO AP 96546&hyph;0001, Telephone 66&hyph;2&hyph;286&hyph;0900; Fax 66&hyph;2&hyph;287&hyph;2102. USIA will give priority to proposals from U.S. organizations that have partner organizations in Thailand or Southeast Asia, which will assist logistically and will contribute to the realization of program goals and objectives and will themselves be enhanced by the program. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate partner relationships by providing copies of correspondence or other materials as appendices to proposals. The partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing or significant in-kind contributions such as local housing, transportation, interpreting, translating and other local currency costs and to assist with the organization of projects. Materials Development USIA encourages the development, where needed, of written, audio and video materials in the local language to enhance the programs. For example, if not already available, glossaries of specialized terms in local government or public administration might be developed. Scope Proposals should limit their focus to local governance. Proposals for programs that are broader in scope will be eligible, but are less likely to receive USIA support. USIA encourages proposals that feature ``train the trainers'' models; the creation of indigenous training centers; schemes to create professional networks or professional associations to disseminate information; and other enduring aspects. Participant Selection All grant proposals must clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process by which participants will be selected. Programs in support of internships in the U.S. must include letters tentatively committing host institutions to support the internships. In the selection of all foreign participants, USIA and USIS posts retain the right to nominate participants and to accept or deny participants recommended by the program institution. Guidelines and Restrictions USIA does not support proposals limited to conferences or seminars of only a few days length which are organized as plenary sessions, major speakers, and panels with a passive audience. It will support conferences only insofar as they are a minor part of a larger project in duration and scope which is receiving USIA funding from this competition. Furthermore, grants are not given to support projects whose focus is limited to technical issues, or for research projects, for publications intended for dissemination in the United States, for individual student exchanges, for film festivals or exhibits. Nor does this Office provide scholarships or other support for long-term (i.e., a semester or more) academic studies. Proposals that request support for the development of university curriculums or for degree-based programs will not be eligible under this RFP. Proposals to link university departments or to exchange faculty and/or students are funded by USIA's Office of Academic Programs (E/A) under the University Affiliation Program and should not be submitted under this RFP. Competitions sponsored by other offices of USIA's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs are also announced in the Federal Register , and may have different guidelines or restrictions. Funding The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $125,000. However, exchange organizations with less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000. While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they may also include separate sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location or activity. Competition for USIA funding support is keen. Please note: All participants will be covered under the terms of a USIA-sponsored health insurance policy. The premium is paid by USIA directly to the insurance company. The following project costs are eligible for consideration for funding: 1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs; ground transportation costs. 2. Per Diem. For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for program participants or the published U.S. Federal per diem rates for individual American cities. For activities outside the U.S., the published federal per diem rates must be used. Note: Grantee staff must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate.
