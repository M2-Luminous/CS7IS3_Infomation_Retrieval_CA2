The Forest Service will not, after all, begin harvesting on Monday [10 January]. About 20 of the Nature Alliance activists went cross-country skiing in the area as they pondered possible future actions. This forest activist group is demanding that the area be closed to all operations and is prepared to interrupt the Riuskanselkonen harvest with various methods. In the opinion of the Nature Alliance, the Riuskanselkonen area still is, despite the harvests that have already been carried out, a significant wetland and forest entity in the Kainuu environment. The 6,500-hectare region contains two wetland protection zones. The harvests were planned for two areas which have been marked for cutting. The project would have employed 40 loggers and contractors.
