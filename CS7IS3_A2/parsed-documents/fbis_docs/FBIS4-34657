Taking advantage of President Itamar Franco's absence at the end of the Ibero-American Summit, the Argentine chief of state devised a broad support base for the candidacy of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is leaving the Mexican presidency next September, to director general of the World Trade Organization (WTO). President Menem ignored the candidacy of current Brazilian Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero formally presented to the organization that will replace GATT. Menem trampled over the basics of Mercosur [Common Market of the South], which includes the adoption of common action on subjects of common interests. He tread on good manners by taking advantage of the Brazilian delegation's absence to accomplish his scheme. With this he obtained Latin America's informal support for the Mexican candidate, but he also harmed relations between Brazil and Argentina. Brazil's immediate reaction was to cancel the visit of Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo on 27 and 28 June to Brazil: Brazilian authorities will not have time to receive the Argentine minister. The mood of the bilateral relations has therefore been established. What could Brazil expect to save from the remnants of a relation whose vitality was in the economic field, and which Buenos Aires insists on damaging in the political field? The impression is that Menem and his political advisers are not capable of designing a policy of rapprochement with the United States without harming relations with Brazil. Given that a policy of rapprochement with the United States is not incompatible with a good relationship with Brazil, the hostility -- invariably unfounded -- with which we are treated is more shocking. The Cartagena episode is just one of a series. Before it took place, Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion had said Argentina would not support Brazil's intention to obtain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Minister Cavallo got sick and tired of telling the Brazilians how to conduct their economic affairs. When establishing regulations for Mercosur, the Argentines went back and forth endlessly. A common external tariff has not been established so far because Buenos Aires hindered the process and blamed Brazil for structural distortions that were rather due to the frozen Argentine exchange rate, an essential part of the Cavallo Plan. The Argentine Government knew beforehand about Minister Ricupero's candidacy to the WTO. Argentina maintains close trade relations with Brazil, a fact that is the embryo for a more serious economic, social, and political integration. Menem's underhanded action -- considering the circumstances in which he performed it -- demonstrate an unsustainable position. The Brazilian authority who from now on accepts the political and moral commitments assumed by this Justicialist administration in relations with Mercosur at face value would be foolish; the Brazilian authority who considers Argentine policies foreseeable, a quality that is the basis of trust, would be irresponsible. The Argentine Government has made its choice regarding Brazil. It has exchanged the excellent relations we had for a move that could end in granting Mexico, therefore NAFTA, therefore the United States, the general direction of the World Trade Organization. We have nothing to object to the candidacy of Salinas or the United States, the largest world power. What is repugnant to our conscience and goes against our good sense is the shameless maneuver that disqualifies its author and places its beneficiary under suspicion. Everything indicates that President Menem will be reelected for four more years in office. This obliges Brazilian diplomacy, as of now, to treat Argentina with the seriousness the situation demands and with the politeness with which we have not been treated. In order to prevent the negative trade balance from affecting the results of the Cavallo Plan and Mercosur, Brazil has been purchasing from Argentina what it could buy elsewhere with greater political gains. Mexico could supply us with the same oil we buy from Argentina. Canada has the wheat we obtain from Argentina. Those two countries are NAFTA members and if the example set by the Casa Rosada [Argentine Government House] is correct, the future is in the north and not in the south. There is no reason for purchasing goods from Argentina just to maintain a balance of accounts. That is the exclusive problem of Argentina. Let us just center on the cost-benefit relation in our trade and policy and do just what is totally gainful for us. Argentina has so far established the terms of our relations, clearly demonstrating that it believes that a special relationship is a one-way path. Brazil does not have to shoulder such a burden.
