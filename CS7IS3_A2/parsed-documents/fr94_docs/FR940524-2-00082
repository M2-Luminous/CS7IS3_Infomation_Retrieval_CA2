Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on April 19, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The CBOE proposes to amend certain of its rules to provide for the listing and trading on the Exchange of options on the Nikkei Stock Index 300 (``Nikkei 300'' or ``Index''), 2 a cash-settled broad-based index with European-style exercise. 2 The CBOE has represented that the designations ``Nikkei Stock Index 300'' and ``Nikkei 300'' are property of Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Exchange to amend its rules to provide for the listing and trading of options on the Nikkei Stock Index 300. The Index is comprised of 300 representative stocks of the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (``TSE''). 3 The Exchange believes that options on the Index will provide investors with a low-cost means of participating in the performance of the Japanese economy and hedging against the risk of investing in that economy. 3 First section stocks are distinguished from second section stocks by more stringent listing standards. Telephone conversation between Eileen Smith, Director, Product Development, Research Department, CBOE, and Francois Mazur, Attorney, Office of Derivatives and Equity Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (May 16, 1994). Index Design: The Index was designed by and is maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. The CBOE represents that Index component stocks were selected by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. for their high market capitalization and their high degree of liquidity, and are representative of the industrial composition of the broader Japanese equity market. The Index is weighted by the market capitalization of the component stocks. The median capitalization of the firms in the Index on March 31, 1994, was y 340.1 billion. 4 The average market capitalization of these firms was US$7.5 billion on the same date using the same rate of exchange. The individual market capitalization of these firms ranged from US$875 million to US$76.5 billion on March 31, 1994. The largest stock accounted for 3.41% of the total weighting of the Index, while the smallest accounted for 0.04%. 4 US$3.3 billion at the exchange rate of y 102.75 per dollar prevailing on March 31, 1994. Calculation: The value of the Index is determined by adding the price of each stock times the number of shares outstanding. This sum is then divided by a divisor which gives the Index a value of 100 on its base date of October 1, 1982. This divisor is adjusted for pertinent changes as described below in the section titled ``Maintenance.'' The Index had a closing value of 296.35 on April 13, 1994. Maintenance: The Index will be maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. To maintain continuity of the Index, the divisor of the Index will be adjusted to reflect certain events relating to the component stocks. These events include, but are not limited to, changes in the number of shares outstanding, spinoffs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. The composition of the Index will be reviewed periodically by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc.
