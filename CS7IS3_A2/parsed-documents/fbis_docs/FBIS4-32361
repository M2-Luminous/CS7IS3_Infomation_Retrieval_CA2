According to preliminary plans, the base would be built on the military facility near the town of Komarom (N. Hungary), which Soviet troops used for nearly half a century. The new base will provide scientific training for experts, and display various methods for environmental protection. The plan was disclosed in Komarom on Wednesday [22 June], when NATO members from the division of science and environmental protection, who are currently holding talks in Hungary, visited the heavily polluted facility. Construction will be carried out by NATO's environmental protection section and the joint research centre of the Budapest Technical University and the State University of Florida.
