"We shouldn't blindly oppose it. We will review it," Yi said. "Proposals for rezoning in the past were just gerrymandering before an election, but as long as it is conducted fairly, it's worth consideration," the Democratic Party leader said. DP Spokesman Pak Chi-won confirmed Yi's remarks, saying the redistricting "should be done if necessary." The realignment of administrative units would include merging cities and counties before the mayoral, gubernatorial and local elections in the first half of next year. Stories were floated last week that the ruling party was ready to split up Seoul as well because it was concerned an opposition figure would be elected mayor, a position so powerful it is called the no. 2 post after the president, and hamper the administration. President Kim immediately dismissed the idea, and Yi said Friday that Seoul "can never be" divided. DP officials said a party leadership meeting early next week will formulate the party's official position on administrative redistricting.
