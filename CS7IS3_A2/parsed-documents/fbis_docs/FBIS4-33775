According to the resolution approved on 9 June during the 24th General Assembly, the OAS considers essential the participation of the chiefs of state and government of all the hemisphere's countries, except for Cuba, which was not invited to the summit by the United States. The Summit of the Americas and the Haitian crisis have been the main subjects of many of the debates in the 24th OAS General Assembly, which began on 6 June and should conclude on 10 June in Belem do Para, northern Brazil. During the traditional unofficial meeting held before the assembly on 5 June, the OAS member countries' foreign ministers expressed the importance of the OAS, as the main political forum of inter-American dialogue, actively participating in the presidential summit by presenting proposals and preparing an agenda. "I believe that one of the most important events of this assembly was the decision we made on 5 June to make the OAS actively participate in the Summit of the Americas," said Argentine Ambassador to the OAS Hernan Patino. "The summit is very important because we admit a reality: The active participation of the United States in the solution of the problems of the continent's countries is indispensable," said Ecuadoran Ambassador to the OAS Blasco Pena-Herrera. OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena Soares himself, who this month steps down from his post after 10 years, said in his opening speech that the OAS should contribute to the success of the summit organized by Clinton. Baena Soares mentioned "the positive and immediate reaction" of member countries to Clinton's invitation and added that "such favorable conditions to promote a broad and creative exchange among the chiefs of state and government have not taken place for a long time." "I think that during the summit the OAS could mark its presence effectively. Its institutional organizations and mechanisms can help prepare and put into practice the results." After several days of consultations, the member countries decided to approve on 9 June a resolution formalizing the OAS' role in the preparatory process for the Summit of the Americas. In the resolution approved by acclamation, the OAS General Assembly recommends that the OAS Permanent Council -- which includes all the ambassadors accredited in Washington -- "make a contribution to the Summit of the Americas and follow up the recommendations it will make." The OAS General Assembly also recommends that the OAS Permanent Council form a working group that "can call the extraordinary preparatory meetings necessary for such purpose." In its resolution, the OAS considers the Miami summit "as a favorable occasion to adopt a plan of action that includes all the agreed-upon solutions for the challenges faced by the hemisphere's countries," as well as an "important chance to strengthen inter-American dialogue and cooperation." Considering that the United States must make consultations and hold several preparatory meetings before the summit, the OAS has offered to operate as the "main political forum for dialogue" and to coordinate the meetings and prepare an agenda. About the matters on which the countries of the Americas reached an agreement during the consultations on the summit, Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga said there is consensus in three main areas: the strengthening of democracy; the areas of commerce, investment, and integration; and sustained development without environmental deterioration. Bolivia hopes the presidents will "engage in an effective dialogue and prepare a true working agenda in which hemispheric integration -- which is nothing but extending NAFTA to all countries of the Americas -- will become something real," Aranibar emphasized.
