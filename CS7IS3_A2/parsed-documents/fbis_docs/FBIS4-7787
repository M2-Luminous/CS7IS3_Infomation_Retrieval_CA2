RSK Foreign Minister Slobodan Jarcevic and Parliamentary Foreign Policy Committee Chairman Lazar Macura have said that their statements made to WASHINGTON POST's journalist John Pomfrit were "rephrased to suit the Croatian or possibly American view of things," and that "vital parts were omitted, ones which reflect the realistic positions of Serb politicians," the RSK news agency ISKRA said on Tuesday. The U.S. daily said in an article in connection with the effectuation of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities between the RSK and Croatia on April 4 that the RSK was showing growing readiness, in exchange for broad autonomy, to agree to live together with Croats and be under Zagreb's sovereignty. However, the RSK maintains that the ceasefire agreement in no way prejudices a political solution to the problem. ISKRA quoted Jarcevic as saying that he had stated to THE WASHINGTON POST journalist that he would resign his post in the RSK government if the incredible was to happen and the Serb state was to agree to negotiate on autonomy, a federation or confederation with Croatia. THE WASHINGTON POST, however, interpreted Jarcevic as allegedly saying that he would be the first to return to Belgrade if the RSK was to lose its independence. Macura, who stated that Krajina could be part of Croatia only if the big powers were to make Croatia be part of a new Yugoslavia and if Krajina was to have political autonomy in the new state, was interpreted in THE WASHINGTON POST as allegedly saying that the Krajina Serbs could live as citizens of Croatia if Croatia was to guarantee them equal rights. The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the then Yugoslav Federation and the attempts of Croatian authorities to deny the Serbs the status of a constituent people and reduce them to a national minority. In mid-March this year, after three years of war and Croatia's four attempts to impose its authority in the RSK by means of force, the two sides signed an agreement on the cessation of hostilities.
