FR940202-0-00046 FR940202-0-00006 (ii) Method of accounting for interest on contracts subject to section 483. Any stated or unstated interest on a contract subject to section 483 is taken into account by a taxpayer under the taxpayer's regular method of accounting (e.g., an accrual method or the cash receipts and disbursements method). See §§1.446&hyph;1, 1.451&hyph;1, and 1.461&hyph;1. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of interest (including unstated interest) allocable to a payment under a contract to which section 483 applies is determined under §1.446&hyph;2(e). (b) Definitions _(1) Deferred payments. For purposes of the regulations under section 483, a deferred payment means any payment that constitutes all or a part of the sales price (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), and that is due more than 6 months after the date of the sale or exchange. Except as provided in section 483(c)(2) (relating to the treatment of a debt instrument of the purchaser), a payment may be made in the form of cash, stock or securities, or other property. (2) Sales price. For purposes of section 483, the sales price for any sale or exchange is the sum of the amount due under the contract (other than stated interest) and the amount of any liability included in the amount realized from the sale or exchange. See §1.1001&hyph;2. Thus, the sales price for any sale or exchange includes any amount of unstated interest under the contract. (c) Exceptions to and limitations on the application of section 483 _(1) In general. Sections 483(d), 1274(c)(4), and 1275(b) contain exceptions to and limitations on the application of section 483. (2) Sales price of $3,000 or less. Section 483(d)(2) applies only if it can be determined at the time of the sale or exchange that the sales price cannot exceed $3,000, regardless of whether the sales price eventually paid for the property is less than $3,000. (3) Other exceptions and limitations _(i) Certain transfers subject to section 1041. Section 483 does not apply to any transfer of property subject to section 1041 (relating to transfers of property between spouses or incident to divorce). (ii) Treatment of certain obligees. Section 483 does not apply to an obligee under a contract for the sale or exchange of personal use property (within the meaning of section 1275(b)(3)) in the hands of the obligor and that evidences a below-market loan described in section 7872(c)(1). (iii) Transactions involving certain demand loans. Section 483 does not apply to any payment under a contract that evidences a demand loan that is a below-market loan described in section 7872(c)(1). (iv) Transactions involving certain annuity contracts. Section 483 does not apply to any payment under an annuity contract described in section 1275(a)(1)(B) (relating to annuity contracts excluded from the definition of debt instrument). (v) Options. Section 483 does not apply to any payment under an option to buy or sell property. (d) Assumptions. If a debt instrument is assumed, or property is taken subject to a debt instrument, in connection with a sale or exchange of property, the debt instrument is treated for purposes of section 483 in a manner consistent with the rules of §1.1274&hyph;5.
