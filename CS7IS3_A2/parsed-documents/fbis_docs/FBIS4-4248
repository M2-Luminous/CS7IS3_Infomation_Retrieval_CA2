Nearly 30 experts in hydropower and navigation took part in the forum, sponsored by the office of the Three Gorges project of the State Council and the Ministry of Communications. Experts from the South-West Marine Transport Institute reported their latest research on the navigation channel, silting and other issues that have to be solved during the 17-year construction of the dam. The institute suggests that instead of building a temporary ship lock and a ship lift, vessels could pass through a channel during the construction. The institute has since early 1992 been doing lab research.
