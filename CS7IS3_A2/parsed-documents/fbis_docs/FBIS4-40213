Previously, the Dniester officials denounced Chisinau for jeopardizing the negotiations with Tiraspol. According to the spokesman, on 28 April, soon after the joint [Moldovan-Dniester] declaration, the Moldovan president formed a group of experts to design the draft law on a special juridical status for the Dniester region. The Dniester party did not create a similar group, as was agreed. An agreement stipulating the reparations of the two bridges across the Dniester was signed. Following this agreement, the Ministry of Transportation three weeks ago signed a contract with an Odessa company to repair the bridges. The Dniester party does not carry out its obligations, said the spokesman. He also said that a branch of the Moldovan National Bank was opened in Tiraspol and that Dniester companies are opening accounts in lei at the authorized banks. According to an agreement signed by the State Administration of Civil Aviation and the parallel Tiraspol department, actions are undertaken to satisfy the passengers. President Snegur is permanently informed of the undertakings and told the experts' group head, Nicolae Osmochescu, to inform Richard Samuel, head of the CSCE permanent mission to Moldova, and Vladlen Vasev, representative of Russian president. The presidential spokesman stated that "Mircea Snegur appreciates at its real value the document signed on 28 April and expresses once more his hope that the Dniester party will prefer to act and not merely talk in order to establish the peace and understanding unanimously longed for by the people of entire Moldova."
