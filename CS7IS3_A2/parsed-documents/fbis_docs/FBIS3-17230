This was stated in an interview with foreign journalists by Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy. He said that the document signed by the two presidents in Massandra last September is not an agreement, merely a protocol of intent. According to V. Bezkorovaynyy, this issue was studied but was rejected. Both sides have agreed to set up a commission to take an inventory of the ships and other Black Sea Fleet property with a view to dividing it up.
