You have said that the opposition has to refrain from impeding the authorities and offer the authorities an opportunity to complete the process of settling the Abkhazian problem. You have also said that a lack of hope will lead the country to destruction and that all our history has been a struggle for freedom, independence, and hope. You have also spoken of a new world order before. In the view of what has happened in Georgia recently, including Abkhazian events, how practical do you think is the hope that we shall be able to settle this problem? [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. Regarding the Abkhazian issue, I welcome the fact that our conversation deals with this topic. I should say that we have tried all options now, and all possibilities have been checked, including the military option. I envisage that we are dealing with the optimum version of a practical settlement of the issue. I would like to say once more that I mean a practical settlement rather than plans based on (?reports) and our desires. We have to talk in terms of a really practical version. I believe that the return of large streams of refugees will begin soon. The main thing is to get this process started. I think this will happen very soon. And I request everyone once again not to pose obstacles to us. The authorities -- and all of Georgia -- are entrusted with such a large and crucial mission today that we all have to be concerned that no additional difficulties are created and no additional destructive processes take place regardless of whether we agree with this path or not. Especially if a beneficial trend is evident, and I am confident that this will be the case. Proceeding from the common interest, those who do not trust us -- and there are quite understandable reasons for such people to exist -- should take at least a neutral position, at least at this stage. It will be different if we face failure. I would say that the very existence of Georgia is connected with the refugee problem. This is how we are dealing with it. I request the refugees, in the first place, not to give in to individual politicians who are guided by certain ambitions or a certain grudge, or who believe only in the efficiency of a variant they are proposing. Do not give in to those who call for an adventurous way. This may prove fatal. I am well aware of their possibilities, and I know that no one is capable of proposing a more practical version of the settlement than the existing one. This is especially so since important decisions pertaining to this issue will be taken in New York very soon. A military team, who are to plan the deployment of the peacekeeping forces, and who in fact have already planned it, have left Moscow for New York. The sequence and stages will be made clear in a week or 10 days time, and then the process will begin. We have had a constant link with New York, and, no matter what, the population will be provided with complete information. The return of Abkhazia and the return to Abkhazia depends of course on our joining the CIS, on engaging in new relations with Russia, and these were purposeful and considered steps. This also depends on our good relations with all states of the world, including the permanent members of the UN Security Council. These are the United States, England, France, our friend the Federal Republic of Germany, and other countries that have been supporting us. All this depends on close cooperation within the UN framework. And this is a sign of the new order I have talked about. All I said does not have anything to do with playing a double game. Some people have fixed ideas, and they believe that the only truth is what they think. Is it a double game to begin establishing good relations with Russia, Ukraine, and other neighboring countries and maintain good relations with the West at the same time when they grant assistance in order to relieve our major pain? [Oniani] Two parties walked out of the council session last week: the Republican Party and Merab Kostava Society. You also did not attend Supreme Council sessions last week. Can we interpret this as your boycotting the Supreme Council? [Shevardnadze] And do you think that we had a preliminary agreement? [both laugh] I can honestly say that walking out of the Supreme Council is a very regrettable event by itself, regardless of what group or what person does it. Those elected by the people shall leave the council by the permission of the people. Whatever the suffering and difficulties connected with sitting there, one must be able to manage it. As for my occasional absence from council sessions, this is caused by urgent affairs, and I am sometimes forced to resort to this sort of protest. I mean not to attend the council sessions especially when I know that it means involvement in aimless debates. There have been demands that the post of head of state should be abolished, but, since we have already mentioned this topic, I would say that I cannot imagine how we could survive without this post at the present stage. Thus, no matter what we want, we have to adapt to reality. We have to listen less to those who are not in the know. For some of them, the worse the better. Therefore, at the present stage, I reiterate, it is fully justified to combine the posts of head of state and chairman of the Supreme Council. I am convinced of this by my own experience. And if I sometimes cannot be seen in the Supreme Council, this should by no means be regarded as disregard or disrespect toward the council. God forbid. [Oniani] Georgia will be celebrating the 75th anniversary of Tbilisi State University next week from 23 to 25 May. This is an important occasion for our country. It was a deplorable state of affairs in our science that you spoke about during your meeting with the known financier and philanthropist George Soros. How can the establishment of an independent, international, social organization -- Georgia Open Social Foundation -- help manage these processes? [Shevardnadze] I believe that yesterday was a very important day. Especially because it was close to the university celebrations. The Soros Foundation is a very important and serious international creation, and Mr. Soros himself is an unbelievably interesting and very fruitful -- if you will, or rather, efficient -- figure in the world. He has been doing great things. [passage omitted] The foundation has already done significant things for Georgia. It is probably not a very large number, but 200 to 250 scientists have been practically cooperating with the foundation. Many of them have received grants from the foundations, and others are nominated to receive them. Some young people are getting an education under the sponsorship of the foundation in various countries. However, since yesterday, since the opening of the center of the foundation and its branch in Tbilisi, the activities will acquire a more purposeful and planned character. [passage omitted] George Soros has an incredibly rich experience and a very well ordered brain, if you will. I think some models we discussed yesterday may be useful for us in order to overcome the crisis even faster. We have reached very interesting ideas. His recommendations are very original, and Georgia may even become a basis for certain experimentation. I do not want to exaggerate the significance of this conversation, but I would say that it was a useful conversation from the conceptual point of view. I have told him what the Georgian authorities are intending to do regarding the coupon, the national currency, and privatization. I have been thinking long about the process of privatization. We have to deal with privatization of not only land but also industry, construction, and trade, and I do not rule out that my edict pertaining to this process -- to speeding up the process -- will be issued very soon. [passage omitted] [Oniani] Batono Eduard, the 26 May celebrations [Georgian Independence Day] are coming this week. Notwithstanding various contradictions and differences in the approach to this issue, Georgia will be celebrating. Something is said to be prepared for this day. Those who we often mention as certain forces, because names of many of them are well known to the official bodies who have to know, intend to do something, are preparing more disturbances. How well is the population of the city secured from this sort of a surprise, if you will? [Shevardnadze] The 26 May holiday is a day of statehood. We are heading in this direction, although at a speed slower than desired. Opponents can say that there is no state, that the state has disintegrated, and so on. This was the case two or three years ago. The times were very hard. But now, the state is being formed. [passage omitted] Party differences and contradictions should not blind us. I do not think that any party will attempt to torment the population on this day. You said that there are rumors about some disturbances. I am not sure what reports we have, but I do believe no one should attempt to create new sources of instability in the capital city on this day. All sound people have to this rule out. On the contrary, everyone has to try to secure a demonstration of our unity and integrity at least on this day. [passage omitted] Speaking of rumors about some disturbances, I think everyone will have sufficient prudence and sense of responsibility not to repeat past errors. I want to reiterate that Georgia's Independence Day and the university anniversary, which has been planned to coincide with Independence Day -- and was therefore shifted -- deserve being celebrated by all of us together so that we all together demonstrate readiness to serve our country, our state.
