In order to protect the interests of the investors and provide for normal functioning of the securities market, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation suggests that all citizens involved follow the following recommendations when buying and selling securities. 1. First of all, gather as much information as possible about who is issuing the securities you have decided to acquire (that is, the issuer). If the issuer is a bank or a credit institution, find out how many years it has been functioning, what its authorized capital is, and the kinds of banking operations for which it is licensed. 2. Make sure that the securities have been through state registration and attentively study the prospectus for the issuance of securities registered by the financial organs. 3. Never trust advertising statements. A decision to invest money in securities may be made only on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the prospectus for the issuance of securities, bookkeeping reports, the nature of the activity of the issuer, and the overall conditions of the market in which the given issuer is operating. 4. When completing transactions with securities use only the services of professional participants in the securities market (investment institutions with the appropriate licenses). 5. Make certain that the seller is the owner of the securities or an employee of the owner of the securities. If the seller of the security is acting on instructions from the owner of the securities (on the basis of a commission agreement or instructions agreement) he must be a worker of the investment institution and have a qualifications certificate of the first category (that is, it is necessary to demand a Xerox copy of the license for the right to conduct activity as an investment institution and a Xerox copy of the qualification certificate of the first category). 6. It is recommended that the transaction for purchase and sales of securities be documented in the form of a written contract which must specify: the procedure for settlements in the transaction, the procedure for entering the new owner in the stockholder's register, the procedure for paying the tax on the operation involving securities, etc. 7. Register the transaction in an investment institution, a bank, or with the issuer whose securities you are buying. 8. As practice shows, at the present time the most risky things are to invest money in bills of exchange and to grant loans through concluding loan contracts. Issuing bills of exchange and concluding loan contracts do not require either state registration or the acquisition of any kind of special permission (license), and this is why these financial instruments are used most frequently by unscrupulous entrepreneurs in order to deceive the population. Here neither the issuer of the note nor the borrower under the loan contract, as a rule, reveals any information about his financial position or the nature of his activity. Remember that when concluding a loan agreement you are entering into civil-legal relations with the borrower and in the event of a conflict you may defend your interests only through the courts. The specific nature of the bill of exchange is such that the absence of even one of the mandatory requisites makes it invalid. If you decide to purchase bills of exchange you should know that the most reliable ones are bills from large banks and banking syndicates. 9. Remember that investing funds in nonstate securities practically always involves a risk. The fact that the securities you buy have been registered by the state is no guarantee of a return on the money you have invested or of the reliability or profitability of these securities. The main axiom for investment activity in the securities market is that the greater the profitability of the securities, the greater the risk. 10. Do not give in to the general tendencies to invest your money for interest that exceeds the average market interest many times over. Remember that the founders of a joint-stock company are responsible to the other stockholders only within the limits of their personal contribution to the authorized capital. Investments in joint-stock companies with small amounts of authorized capital that have declared issuances thousands of times greater than their authorized capital are extremely risky.
