In an interview, Fadlallah said that when Rabin visits the Vatican and is warmly received, we want to ask: Is the Vatican a West European country like the others or a Christian mission? Is it operating in its capacity as the Church, guided by its Christian values, or as a state operating according to international balances? [passage omitted] His eminence continued: The Vatican always spoke of internationalizing Jerusalem first and the holy shrines second. It also spoke of the freedom of religion and even regarded Jerusalem as its very own cause. This time the pope did not discuss Jerusalem with Rabin, as Rabin said. The Vatican did not deny Rabin's story. Fadlallah asked: If the pope did not discuss Jerusalem with Rabin or the need to protect unarmed Palestinians by sending in international forces and if Rabin did not ask him to mediate in the negotiations, what was the visit about? The affair then represents an indulgence for the Jews and a new recognition that gives "Israel" new moral strength to add to the strength it already has. [passage omitted] He continued: We want Christianity and Islam to be value systems that defend the wronged and oppose the arrogant regardless of the consequences. When calculations enter the issue, value is lost. If value is lost, what is left of the meaning of Islam and Christianity? This is not a position against Christianity and Christians. It does not deal with the pope's planned visit to Lebanon. We do not oppose the visit. We welcome some of its aspects. Undermining causes is a different issue. It is not an issue of a papal envoy sent to Tunis. A papal envoy should be sent to all those who lost their fathers or children in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, because it is these people who can utter the word of truth and ask: What is the meaning of the Jews' existence in Palestine?
