As a communist, he realized his faith through his actions. Just as he wrote in a "self-appraisal": "The fact that I am appointed director of a shipyard with 10,000 workers and staffers proves the party's trust in me and only by working hard, heart and soul, will it be possible for me to live up to the party's expectations." I. In the summer of 1985, Chen Wensong was promoted from deputy chief engineer to deputy director in charge of operations and soon after that he was appointed deputy director in charge of routine affairs. At that time, the enterprise had contracted debts of over 100 million yuan because of a foreign businessman's bankruptcy which caused him to cancel an order for a vessel the yard was building and there were few domestic orders for vessels for civilian. With production tasks inside the shipyard basically canceled the enterprise had landed in an operations "trough." At a meeting of the shipyard's decisionmaking team, Chen Wensong stated: "We should compete in the world market!" Unfortunately, the wave of shipowners going bankrupt affected half the shipyards in the world, and Dalian Shipyard had no scope to exercise its ability in opening the world market. Nevertheless, a strange phenomenon surfaced: Many foreign shipowners visited Dalian Shipyard making inquiries about prices and placing orders for vessels; in 1986 alone, the management received some 230 foreign visitors in that category. Some people in the shipyard could no longer maintain their calm and were in favor of accepting the shipbuilding orders. At a meeting of the shipyard leading body, Chen Wensong soberly analyzed the prices offered by those foreign shipowners as well as shipbuilding trends and cost, then flatly said: "No! We cannot accept these orders! This strange phenomenon is actually a trick being played by some speculators to take advantage of the recession in the world shipbuilding industry by suppressing prices to speculate in vessels. Should we accept a large number of shipbuilding orders, that would be like drinking poison to quench a thirst." Chen Wensong's proposal was accepted. The shipyard decided: Shipbuilding activities should be temporarily axed and ship repair services and nonshipbuilding activities expanded, while waiting for opportunities to accept shipbuilding orders. Through two years of hard struggles the shipyard's output value for ship repair services soared, ranking top in the trade across China; its diversified operations entered the large equipment arena in the petrol chemical, metallurgical, and energy resource industries, with such pillar products as large steel structural parts such as boilers and steel-making converters taking shape. In 1985, the most difficult year for the enterprise, Dalian Shipyard still made a profit of 780,000 yuan and, in 1986, the profit was 14 million yuan. In 1988, there was a turn for the better in the world vessel market; for many shipyards it was like enjoying a great rainfall after a long drought, while accepting shipbuilding orders for export in batches. Through a detailed and meticulous market survey, Chen Wensong believed that the trend for vessel prices to go up would continue; prices for equipment and raw materials would continue to climb; and the time for accepting shipbuilding orders in batches was just not mature. Soon, vessel prices on the world vessel market rose by a wide margin. At this point, Chen Wensong made a suggestion to the shipyard leading body: "Seize the opportunity, accept shipbuilding orders as quickly as possible and go all out to expand the proportion of shipbuilding." Soon, the shipyard signed contracts to build two vessels for export, one with a tonnage of 75,000 and the other 45,000, with an export transaction volume of $118 million. In 1991, when the Gulf war came to an end, the prospects for the world ocean shipping business industry remained hazy and many shipyards were wavering and waiting to see. By that time, Chen Wensong had already been promoted to shipyard director; he had long been sending men to find out about the market conditions and came to the conclusion that a thriving situation in the world ocean shipping business was at hand. He took the lead in signing a contract to build a 60,000-ton oil tanker for the domestic market, creating a record in vessel prices on the home market; he was commended by the All-China Shipbuilding Industry General Company for the good beginning he had achieved for shipbuilding at home. After that, Director Chen seized the opportunity of the further rise in prices on the shipbuilding market and accepted a series of shipbuilding contracts for seven vessels with a total tonnage of 340,000, thus the shipyard's order books were full until 1994. The success of Chen Wensong and leading members of other factories in the shipyard in their decisionmaking brought vitality to the enterprise. Chen Wensong believed that to have a place in the world shipbuilding market, it was imperative to accelerate the process of the enterprise entering the world advanced ranks in shipbuilding. This 1965 straight-A graduate from Shanghai Jiaotong University, specializing in shipbuilding electrical engineering, had a solid theoretical foundation and a very high managerial level. He had command of three foreign languages and paid attention to studying science, technology, advanced managerial experiences of capitalist countries; had mastery of vessel design, manufacturing, and the financial affairs of a large shipyard and also the knowledge and skill to conduct talks about commerce and trade; and had gradually become an expert in shipbuilding electrical engineering, vessel design as well as a fine entrepreneur running a modern shipyard, who was renowned at home and abroad. Today, the international shipbuilding industry is rapidly advancing toward the large and high-grade direction. Chen Wensong led the enterprise in keeping track of modern shipbuilding technology, making proposals and participating in the implementation of some important technological transformation projects. In the past, the No.3 dock in the old area could only manufacture vessel up to a tonnage of 30,000; through transforming the dock, production, and installing cranes weighing 1,600 tons, it was able to turn out large vessels with tonnages of up to 80,000. Chen Wensong's efforts can be seen in the completion and perfection of the production capability of the shipyard's new area with the building of a dock with a tonnage capacity of 100,000; with the importation and installation of a crane with a capacity of 580 tonnes, the largest of its kind in China and with the building of another shipbuilding dock with a tonnage capacity of 200,000 still under construction. Chen Wensong worked hard in arduous exploration to shorten the shipbuilding period. When building the No. 3 vessel with a tonnage of 35,000, he persisted in keeping track of the production department's monthly plan and the workshop schedules, promptly harmonizing and resolving problems surfacing in production. As a result, the production period was 214 days shorter than that of the No. 2 vessel of the same type; the period of being anchored at the dock's berth was 103 days shorter than No.2 vessel; the date of delivering the vessel was 5 months and 21 days ahead of the contracted date; and five vessels in the same batch were all delivered ahead of schedule, with the realization of the operational goal of turning out two additional vessels within a year. II. In the summer of 1990, the relevant state department decided that Dalian Shipyard should be split into two, with the establishment of a new enterprise--Dalian New shipyard. When the old shipyard was split, a number of technological backbone and important equipment was also transferred along with some workshops and land. The enterprise faced great difficulties in production and sentiments of fearing difficulties surfaced among workers and staffers in the old shipyard. It was true that the pressure on Director Chen's shoulder was greater than on anybody else. However, he had a staunch party spirit, a concept of the overall situation, and felt quite at ease. At an assembly for cadres of the whole shipyard, he mobilized them, saying: "In viewing a matter, we must proceed from the overall situation of the country. Cadres who are party members should pay attention to party spirit and show consideration for the overall situation. What we should do today is to create conditions and formulate measures to do a better job of building the old shipyard. At the same time, we should support the new shipyard in carrying out large-scale production as soon as possible. Soon, the old shipyard set out the production strategy of "renting land outside the shipyard, while tapping the potential inside the shipyard." In addition, it formulated the blueprint for construction characterized by "a three-step process to revitalize the old shipyard." They transferred 60 percent of movable fittings to enterprises in townships and towns for production, thus resolving the shortage of workshops and space in the shipyard. With the founding of the new application workshop, electronic computer center, and shipbuilding research center, solutions were found, in turn, to the shortages of equipment, technological forces, and scientific research organizations. In the wake of the split, Chen Wensong paid special attention to the matter of style to do a good job of handling relations with fraternal shipyards. In July 1991, a crack appeared in the outer casing of a diesel engine on a vessel for export; the diesel engine manufacturing plant sought help from the shipyard to repair it. Chen Wensong immediately ordered the relevant leading members to send the shipyard's best welders to take charge of it without setting out any condition. In addition, the overtime differentials and bonuses for the welders in question were all taken care of by the shipyard itself. After 20 days of hard work, the shipyard workers fulfilled the task and the engine was repaired; consequently the good reputation of China shipbuilding products was maintained. Dalian Shipyard has always possessed the fine tradition of party-government solidarity. After Chen Wensong took over the director's office, he placed very strict requirements on himself in every aspect and at all times. In a 1992 Director's Work Summary, he wrote: "The solidarity between the leading members of the party committee, the administration, and the workers' trades unions is the prerequisite for the healthy development of the shipyard's situation, with its work continuously improving. In our shipyard, the chief responsible persons of the party committee and the committee, administration, and workers' trades unions are able to unite as one." At the routine meeting for the shipyard directors, over which Chen Wensong presided, he always invited the participation of the leading members of the party committee and the workers' trades unions to jointly discuss the shipyard's major affairs. Chen Wensong had been chief architect, chief supervisor in manufacturing, team leader for vessel delivery, and chief overseer on site, with many of the vessels being awarded national gold or silver prizes. Some of his theses on building modern berths and dockyards, as well as new shipbuilding technology, attracted the attention of ocean shipping and academic circles as well as top-echelon state leadership. Time and again he provided opportunities for others to be assessed for senior professional titles. However, the title of "national-level middle-aged and young expert with conspicuous contributions" was specially approved for him by the relevant state department, on the report submitted by the shipyard and city leadership without his knowledge when he was on his death bed. Chen Wensong's home was very simple, displaying no high-grade furniture or electric home appliances. Aside from a color TV set, there was no camera, recorder, audio or video recorder. Nevertheless, he left a very precious spiritual wealth. Chen Wensong was a famous "Three-Seven cadre"; he started work at 0700, called it a day at 1900 and, for many years, he would accept only a monthly seven-yuan bonus. With the exception of occasions involving foreign affairs, Chen Wensong was always in his overalls and safety hat, placing himself among the workers. He persisted in the shipyard's system of cadres participating in manual labor; when he was a workshop cadre, his record of manual labor exceeded 100 days each year; when he became an office cadre, his record of manual labor exceeded 25 days a year; and when he become a cadre at factory-level, his record of manual labor was not less than 20 days. All the waiters at the Beijing China Shipbuilding Industry General Company guest house knew that Director Chen was the "most important guest" with the least requirements; he would never pick a better room so long as there was a bed for him to sleep on. Once, Chen Wensong went to Guangzhou for talks and the shipowner made arrangements for him to stay at the White Swan Hotel; however, he would not stay there but was bent on booking into a small hotel and "a room for three" at that. With tears in his eyes, Wang Anguo, the shipyard operational department head, recalled: "On that occasion, the shipyard accepted an order worth 100 million yuan but Director Chen would not think of the expense of a hotel single room!" In recent years, the shipyard authorities built a number of residential buildings for staffers and workers, while providing a thousand or so households with gas tanks. Wang Xuejin, an electrical workshop worker said: "I have two children, one big boy and one big girl, and our living quarters seemed a bit crowded; somehow Director Chen heard about our situation and allotted me a large three-bedroom unit. Only recently I found out that Director Chen had a big boy and a big girl, too, in addition to his two old parents; however, his housing conditions were poorer than mine, a common worker." III. An extraordinarily big storm attacked the Liaodong Peninsula. At around 2000 on 1 September 1992, Chen Wensong had just completed his report to the relevant leading member of the Ministry of Personnel and returned home. He got a telephone call from the shipyard saying that water had flooded No. 207 warehouse in the Xianglujiao new area. Director Chen waded in the flooded warehouse, carrying sand bags to block the water while directing people and trucks to hurriedly move equipment and raw materials away. At this particular moment, he felt pains in his chest and trembled all over; beads of sweat ran down his brow and face. At dawn, the rush to deal with the emergency was over. Director Chen drove his car straight from the No. 207 warehouse to the shipyard area to inspect every berth, warehouse, and workshop along the waterfront that stretched 10 li. In the storm he strove, together with the workers and staffers accompanying him, giving orders while pushing a "great crane" that had been swept away by the waves to a safe zone. When the sun rose, he went to the office and began a new day's work Back in early April 1992, Chen Wensong felt a dull pain in the left side of his abdomen. He went to the hospital for a checkup and it was found that there was a lump, 2 by 2.8 mm, between his liver and stomach. The doctor suggested an operation for further examination. At that time, Luo Yumin, deputy director and concurrently the shipyard's chief engineer was hospitalized for emergency treatment of metastasis cancer; on the eve of "1 May," a vessel was to be launched and another was to be delivered so Director Chen was really too busy! Thus, the checkup was put off. By July, he often felt dizzy, thus he asked a doctor from the factory hospital to give him an infusion [shu ye 6551 3210]. He persisted in his work. It was a holiday on 15 July. Engineer Liu Shande, the shipyard technology section chief was looking for Director Chen for a chat. He could not find him anywhere around his residence and, in the end, he went to the director's office and found the director reading documents while having his infusion. By 3 September, his case had actually grown very serious but Chen Wensong had already been working almost continuously for 48 hours. This tough guy eventually collapsed. The related state department, and the provincial as well as city leadership gave instructions to do everything possible to save Chen Wensong's life. However, the experts and professors who made the diagnosis report on Director Chen's case were shocked: The lump which had not been properly defined in the past had now developed into a rare case of choriocarcinoma and had expanded to such internal organs as the stomach, liver, and lungs. On his deathbed, Chen Wensong expressed a communist's sentiments to the party organization: "My thanks to the party and government leadership at various levels for their concern for me during this period. Should the treatment fail, I will have no complaints whatsoever. I will leave everything to do with my family to the organization's arrangements; I personally require nothing. I hope that everyone will do a good job from now on; the leading body should unite as one to do a good job of the shipyard. I have not done enough work at the shipyard, and I want very much to go on working...."
