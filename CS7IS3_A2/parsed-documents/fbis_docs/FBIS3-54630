Lamba met the Pakistani foreign secretary the other day and presented six proposals to lessen the existing tension between Pakistan and India. The proposals were related to matters like Siachen glacier, the Line of Control [LOC] in Kashmir, Sir Creek, delimitation of the maritime boundary, reactivation of the camps formed by the joint commission in 1988, and steps to create a parity [between the two countries] in the peaceful nuclear program. The Pakistani authorities have not yet examined the proposals in detail. However, expressing an initial reaction, the Foreign Office has said there is nothing in the Indian proposals which can boost Pakistan's hope for a solution of the issues, adding that these are nonpapers. Diplomatic sources say that indications are that India will consider reducing its forces along the LOC if Pakistan agrees to these proposals and starts implementing them. It will, in fact, not solve any problem. It had been India's fashion from the very beginning to emphasize talks on secondary subjects instead of the main issues. But if the primary and basic issues are resolved, then it will automatically lead to the resolution of secondary issues as well. The whole world knows that the main dispute between Pakistan and India is the sole issue of Kashmir. But India persistently avoids any concrete and positive talks to resolve it. The first time Kashmir was acknowledged as an issue was at the recent foreign secretary-level talks between the two countries in Islamabad. However, no progress toward a solution of the issue could be made due to India's arrogance. And now, in the current proposals, India totally omitted the Kashmir issue. Since the prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, declared that only purposeful talks will be held with India, holding talks on secondary issues instead of the real ones will only be a waste of time. Hence, the rejection of the proposals is a correct decision.
