The Declaration on the Current Situation approved by the expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the SKNDF Central Committee follows: The political situation of the new year demands that we wage a definitive struggle [chong kyolsan] against the Kim Yong-sam civilian regime. The Kim Yong-sam regime, which was launched by publicizing its civilian status in the womb of the Sixth Republic, loudly beat the drum of change and reform during its 10 months of power. The result is only the sediment of military dictatorship and the regime has done nothing for the people. Our people cried out calling for genuine democratization, but the Kim Yong-sam ring blocked the road to genuine democratization by false democratic reform and built a civilian fascist dictatorship more vicious and crafty than the military fascist dictatorship. His political reform resulted in the revival of the notorious National Security Law and the Agency for National Security Planning and the lengthening of the billy club used for the repression of demonstrations from 71 centimeters to 105 centimeters. Business conglomerates were given special favors for investment and the working masses were forced to face a new nightmare of sharing pain in his political reform. At the same time, the drama of state fraud and four unconstitutional cases, used to judge social reform, were sealed off unrectified and the main culprits have begun to reappear. Our people have waged a bloody struggle for independence, but the Kim Yong-sam ring, in an attempt to shore up its fragile power, sold our people's national sovereignty and interests to outside forces. There has been no ruler in South Korea who did not engage in treachery, but no ruler has ever dared to sell out the rice market -- the people's flesh and blood. The Kim Yong-sam gang began to bargain over the opening of the rice market as early as when he contended for power as a presidential candidate, and sold it out completely as a card to check the North-proposed package solution to the nuclear problem. There has been no ruler in South Korea who did not serve as a stooge for the United States, but there has never been a stooge like Kim Yong-sam, who asked the U.S. forces in South Korea to remain continuously and left all human and material resources in U.S. hands as strategic supplies in return for his role as a shock brigade to implement the U.S. concept of a new Pacific community. As the five bandits of Ulsa in 1905 sold out the country to the Japanese imperialists and as traitors Pak Chong-hui and Kim Chong- pil signed the treacherous South Korea-Japan agreement in exchange for the property claim of $300 million, the Kim Yong-sam gang today is opening wide the door for reinvasion of the Japanese reactionaries, who are attempting to ignore the claim for the liquidation of the past wrongs they committed during the Japanese imperialist colonial rule and for the wrongs they committed against the Korean women forced to prostitute for the Japanese Army, and who are attempting to come to the fore as a military power and a nuclear power. All the fellow countrymen have been ardently wishing to realize reunification in the nineties, but the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique is leading North-South relations to a state of extreme confrontation under the pretext of the nuclear issue, thus driving the nation toward the calamity of nuclear war. Because of the Kim Yong-sam clique's treacherous act, the door for dialogue and exchange, which was open even under the Sixth Republic's military dictatorship, is completely closed under the civilian regime, the North-South agreement is nothing but mere paper, North-South relations are totally frozen, and dark clouds of a nuclear war are looming over the nation. As traitor Syngman Rhee started the Korean war with the U.S. imperialists' backing yesterday, so traitor Kim Yong-sam is instigating a nuclear war with the backing of nuclear powers today. The Kim Yong-sam ring, seeking stability in its ruling system, is blocking and obliterating our masses' movement of change for independence, democracy, and reunification. The Kim Yong-sam regime even enforces the right of emergency coordination [kingup chojongkwon] and the right of forced dispersion [kangje haesankwon] with its new public security-dominated rule far worse than the Sixth Republic's public security-dominated rule in order to turn the movement of various strata into ruins. At the same time, it is employing all sorts of tactics to discolor the change-aspiring mass movement into a citizen's reformist movement. Because of the birth of the Kim Yong-sam government, South Korea is not heading for independence, democracy, and reunification, but for a hell of fascism, subjugation, and nuclear disaster under an illusion of a civilian government. It is our people's general view that the traitorous Kim Yong-sam government must not be forgiven any more. Along with all people who aspire for independence, democracy, and reunification, the SKNDF announces its resolute separation from the Kim Yong-sam government and solemnly declares that it will overthrow it. 1. We must overthrow the fake civilian government and establish a real, independent, and democratic government. The Kim Yong-sam government is the traitorous group that is poisoning democracy and is bringing a fire of nuclear war to the country with outside forces after creeping into Chongwadae [presidential office] under the cloak of a civilian government. Our people cannot introduce the cause for independence, democracy, and reunification -- which is written in blood -- into the illusion of the civilian government. All strata of the patriotic masses, who want to live for independence and democracy, must bravely struggle to overthrow the fake civilian government, which is fascist-oriented, and to establish a real, independent, and democratic government. 2. We must earnestly carry out the movement for independence, democracy, and reunification. Kim Yong-sam government's reform is fake and is aimed at maintaining the stabilization of a ruling system. The real reform lies in achieving independence, democracy, and reunification. Earnestly accelerating the movement for independence, democracy, and reunification in a proper manner is a solemn order of the times and a historic mission. The masses from all walks of life must make the popular-oriented struggle, which started as a result of the struggle against the rice market opening, become the movement for independence, democracy, and reunification. Reality is not a situation for compromise, but rather a situation for struggle. All change movement organizations must not be involved in a dirty reformist trend, but instead they must make the masses become conscious through struggle; organize them through struggle; and create a vitality for the new leap of the reform movement. Let us more clearly uphold the chuche banner of reform by driving out the wind of reformism. The anti-U.S. struggle is a basis of the national and democratic movement. Without the anti-U.S. struggle, we cannot expect independence, democratization, national peace, and reunification. Let us terminate the colonial fascist rule by waging a nationwide anti-U.S. struggle to expel [chubang] the United States and establish national sovereignty. 3. We must make all patriotic democratic forces unite as one. Chongwadae is now plotting to disperse our patriotic democratic forces from within and to obliterate them by isolating them from the masses. The present situation requires the patriotic democratic forces to unite unconditionally as one. Let us unite over and over again. The change movement of our masses -- which has inherited the vigor spirit of our nation by experiencing the 19 April uprising, the May Kwangju popular uprising, and the June democratic uprising -- will adhere to the chuche banner of change to the end and move forward until the day we remove colonial rule, the fascist dictatorship, and the national division from this land and when we achieve independence, democracy, and reunification. Destruction will be brought to the traitorous persons who aspire subjugation, fascism, and separation. The victory is our masses, who fight for independence, democracy, and reunification. Hurrah for independence, democracy, and reunification! The following are the Immediate Fighting Slogans, adopted at the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the SKNDF Central Committee. Overthrowing the Kim Yong-sam traitorous regime and opening a road toward independence, democracy, and reunification today is the will of the popular masses and the call of national history. At the call of the situation and the will of the popular masses, the SKNDF Central Committee releases the Immediate Fighting Slogans.

These were the Declaration on the Current Situation and the Immediate Fighting Slogans, which were adopted at an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the SKNDF Central Committee.
