FBIS4-54169 "dreas102_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-102 Daily Report 26 May 1994 North Korea ROK `Battleships' Reportedly Infiltrate DPRK ROK `Battleships' Reportedly Infiltrate DPRK SK2605043194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0300 GMT 26 May 94 SK2605043194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0300 GMT 26 May 94 Korean BFN [Text] The South Korean puppets perpetrated a grave military provocation by illegally infiltrating a group of battleships deep into the territorial waters off our side's west coast on 25 May. At around 1633 [0733 GMT] on 25 May, three battleships of the puppet army based in Taechong Island went into battle formation and deeply infiltrated into our side of the territorial waters south of Ochajin-ri, Yongyon county, South Hwanghae Province, to openly kidnap our peaceful fishing ships in broad daylight. The Korean People's Army Naval patrol boat which was vigilantly defending the sea posts of the socialist fatherland went into emergency mobilization on the spot and the rascals rapidly fled towards the South. The South Korean puppets' reckless act of infiltrating into the sea is stimulating North-South confrontation. This is also an intentional and planned provocative maneuver to drive the Korean peninsula toward an intense and aggravated situation. This act of military provocation was committed at a time when the South Korean puppets are finding fault with our nonexistent nuclear issue, conspiring with outside forces to drag in up-to-date murderous equipment on a large scale into South Korea, and leading the situation to a dangerous stage by accelerating the increase of forces in the Military Demarcation Line area of the DMZ. Therefore, we cannot but all the more regard this as a severe situation. If the South Korean puppets ignore the consistent desire of the Korean people and the world's peace-loving people who want peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula and continue to move toward the road of war and confrontation, the provokers will not be able to escape from receiving a resolute punishment.
