This is, inter alia, because it will thereby gain the possibility of recovering the sizable sums which Baghdad owes our country. This statement, disseminated by foreign news agencies, was made by a Russian diplomat who remained anonymous. The statement seemed an absolute sensation because it marked a change in Russia's stand with regard to Iraq. On Friday the Security Council is to discuss the problem of sanctions in the presence of Iraq's representatives. One of the leaders of the Near East and North Africa Department has told IZVESTIYA that Russia intends to insist that Iraq be given some reassuring signal so as to encourage Baghdad, which is being seen to make obvious progress in its position on arms control and the abandonment of programs for the creation of weapons of mass destruction. This viewpoint of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is at variance with the present position of the Americans and the British. They see no signs that Iraq has merited any encouragement. At the same time a number of Security Council members, such as France, China, and Brazil, will obviously voice solidarity with Russia. It is maintained on Smolenskaya Ploshchad that Russian diplomacy's present position does not signify a cardinal shift in its policy on Iraq. Russia has always held its own viewpoint on the events occurring in this region. In addition, recognition of the progress which Baghdad has made in the disarmament sphere does not signify the immediate lifting of sanctions. Russia will act in accordance with UN decisions. At present 547 tonnes of crude uranium and 50 kg of enriched uranium, which that country possessed, have been removed from Iraq. But R. Ekeus, leader of the UN Commission for the Destruction of Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction, insists that it will be possible to speak of lifting sanctions only after six months of careful monitoring of Iraqi military installations. Meanwhile, the actual mechanism of such monitoring has not yet been worked out. Baghdad insistently demands the lifting of sanctions, citing the fact that keeping them threatens the lives of 400,000 people. Western countries, however, doubt the sincerity of Saddam Husayn's government. The Iraqi authorities are refusing to accept the Security Council's offer to sell oil under UN control, although we could be talking of a sum of $1.6 billion which would be used for humanitarian purposes. Russia's new position could tie still more tightly this whole unusually tangled mass of problems started by the Iraqi troops' invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
