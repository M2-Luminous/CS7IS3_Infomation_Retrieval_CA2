Hajy Faiz, prorector of the Higher Spiritual Medrese under the Spiritual Administration of Transcaucasian Muslims, Meshedi Behruz, a teacher at the medrese, Hajy Jebrail, chairman of the Farmers' Union, and his deputy Hajy Nazim, Hajy Osman Efendiyev, chairman of the National Enlightenment Party and docent Philosophy Department at the Economics Institute, Tariyel Hesenov, a colleague in the humanitarian policy department of the Office of the President and Professor of Theology at Baku State University, Etibar Talybly, chairman of the university rayon department of the APF [Azerbaijan People's Front], Arif Aliyev, deputy chairman of the APF, Meshedi Arif, member of the Presidium of the APF, and others took part in the meeting. The orientalist and translator of the Koran into Azeri, Neriman Gasymzade, chaired the meeting. During the discussion the return to the Koran, Islam and tradition, remnants of idolatry in Islam, religious education and problems of religion and policy were discussed. It was noted that the concept of "there is no God but God" is the major source of human freedom. In the Islamic concept, freedom has three supports: glasnost, equality and solidarity. Religious functionaries explained their positions by saying "essentially, there is freedom in Islam, but scholars must absolutely reveal it." The scholars discussed the damage done to society by religious illiteracy, what the fragmentation of Islam means to fragmentation of the nation, and the traces of idolatry in Islam, and noted that one could consider the effort to iconize certain political leaders even today as a manifestation of this idolatry in modern times. The party representatives gave more stress to the subject of religion and politics. It was noted that the politicization of Islam primarily damaged the religion itself. Religious believers can implement their needs and demands through politicians without interfering in politics themselves. Politicians must create conditions for propagandizing religion on a healthy basis and guarantee the inviolability of freedom of conscience. But the establishment of religious parties as an effort to put religion in a political framework is acceptable to no one. At the end of the meeting it was decided to hold such talks more often and to hold conferences on specific religious themes. Agreement was also reached on organizing a special meeting of the leaders of all confessions in Azerbaijan, scholars and politicians.
