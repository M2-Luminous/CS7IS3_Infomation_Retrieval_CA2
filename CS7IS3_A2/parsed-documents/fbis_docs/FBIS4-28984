The history of socialist economic construction in the country began with developing coal resources and upgrading coal industry. The state defined the coal industry as one of the domains that should be kept ahead of other domains of the national economy and has all along directed big efforts to it. In the 1970s when most countries around the world were depending on oil in industrial development Korea developed the industrial sectors feeding on the rich domestic coal resources as its fuel, raw material and power resources, thus building a powerful independent national economy. The state has increased the production capacity of the existing coal mines 3.5 times over the past 30 years by steadily increasing investments in the coal industry. And it has constructed 40 odd coal mines and over 50 pits in promising areas. The coal industry is now turning out in a few days as much coal as was produced in the whole year of 1946. Korea produced 27.5 million tons of coal in 1970 to reach the level of the developed industrial states in the coal output per head of the population in those days. The annual output hit the 85 million ton mark in the 1980s. The rapid development of industry resulted in the ever increasing demand for coal. With a view to satisfying the demand for coal, the state put forward the task to boost the coal output 30 percent in the adjustment period (1994-1996). Big efforts are being made nationwide to hit the goal. New coal deposits have been found in different parts of the country. With the discovery of promising coal deposits in Yanggang Province which has been dependent on other areas for coal, prospects have opened for meeting the local demand by itself. The construction of new coal mines and pits is progressing and undertakings to carry out a comprehensive mechanization of pit work are gathering momentum. The laying of a belt conveyor line to increase the transport capacity in the pits of Yongdung, Changan, Sochang and Sunchon area coal mines and a project to increase production capacity of the Kangdong area coal mines have reached the final stage. Work is making a successful progress to move up the date of commissioning of the coal mines and pits under construction in Anju and the northern region and to complete the comprehensive mechanisation of pit work at the June 13 coal mine, the Hakpo coal mine, etc.
