They will leave, as agreed earlier, in September. There will be a meeting of the two countries' cultural figures in Weimar. The annoying incident in bilateral relations is considered closed. As Boris Yeltsin said, his friend Helmut Kohl detected the mood of the guest from Moscow and of the Russian public in his first sentence. Sacrificing election considerations, Helmut Kohl found within himself the courage to abandon in time a procedure that was humiliating for the Russian Army. General Matvey Burlakov, commander of the Western Group of Forces, declared with relief that "it is even simpler" to leave separately [ukhodit po otdelnosti]. Boris Yeltsin proposed appending the final period mark to the past at the conference of heads of state and government of the CSCE countries which will be held in Budapest in December. In the president's opinion, new principles of an international structure for the year 2000 must be formulated there. The 50th anniversary of the end of World War II can also be a suitable moment for the collective drawing of a line under the past. Military topics were thereby virtually exhausted in the talks. The establishment of Russia's closer relationship with NATO was postponed to a future date. Helmut Kohl confirmed the FRG's fidelity to the "partnership for peace" concept. President Yeltsin replied that he cannot sign this document until the Russian side has drawn up and agreed an additional protocol taking into account the special features of the 3-million-strong army with its unique armament, which not one Western state possesses. A protocol amending the "partnership for peace" concept for Russia's part will start to be prepared within the next few days. German commentators point out that Russia is increasingly confidently declaring its geopolitical interests and the need to reckon with it as a great power. Kohl, incidentally, did not stint epithets when recalling Russia's greatness and its historical role in Europe's development. To all appearances, Moscow diplomats still do not know which way Germany will go after it has seen off the last Russian soldier. Will its desire to support the Russian reforms not cool, preferring closer and more reliable partners in the West? Much attests that it is already pretty tired of being one of Moscow's most active and generous helpers. Boris Yeltsin believes in the chancellor's decency and political experience and considers him the guarantor of a further strengthening of bilateral ties. But what if another chancellor accedes to power here in November, after the Bundestag elections? In conclusion, about the work of the Russian officials who organized the visit. They operated in the best traditions of the stagnation period. On a directive from the Russian Embassy the texts of Boris Yeltsin's after-dinner speeches were kept in the press center's desk practically until the need for them had evaporated. On the eve of the news conference the press service not only decided who would put questions to the president and the chancellor but also thought up these questions itself. In the space of some two years, if you recall his previous visit to the FRG, the president has been clothed in impenetrable bureaucratic armor.
