He pointed out that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has no "real desire" to "establish democracy through the election principle and guaranteeing the opposition's right to perform their activities freely." He stressed that the continuation of the military operations of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, Hamas' military wing, "is linked to the presence of the occupation." Nazzal told AL-HAYAH that the movement's position on the question of contesting the self-rule elections in October "is clear and declared. We are for legislative elections in which the people choose their leadership. As for the elections linked to the self-rule plan, our position is clear with regard to the refusal to participate in them." He accused those "calling for participation in the elections of marketing their political plans to justify their weak positions." He drew a distinction between administrative rule elections and "unionist, student, and municipal" elections. He said that "we are for participation in all these elections. The only exception is the administrative elections linked to the self-rule." Nazzal said that "so far we have not sensed within the influential minority any real desire to establish democracy in Palestinian society through the election principle and guaranteeing the opposition's right to perform their activities freely." He added that "what we are witnessing in reality is exactly the opposite. The PLO leadership is against the election principle." He added that "this leadership's commitment in its recent agreement with Israel to prevent verbal incitement by organizations or groups against the occupation authorities casts dark shadows on this leadership's method of dealing with its opponents in the stage ahead." He was asked: Will you continue military action if you join the [Palestinian] authority? He replied: "That assumption is wrong. Who said we are going to participate in the authority? And what sort of authority is the one being talked about, whose composition is subject to the occupation authorities' approval?" Nazzal pointed out that "Hamas' continuation of the resistance is linked to the presence of the occupation. As long as the Israeli occupation continues to exist, the resistance against it will continue and never cease." He added that he accepts "the flexibility that does not deviate from the constants and that gives room for moving toward achieving the Palestinian aims.... If the intention is to say that Hamas is showing one thing and concealing another, and that its positions are aimed at achieving some interests, even if these interests conflict with its principles and constants, this concept does not apply to us and is unacceptable to us." Hamas' representative in Amman went on to say that the "al-Qassam Battalions will not be abolished, nor will they cease to operate. Nor is there any reason to do that as long as the occupation is still weighing heavily on our land. In fact all international conventions and treaties guarantee us the right to resist as long as the causes prompting this resistance have not been eliminated." Asked who is going to agree to support them financially if efforts to establish a comprehensive settlement continue, Nazzal said: "Despite our repeated affirmations that we have not received any money from any official quarter, it seems there is a determination to stir up this matter." He added: "I believe that those who raise these questions are comparing us with those on the Palestinian scene who received millions of dollars during the decades in which conditions were favorable for confronting the occupation, but they could not achieve what Hamas has now achieved. So it is difficult for some people to accept the fact that Hamas has achieved a lot with limited resources." Nazzal stressed that "Hamas has not received any money from any official quarter so far." He added that "it does not mean that we consider such support for Palestinian action a crime that should be denied. We believe that bolstering the Palestinian people's steadfastness and resistance against the occupation is a pan-Arab and Islamic duty for all Arab and Islamic quarters, official and popular." He added that Hamas does not reject such an unconditional support. "But the facts should be stated as they stand in order to put matters straight." Nazzal described Hamas' relations with the other nine factions of the "Palestinian Forces Alliance" opposed to the Oslo accord as "good. We are coordinating with them in order to consolidate and unite our efforts and tackle the challenges of this stage." He stressed that Hamas "is not accused by anyone. It declares its positions clearly and courageously. We offered our opinion clearly on a number of issues" during the alliance's meeting two weeks ago. It was "from the position of an ally seeking common denominators."
