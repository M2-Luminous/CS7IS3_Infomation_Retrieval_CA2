FR940810-0-00051 FR940810-0-00021 The term is limiting because it focuses on a fraction of the circumstances and criteria which define lower risk work with asbestos-containing material. For example, removing asbestos-containing products like transite panels, likely will not result in significant exposure, even if conducted for more than one day, if there is use of a few simple controls. As much as the scope and duration of the job, the materials themselves, their condition and the work-practices used define hazard potential. OSHA had tried to include these concepts under the ``small-term, short-duration'' exception in the current standard, by reference to examples. However, the breadth of the examples led the court to observe that ``the exception as now worded seems to erase the rule.'' (838 F. 2d at 1279). In the 1990 proposal OSHA tried to identify the conditions and operations which separated higher risk work with ACM from lower risk work in its small-scale, short-term definition. Still anchoring the distinction however, was OSHA's belief that the time a job took, and the amount of material involved, primarily determined risk. Based on the record of this proceeding, OSHA now finds that these are relevant, but not exclusive, factors. OSHA finds also that use of the term is confusing. In 1986, in its list of activities considered ``small-scale, short-term,'' OSHA listed some which are neither small-scale or short-term, but were regarded as lower risk, such as roofing work. To cure this confusion, OSHA proposed, in 1990 to limit the ``small-scale, short duration'' exemption to a subset of renovation, removal and demolition operations which took less time, and/or involved small areas. Even for these activities a temporal or volume cutoff was difficult to define, and the proposed definition contained numerical criteria, which varied depending on which activity was defined. In addition, it proposed to exempt other activities, such as roofing, regardless of the size of the project, from the negative-pressure enclosure requirement. EPA uses the term ``small-scale, short-duration'' to describe cut-offs which are much higher than those proposed by OSHA for its reporting requirements for asbestos renovation, demolition and removal work under NESHAPS. And under EPA's worker protection rule which applied to state and local government workers in OSHA non-state plan states, reporting requirements for asbestos ``abatement'' projects, do not apply to projects involving ``less than 3 linear feet or 3 square feet of friable asbestos material.'' (40 CFR 763.124). Many objections to the proposed definition were received by the Agency. After reviewing this record, and in light of the variety of interpretations of the term ``small-scale, short-duration,'' OSHA determined that it is inappropriate to use that term as the equivalent of lower risk activities. Once OSHA decided to include other control methods in the ``preferred category'' for high risk asbestos work, neither a ``small-scale, short-duration'' definition nor an exemption from negative- pressure enclosure requirement was central to OSHA's regulatory scheme. As explained more fully below, although OSHA no longer uses the term ``small_scale, short-term'' to exempt activities from universal requirements, OSHA uses the related terms ``small-scale'' and ``reduced exposure potential'' as part of a larger classification scheme. Issue 8. The extension of reporting and information and transfer requirements: A. Notification to OSHA OSHA had proposed expanded notification and reporting provisions in response to the Court's remand order concerning two issues. The first is whether OSHA should require employers to give the Agency advance notification of asbestos-related jobs. BCTD, in the 1984 rulemaking had suggested that OSHA should require all construction industry employers to file reports concerning any building demolition, renovation or removal project involving asbestos prior to beginning such a project. Two health enhancing benefits of a notice requirement were advanced by BCTD. One, is the help such information would provide the Agency in targeting inspections. The other is a claimed reduction in risk because of the consciousness-raising and self-education provided by the notice process. The Court noted that the BCTD proposal would ``arguably generate better information for ``selecting targets for inspection and that it was based on ``uncontradicted (and unanalyzed) evidence of non-de minimis benefits.'' (relating to compliance enhancement). (838 F.2d at 1278). It remanded the issue to the Agency for further explanation or rebuttal.
