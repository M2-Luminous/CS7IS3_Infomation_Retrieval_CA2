During the ceremony 'Arafat first signed three copies of the agreement, but refused to sign the annexes of the maps of Gaza and Jericho that will become autonomous zones. Then Rabin signed the agreement without signing the annexes either, which led to a brief recess of the ceremony for last minute consultations. They returned to the hall a few minutes later. 'Arafat then wrote down his reservations in arabic and signed the annexes. Informed sources told XINHUA the words he wrote in Arabic were "these maps are not final and they are still under consideration." Rabin listened to 'Arafat's reservations through an interpreter and then signed the annexes without making any statement. Israel agreed to give 62 square kilometers to Jericho but Palestinians demanded more than double. Chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'ath said after the ceremony that the size of Jericho will be further negotiated.
