Vural then said that at the meeting Prime Minister Ciller raised the issue of the DEP [Democracy Party] deputies who were stripped of their immunity. Vural said: Prime Minister Ciller said that she observed that the issue is giving rise to concern in France due to misunderstanding and lack of information. The prime minister stressed that legislative immunity in Turkey is more comprehensive than in many European countries, and that those who were stripped of their immunity continue to be members of parliament. She noted that they were stripped of their immunity because of serious allegations that they had links with a terrorist organization.

The prime minister stressed that the decision will be made by independent courts. The French foreign minister said that France respects Turkey's territorial integrity, and realizes that Turkey is faced with terrorism. He stated that his country took measures against the terrorist organization PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] and that France is opposed to terrorism.
