SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of June 20, 1990 (55 FR 25204 at 25232), FDA proposed talc, 45 to 100 percent, as Category I (generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded) as an OTC skin protectant active ingredient for the treatment and prevention of diaper rash. Specific warnings and directions were proposed for powder products containing talc. The final monograph for OTC skin protectant drug products will be published in a future issue of the Federal Register . The discussion of talc at these public meetings may be considered by the agency in the preparation of this final monograph for OTC skin protectant drug products. The purpose of these meetings is to provide a forum for an updated discussion of the origins, manufacture, characterization, toxicology, and epidemiology of talc and related products. The principal focus will be on the latest toxicologic and epidemiologic studies, particularly as they reflect on the safe uses of talc in consumer products. The following topic areas will be discussed: (1) Characteristics of cosmetic-grade talc; (2) a history of the uses of talc in a variety of consumer products; (3) current quality control measures to insure safety; (4) the regulatory history of talc; (5) recent National Toxicology Program studies of chronic pulmonary exposure of rodents to talc and the relevance of these studies to human risk assessment; and (6) the significance of contrasting epidemiologic studies of talc exposure. Speakers and panelists will include well-known regulatory specialists, toxicologists, epidemiologists, pathologists, talc product manufacturers, talc production experts, and consumer representatives. A critical panel discussion by speakers and invited experts will complete each session. Dated: January 11, 1994 Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy.
