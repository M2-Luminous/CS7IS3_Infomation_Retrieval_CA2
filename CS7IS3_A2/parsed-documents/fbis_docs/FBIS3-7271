The Thai military continued sending the 25,000 Cambodians back over the border into Khmer Rouge-held territory, but was encountering resistance from some refugees who did not want to go, according to traders at the border. Phnom Penh had asked Bangkok to allow free access to the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in order to determine if the refugees wanted to return to areas controlled by the Cambodian government. But the Thai military kept the Cambodians in an area closed to outsiders, and has not let foreign aid agencies or independent observers interview them. "The Thai authorities have not listened to our request," Prince Sirivut said. "I think it is a human rights abuse from some people or Thai authorities, and I would like to say clearly that the Royal Government ... and the two prime ministers, we are not happy about this," Prince Sirivut said. "We think it is a forced repatriation," he added. At least half of the refugees, according to Thai soldiers, were repatriated to a Khmer Rouge-held zone following the Phnom Penh government offensive against the Khmer Rouge bastion of Pailin in northwest Cambodia. Pailin is Cambodia's most important mining center for rubies. "It is not normal that the Thai authorities take this decision to send 25,000 people without security, with nothing we can check," the prince said. "I'm quite disappointed and I asked all the international community to look very carefully in this way," he said. "In particular, we have requested the presence of the UNHCR," the prince said. Sagato Ogata, the UN high commissioner, made, without success, an official request Friday to the Thai government for access to the refugees, the UNHCR in Phnom Penh said. The refugees began streaming out of Khmer Rouge zones of control around Pailin following a government offensive that captured the resource-rich area last week. The repatriation was launched Friday night by the Thai military and continued Sunday and Monday, a source on the Thai side of the border said. According to an unconfirmed report, the Thai military may have culled out the young men and the able-bodied and repatriated them first by truck, to the Khmer Rouge-controlled zone of Phoum Malai, 45 kilometers (28 miles) to the north. Thai troops are regularly accused of aiding the Khmer Rouge at the border, an accusation strongly denied by Bangkok. Prince Sirivut said he would still meet to discuss the issue as planned Monday with his Thai counterpart in Bangkok, Prasong Sunsiri, with whom discussions on the repatriation of the refugees had been anticipated. The minister hinted that Thai requests for an extension of the March 31 deadline for the return of timber harvested by Thai loggers in the Pailin area -- concessions granted by the Khmer Rouge -- would be carefully examined. The request was conveyed Tuesday to Phnom Penh by the Thai vice minister of foreign affairs, Surin Phitsuwan, who asked for the return to Thailand of expensive mining equipment as well as cut timber left in place before the advance of government troops.
