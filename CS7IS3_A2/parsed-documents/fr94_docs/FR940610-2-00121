FR940610-2-00121 FR940610-2-00067 (b) The Company's annual report provided to the Plans containing detailed information on the Company's activities with respect to the Properties during the preceding year is not ``audited'' by the ``qualified oil and gas investment manager'' each year, but is ``audited'' at intervals recommended by the investment manager and authorized by GMIMCo. However, the ``qualified oil and gas investment manager'' will review the information throughout the year for problems or mistakes which will be corrected by the Company. Paragraph 10 of the Summary should be clarified to reflect the fact that, as previously noted, the Company may receive additional compensation for operating the Properties in the form of operating fees pursuant to an Operating Agreement and may recoup certain general or administrative expenses as permitted by the Conveyance. Paragraph 12 of the Summary should be clarified to reflect the fact that GMIMCo has appointed other ``qualified oil and gas investment managers'' for the Plans, in addition to RPI Institutional Services, Inc., and such managers have met all the requirements of Section III(d) of the Proposal. Paragraph 14 of the Summary should be clarified to reflect the correct NPI sharing percentages of the May 8, 1990 NPI transaction with Callon Offshore Production Inc. (Callon). The applicant states that although the Plans did in fact pay 98% of the $28 million purchase price, the Plans received a 98% NPI in the Properties which will continue until the Plans recoup their entire share of the purchase price. After the Plans receive their entire investment in the NPI acquisition, there will be a reversion to an 88% NPI for the Plans at that point in time. The applicant believes that this clarification is important because the Plans will receive all of their investment in the Properties before Callon is able to collect from its additional NPI percentage. The Department also received eleven comment letters from participants in the Plans regarding the Proposal. Two of the commenters were opposed to the granting of the exemption. One of these commenters was concerned that the oil and gas transactions are risky investments for the Plans and that any appraisal of such assets by the Plans may be overvalued. The other commenter stated that he was opposed to the exemption because GMC may either knowingly or unknowingly exercise a controlling influence over various oil and gas suppliers when it buys oil and gas to meet its own energy needs and that such influence may be to the detriment of the Plans' oil and gas investments. This commenter also stated that GMC's oil and gas purchasing power could be used to affect certain local markets. Many of the Commenters stated that they supported the granting of the exemption, but only if GMC offers an ``early retirement package'' to all salaried employees, regardless of job classification, that meet certain age and service criteria. Some of these commenters noted that notices regarding the Proposal were posted late and that interested persons were not given enough time to reply. By letter dated March 18, 1994, the applicant responded to these comments. First, with respect to the comment that oil and gas transactions are risky investments for the Plans and that appraisals of such assets may be overvalued, the applicant states that the subject transactions under the terms and conditions described in the Proposal are in the best interests of the Plans and their participants and beneficiaries. The applicant represents that oil and gas investments can be reasonable and appropriate for a large pension plan, such as the Plans, and that the subject transactions have been and will continue to be carefully monitored by GMIMCo. The oil and gas transactions by the Plans under the requested exemption will represent only a small percentage of each Plan's total assets (see Section II(i) above) and the existing investments have yielded the Plans a high rate of return (see Paragraph 11 of the Summary). The applicant states that any activity by GMIMCo or the ``qualified oil and gas investment manager'' acting for the Plans that is outside the scope of activity described to the Department in the Proposal, including any methods for overvaluing the fair market value of proposed or existing oil and gas assets of the Plans, would be a breach of fiduciary duty in violation of the Act. In addition, such activity would be outside the scope of the conditions of the Proposal and would not be subject to the prohibited transaction relief which would be afforded by the exemption. Second, regarding the comment that GMC may exercise a controlling influence over various oil and gas suppliers when GMC buys oil and gas to meet its own energy needs and that such influence may be to the detriment of the Plans' oil and gas investments, the applicant states that the comment is without merit and is inconsistent with the facts and representations contained in the Proposal. The applicant maintains that GMC has a de minimus involvement with any oil and gas suppliers when acquiring oil and gas to run its own operations. With respect to GMC's relationship to any such suppliers in the subject oil and gas transactions by the Plans, the applicant states that the definition of ``Company'' in Section III(a) of the Proposal excludes any operating company or partnership which is related to GMC or its affiliates. In addition, the oil and gas investments covered by the Proposal involve the Plans' in a passive investment role, with very limited control over the actual sale or distribution of oil and gas obtained from the Properties.
