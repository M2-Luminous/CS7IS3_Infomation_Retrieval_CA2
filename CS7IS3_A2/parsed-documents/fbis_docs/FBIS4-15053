FBIS4-15053 "drsov066_a_94016" FBIS-SOV-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Zhirinovskiy Warns Finland on Baltics Zhirinovskiy Warns Finland on Baltics LD0604105994 LD0604105994 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 1000 GMT on 6 April carries a report by correspondent Svetlana Pankratova on a Russian-Finnish seminar on Russia joining the Council of Europe. The seminar was held in Helsinki and attended by members of parliament from both countries. Pankratova reports that Oleg Lukin, head of the international affairs committee of the Russian parliament, said the meeting in Helsinki "would accelerate the resolution of the issue of Russia joining the Council of Europe." Finnish members of parliament would also like Russia to join the Council, for otherwise the process of European integration would not be complete. Pankratova says that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, LDPR, took part in the seminar, but refused to meet journalists at a general meeting and preferred to convene his own news conference in a Helsinki hotel. Pankratova continues: "At his news conference, Vladimir Volfovich lectured the Finns on how they should conduct their affairs with Russia. Do not touch the Baltic states, for they are a part of Russia, warned Zhirinovskiy. Otherwise you will have a third world war. The LDPR leader thinks that this third world war is already being waged in Tajikistan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. It is obvious that the LDPR leader's extremist utterances not only do not facilitate any further strengthening of trust between Russia and Finland, but on the contrary, do much to devalue the results of the constructive dialogue which took place between members of parliament from both countries." Pankratova continues: "The report that following the news conference, the LDPR leader visited one of Helsinki's best known fleshpots, not among the best, either -- the erotic night-club King-Sex Cockatoo -- had a truly shocking effect on the Finnish public."
