Zhang Wannian today exchanged views on what has been gained from studying the book with members of the core group of the General Staff Department Party Committee and students attending the first study class for Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. The study class was held for the General Staff Department's leading cadres at the army and divisional level; most of the students attending the study class are from the department's bureaus and academies. The students scored initial success by studying the original work in a down-to-earth manner, by profoundly grasping its basic viewpoints, and by linking the study with practical problems. Zhang Wannian stressed: Party committees of the General Staff Department and leading cadres at all levels must study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping with a strong sense of political responsibility to the party and to the cause of army building, lay a strong ideological and theoretical foundation for upholding the party's absolute leadership over the army, ensure adherence to the correct orientation in very complex situations, and consciously maintain a high degree of unity with the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. Zhang Wannian pointed out: We must study the original work in a down-to-earth manner, grasp its spirit, and concentrate on grasping its standpoint, viewpoints, and methodology. At the same time, we must closely link the study with practical military work, use the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping as guide, and improve our ability to analyze and resolve problems. First, we must integrate study with the reality of the ideological field, further emancipate our minds, acquire new ideas, and enhance our unshakable faith in implementing the party's basic line. Second, we must integrate it with the reality of reform, opening up, and the development of a socialist market economy, profoundly understand and firmly implement party and state policies in promoting reform, and keep our troops highly stable, centralized, and unified. Third, we must integrate it with the reality of the department's work and work hard to enhance our political consciousness in upholding the principle of the party commanding the gun, our strategic sense in developing plans from a macroscopic perspective, our strong sense of responsibility toward national security and army building, and our sense of leadership in placing stricter demands on ourselves in everything we do. Fourth, we must integrate it with the reality in party building and work hard to create a good image of our party committees and leading cadres at all levels. Fifth, we must integrate it with the reality of our workstyle, firmly overcome formalism, carry out our tasks in a down-to-earth manner, pay attention to work at the grassroots level, and continue to improve efficiency in guidance work.
