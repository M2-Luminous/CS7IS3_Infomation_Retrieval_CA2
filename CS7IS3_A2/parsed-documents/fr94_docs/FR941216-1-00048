FR941216-1-00048 FR941216-1-00010 Example 3. Negative adjustment carryforward for year of retirement_ (i) Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 of paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section, except that the payment actually made on December 31, 1997, is $1,010, rather than the projected $1,100. Thus, Z will have a $9 negative adjustment carryforward for 1997, the year of retirement. See Example 2 of paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section. (ii) Loss on retirement. Immediately before the payment at maturity, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $1,100. Under paragraph (b)(7)(iv) of this section, Z is treated as receiving the projected amount of the contingent payment, or $1,100, as the payment at maturity. Under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)(2) of this section, however, this amount is reduced by any negative adjustment carryforward determined for the taxable year of retirement to calculate the amount Z realizes on retirement of the debt instrument. Thus, Z has a loss of $9 on the retirement of the debt instrument, equal to the amount by which Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument ($1,100) exceeds the amount Z realizes on the retirement of the debt instrument ($1,100 minus the $9 negative adjustment carryforward). (8) Character on sale, exchange, or retirement _(i) Gain. Any gain recognized by a holder on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a debt instrument is interest income. (ii) Loss. Any loss recognized by a holder on the sale, exchange, or retirement of the debt instrument is ordinary loss to the extent that the holder's total interest inclusions on the debt instrument exceed the total net negative adjustments on the debt instrument the holder took into account as ordinary loss. Any additional loss is treated as loss from the sale, exchange, or retirement of the debt instrument. (iii) Special rule if there are no remaining contingent payments on the debt instrument. Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section, if, at the time of the sale, exchange, or retirement of the debt instrument, there are no remaining contingent payments due on the debt instrument, any gain or loss recognized by the holder on the debt instrument is gain or loss from the sale, exchange, or retirement of the debt instrument. (iv) Fixed but deferred payments. For purposes of paragraph (b)(8) of this section, a contingent payment that is fixed within the 6-month period ending on the due date of the payment is treated as a contingent payment even after the payment is fixed. See paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section, under which a contingent payment that is fixed more than 6 months before it is due is not treated as a contingent payment after it is fixed. (v) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (b)(8) of this section. In each example, assume that the debt instrument described is a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. Example 1. Gain on sale _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1997, D, a calendar year taxpayer, sells a debt instrument that is subject to paragraph (b) of this section for $1,350. On that date, D has an adjusted basis in the debt instrument of $1,200. In addition, D has a negative adjustment carryforward of $50 for 1996 that results in a negative adjustment of $50 on January 1, 1997, under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)(1) of this section. D has no positive adjustments on the debt instrument on January 1, 1997. (ii) Character of gain. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, the $50 negative adjustment on January 1, 1997, results in a negative adjustment carryforward for 1997, the taxable year of the sale of the debt instrument. Under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)(2) of this section, the negative adjustment carryforward reduces the amount realized by D on the sale of the debt instrument from $1,350 to $1,300. As a result, D realizes a $100 gain on the sale of the debt instrument, equal to the $1,300 amount realized minus D's $1,200 adjusted basis in the debt instrument. Under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, the gain is interest income to D. Example 2. Ordinary loss on sale _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1996, E, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a debt instrument at original issue for $1,000. The debt instrument is a capital asset in the hands of E. The debt instrument provides for a payment of $1,000 at maturity on December 31, 2001, and for quotable contingent payments on December 31, 1997, 1999, and 2001. The projected payment schedule provides for projected payments of $275 on December 31, 1997, $200 on December 31, 1999, and $1,127 on December 31, 2001. Thus, the projected yield on the debt instrument is 10 percent, compounded annually. Based on the projected payment schedule, the total daily portions of interest would be $100 for 1996, $110 for 1997, and $93.50 for 1998. (ii) Adjustment for 1997. Assume that the payment actually made on December 31, 1997, is $150, rather than the projected $275. Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, E has a negative adjustment of $125 on December 31, 1997. Because E has no positive adjustments for 1997, E has a net negative adjustment of $125 on the debt instrument for 1997. This net negative adjustment reduces to zero the $110 total daily portions of interest E would otherwise include in income in 1997. Accordingly, E has no interest income on the debt instrument for 1997. Because E had $100 of interest inclusions for 1996, the remaining $15 of the net negative adjustment is an ordinary loss to E for 1997. (iii) Determination of amount and character of loss on sale. Assume that E sells the debt instrument for $950 on December 31, 1998. On that date, E has an adjusted basis in the debt instrument of $1,028.50 ($1,000 original basis, plus total daily portions of $100 for 1996, $110 for 1997, and $93.50 for 1998, minus the $275 projected amount of the December 31, 1997 payment). As a result, E realizes a $78.50 loss on the sale of the debt instrument (the difference between the sales price and E's adjusted basis in the debt instrument). The total amount of E's interest inclusions on the debt instrument as of December 31, 1998 ($100 in 1996 and $93.50 in 1998) exceeds the total amount of net negative adjustments on the debt instrument E treated as ordinary loss as of that date ($15 in 1997) by more than $78.50. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, the $78.50 loss on the debt instrument is treated as an ordinary loss by E. Example 3. Loss on sale of a debt instrument _(i) Facts. Assume the same facts as in Example 2 of this paragraph (b)(8)(v), except that the payment actually made on December 31, 1997, is $0, rather than the projected $275. (ii) Adjustment for 1997. Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, E has a negative adjustment of $275 on December 31, 1997. Because E has no positive adjustments for 1997, E has a net negative adjustment of $275 on the debt instrument for 1997. This net negative adjustment reduces to zero the $110 total daily portions of interest E would otherwise include in income in 1997. Accordingly, E has no interest income on the debt instrument for 1997. Because E had $100 of interest inclusions for 1996, $100 of the remaining $165 net negative adjustment is treated by E as an ordinary loss for 1997. The remaining $65 of the net negative adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward for 1997 that results in a negative adjustment of $65 on January 1, 1998.
