Firstly, there is the concern on a personal, humanitarian level for the welfare of approximately 100 Thai prisoners. Secondly, there is the worry about what the story, if substantiated, could do for Thai-Lao relations at this crucial juncture. According to a former Thai prisoner who was held for a short period in the Pakse jail in Champassak in Laos, as many as 100 Thai prisoners have died due to cruelty and neglect. The man talked of the inhumane conditions and treatment the Thais face at the hands of their Lao captors. The former prisoner accused the Laotian authorities of chaining the Thai prisoners up and of providing only poor food each day. Humanitarian concerns aside, this type of news does little to help the relationship between Thailand and Laos at this important time. [passage omitted] Yet under the surface many of the old animosities remain. Racism, in terms of the relationship between Thai and ethnic Lao, is still a problem in both countries. This is aside from the clash between the Marxist ideology pursued by the government in Vientiane and the democratic and free market ideals of Bangkok. The niggling animosities are partly a product of struggle and competition over the centuries, and partly due to a dislike of people considered outsiders. Many people in government and private circles in Laos fear being swamped by everything Thai. Not only are Thai companies and businessmen making major inroads into Laos with their products and services, but Thai culture as a whole, brought by the mass media, is being lapped up by many Laotian people who have televisions, radios and cassette recorders. Modern Thai culture -- a cross between Thai and Western influence -- is having a significant effect on a country which has very limited forms of modern entertainment and is only just emerging from the pall of the monotony of communism. This is a period in time when the relationship between Thailand and Laos should be handled sensitively. The Lao and Thai governments would do well to work together in a spirit of cooperation to iron out contentious issues, including how they treat each others' nationals. This not only applies to Thai people in Laos, but also to Lao people in Thailand. Stories about the bad treatment of foreign nationals do not help.
