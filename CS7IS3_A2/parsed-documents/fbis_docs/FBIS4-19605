Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose said he had no intention of asking the peacekeeping troops to fight a war from white-painted vehicles but air power could have a use for protecting UN safe areas. "I believe the imposition of the total exclusion zone for heavy weapons around Sarajevo is something that could well be replicated elsewhere in the safe areas," he said. Asked if he thought the first UN convoy would get into the stricken city of Gorazde today in the wake of the new ceasefire agreement signed at Pale, he replied: "I hope the words of the Bosnian Serb authorities will now be matched by action." Gen Rose added: "We have 141 troops who are going to go in there, including medical staff. And we have got humanitarian aid convoys as well." Asked whether he wanted more troops, he said: "Of course we would have done. We feel that the town is very destroyed. There will be many people who will need help and sustenance. There is still some sporadic fighting going on. We shall certainly need more troops in the future there, but at least we have made a start." The accord reached in Pale was important, he said on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. "It does bring about a ceasefire. It allows us to run these convoys there. It is described as a first step towards some better arrangement. It is a first step insofar as it is temporary. It depends upon the willingness of the two parties not to resume the conflict. I hope it will turn in due course into a cessation of hostilities which is more permanent." Gen. Rose said there were now enormous pressures on the Bosnian Serbs. "They may have made a tactical gain by capturing most of the right bank of the River Drena in Gorazde, but their strategic assessment has been nothing short of disastrous." He said Gorazde was at the mercy of the Serbs. "There is nothing we can do to sustain the defences of Gorazde. We did our best to bring about peace as a peacekeeping force. I am delighted to say we have at least a signed document with this ceasefire arrangement well supported by the various measures we are taking." Questioned about air strikes, Gen. Rose said: "You have got to be terribly careful. We are here as a peacekeeping force. I have got a responsibility for 15,500 young men and women who are here as peacekeepers. I have no intention of asking them to fight a war from white-painted vehicles. Their countries did not send them for that."
