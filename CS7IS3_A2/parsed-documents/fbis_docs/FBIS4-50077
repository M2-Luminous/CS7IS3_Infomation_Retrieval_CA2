Wu said that Ambassador McLaren has been in China for nearly three years and will retire soon. We wish him good luck and good health after his retirement. Wu continued that despite the breakdown of the Sino-British talks on arrangements for Hong Kong's 1994-95 elections, the Chinese side, proceeding from the livelihood and economy of Hong Kong, is still willing to cooperate with the British side. Of course, whether cooperation between the two sides is smooth depends on the British side. [passage omitted]
