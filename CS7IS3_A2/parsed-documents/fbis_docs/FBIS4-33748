Michael Benditti and Robert Shymko arrived in Havana on a boat from Florida and stopped over at the "Marina Hemingway" naval base, claiming that they planned to continue their trip to Varadero Beach, 140 km from Havana. Nevertheless, according to Foreign Ministry Spokesman Miguel Alfonso, the Canadians in fact traveled to Guanabo Beach, approximately 25 km from the capital, to facilitate the illegal departure from the country of eight people which, apparently, had been previously agreed upon. The group's haste to leave prompted an accident on the beach which claimed the lives of two swimmers and caused serious injuries to another, he added. Consequently, it has been officially announced that the two Canadians have been arrested and will be subjected to legal procedures established for such cases. The spokesman explained that the foreigners have already been visited by officials from the Canadian Consulate in Cuba and that legal procedures against them are following their normal course.
