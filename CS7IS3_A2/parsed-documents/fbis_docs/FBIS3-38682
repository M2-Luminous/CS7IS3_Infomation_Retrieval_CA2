The U.S. Senate warned the FRG, of all countries, not once, but twice, to finally "fully" participate in UN military missions. One resolution was even adopted with 96 to 1 -- which the "most exclusive club of the world" does not do too often. This resolution (which is not binding for anyone) asks the Germans to take the "necessary constitutional steps" for combat missions under UN auspices. This fits in nicely with the concept of the Kohl/Kinkel government, because it can elegantly pass on the pressure: first, toward Karlsruhe, where diverse proceedings are still pending that should clarify once and for all what can legally be done "out of area"; second, toward the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], which is in favor of "peacekeeping" but not of "peacemaking" (that is to say combat) missions. So far, so good. The barbs become visible if one takes a closer look at the Senate debate, and they hook up with the ardent desire of officials in Bonn to finally be awarded the epaulets of a true major power: a permanent seat in the Security Council. The Clinton administration has nothing against it, and recently even advocated Bonn's promotion in this respect. The senators, however, have explicitly asked for a price. Senator William Roth put it in the following way: "I do not think that people in Tokyo and Bonn today see the indissoluble connection between global power and responsibility." In plain English: Those who want the epaulets also must accept the burden; one cannot force one's way into the cockpit if one reaches for the parachute moments before the battle by referring to other obligations. Have officials in Bonn sufficiently analyzed the link between power and duty? True, they are tired of having to look at the five permanent members of the Security Council (United States, Britain, France, Russia, and China) as the eternal winners of World War II. After all, the united Germany has regained its status and, moreover, economically and demographically it is one number larger than England and France. And it worries greatly (one has said: "I cannot stand it") that "we do not participate in the discussions between the Five," but "always remain outside the door." Only: Reality is different. Those who watched how Clinton flattered Kohl in Washington earlier this week hardly have to worry about Germany's importance in international politics. The Germans are number two in NATO and the G7 group of industrialized nations -- and, with the French, number one in the European Union. Wherever Bonn puts forward its interests, it gets involved. And where Bonn does not get involved -- in the Balkans, where the stake is military strength -- the UN epaulets will not be of any use. After all, this is where Bonn does not want to join in the game -- for the often mentioned historical reasons. Strength [macht] is not derived from wanting [moechten], but from doing [machen]. If the Bonn government really wants to participate, then it should first clarify whether it is able to -- in terms of domestic policy -- and really wants to -- in terms of foreign policy.
