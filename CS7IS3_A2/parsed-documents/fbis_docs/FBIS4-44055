Mario De Scalzi interviewed Defense Minister Cesare Previti a few minutes ago. He asked him what the Italian Government's position is. [Begin recording] [Previti] We have said we are available for an international mission -- either sponsored by the Western European Union [WEU] or the United Nations -- and we can confirm that. The mission should be very international. The commandment should clearly be given to someone at a supernational level [as heard]. The goals should be peace and humanitarian aid. [De Scalzi] So a mission like the French one is not feasible according to you? [Previti] The United Nations has given its support to the French intervention. It must be a short-term intervention before there is a wider UN intervention. I hope these plans materialize as soon as possible. It appears that it is more and more necessary to do what the prime minister has said more than once: There should be a task-force capable of intervening on behalf of the United Nations or the WEU in places like Rwanda where the disaster is getting worse by the minute.
