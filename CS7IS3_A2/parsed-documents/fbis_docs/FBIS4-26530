According to local officials, the new railway line will start from Yingcheng city in eastern Hubei and join the existing Jiaozuo railway line at Jingzhou city, also in Hubei, via the province's Tianmen and Zhongxiang cities and Jingshan County, and extend to Yichang city, which is quite close to the huge projected dam. The new railway line will have a capacity to carry more than 20 million tons per year. Construction of the line will begin during the next five-year- plan period (1996-2000) and the whole project will be completed within three years. Foreign funds, such as foreign governmental loans and investment from transnational consortiums, will be used besides locally-raised funds to pay for the new line. Engineers say that it will help shorten the travelling distance between Wuhan, the province's capital, and Yichang by 240 km, compared with the existing Handan and Jiaozhi railway lines. The officials added that the new line would be of great importance for improving the comprehensive transport system in central China, promoting economic development along the Chang Jiang river, and helping the construction of the Three Gorges Dam.
