They saw the action taken by the British Hong Kong authorities as a further step to deliberately sabotage the Sino-British cooperation over the Hong Kong issue. They urged local residents to make concerted efforts with the Chinese side to ensure a smooth transition of the territory in 1997. Chris Patten's remaining political reform package regarding the 1994-1995 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong was tabled to the Legislative Council yesterday afternoon. The first part of his reform bill was introduced last December. Both parts of Chris Patten's so-called democracy reform bill were tabled under the circumstance where no agreement was reached between China and Britain despite the fact that the Chinese side had made its utmost efforts in the past 17 rounds of the Sino-British talks over the Hong Kong issue. The Chinese side has repeatedly warned that any unilateral action taken by the British side in this aspect before an agreement is reached between the two sides is in gross violation of the joint declaration, the Basic Law as well as the agreements and understandings reached between the two countries. Wong Siu-yee, a local member of the Urban Council, said that the real intention of the British side by unilaterally tabling Patten's reform bill was to continue the British influence over the territory, which it took away from China by armed forces in the late 19th century, after it is returned to China in 1997. Another local public figure, Rita Fan, said that the British side claimed, on the one hand, that the door for the Sino-British talks was open, while, on the other hand, it had slammed the door by taking unilateral actions. Fan, a female member of the Preliminary Working Committee, said that one can not entirely depend on the cooperation of the British side in the other fields as Britain has taken an uncooperative attitude towards the political issues. Wong Siu-lun, a professor from the Sociology Department of Hong Kong University, said that under the situation in which the basis of the Sino-British cooperation over the Hong Kong issue has been ruined by the British side, the Chinese side should work closely with the local residents and be prepared for the long-term development of the future special administrative region.
