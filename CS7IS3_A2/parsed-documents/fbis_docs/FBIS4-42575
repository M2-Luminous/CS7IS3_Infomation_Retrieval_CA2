M.] [Text] Commenting on a statement by Albanian President Sali Berisha that his country's openness to dialogue is a message of goodwill, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said he hopes Greek-Albanian relations will cool off. However, the Greek Government continues to expect a lot from the U.S. stance and the pressure that it is in a position to exert on Tirana. In a letter to his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher, the Greek foreign minister asks that the United States intervene immediately to create the conditions that will allow Greece and Albania to come to the negotiating table. In his letter, the Greek minister notes that the Albanian economy essentially depends on remittances by the 400,000 Albanian citizens who live and work, legally or illegally, in Greece. Papoulias asks the U.S. secretary to remind the Albanian Government of this fact and suggest to it that it move away from issues that create tension between the two countries, so that the way can be opened for a new approach. At the same time, the Greek Government is trying to involve the European Union [EU] in the issue of Greek-Albanian relations. Of course, this will happen if the EU supports the Greek positions on the violation of the Greek minority's human rights. The Greek minister said: "In any case, the government is determined to take drastic measures to deal with the situation." The Greek Government is in a hurry to ease the tension in Greek-Albanian relations, and not just because of the dangers to peace in the entire region. According to safe information, the Greek Government is concerned about the outcome of a possible trial for the six arrested members of the minority group Omonoia. According to the same information, the Greek Government is concerned about the possibility that the Albanian charges against some of the six will be proved either with existing or fabricated evidence. Indicative of the Greek Government's "embarrassment" is government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos' answer when asked if it is possible for a Greek-Albanian dialogue to begin when Albania insists on trying the six. Venizelos gave an ambiguous answer: "The Greek positions on protection of human rights and the rights of the Greek Albanians have been given." The spokesman's answer reflects the Greek Government's dilemma, whether or not to pursue a political settlement of this issue. The views on this are split but many believe that the issue must close as soon as possible through political moves. Some diplomatic and government officials agree that if there is no trial, the Greek side will have to face the Albanian charges for the activity of some Omonoia members and the international community's suspicion. According to the second view, which is gaining ground, the Greek Government will lower its tones and let the initiative move to the Albanian Government. If Tirana proceeds with a trial, then Athens will condemn the procedure as a fabrication.... [ellipsis as published]
