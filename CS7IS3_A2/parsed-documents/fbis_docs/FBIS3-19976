There was a 7.1 percent increase last year. At the first industrial policy conference of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania in Klink, near Waren, Rexrodt said on Wednesday [23 March] that this land was one of the regions that was going through particularly profound structural changes. However, the upward trends were consolidating in the key industries of food, agriculture, and shipbuilding. The Federal Government has so far supported this conversion with some 17 billion German marks [DM] in subsidies, which has helped to create or save a total of 445,000 jobs. According to Rexrodt, the Baltic Sea Highway A 20 will make the coastal region of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania more attractive to investors.
