In the opinion of the Association of Brazilian Exporters (AEB), for this reason it will not be accepted by the multilateral trade organ. The program provides for the creation of fiscal incentive mechanisms, which contradict the GATT Code of Subsidies. The third article of the Code condemns the creation of foreign trade incentives based on "export performance" [preceding two words in English]. Despite this, the MICT project foresees that in order to have the fiscal incentives approved, enterprises will take minimum export commitments. The matter was analyzed yesterday during a meeting of AEB entrepreneurs, for whom the project must be subject to external auditing for evaluation of specific conflicts with GATT principles. AEB President Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes is concerned that the program proposed by the government -- despite the fact that it is more generalized than the previous one (described in Draft Bill No. 3721/93, which provided for incentives for automobile exports only) -- will artificially create unequal competition conditions for various industrial sectors. Pratini de Moraes said: "The old Befiex (an export fiscal incentive program created by Pratini de Moraes himself, when he was minister of industry and commerce, during the Medici administration) was a good program, and fulfilled its objective more than 20 years ago." In his opinion, the best way to support Brazilian foreign trade is to eliminate the tax burden on exports.
