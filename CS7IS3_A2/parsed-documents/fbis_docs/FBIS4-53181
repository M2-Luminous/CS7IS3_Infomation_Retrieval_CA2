The recording of this greatest decline (relative to the previous month) since the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] began keeping statistics on trends in mining and manufacturing production occurred in October 1993. Since then neither production nor factory shipments have shown any signs of recovering. The perception has collapsed of viewing this recession as a process of course correction back to that before the bubble inflated, and most industries are being hit directly by declines both in their production and in their shipment indices to levels far below any theoretical figures. One might be able to see the Japanese economy reverting, in scale and strength, back nearly to the levels of 1984, ten years ago, and now being headed on its way to even further retrogression toward the levels prior to that--those of the early 1980's. This year again, most Japanese companies, including the auto industry, issued bullish new-year forecasts of performance recovery, but one must seriously doubt about the extent to which the managers believed in achieving the scenarios they themselves had written. Still, in contrast to such pitiful conditions domestically, there exists an area where plans are under way to augment production facilities across the board and should effectuate broad-scale projects for increasing production. It is the Asia-Pacific region, and what is doing it is Japanese capital centered on electronics, communications, and home appliances. In Malaysia by the end of 1994, electronic parts such as variable resistors, tuners, as well as floppy-disc drives will go up by 1.3 to five times. And in Thailand, parts for microwave ovens and for nonportable VTR's [video tape recorders] will go up by 1.5 to two times. Furthermore, in Singapore, projects are under way to double computer peripheral equipment, microshafts, and so on. Facilities investment to expand the scale of production is starting up across the board at local plants backed by Japanese capital. From the fact that the number of imported color TV sets has for the first time surpassed the number exported (1993), one may see at what a rapid pace the transfer of the production base of our nation's manufacturing industries is proceeding. It is not only in color TV sets that imports have quantitatively surpassed exports. Many of the manufacturers of electronic parts established as local corporations are actively pushing the reimportation of locally made parts. Not to mention the parts for nonportable VTR's, but the scale of increase in finished goods imports also reached 50 percent (relative to 1992) in 1993. Compared to the 30-percent reduction recorded for the exports of these, it is a great contrast. "Technology Transfer" Becoming High Tech The many Japanese-owned local plants are already entering their third stage of development. The initial expansion era of the first stage had a goal of using the cheap labor power available locally. It was a response to the continuing keynote of the high yen, and local plants were accorded the role of mere bases for supplying parts for Japan. For electronic parts, however, such a primitive stage is long past. From Japan's viewpoint, the parts-supply bases have evolved into bases for exporting parts to other regions, including Japan. The respective production bases were reorganized from an initial "development of points" to a "development of areas," and they entered into the second stage, that of producing the best suited parts in the best suited regions on the most suitable scale. Now, in the third stage we are coming into an era in which they make the parts locally, Japanese assemblers everywhere assemble the products locally, and sell the products locally; and at the same time, they export the products to Japan and elsewhere. Looking at durable consumer goods, local buying power is rising sharply, as seen in China. An age is approaching in which the advent of the so-called mass-consumption society can be foreseen. The strategy and evolution of assembling locally, selling locally or exporting finished products to other regions is being advanced by the local corporations themselves. Along with such changes, "technology transfers" to these localities are beginning to take complex aspects. Technology transfers from Japanese business can be classified broadly into five types. One can see the inevitability of having to proceed toward progressively higher levels of technology transfer. Type 1. Transfer of skills: At local factories created by extending capital directly, the processes for making things are taught to employees and leaders. Guidance for each line is administered by on-the-job training, and when production of new parts is begun, knowledge of the broader scope needed for plant production is transferred to the local people. Type 2. Sophistication of transferred technology: Cases in which transferred technology reaches the stage of giving birth to new lines are not rare. Even the same resistors as are used for radio-cassette players have become producible locally for high-quality hi-fi equipment. Other examples are such things as going higher level such as by taking one cylinder for a VTR cassette player and going from those for two-head machines to four-heads and then on to six-heads. As this proceeds, the technology level is approaching high tech. By seeking ever higher added value locally, it is starting to give rise to successive new lines. Type 3. Local transfer of design and quality assurance sectors: Taking up the third stage already discussed, such things as the introduction of CAD (computer aided design) systems have come to be worked on locally. Aiming for the optimal supply bases for the entire East Asian region, they need to go not only into product aftercare and so gain the ability to provide repair and replacement parts, but also to meet ISO (International Standardization Organization) levels. By going through such processes, local plants will proceed toward higher orders of specific technology. The needed technology is brought in from Japan. Type 4. Transfer of "manufacturing processes:" This is the formula by which Japanese firms handle the manufacturing process up to a certain stage and shift completely to local areas certain processes up through finishing the product. Japan becomes the supply base for semi-processed parts, and the local plants take these and do the finishing of the products. Needless to say, know-how for product inspection and local transfer of reliability-testing sensors goes with that. Except for special high-level parts technology, the all-out transfer of production technologies must proceed in this way. Type 5. Transfer of R&D: At present, transfers of research and development sectors occur only in the early stages. However, what will come after a unified development of skills and technology will inevitably be the completion of a "once-through system of making things" which will mean localizing the capacity to improve and develop products and parts. Japanese firms that assert they are aiming for the shortest possible way to reach that goal are growing in number. In the past, if one asked who it was that bore the burden for types from one to five, it naturally was the midsized small and tiniest subcontracting plants for parts within Japan. It is already clear what the above described transfer of production bases and technology will bring next for them in Japan. By avoiding the subject of industrial hollowing that has raised concerns lately, we become unable to discuss Japan's economy and business climate henceforth, and the future of subcontracted parts industries and, of course, employment. The situation has not changed a bit, either, for any discussion of breaking out of "the 1990's slump." Dilemmas of Technology Transfer and Employment Just as it was for restoring Japan's postwar economy, it is valid also for Asia's NIE's [newly industrializing economies] and ASEAN nations to accept technology transfer from the technologically advanced nations and follow the road to growth by using that as a nucleus and improving on it as a way to advance. Based on the assumption that NIE's and ASEAN nations will in due course be able to overtake and pass the north's advanced nations, the thought that conditions for competition in trade globally will be equalized will lead to a way for preserving fairness and equity in international trade. Conversely, a hegemonic strategy such as rejects the principle of equalizing the terms of exchange--between the north's industrial goods and the south's resources--would eventually come to be boycotted strongly by the world. In that sense, for the technologically advanced nations themselves, including Japan, working actively for technology transfer may be called their international duty. The problem is how should that be advanced in equilibrium with the hollowing out of domestic industry? Realistically, it comes to the point that one cannot avoid tackling it with a broader point of view. In dealing with the knotty issue of technology transfer and industrial hollowing, the strategic argument is often made for "transferring low tech while keeping the high tech." With that in mind, the ultra-optimistic argument is quite glibly put forth that "Japanese business can survive by commercializing the next-generation technology." As for the first, just as a clash of views has arisen over the transfer of VTR technology to China, a strategy of distinguishing between low tech and high tech will be rejected by the industrial policies of the side accepting the transfers. That the latter idea is too sanguine goes without saying. For instance, not even the buds of any commercialization of such next-generation technology as room-temperature nuclear fusion or biotechnology are to be seen. Even if these did come into being as new industries, they would not likely be the labor-intensive type of industry; and expecting too much of them as a solution for employment problems that are anticipated is out of the question. According to predictions by the Sanwa Research Institute, if direct overseas investment by Japanese business rises henceforth at a 10-percent pace year after year, employment opportunities within the nation amounting to 950,000 persons will be lost by the year 2000. And, if it rises at a 20 percent rate, employment opportunities for 1.26 million persons will disappear, it says. These figures are huge ones surpassing the current number of unemployed within businesses in the manufacturing industry. Added to employment adjustments responding to the "1990's slump," having this much reduction in employment predicted for five or six years from now speaks to the peril of the unemployment rate in Japan shooting up to an acute level exceeding the levels of the United States and Europe. Production Base for Key Devices What sorts of directions might the strategic decisions at the level of individual corporations be taking now? It is a question of guarding against hollowing out at home as well as how to proceed with technology transfer with nations of the Asian region. How those choices are made may constitute a crossroads that will determine the future of Japanese business. Certain businesses seek to gamble on making their parts even more advanced. For the production technology of VTR decks, they have a strategy for advanced development of parts whereby a number of parts are linked together by integrated circuits, with production of the key devices being concentrated in Japan. The advanced technology that puts the cylinder and pre-amp into one chip necessitates a general mobilization of high technology, such as semiconductor technology and miniaturizing and precision processing technology. It is believed that in the regions and nations receiving the technology transfers they still have to go some distance to reach this advanced technology level. In addition, the added value of this kind of key device makes up 60 to 70 percent of the VTR deck as a whole. It is said that it can be one of the few profitmaking domains within Japan's "building of things." This is not to say that the technological fields to remain in Japan are to be the existing high-tech areas, but that we should trim back to such fields as are being newly developed and thus to make higher technology possible for more products. It would mean positioning plants within Japan as production bases for such new key devices and endeavoring to maintain them as places of employment. It can be called an option showing possibilities. In other words, Japan--the producer and exporter of finished goods--would change into a parts supply base. In this way we would be aiming to circumvent reductions in employment opportunities. Still, the businesses involved think that, despite such efforts by companies, a shrinkage on the order of one third might be unavoidable for employment in the production stage. A part of the stern reality is coming to the fore. Can We Counter the Big Three? A hardship even worse than in electronics is facing the auto industry. The cost advantage of Japanese cars is rapidly being lost in the "1990's recession." In this industry the strategy pursued in the 1980's for boosting competitiveness faces the contradiction that in the 1990's it is changing totally into a heavy burden. The competitiveness created in the 1980's by the strategy of production of many models but small quantities, short cycles, and high value-added was transformed in the 1990's when it ran into the sharp drop in demand. That is because the strategy that gave birth to competitiveness had become the cause of totally adverse effects. The Big Three of the United States, our international rivals, have begun moving to transfer their production strongholds to Mexico, and the European companies have gone into eastern Europe and Spain. Needless to say, it is a strategy of again recovering a powerful cost advantage by a shift of production bases. To counter such global mobility of production strongpoints, Japanese makers also may have to move to shift into the Asia-Pacific region. But it is clear that this option is not something of a kind that is easily managed. As distinct from electronics, the cultivation of parts industries for autos in the Asia-Pacific region will face many obstacles. One is that the policies of the local governments toward the auto industry have still not settled on whether or not they should give priority to domestic production. Hence, the basic conditions differ from the expansion of the Big Three into Mexico. On the other hand, bringing the technological level of local parts makers up to that of domestic keiretsu subcontractors would take far too much time. And yet, to advance capital aborad with domestic subcontractor firms, the production scales in the local areas are far too small. The 1980's strategy of moving into an area by somehow building a beachhead centering on the knockdown (local assembly) formula is about to go against them here, too. Yet, as mentioned before, domestic subcontractors' ability to cut costs further has already attained its limit. One symbolic example of this is the failure (last October) of Taiyo Kogyosho, which had been a primary subcontractor for Toyota Autos and supply source for Toyoda Steel Works (pressed parts). The company's order volume had fallen to one third of its peak time. The number of failures in steel and metals located in the central region has become 2.4 times that of the same period last year. But, this, too, is but a phenomenon showing an example of the distress the auto industry is experiencing. At the subcontracting stage--the base of the pyramid--the reality of hollowing out is now close at hand. With all this going on, it is not conceivable that Japanese auto makers will easily have available the approach of recovering cost competitiveness vis a vis European and the U.S. cars by seeking to transfer such production bases in the way that the electronic parts industry and other assemblers have done. Here, too, a new peril has arisen for Japanese industry. The "1990's slump" has begun to show another of its new sobering aspects.
