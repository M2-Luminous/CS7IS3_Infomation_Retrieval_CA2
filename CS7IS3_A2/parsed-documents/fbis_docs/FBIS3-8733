Greece strongly opposes that FYRM, which seceded from the former Yugoslav Federation in 1991, should be recognized under the name of Macedonia, arguing that the name is related to the Greek history and that it shows Skopje's territorial claims on the Greek province of the same name. When some member-countries of the European Union (E.U.), despite Greek resistance (Greece is also a E.U. member) in late 1993 recognized FYRM and established diplomatic relations with it, Athens imposed a trade embargo on FYRM. Regardless of the damage caused by the Greek blockade, which adds to almost three billion dollars of FYRM's loss caused by its abiding by U.N. anti-Yugoslav sanctions, FYRM's leadership is not prepared to make concessions and compromises, primarily because of the parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for November. Three of the four members of the ruling coalition -- Macedonia's Social-Democrats, Liberals and Socialists -- fear that their yielding in this dispute would make the opposition call them "traitors of national interests." The fourth coalition partner (the Party for Democratic Prosperity) which rallies ethnic Albanians, fears that FYRM might take a name which would point at the Slav features of the nation living in it, thus undermining the party's assertion that "the Albanians represent an autochthonous nation in the territory." Ethnic Albanian parties in FYRM urge the authorities in Skopje to recognize the status of the Albanian national minority in FYRM as that of a nation. They want to proclaim territorial and political autonomy in western Macedonia, where the Albanian population represents the majority. Political analysts in Skopje assess that the Greek-Macedonian dialogue will yield no results before the elections are completed and the new government established in FYRM, meaning, according to their predictions, that the current state of affairs would be frozen for at least one year's time. [passage omitted] Such moves, according to observers, aggravate the already bad Greek-Macedonian relations and justify the claims of the circles in Athens that authorities in Skopje have "territorial claims on Greece."
