At present, 18.8 million hectares of land in the territory of four CIS states (Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan) are employed as fall zones, and the Plesetsk cosmodrome uses almost half of this--9 million hectares of Russian land--for this purpose. The Ecos program to improve the ecological situation in the fall zones, which involves the cleanup of fallen spent rocket elements, a decrease of rocket fuel remnants from spent carrier-rocket stages, and a reduction in the amount and size of fall zones, is at present being implemented using Russian Defense Ministry funds. The largest fall zone area--in Archangel oblast--is 3.5 million hectares (almost 6 percent of the oblast's total area). Ecological cleanup subunits begin their field season there every July. The servicemen gather into containers the fragments of carrier-rocket stages, which are then taken to storage depots. Almost 4.5 million hectares of land in Russia is used as fall zones for the spent parts of carrier-rockets launched from the Baykonur cosmodrome, over half of this land being located in Tomsk Oblast (about 2 million hectares) and Novosibirsk Oblast (almost 1 million hectares). In 1993, the fall zone areas for the first stages of the R-7A family of carrier-rockets (``Soyuz'' and ``Molniya'') were reduced by 10 percent. This process is continuing. About 500,000 hectares will be returned to users in Tomsk and Novosibirsk Oblasts because seven fall zones have ceased to be used. In this connection, specialists emphasize that the problem of reducing fall zone areas can be radically tackled only if one employs the controlled descent of spent carrier-rocket elements on aerodynamic structures that can be unfurled such as parachutes, paragliders, and air balloons. However the Russians have no money to fund this work. The Russian Federation Parachute-Building Research Institute has had to develop a gliding parachute, although it was indeed for the French Ariane-5 carrier-rocket.
