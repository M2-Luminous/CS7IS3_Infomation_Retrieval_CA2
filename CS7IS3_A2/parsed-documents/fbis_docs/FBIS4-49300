Chen Liyou, deputy governor of north China's Hebei Province, said that the Bohai economic rim is China's third economic booming area following the Zhujiang and Chang Jiang River Deltas. Located at the center of the Bohai rim, Hebei should give top priority to the development of regional economic co-operation, he said. He added that redoubled efforts should be made to strengthen infrastructure facilities such as highways and ports in the province to promote regional prosperity. Hebei serves as a major gateway for the country's coal exports from inland provinces and also as a link for other provinces and cities within the economic rim, including Liaoning, Shanxi and Shandong Provinces, and Beijing and Tianjin Cities, the official said. The province also boasts geographical advantages and rich natural resources. It has a coastline of 487 km. He noted that the provincial government has decided to work hard to upgrade its numerous state-owned enterprises in the metallurgy, chemicals and building materials industries. The province has also made great efforts to harness the Yanshan and Taihang Mountains to bolster economic development and social stability in the area of Beijing and Tianjin and on the north China plain. In infrastructure construction the province has listed ten major projects to fit in the development of the Bohai economic rim, the official said. Talking about railway construction, he said that emphasis will be placed on the building of the Shenmu-Huanghua Railway leading from northern Shaanxi Province to Bohai Bay, and the Handan-Jinan Railway from Handan City in Hebei Province to Jinan, capital of Shandong Province. At the same time, he said, the construction of the northern section of the Beijing-Shenzhen and Beijing-Shanghai Expressways will also be accelerated this year. And the pace of building other expressways and highways in the province will be quickened. He added that an expressway and highway network will soon be built in the ring area, including roads and highways for coal transportation. In addition, construction of ports and airports in this area will be strengthened. The focus will be on building the Huanghua Port, the Jingtang Port at Tangshan City and the Shijiazhuang International Airport. Speaking of energy resources, the deputy governor said that to ease the bottleneck in power supply in the area, the province will step up the building of its own power stations while importing electricity transmitted from Shanxi Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He said that in telecommunications construction nearly 20 national and local optical fiber lines will be built within the province. The official said that the focus of iron and steel industrial construction will be on the expansion and rebuilding of six major steel production bases to produce a total of more than five million tons a year. The province will also channel more funds toward the development of several water-control projects to meet the demand for drinking water in the Beijing-Tianjin area.
