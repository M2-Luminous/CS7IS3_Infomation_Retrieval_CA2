It is a standard one. Aleksey Vedenkin set up his headquarters here at the beginning of the year. Vedenkin is the "number two" man behind Zhirinovskiy, the ultranationalist victor in the Russian elections, who has been frightening the world with threats to use nuclear weapons for weeks and has been making constant headlines. The room is full of files. There are thousand of photographs and some videocassettes on the window sill. There is a pile of business cards on his desk. The telephone keeps ringing. "They are businessmen," said Vedenkin, "who want to have contacts with us. They are literally falling over each other to get through the door." Vedenkin took a sip of soda and with an air of superiority said: "They know who they have to bank on. Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy] will be the new Russian president and I will be his foreign minister. At the moment, I am the Liberal Democratic Party's [LDP] financial adviser and its spokesman on Europe." Zhirinovskiy's LDP, with 25.3 percent of the vote, was the clear winner in the Russian elections. In the new Duma (parliament), it has 66 seats. Right after the first parliament meeting Zhirinovskiy presented himself as the "new strong man" and announced the formation of a coalition with the communists. Vedenkin said: "Thus, we finally have a say. In addition, we are Russia's richest party. I could rent entire floors of hotels, but that is something that we do not do." Vedenkin's contact man in Austria is 60-year-old Svetoslav Stoilov, a Bulgarian by birth who has lived in Austria for about 30 years. Stoilov has placed his automobile, office, and business contacts in Austria at the disposal of his Russian friends. He also organized Zhirinovskiy's trip to Bulgaria, which provoked a great furor. While Zhirinovskiy then flew directly back to Moscow from Bulgaria, Vedenkin, his companion, the 23-year-old Dimitriy Klinkov, and a bodyguard flew back to Vienna. Dimitriy Klinkov has lived in Austria for two years and is employed as a commercial director at the IBC trading company in Carinthia. He acts as an interpreter and money courier for the Zhirinovskiy team. Apparatchiks and Ex-Nazis Working over a period of a few months, Vedenkin and his colleagues have succeeded in establishing a network of companies all over Europe. Zhirinovskiy's "Liberal Democratic Party" already has subsidiaries in Austria, Germany, Italy, France, Holland, and Switzerland. The "Russian Hitler's" team has been successful at skillfully operating on two levels: On one level, with his constant provocations, Zhirinovskiy keeps making headlines. Recently, he condemned President Clinton: "If he does not want to shake hands with me, then he should stay at home and play the saxophone." Thus, all public interest has focused on the figurehead, Zhirinovskiy. Is the Mastermind a German? Vedenkin, on the other hand, stays in the background and directs things: He links up old Nazis such as the notorious German Gerhard Frey (the publisher of NATIONAL-ZEITUNG) or Edwin Neuwirth, the Carinthia-based timber trader, with the nomenklatura in Russia and the former east bloc. Werner Girke from Berlin is supposed to be one of the masterminds. In the GDR, Girke was the financial director of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany]. He had the authority to manage SED bank accounts in the FRG, Switzerland, and Luxembourg. Following the collapse of the GDR, he transferred millions for the SED successor party, the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]. He transferred about 100 million Austrian schillings to a Luxembourg bank account. He received the 100 million in cash and without signing a receipt. However, last summer, he returned the money to the Berlin Trust Agency. It is, however, suspected that Girke transferred millions for the KGB as well as the PDS. Werner Girke was "on vacation" with Zhirinovskiy in Carinthia. He was accompanied by a smartly dressed man with gray hair who spoke with a Saxony area accent. Vedenkin said evasively: "All I can say about the second man is that in the past he had quite a say in the GDR's financial sector." Vedenkin went on to say: "Girke is one of our best friends. I spent six weeks with him in the fall and worked in his office in Berlin. He advised us and gave me a lot of good tips. The German authorities have know that for a long time. During my stay, the fiscal authorities even conducted an audit at Girke's office. No irregularities were found." Zhirinovskiy on the NEWS Telephone Talking about the special relationship between Girke and his leader, Vedenkin said: "Girke visited also visited us in Carinthia during our vacation. However, he certainly did not move any millions around for us." The short, thick-set 30-year-old paused and said: "Zhirinovskiy will confirm that, let's phone Volfovich." Vedenkin dialed a Moscow number. At the first attempt, a male voice replied at the other end of the line. Shortly afterward, Zhirinovskiy himself was on the line. He does not talk, but shouts: "Yes, I know Girke well. He is a respected businessman and a good friend of mine. However, his T.V.O neither financed me or my election campaign. The searches at his home are simply an act of revenge, because Girke invited me to Germany. Unfortunately, he sent the invitation to the German Embassy in Sofia, and that is how the authorities established that I am in contact with Girke." Zhirinovskiy's voice became hoarse as he shouted down the phone. Then, he went on the offensive: "The KGB no longer exists, just as the CPSU no longer exists. In the past, the state controlled their accounts, and today, those accounts are controlled by former party members, who have transferred billions to the West following the putsch. Why is no one angry about that? There are also hundreds of former Communist Party companies in Austria, which are now doing marvelous business. These people are suddenly highly respected in the West. However, the game is over now." Toward the end of the conversation, he announced that we wants to visit France and Spain in the next few weeks and also expects Germany to grant him an entry visa once again: "If I insulted the German people, then I want to apologize for that in every possible way. I am very sorry, it was not my intention to do so. Please pass that on to my German friends." Then Zhirinovskiy put the phone down, but not before he had praised "Austria, that wonderful land of culture." We have reported on how much "culture" Zhirinovskiy experienced in Austria. However, the fact is that he returned to Vienna after his sojourn in Carinthia. He rented a penthouse apartment on the tenth floor of Vienna's Plaza Hotel before leaving for Bulgaria on Christmas Day. Actually, Zhirinovskiy also wanted to visit Slovenia and Croatia. Belgrade was also on his itinerary. The 57-year-old Montenegrin Petar Ivanovic wanted to organize a trip to Belgrade for Zhirinovskiy. Ivanovic operates the "Oweka Trading" company, the headquarters of which are on Vienna's Neuer Markt. "Oweka" is involved in trade between the former East Bloc and the West: "We buy and sell oil, copper, steel, everything," argued Petar Ivanovic and pointed out that his "Oweka" had sales of almost 700 million in 1990. In addition, Ivanovic is also an executive director for numerous other companies. "At the moment," conceded Ivanovic, "some of our companies are experiencing problems. The UN embargo against Serbia and Montenegro has particularly affected our companies." Is that why he is trying to get close to Zhirinovskiy (Ivanovic hired a special stretched Mercedes limousine for his trip to Carinthia)? Ivanovic: "Of course, Zhirinovskiy is the new man in Russia. Everyone who wants to do business with Moscow must come into contact with him." Sinister Billionaire While Ivanovic was only one of the businessmen who just wanted "to establish contact" with Zhirinovskiy, Zhirinovskiy's true financial backer is supposed to be a woman. Aleksey Vedenkin said: "She is French and is called Miriam Selen." [name as published] She is supposed to be close to Jean Marie LePen. Vedenkin boasted: "She has contacts at all the highest levels and is considered one of the richest women in Europe." However, neither the editors of LE FIGARO's commercial section nor DER SPIEGEL's Paris bureau had heard of a "super-rich woman" of that name. Broom Handles Made of Titanium However, having lit his tenth Marlboro within half an hour, Vedenkin insisted that "the world will be astonished when it sees what doors this businesswoman will open for us." He drew on his cigarette with obvious pleasure, then blurted out: "Both Zhirinovskiy and myself know exactly which members of the Communist Party have transferred billions to the West and are still doing so." He then cited an example: "Recently, a high-ranking CPSU functionary sent three train loads of brooms to Europe. Everyone was wondering why one would send brooms from Russia to Europe. The broom handles were not made of aluminum, but of titanium." Business transactions worth billions are supposed to have been carried out in this way through Western front companies. "They trade weapons and drugs, and launder money. We will bring these people back to Moscow and make them appear in court. The contents of their bank accounts will be seized, and we will use the money to fly in food from Austria." However, before then, Aleksey Vedenkin has got another problem: His Austrian visa is about to expire.
