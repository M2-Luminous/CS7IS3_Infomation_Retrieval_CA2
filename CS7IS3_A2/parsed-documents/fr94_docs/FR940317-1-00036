FR940317-1-00036 FR940317-1-00011 c. Advance Payments for Small Fees 25. Section 9(f) states that the Commission's regulations shall require the payment of ``small'' regulatory fees ``in advance for a number of years not to exceed the term of the license held by the payor.'' 47 U.S.C. 159(f)(1). Based on the legislative history, for the 1994 fiscal year we propose to require advance payment for regulatory fees in Private Radio services. Due to the large volume of Private Radio licensees and other authorizations, we believe that assessment and collection of these small regulatory fees on an annual basis would be very costly and would likely result in a larger number of delinquent payments unless such payments coincide with the beginning of the license term. 26. We propose to require those who are assessed a small regulatory fee to pay their annual fee for their entire license or authorization term. These regulatory fees would generally be paid concurrently with an applicant's new, renewal or reinstatement application. We propose to require persons holding lifetime restricted radiotelephone and radio operator licenses or permits for commercial use to pay a one-time regulatory fee of $105.00 to cover the entire lifetime license or permit term. If the fee amount is adjusted subsequent to a regulatee's advance payment, the regulatee would not be subject to the new fee amount until its next renewal application and regulatory fee is due. Regulatees thus would only be subject to the fee amounts in effect for the fiscal year in which their application is filed. Finally, for the first round of fee payments for regulatees in the private radio service, we may require payments subsequent to the time when the application is actually filed. 11 11 We note that some existing private radio licensees will be reclassified as Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) providers pursuant to section 332 of the Communications Act. 47 U.S.C. 332(c), (d). To the extent that private radio licensees will have paid their ``small'' fees in advance for the term of their licenses, we would apply the advanced payment toward any new regulatory fee requirement imposed upon such licensees as a result of being reclassified as CMRS. 2. Method of Payment and Payment Location 27. We propose to use the same general requirements and procedures for the payment of both application fees and regulatory fees. First, in addition to the payment methods in section 1.1108(a) of our Rules, we propose to allow the filing of fee payments by electronic means. We will first allow electronic fee payments only on a limited, experimental basis. We also propose to allow payment by credit card in some circumstances. The credit cards which will be accepted are VISA and Mastercard. When a credit card is employed for a fee payment, the entire fee payment must be made by a single credit card transaction. 28. Second, we propose to allow the use of one payment instrument to cover multiple standard regulatory fee payments and, where applicable, multiple installments. 12 Our new remittance form and payment procedures would allow individual entities to use a single payment method or instrument to pay the standard regulatory fees for each Mass Media and Common Carrier license or authorization it holds. Each individual regulatee will be solely responsible for accurately accounting for and listing each license or authorization and the number of subscribers, antennas, access lines, or other relevant units, and for paying the proper cumulative amount by the single instrument. 12 Since small regulatory fees will be paid at the same time as application fees, our current application fee-filing procedures requiring one instrument per application would apply. However, we are proposing below to modify the one-instrument/one-application rule to allow one payment instrument to cover multiple applications filed in the same bank lockbox. 29. Finally, in order to efficiently process Mass Media and Common Carrier regulatory fee payments, we propose to set up a single lockbox at the lockbox bank, separate from the lockboxes established for applications and application fees. Regulatory fee payments for both services are to be submitted to this lockbox. This will allow regulatees in the Mass Media and Common Carrier services to combine payments for different fee categories. However, since regulatory fees for Private Radio services will be due at the same time as applications and application fees, these regulatory fees, must be paid to the same lockbox as the application fees. Because they are paid to different lockboxes, Private Radio fees may not be combined with Mass Media and Common Carrier regulatory fees. We request comments on the above proposals. Enforcement of Regulatory Fees Statute and Regulations 30. Section 9(c) of the Communication Act provides the Commission with three methods of enforcing the statute: monetary penalties for late payment, dismissal of applications, and revocation. 47 U.S.C. 159(c). In order to ensure an effective regulatory fee collection program, we intend to use these enforcement mechanisms to the fullest extent possible. In addition, the Commission will pursue all available remedies against delinquent payers under the Debt Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3711 et seq., and related statutory provisions. We invite comment on the proposals which follow. 1. Penalties for Late Payment 31. We propose to incorporate section 9(c)(1) into our rules. Thus, we will charge a 25 percent penalty to any regulatee that fails to pay its regulatory fee (or installment) in a timely manner. We intend to consider a payment to be late, or ``not paid in a timely manner,'' if the full regulatory fee amount or the entire installment payment is not received at the lockbox bank by the due date specified by the Commission. A payment would also be considered late if the payment (check, bank draft or other means) is not collectible. 13 13 We will also continue our policy of not accepting instruments other than cashier's checks for payers who are notified that other payment methods are unacceptable.
