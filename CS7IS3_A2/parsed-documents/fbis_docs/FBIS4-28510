In announcing his planned visit to Korea, Carter made no mention of the nuclear dispute. But it was obvious he intends to take up the question with North Korean President Kim Il-song when he said he hopes to "discuss the important issues of the day with the leaders of the area." He also could act as "a messenger" between the leaders of South and North Korea since he said he plans to visit Seoul following his stay in Pyongyang. Despite efforts by Carter himself to play down the significance of his trip, official expectations in Washington are apparently running high as a White House spokesman told reporters, unsolicited, that Carter is expected to meet Kim Il-song. Moreover, the State Department confirmed that it has already briefed the former President on the nuclear issue. Such high expectations are also based on Carter's experience as a peace mediator in Panama, Nicaragua, Sudan and the Middle East. Some Korea watchers in Washington point out that Pyongyang has shown a sympathetic attitude toward Carter and therefore, if there is anyone best suited to helping resolve the North Korean nuclear row, it must be the former U.S. President. On the other side of the coin, however, is a sizeable body of opinion in the U.S. Capital that too much significance should not be attached to Carter's visit. Commentators in this camp note that Carter's trip is being realized at "Pyongyang's initiative" and not Washington's. In order, perhaps, to discourage the public from expecting too much, Carter himself noted in his statement that North Korea has issued many invitations in the past, making it clear the upcoming visit has not been "hastily arranged" for any particular purpose. One State Department official involved in the dispute over North Korea's nuclear program said there have indeed been suggestions in some quarters that Washington send a special envoy to Pyongyang. But the official said he wanted to make it unequivocally clear that the question of sending a special envoy to Pyongyang has not been studied. Nevertheless, any new attempt to resolve the issue appears to be worth watching as the United States is experiencing difficulties in putting together a Security Council resolution on economic sanctions and North Korea is reacting strongly against moves by Washington and its allies.
