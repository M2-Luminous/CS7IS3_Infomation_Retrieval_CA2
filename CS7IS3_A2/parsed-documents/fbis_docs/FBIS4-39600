However, he is very critical about the attempt of the Federation Council to considerably increase defense spending. In an exclusive interview with Interfax on Wednesday evening Rybkin said the swift approval of the budget by the Duma was no surprise for him. "I believed that the Duma would have the will, reason and endurance to do that", the speaker said. For the first time in three or four years the parliament tried to pull together the scattered financial resources of the country. The speaker said that certain figures in the Federation Council did not want this to happen and they might attempt to tear up the budget. If anyone in the Council of the Federation tries to destroy the budget, Rybkin said, he is ready to tell the public who they used to be and why they have been undermining the budget for four years. Last week the Federation Council spoke in favor of considerably increasing spending, in particular earmarking 55 trillion rubles instead of 37.1 for defense. On Wednesday the Duma approved in the second reading the federal budget without making any changes to the revenue, spending or deficit. The Duma accepted the proposal of its budget committee to increase defense spending from 37.1 to 40.6 trillion rubles through a redistribution of resources in the budget.
