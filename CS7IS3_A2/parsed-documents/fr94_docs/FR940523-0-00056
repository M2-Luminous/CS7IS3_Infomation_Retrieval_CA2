FR940523-0-00056 FR940523-0-00014 Finally, one commenter suggested that ยง765.2(d) of the proposed rule be modified to clarify that expenses incurred as a result of an NRC directive, an Agreement State directive, or both, are eligible for reimbursement. A mill may have been regulated by both the NRC and an Agreement State during the mill's history, and may have therefore incurred costs for activities required by directives from both regulatory authorities. This commenter urged that references to ``NRC or Agreement State'' be revised to read ``NRC and/or an Agreement State.'' The Department has retained the proposed language but wishes to clarify that use of the phrase ``NRC or an Agreement State'' refers to NRC, an Agreement State, or both. C. Determining the Federal Reimbursement Ratio The proposed rule provided that the Department would establish a ``Federal reimbursement ratio'' to determine the portion of costs of remedial action attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States. Under the proposed rule, the Federal reimbursement ratio would be the ratio of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material to total dry short tons of byproduct material present at each site on the date of enactment of Title X. Some commenters suggested that the Department should allow licensees to use a method other than the proposed rule's tonnage or quantity-based approach to establish a site's Federal reimbursement ratio. These commenters argued that at some sites the tonnage-based Federal reimbursement ratio may not accurately reflect the true costs of remediation attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States. These commenters also suggested that the rule allow greater flexibility in the methods available to determine the Federal reimbursement ratio. In particular, these commenters requested that the rule allow such ratio to be based on the acreage covered by Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material compared to the total acreage covered by all dry short tons of byproduct material at the site. Title X limits reimbursement to costs ``attributable to'' byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States, but does not require a specific method for determining how to attribute costs to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States. Section 1001(b)(2)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)(A)) establishes a $5.50 per dry short ton of byproduct material limit on reimbursement. This indicates that the tonnage approach is an appropriate method for determining the Federal portion of remedial action costs. However, the tonnage approach may not, in some cases, most accurately reflect the portion of costs attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States. As the Department recognized in the ``Commingled Uranium Tailings Study, Volume II: Technical Report,'' (Department of Energy, June 30, 1982) different approaches for allocating costs attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States may be appropriate, depending on the unique characteristics at each site. Accordingly, the final rule has been revised to allow a licensee to demonstrate that an alternative method for determining the Federal reimbursement ratio, other than the tonnage approach, should be used. In order to make this demonstration, the final rule requires the licensee to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that such alternative method is more accurate than the tonnage-based approach in delineating between costs of remedial action attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States and costs attributable to other byproduct material at the site. Any licensee requesting that the Department consider an alternative approach for establishing a site's Federal reimbursement ratio, must submit the request in writing, together with any information the licensee wants the Department to consider in support of the request. The Department reserves the right to approve or reject the alternative method, based on the Department's determination of whether such method may provide an effective, accurate, and verifiable means of attributing costs of remedial action for byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States. Regardless of the methodology used to establish the Federal reimbursement ratio, the statutory ceiling on reimbursements to licensees will not change. D. Definition of Byproduct Material and Dry Short Tons of Byproduct Material; and Determination of Reimbursement Ceiling at Each Active Uranium Processing Site One commenter disagreed with the proposed rule's definition of ``dry short tons of byproduct material.'' This commenter requested that the definition be expanded to include other wastes as well as tailings. For the reasons stated below, the Department has not adopted this approach. Section 1001(b)(2)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296(a)(b)(2)(A)) requires that the ceiling for uranium mill tailings sites shall not exceed an amount equal to $5.50 multiplied by the dry short tons of byproduct material onsite on the date of Title X's enactment and generated as an incident of sales to the United States. Although Title X incorporates by reference the Atomic Energy Act's definition of ``byproduct material,'' 4 the phrase ``dry short ton of byproduct material'' is not defined in either Act. While the definition of ``byproduct material'' could be read to suggest that the term includes wastes other than tailings, section 1001(b)(2)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)(A)) appears to use the phrase ``uranium mill tailings'' interchangeably in the same sentence with the phrase ``byproduct material.'' The apparent interchangeable use of these terms is further reflected by the fact that House Bill 776 5 , which ultimately was enacted, established a reimbursement limit of $5.50 per ``dry short tons of byproduct material ,'' (emphasis added) while the section-by-section analysis of the House Energy and Commerce Report 6 accompanying the bill described the limit as ``$5.50 per dry ton for uranium tailings '' (emphasis added). 4 Section 1004(2) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;3(2)) provides that the term ``byproduct material'' has the meaning given that term in section 11e.(2) of the Atomic Energy Act, which defines ``byproduct material'' as ``the tailings or wastes produced from the extraction or concentration of uranium or thorium from any ore processed primarily for its source material content.'' 5 Section 1001(b)(2)(A) of H.R. 776, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992). 6 See H.REP. NO. 474, 102 Cong., 2d Sess. pt 1, at 205 (1992), reprinted in 1992 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2028. Consequently, for the purposes of this rule's maximum reimbursement ceiling determination for active uranium processing site licensees and Federal reimbursement ratio for uranium and thorium licensees, the Department is defining the phrase ``dry short ton of byproduct material'' in the final rule to mean ``the quantity of tailings generated from the extraction and processing of 2,000 pounds of uranium or thorium ore-bearing rock.'' One commenter requested that the proposed definition of ``tailings'' be revised to conform to the definition established by section 101(8) of UMTRCA (42 U.S.C. 7911(8)). The Department agrees with this comment and has revised the definition accordingly.
