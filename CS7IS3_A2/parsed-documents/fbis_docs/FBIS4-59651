In an address to the EU Council this evening, the foreign minister said that Egypt is currently studying and analyzing this matter from all aspects. "We are ready to begin discussions with the EU on a new partnership agreement in the near future," he said. The minister began his speech to the Council meeting, which is devoted for Egypt, by emphasizing that many developments and changes have taken place in Europe and in the Middle East since the last meeting between the Council and Egypt in July 1992. In Europe, he noted, the EU itself has been launched, reflecting positively on the temporary and future role to be played on the level of European relations. In the Middle East, important changes have taken place, notably the 4 May Cairo Agreement between Israel and the PLO. The agreement, he said, opens up important possibilities for achieving peace, stability, and security in this region and also reflects positively on regional and multilateral cooperation. Among the other changes in the Middle East, Musa pointed out, is the progress in the peace talks between Israel and other sides, and the progress in the multilateral talks, where a protocol for economic cooperation between Israel and the PLO was signed. All this, Musa said, creates a positive climate to advance cooperation and economic, political, and security relations between the states of the EU and our region. He added: We hope the EU will play its role in entrenching this cooperation. This, he went on, should not be at the expense of bilateral cooperation between the EU and the region, but should serve as an additional avenue to help regional developmental projects and projects in the occupied territories. The foreign minister reviewed Egypt's efforts to implement the comprehensive economic reform plan in Egypt, the positive results of the first phase of the plan, and the start of the second phase in a way that will open the door to all-out development in Egypt where the private sector plays an important role. 'Amr Musa reviewed the efforts Egypt has already made on its economic reform and privatization programs. He noted these efforts and the successes in this field. He stressed the role of the EU in supporting Egypt's efforts and backing this program "which we are following up with serious steps." He noted his country's efforts in confronting its other social and economic problems, beginning with finding solutions to unemployment and confronting the housing problems. He also noted that Egypt's concern about the population problem is apparent in the fact that Egypt will host the international population conference in September. In discussing cultural relations between Egypt and the EU, the Egyptian foreign minister highlighted the need to make full and ideal use of EU allocations of funds and other aid to Egypt within the framework of the fourth protocol. The Egyptian foreign minister stressed the importance of continuing European investment's role in bolstering the economic reform process and providing easy-term loans, especially since the World Bank report on Egypt released on 18 April 1994 praised the progress in economic reform, particularly the privatization process. 'Amr Musa noted that Egypt still has to scientifically and constructively confront the challenges of developing its human resources, encouraging exports, decreasing social burdens, protecting the environment, and encouraging investments. It needs to do all this to implement the economic reform programs, make some progress, and decrease the burden of the low-income and working-class sectors. It also has to concentrate on exploiting the available resources to absorb new and young work potentials. He also spoke about bilateral relations with the EU. He asked that the necessary measures be taken to encourage Egyptian exports to the EU members in order to realize the joint interests of both sides. 'Amr Musa spoke about the challenges that emerge after signing the GATT agreement. He also highlighted the need to find greater opportunities for international trade in the international community. He noted the fears of protectionist policies. He said that all this makes it necessary to discuss and consult with the EU and demand a larger scope for cooperation with it. We also ask that it increase the easy-term loans and grants it gives us, as well as the food aid to realize the food security projects in Egypt and help the poorer classes. The Egyptian foreign minister once again discussed developments in Egypt and our region. In particular, he addressed the economic changes in Egypt, the future role of the EU as an effective factor in the European community, and the great possibilities for regional cooperation, especially now that the peace agreement has been signed.
