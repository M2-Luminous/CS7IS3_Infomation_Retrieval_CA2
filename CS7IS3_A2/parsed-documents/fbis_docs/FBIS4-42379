The Prime Minister raised the prospect of Britain opting out of the next stages of political and economic integration just a day after France called for like-minded member states to forge ahead, leaving stragglers behind. His speech at a European election rally in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, was a clear attempt to reassure Eurosceptic Conservatives that Britain would never be forced to accept a single currency or further centralisation against its will. He insisted that it was "old-fashioned commonsense" that member states should be free to do some things in their own way and at their own speed. But he had dearly moved a long way from his speech in March 1991 when he said: "We want to arrive at solutions which will enable us to move forward more united, not less." Last night, amid clear signs that France and Germany are planning a joint strategy to keep up momentum for a more integrated union, Mr Major set out his new vision of a Europe where countries could move between the fast and slow lanes. He said he had never believed that Europe must invariably act as one on every issue and advocated what he called "a sensible new approach, varying when it needs to, multi-track, multi-speed, multi-layered. It is a Conservative idea in line with the mood of people everywhere. We should be examining how this can work, not just fighting over the old centralised prescription. Mr Major's remarks brought a furious attack from his opponents, with John Cunningham saying he had abandoned any pretence that Britain would be a first-rate nation in Europe. "The Prime Minister has let the cat out of the bag," the shadow Foreign Secretary said. "He has admitted that his Government would let Britain fall behind in Europe. He is apparently willing to offer voluntary relegation to the second division in Europe and he isn't even prepared to put up a fight. "I believe that in any two-speed Europe, Britain must be up with those in the fast lane. Clearly, Mr Major does not." Charles Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, said: "This is a negative, defeatist message of a nasty, divided party. This is not about a multi-track, multi-speed, multi-layered Europe, but a second-class Britain in a two-tier Europe. Britain will be condemned to a seat below the salt at the top table of Europe." Senior Conservatives said last night that Mr Major was making plain his view that beyond the matters that had already been agreed by the EU [European Union], it did not make sense for every member state to march in the same direction at the same speed. On some issues, Britain would clearly be in the fast lane; on others, such as the single currency, it would reserve its position. Mr Major had told his invited audience: "I do not happen to think that it threatens Europe if member states are free to do some things in their own way and at their own speed. It is simply good old-fashioned commonsense. "If other countries want to slap more costs on their businesses, then they are welcome to -- if they want the Social Chapter, they can have it. But we are not having it here." The experience of the past two years proved that Europe could not be taken too far, too fast. Britain was right not to be pushed into agreeing a single currency in place of the pound. "It may happen in the future -- or it may not. But in any event, we cannot make a sensible judgment on it now, and a future Parliament must be free to say yes or no when it has all the facts before it."
