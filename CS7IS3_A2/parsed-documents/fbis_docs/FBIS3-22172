The department has made a series of inspections as part of a five-month campaign beginning in January to monitor factories to ensure they do not dump treated or untreated waste water which fails to meet standards into public waterways. The factories have been urged to economise on consumption of water or to reuse treated water in the factories to help cushion the impact of the severe water shortage. The campaign is part of the government's effort to tackle the drought this year, the worst in 25 years. Mr. Manat said: ``I can assure you that river water will not be polluted by factories along either bank of five major rivers during the dry season. However, I cannot be sure that the river water will not be polluted by communities and farms.'' He said there will be constant inspections during the dry season to ensure that the factories do not pollute the river water. ``The department has got tough with factories discharging waste water into the rivers because the drought this year is the worst ever, and a very low volume of water from major dams is flowing into the rivers,'' he said. ``Even a little waste water dumped into the rivers can easily pollute the water.'' Any factory found polluting river water will face severe penalties, ranging from warnings and fines to imprisonment, he said. Last week Mr. Manat led a group of officials and engineers to inspect factories near the Bang Pakong river in Chachoengsao, to monitor whether the department's campaign was being carried out successfully. He said that treated waste water from 33 major factories sited on either bank of the Bang Pakong River is being discharged into the river in very small amounts. This is because of the limited volume of raw water. Most factories are storing the treated water for further reuse, especially for factory cleaning and garden watering. In addition, the raw water sold in this area is very expensive, as high as 100 baht per cubic metre. After they followed the department's advice, factories can reduce water consumption by 30 percent compared with the same period last year. One million cubic metres worth one million baht can be saved, he said. Mr. Manat said the samples of water from the Bang Pakong river show average salinity gauged at 24,500 parts per million (ppm). Dissolved oxygen is gauged at five milligrammes per litre. This indicates that the river water is too salty and is not fit for consumption. The salinity standard of drinking water is 250 ppm. Mr. Manat said factories sited on the banks of other target rivers are also being kept under close watch. Factors contributing to river pollution vary, he said. For example, water in the Chao Phraya and Pa Sal rivers is mainly polluted by the community rather than by factories, while that of the Tha Chin River is the result equally of communities, farms and industrial plants The problem of the the Nam Pong is very easy to see, as the river is static, and the department will therefore not allow factories to dump any waste water there, he said. Phoenix Pulp and Paper Co's mill is a model in that it does not discharge treated waste water into the Nam Pong, but instead uses it to water its eucalyptus tree plantation, he said. ``With the strict measures applied to factories, I can assure you that river water will definitely not be polluted by factories,'' Mr. Manat said.
