The accord will then facilitate the achievement of peace and concord in society and provide for a political respite which can be used to implement economic reforms. Shakhray called on all leaders of political parties willing to sign the accord to join in finalizing the draft so as to avoid any misunderstanding. Some State Duma deputies have complained that they had taken no part in working out the draft accord. Shakhray also called for the signing of the accord as soon as possible. "We have already has a war of laws, then a war of sovereignties and we must no longer permit yet another war to break out -- a war of agreements on peace," he said.
