FBIS3-31493 "dreeu034__a94014" FBIS-EEU-94-034-A Document Type:Daily Report 18 February 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Government Accused of Concealing Temelin Studies AU1802083994 Prague CTK in English 1821 GMT 17 Feb 94 AU1802083994 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Feb 17 (CTK) -- The environmentalist movement Duha [Rainbow] is demanding an explanation from the government and the Czech Power Company, CEZ, on why it has been concealing sections of international reports casting doubt on the Temelin nuclear power station. At a press conference today, Duha member Jan Beranek claimed the movement had obtained from the Library of the European Union a copy of a report conducted by the Belgian company Tractebel and financed by PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary]-Energy. The first part of the report has been frequently cited by the Czech Government because the completion of the Temelin plant in southern Bohemia is described as the cheapest way of meeting the national energy requirement, he said. The second part, however, which deals with energy saving possibilities in the Czech Republic, is suppressed, Beranek claimed. The report concludes that investment into energy saving measures would cost less than the production of electricity by any method, including Temelin. A second study -- by the German Society for Nuclear Safety -- observed that progress at the Temelin site was in fact very much less advanced than officially claimed. It also produced a higher cost estimate for the conversion and completion of Temelin than has been published in the Czech Republic, Beranek said. Duha also pointed to a World Bank report from January this year which allegedly showed that loans offered to the Czech Republic for the desulfurization of coal power stations in north Bohemia (the loans were called "Energy II") and for the recultivation of disused open cast mines ("Environment") were suspended because of the "unconfirmed interest of the Czech Government." The decision will definitely slow the environmental clean-up of northern Bohemia, Beranek said. He added that the Czech Government had granted a state guarantee to the completion of Temelin probably at the expense of the desulfurization of the coal plants.
