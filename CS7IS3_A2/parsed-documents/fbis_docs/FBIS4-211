An ANC official who did not want to be identified said the mediators would be here to mediate, not to arbitrate. The mediators, including two former foreign affairs ministers, Dr. Henry Kissinger of the United States and Britain's Lord Carrington, are due to arrive in South Africa this week. The ANC and IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] joint working committee, which is meeting in Kempton Park today to make final arrangements for international mediation, is expected to meet the mediators later this week to suggest amendments to the constitution.
