The protease has an optimum reaction temperature of 70�C and was stable at 60�C. It retains 84 percent activity even after treatment of 80�C for 10 min. Ca[.sup]2+[/] enhanced the heat stability of the enzyme obviously. The optimum pH for casein hydrolysis was 8.5. The enzyme was stable over the pH range from 5 to 9. The enzyme was inactivated after treatment with PMSF [phenylmethylsulfuryl], but not inactivated by EDTA [ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid] and _a_-_a_' Bipyridin. the cation such as Cu[.sup]2+[/], Zn[.sup]2+[/], Fe[.sup]2+[/] and Co[.sup]2+[/] inhibited the enzyme activity while Ca[.sup]2+[/] tends to stimulate activity.
