Around 15 percent of donated medicines had passed their deadline for use or were otherwise unusable, and 30 percent were totally inappropriate for the needs of the population, the WHO said. Sorting out what medicines could be used had cost WHO and charity organisations precious time. Carrying the useless medicines had filled up valuable cargo space in stores, on aircraft and lorries, the WHO added. Only medicines which still had more than a year to run to their expiry date and which are included in the WHO list of essential drugs should be sent, it said.
