FBIS4-8856 "dreeu075_i_94016" FBIS-EEU-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Gorazde Situation Worsens as Attack Continues Gorazde Situation Worsens as Attack Continues Izetbegovic: Gorazde Victim of UN `Excuses' AU1804193094 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 1700 GMT 18 Apr 94 AU1804193094 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Address by Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic to rally in Sarajevo on 18 April -- recorded] [Text] Dear citizens of Sarajevo [crowd chants: Bosnia, interrupting him] Dear citizens of Sarajevo, we have gathered here to express our solidarity with the citizens of Gorazde, and to tell them that they are not alone. We have been following their struggle, and living through every hour and minute of theirs. We are also here for another reason, to express our defiance and to say that the violence and deceit will not pass [crowd cheers], to utter a large No to violence and deceit, and of course to tell them that we are not afraid of them. Those of you who came here have shown that you are not afraid of them. Those who stayed at home are obviously afraid. [crowd chants: Let us go on Gorazde, Bosnia] This is not the time for long speeches. Even if we had come here in total silence, even if this gathering had come in silence, that would have still been an eternal expression and a message. They have obviously decided to go for all or nothing. We will also go for all or nothing. [crowd cheers] This is a battle between good and evil, and for that reason in this battle for all or nothing we will get all. They will be left with nothing. [crowd chants] Dear citizens, it must now be clear to everyone that Gorazde is the victim of a conspiracy. Here are the Chetniks with their steel, and there is the deceitful world, or better said, that part of the deceitful world that is hypocritical and has hypocritical justice. Gorazde is the victim of that. [crowd chants] And let me tell you something: It is not the fault of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], it is not the fault of their soldiers, it is not the fault of their officers. It is the fault of the leadership of the United Nations. They too are being killed here, imprisoned, abused. They are following their orders. It is not their fault, you have to know that. It is the leadership that is to be blamed, the head is guilty, and you know what the name of that head is over there. [crowd chants: Ghali, murderer!] Instead of mobilizing the world against evil, against this ominous evil that has come down on Bosnia, they are paralyzing the UN mechanism. They are paralyzing and demobilizing, and instead of action they think up excuses. They are constantly coming up with excuses for not acting. Gorazde is the victim of this, our people in the entire eastern Bosnia are the victim of this, Bosnia is the victim of this. [crowd chants] I will tell you one other thing: It is not the fault of the Serbs, it is the fault of the Chetniks. The Chetniks are guilty. Make that distinction! Make that distinction for the good of Bosnia-Herzegovina! You have to separate the wheat from the chaff! Make the distinction between the wheat and the chaff! Those who are among us today, those who have been with us for two years, the Serbs who have been with us for two years on the free territory, in the state, and Sarajevo, they are our fellow-fighters against that evil. It is unfortunate that there is more chaff than wheat, but we will not be blind. We will always separate the chaff from the wheat. Those in the hills are the chaff! [crowd chants] And finally, we have learned the lesson, they have rammed the lesson home. The lesson is very brief: We must be strong. We must be strong! Pass this knowledge to our children. Tell them that they have to be good and honorable, but that they must be strong. This world respects nothing but strength. The world respects many things, but strength, it seems, the most. We will be strong. Teach your children that. And we will save Gorazde! [crowd chants]
