The public debate process of the workers assemblies was conducted between January and March. This process highlighted for the ANPP the policies to be followed. In accordance with a poll conducted nationwide in March by the Sociology Studies Center among 1,404 workers, 87 percent believe that the workers assembly process was worthwhile. Likewise, 71 percent of the workers affirmed that the workplace debates contributed to creating an awareness of the true situation of the Cuban economy. Regarding the proposals and suggested measures to streamline the internal finances, 56 percent of the workers believe that the measures will gradually solve [passage indistinct], while seven percent do not see a relation between measures and an improvement in the Cuban economy. Statistics reveal that it is evident there is a high consensus on the need for economic measures, although, opinions differ on the shape they ought to take. Some 39 percent of the workers believe that the measures ought to be taken separately and gradually; 25 percent believe the measures should be taken separately but quickly; and 27 percent believe the measures should be taken quickly and all at once. According to this poll, which also shows a high level of democracy in the opinions expressed, the measures with more widespread support are reducing frivolous gratuities, eliminating the regulated sale of cigarettes and rum, increasing the cost of electricity the higher the consumption, and implementing a more active price policy aimed at subsidizing people rather than products. However, in my opinion, we ought to give more attention to certain indicators revealed by the poll. For example, there is not a clear enough understanding that economic measures will affect everyone's living conditions to a different degree. Fifty-five percent of the workers responded yes to the question: Should we all receive the same? This shows a deeply rooted egalitarianism. The poll also confirms the people's consensus on the need to work more and shows the value of public discussion when 64 percent of the workers stated that the country will move ahead. The opinion of the specialists is that the workers assemblies yielded the positive result of increasing trust and hope in the possibility of Cuba's reversing the current economic situation. On May Day the ANPP will meet; we know the expectations. The ANPP will debate, compliment the consensus, and draft policies on how to solve the current financial situation. Then it becomes the government's responsibility to implement the policies drafted by the ANPP.
