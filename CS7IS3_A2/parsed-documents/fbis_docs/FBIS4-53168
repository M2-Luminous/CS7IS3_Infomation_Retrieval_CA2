Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice minister of international trade and industry, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs, will visit the United States on 19 May to begin unofficial talks with the U.S. Government. Behind this move lies the fact that the Clinton administration can no longer put pressure on Japan at a time when a sudden surge in long-term interest rates, caused by the dollar depreciation, might have a negative effect on the U.S. economy, and that the Hata government intends to strengthen its foundation by breaking the stalemate in the trade talks. Despite the Hata cabinet's intention, the trade talks will continue to be rough because it is still unclear whether the minority Hata coalition can implement multiyear tax cuts as a macroeconomic measure. After the breakdown of the summit meeting in February, Japan-U.S. relations were put in "abnormal circumstances." U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor gave strict orders to U.S. negotiators not to meet Japanese bureaucrats and as a result, no contacts were made. However, following the inauguration of the Hata government, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata met with U.S. Government officials. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata also held a telephone conference with President Bill Clinton. As such, there are signs that bilateral relations are improving. It is believed that Washington has changed its attitude toward Japan because it can no longer maintain its policy of putting pressure for the yen to further appreciate at a time when rapid appreciation of the yen might lead to a triple drop in U.S. bonds, stock prices, and the value of the dollar, and a sudden rise in long-term interest rates might have adverse effect on the U.S. economy. Also, alarmed by a letter complaining of Washington's Asia policy, which was sent by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the Clinton administration has shown a tendency of reviewing its economy-oriented diplomacy toward Japan. Meanwhile, it is said that the Hata cabinet is eager to resume talks with Washington because it hopes to strengthen its foundation through the improvement of relations with the United States so that it can maintain its centripetal force even after the passage of the 1994 budget bill, enabling it to promote tax reform and deregulation. Because "it is not allowed to make a mistake again," the two sides have agreed to hold unofficial, subcabinet-level meetings first. In Japan, some people argue that if Tokyo and Washington agree to resume trade talks, they should adopt a "two-step plan." They propose that negotiations on government procurement and insurance should virtually be concluded by early July, before the (G-7) Naples summit opens, and then talks on automobiles and auto parts, a sector in which there is conflict of opinions between the two countries, should be concluded by the end of September, which is the deadline for Washington to invoke the Super 301 provision of the U.S. Trade Act (which outlines steps for retaliation against trade partners' unfair practices). However, this plan is possible only when the ruling and opposition parties reach an agreement on tax cuts and sources to fund the cuts by the end of June. An official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said: "If this macroecnomic measure is scrapped, it will be impossible for the government to obtain concessions from Washington in negotiations on each trade sector." Nevertheless, it is uncertain whether the ruling and opposition parties will be able to reach an agreement. Main topics in the negotiations on government procurement and insurance will be what method should be used to gauge the openness of markets and what measures should be taken to promote deregulation in each trade sector. A top MITI official said the Japanese Government hopes hopes to avoid the "theological argument" over the issue of whether to call it numerical target or objective criteria and to "start concrete discussions as soon as possible. However, whether Washington will change its policy toward Japan and make a compromise over numerical targets "will not be known until the trade talks resume" (according to a MITI official).
