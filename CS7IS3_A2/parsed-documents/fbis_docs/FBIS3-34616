The Palestinians reported that the PLO office in Gaza together with the PLO in Tunis have been responsible for the program for Van Rooy's visit and, for the first time, the security arrangements for a senior foreign government representative have been entirely in Palestinian hands. There was no involvement by the Israelis or the UN refugee organization. Former Palestinian activists who have played a major role over recent years in the intifada, the popular resistance to Israeli occupation, guaranteed the safety of the Dutch minister during her three-hour visit to the Gaza Strip. Men in plain grey suits with a small Palestinian flag on their lapels guarded the entrance to the assembly hall of the Palestinian chamber of commerce in Gaza, where Van Rooy and her delegation of Dutch businessmen met with Palestinian representatives led by Hayder 'Abd-al-Shafi, the former head of the Palestinian delegation at the peace talks in Washington. During the intifada, Jalal Shakak, the 30-year-old Palestinian security man, was deputy commander of the youth section of 'Arafat's Fatah resistance organization at the Islamic university of Gaza. He has been imprisoned by the Israeli's on ten occasions: "I am proud that I can now serve my fatherland. In our work as security people during the visit by the Dutch secretary of state we are demonstrating that we are able to guarantee security and to govern ourselves." In a convoy of local cars and accompanied by two UN buses, the Dutch party travelled through the densely populated refugee camps of Jabalaya and Shafi. They then continued along the seriously polluted beaches of the Gaza Strip and Van Rooy was able to take a look at the possible site of the first Palestinian port in which the Netherlands is prepared to invest 40 million guilders. During Van Rooy's visit no Israeli soldier was to be seen and all seemed quiet. But it was learned in the evening that incidents had occurred during the day in Jabalaya and Shafi, leaving 12 injured by Israeli army bullets. Half of those wounded were children. The Palestinians remain very divided over plans to build their own port. Yesterday afternoon at the Palestinian political headquarters in New Orient House in East Jerusalem, Van Rooy met with representatives of the occupied Jordanian West Bank. The West Bank delegation was led by the journalist and lawyer Ziad Abu Zayad, also a member of the Palestinian delegation at the political peace talks with Israel. Zayad: "The Palestinian port is important. Not only because it would provide a valuable source of revenue, but above all because it would form one of the principal pillars of Palestinian independence. We discussed various matters with Van Rooy, matters which must be dealt with by every country in the making." Less sure about the Palestinian port is the leading professor of economics, Hisham Awartani, of the An-Najah University in Nablus on the West Bank, who has met with Dutch businessmen. He was a member of the Palestinian delegation which conducted the (temporarily suspended) economic peace talks with the Israelis in Paris. "I do not believe that a port will be viable if it is designed solely to serve the expected needs of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip," says Awartani. "Such a port must serve the whole region, but that would depend on the political relations with neighboring countries. That is why we must first carefully study the situation. "Also, I believe that there are more urgent needs than having our own port. It is more urgent to do something about the miserable housing situation in the refugee camps, especially as we must expect foreign aid to decrease over the years. The international euphoria has in fact already subsided." Secretary of State Van Rooy was accompanied by around 40 Dutch businessmen; the largest business delegation from the Netherlands ever to have visited this part of the world.
