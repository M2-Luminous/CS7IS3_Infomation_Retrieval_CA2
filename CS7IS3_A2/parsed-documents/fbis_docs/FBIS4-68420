The basic goal of the Society's activity is the country's political, economic, cultural, and moral revival, the basic prerequisite of which is the restoration of Georgia's territorial integrity and the creation of the political, material, and legal base necessary to meet the needs of the population. 2. We condemn chauvinism, local separatism, and every form of demagoguery and are guided solely by principles of true democracy, people's friendship, protection of human rights, and the political, economic, and creative liberties of the individual. 3. Georgia's internal state system and administrative-territorial division must take full account of historical traditions, specific regional characteristics, satisfy the needs of the native peoples and national minorities, and be in accord with universally recognized human rights. 4. Our economic program rests on the modern world's practical experience of the organization and management of production as well as Georgia's national, historical, and production experience and characteristics. Because we believe that there is no alternative to a market economy, our aim is to promote the kind of market relations which will ensure effective realization of the country's material, labor, and scientific potential and strengthen the foundations of the country's spiritual life. We believe that a multi-structural, socially-oriented market economy is most in keeping with the country's development interests. Equal economic, organizational, and psychological conditions need to be provided for the development of all forms of property ownership. The state should not intervene directly in economic management but only in the creation and regulation of the kind of economic, organizational, and psychological environment whose ultimate goal is a functioning, balanced national economy. A multi-structural, socially-oriented market economy will serve to prepare the groundwork promoting the interests of all social strata (groups) and, in this way, the attainment of social harmony in society, which is an essential prerequisite for any revival of the country. 5. We endorse private and state ownership of the land. Only household, vacation home, and garden plot lands should be turned over to private ownership; all other lands should be owned only by the state, which can transfer land to citizens on a lease or permanent-use (possession) basis with the right of inheritance. A land's owner as well as a land's lessee, whether physical or legal persons, may themselves determine the form of production and organization of labor (peasant farming, individual farm operation, cooperative, partnership, state farm, or other). 6. The country needs its own currency, the use of which will require the preparation of the necessary material, economic, and organizational foundation. We endorse efforts to attract foreign investment and the effective use thereof, initially through the sale of stock shares, the creation of joint enterprises, the acquisition and use of new technologies, and so on. 7. The privatization process is in need of state regulation. We endorse the development of private property and the creation of the legal, economic, and organizational basis as well as the nurturing of entrepreneurial proprietors for the purpose. The state must provide the protection of property and its owners. 8. The cornerstone of Georgia's political and social-economic development is the integrated development of the country's regions. We believe it is essential to work out and implement goal-oriented state programs for the social-economic development of the various regions. They must take full account of the specific character of local economic and cultural life, prospects for the effective use of available resources, labor traditions and customs, and so on. 9. In the interests of the various strata of society, a clearly defined state social policy needs to be carried out. It is essential to provide real guarantees of citizens' rights to an education, health care, and social aid for certain categories of the population (pensioners, college students, single mothers, and invalids). State responsibility for scientific, cultural, and educational development needs to be increased. And the criminal practice of reckless experimentation in schools and health care facilities must be condemned and stopped. 10. At the present stage, one of the most important tasks is for the state to take care of our countrymen who have been forced to abandon their homes and have become refugees in their own homeland, also citizens who were robbed during the Civil War. The state will have to create not only temporary, elementary provisions for normal living but also, eventually, pay for their lost property with appropriate material compensation, because the people should not have to be liable for the results of the adventurism of political circles. 11. The country needs to have a properly trained, properly equipped [lines illegible] army and internal troops. Considering the exceptionally difficult tasks (the disarming of [words illegible] units and banded gangs) we believe it is possible to enlist properly qualified citizens of other states for military service on the basis of a temporary contract. In order to avoid collusion between mafia-gangster and state structures, measures need to be taken to purge state administrative and law enforcement agencies of persons who have been besmirched by ties to criminal elements, and strengthen and renovate the material-technical and organizational base of state security and internal affairs bodies. 12. In foreign relations, we endorse a policy of active neutrality. At the same time, owing to the country's geopolitical, historical, and economic characteristics, the Russian Federation and the other republics of the former Soviet Union will continue to be our country's chief partners in political and social-economic spheres; naturally, this does not rule out close relations with the world's other countries, in particular those of the Black Sea Basin. Particular priority must be given to the development of good-neighborly relations with all the republics of Caucasia. 13. Our Society will actively cooperate with all social/civic or political organizations, promote the harmonization of the goals and tasks of political parties and movements, and share analytical information for the purpose of preparing shared views as to the accomplishment of the tasks of the country's political and economic development at the present stage, in order to protect the interests of every stratum of society and eventually attain social harmony.
