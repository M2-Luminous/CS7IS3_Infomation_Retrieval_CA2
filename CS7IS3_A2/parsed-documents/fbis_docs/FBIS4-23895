One of his advisers also stated at a press luncheon that what "the Western media are calling militia," comprise "resistance forces, like the one in France, which just celebrated the 50th anniversary of its liberation." Mr. Sindikubwabo, the ministers of foreign affairs and health who accompanied him, and several advisers, stated that Rwanda was the victim "of Ugandan aggression," which according to them, is supporting and arming the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF, Tutsi minority rebels). They also accused "certain Western press" of taking only the viewpoint of the RPF into account. The participants also said Belgian troops from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) were present at Kigali airport during the 6 April attack on the plane carrying the Rwandan and Burundian presidents. "Kigali airport was in the hands of UNAMIR and other elements, most of whom were Belgian troops," Mr. Sindikubwabo stated. He pointed out that the aircraft's black box "could not be found by the Belgian troops, and that it was not in the hands of the UNAMIR," without giving further details. Mr. Sindikubwabo and his delegation, who were on their way back from the OAU summit in Tunis, also expressed satisfaction with that meeting, as well as their desire to see the establishment of "a frank and sincere dialogue" with the RPF, so as to find a "political compromise" to the Rwandan situation.
