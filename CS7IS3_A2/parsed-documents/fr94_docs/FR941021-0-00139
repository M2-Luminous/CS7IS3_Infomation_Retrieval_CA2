Overfill Devices; Interim Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 203 / Friday, October 21, 1994 / Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Parts 155 and 156 [CGD 90-071a] RIN 2115-AD87 Overfill Devices AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Interim final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is issuing an interim final rule (IFR) that establishes minimum standards for overfill devices and requires the phased-in installation and use of devices on the cargo tanks of certain tank vessels that carry oil or oil residue as primary cargo. Regulations addressing minimum standards for and concerning the use of overfill devices are required by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). The purpose of the interim regulations is to reduce the likelihood of spills when oil is loaded as cargo. DATES: The interim final rule is effective on January 19, 1995. Comments must be received by January 19, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406) (CGD 90&hyph;071a), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001 or may be delivered to room 3406 at the same address between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477. Comments on collection-of-information requirements must be mailed also to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20503, ATTN: Desk Officer, U.S. Coast Guard. The Executive Secretary maintains the public docket for the rulemaking. Comments will become part of this docket and will be available for inspection or copying at room 3406, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, between 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LCDR Jeff Brager, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection (G&hyph;MVI&hyph;1), (202) 267&hyph;1046. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in the rulemaking by submitting written data, views, or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify the rulemaking (CGD 90&hyph;071a) and the specific section of this rule to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment. Please submit two copies of all comments and attachments in an unbound format, no larger than 8 by 11 inches, suitable for copying and electronic filing. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope. The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this rule in view of the comments. Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Randall Crenwelge, Project Manager, and Pamela Pelcovits, Project Counsel, OPA 90 Staff. Regulatory History Section 4110 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380) adds a statutory note following 46 U.S.C. 3703 requiring, in part, the establishment of minimum standards for overfill warning devices and requirements concerning the use of overfill devices on certain tank vessels. To meet the statutory requirements, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled, ``Overfill Devices,'' in the Federal Register (58 FR 4040; January 12, 1993). The Coast Guard received 32 letters commenting on the proposal. In response to some comments, the Coast Guard published a notice (58 FR 54315; October 21, 1993) and held a public meeting at U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters on November 17, 1993. Twenty-eight people attended the meeting, and a list of the attendees and audio tapes of the meeting are available in the public docket for the rulemaking (CGD 90&hyph;071a) at the address listed under ADDRESSES . Statements made at the meeting have been treated like written comments in the preamble. Background and Purpose Detailed information on overfill spills and devices is found in the preamble to the NPRM. An overfill spill occurs when too much oil is pumped or gravitated into a cargo tank during a transfer operation (e.g., from a facility to a tank vessel or from one tank vessel to another). Human error is the most often reported cause of this type of spill. Many overfill spills are small; however, some reported overfill spills have involved large quantities of oil. Coast Guard regulations require vessel owners and operators to follow pollution prevention procedures during oil transfer operations (33 CFR parts 155 and 156). Existing regulations do not require devices on cargo tanks to detect and warn of impending overfills. Discussion of Comments and Changes Location of Regulations One comment objected to the proposed placement of the regulations in 33 CFR subchapter O as too cumbersome and confusing due to cross references, applicability sections, exceptions, and definitions. The comment recommended a comprehensive reorganization of the regulations based on statutory authorities. A reorganization of 33 CFR subchapter O is outside the scope of the rulemaking; however, the interim regulations amending 33 CFR subchapter O have been drafted to be as clear and concise as possible. Applicability In the NPRM, the Coast Guard proposed requiring overfill devices on tank vessels with a cargo capacity of more than 40 cubic meters (M 3 ) (approximately 250 barrels, 1 barrel = 42 U.S. gallons). One comment suggested that the threshold was inappropriate and that additional ``small vessels'' should be excluded from the regulations. The comment stated that current oil transfer procedure requirements found in 33 CFR parts 155 and 156 are adequate to prevent overflow spills from smaller tank vessels because these vessels have simple oil transfer systems. The comment also stated that the cost of installing and maintaining overfill devices would be a significant financial burden to the company submitting the comment.
