With time left for discussion running out, both parties have basically agreed to get the stalled talks on establishing a new framework for bilateral trade back on a track, Hata told a press conference. Hata said Japanese and U.S. delegates at subcabinet-level talks in Washington are now working on the final wording of key points that have divided the two parties since the framework talks ruptured in February. If the delegates reach specific accords on resuming the trade talks, that would lead to an early meeting of the leaders of the two countries for a final breakthrough in the negotiations, Hata said. But Hata declined to speculate when issues hampering a restart of the trade talks will be cleared. He denied reports that it would be "in one or two days." In Washington, the unofficial trade negotiations entered a fourth day, with the sticking point being how to define earlier agreed "objective criteria" as a way to gauge U.S. access to Japanese markets. "We are working on final wording of such a term so that it can be defined in a mutually acceptable manner," Hata said. The talks to establish a new bilateral trade framework broke down when Japan rejected a U.S. demand for using "numerical targets" as objective criteria during the February summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. In search of a breakthrough in the talks, Washington made three new proposals to Japan in April on three areas -- objective criteria, overall goals of the framework talks and macroeconomic policy measures. Heading the Japanese team at the Washington talks are Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and industry minister for International affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs. They are believed to have given Japan's reply to the three U.S. proposals.
