More than 220 West African nationals, including 158 Nigerians, 52 Ghanaians, five Togolese, four Senegalese, four Malians, and some Beninese were arrested at the beginning of the week by the naval branch of the Gendarmerie as they attempted to enter Gabon illegally by sea. Held in temporary detention, 60 of them were discovered dead in the Rebouket Camp cells on 3 February. The government has been informed of the tragedy. What measures have the competent authorities taken? Let us listen to Lazare Digombe, minister of culture, arts, popular education and human rights, who was interviewed by Charles Mezo. [Begin Digombe recording] We were informed that there had been a certain number of deaths at the regrouping center. According to the reports, when the cells were opened in the morning, a certain number of the immigrants were found dead. It is now left to explain how these deaths came about. In this center, which is not a prison with surveillance structures, you cannot imagine the gendarmes sleeping in the same place as 200 people. It is unimaginable. We have even learned that one of the gendarmes who carried water to the immigrants was taken hostage by them and had to be freed. If you were a gendarme, I do not think you would accept to spend the night with such people. That is what you must understand. It is not a prison with surveillance structures. It is a center where the immigrants who just happened to turn up unexpectedly were fortuitously regrouped. We are talking here of illegal immigrants. Now that we have learned that a large number of people have died, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Communication, the Ministry of National Defense, and the Ministry of Human Rights have been informed. How do we explain the deaths? I told you yesterday, in my address to the nation, in a press communique on behalf of the government, that an enquiry has been ordered to determine the causes of these deaths. None of us was there to see how they died. However some assumptions have been put forward. Perhaps, a fight broke out among them. [end recording]
