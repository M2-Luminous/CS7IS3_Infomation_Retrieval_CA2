"I do not believe that the referendum in Austria will be of any significance for the Norwegian EU debate, but it would of course have been an encouragement if the result had been a no," Kristen Nygaard, leader of the No to the EU organization, said. Tor Wennesland, secretary general of the Europe Movement, said that the result in Austria is much better than expected. Wennesland believes that the foundation of the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement as an independent alternative to the EU has now been greatly undermined. He also said that the possibility of expanding the EU to the east has been strengthened by the fact that Austria has said yes to EU membership. "I am happy that the nationalists did not manage to achieve a no majority in the referendum," Wennesland said. "No" general Nygaard is not happy about such comments. "The yes side is now clearly now trying to portray EU opponents as nationalists with Nazi views. Such allegations must therefore apply to 52 percent of the Norwegian people," said Nygaard, referring to Opinion's latest EU membership poll that was published in AFTENPOSTEN on Saturday [11 June]. Nygaard thinks that it is mean of the Europe Movement to imply that opponents of the EU have Nazi sympathies.
