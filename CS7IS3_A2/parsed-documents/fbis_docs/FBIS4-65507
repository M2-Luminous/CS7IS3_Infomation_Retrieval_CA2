Deputy Konrad Weiss (Alliance 90/Greens) harshly criticized the "hesitating work" of the police as well as statements and actions by Magdeburg Police President Antonius Stockmann. The police not only did not protect the attacked foreigners but even harassed them, he pointed out. Statements by Roman Herzog, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union candidate for president, concerning the naturalization of foreigners are practically calling for a manhunt, Weiss said. Social Democratic Party of Germany Deputy Juergen Schmude stated that Germany is beginning to change and we are doing nothing to stop this development. If we are not able to nip such developments in the bud, "we will not recognize our country again," Schmude said. Rolf Olderog (CDU) warned against condemning the police. Media reports about the riots in Magdeburg were often incorrect and exaggerated. Free Democratic Party of Germany Deputy Burgkhard Hirsch said in the debate that statements by Police President Antonius Stockmann, which played things down after the events, were worthy of a cabaret.
