The streets and squares of this hero city have not seen for a long time such an enormous mass of people as that which gathered this morning. It was exactly half a century ago that the city was liberated from the fascists. Over 1,000 war veterans arrived for the celebrations. They laid flowers and wreaths at the fraternal graves and observed a minute of silence in honor of the dead. At a requiem rally held on Nakhimov Square by the memorial to the heroic defenders of the city, greetings telegrams from the presidents of Ukraine and Russia were read. The gathering greeted Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and Sevastopol City Chairman Viktor Semenov.
