The urgent need for such a program stems from the worsening environmental situation coupled with the virtual absence of an independent sector in this country oriented toward the development and manufacture of environmental products, as well as the fact that the task is truly complex. Using the intellectual and scientific-technical potential and production capacity of the defense complex to solve environmental safety problems by providing comprehensive environmental monitoring, creating new environmentally safe technologies and improving means of processing industrial and household wastes will help make that task manageable. The program envisions involvement by more than 90 research and planning organizations under the Russian Federation Committee on the Defense Industry. According to 1993, estimates, the cost of the program will be R54.28 billion [rubles]. Funding will come from the republic budget, investment and conversion credits, capital investment, foreign investment, customers' own funds and other off-budget allocations. Implementation of the program is expected to take three years. The program will include the development and production of new technologies and means of cleaning up exhaust gases and waste water and of processing, neutralizing and reusing solid waste; measurement and information systems for background monitoring of the state of the environment, and systems to monitor pollution sources; and environmentally safe and resource- and energy-conserving technologies and types of production. The ``Conversion-Ecology'' program will be coordinated by the Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources.
