The Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, in a meeting with a group of editors from the country's highly circulated newspapers and magazines this week, stressed that the central government would not allow measures repugnant to its laic [as heard] policy. He said that the administration of Istanbul, too, is the responsibility of the government rather than that of the municipality. Also, Turkey's interior minister, in a similar statement, has sounded a warning to the new Islamic mayors of Ankara and Istanbul, as well as of other cities in the country. He declared that they would probably be prosecuted in the event of not adhering to the policy of the separation of politics from religion. Undoubtedly, such statements from Turkish officials arise from their concern over the impact of the assumption of power by the Islamic Prosperity Party in some major cities of Turkey. In fact the acceptance of such an issue -- based on the secular system of government in Turkey -- is something which can hardly be likeable to the country's laic circles. At any rate, the reality cannot be overlooked that the outcome of the recent municipality elections has shown that, despite 70 years of sovereignty of un-Islamic laws and propaganda about secularism, Islamic trends in Turkey are on the rise and this is something which has put the secular government of Turkey at loggerheads with the Muslims of the country. However, aside from the various reasons that have led to the recent election success of the Islamic-based Prosperity Party, which has been allowed to have political activities, it can be said that the frustration that the Turkish Muslim people have with respect to the potential of the country's secular and liberal parties in overcoming the social, economic, and political problems of Turkey has also acted as a main factor in shifting the voters toward the Prosperity Party. Now, in view of these considerations, the secular circles in Turkey are faced with the question and concern as to what extent the Islamic trends in that country are going to influence the economic, social, and political aspects in the future. Besides, according to these secular circles, there is no guarantee that, during the future parliamentary elections, the Muslim people of Turkey will turn to the Islamic-based Prosperity Party.
