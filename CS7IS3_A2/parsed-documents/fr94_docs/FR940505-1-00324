FR940505-1-00324 FR940505-1-00012 (B) Documentation of methods used to achieve the VOC emissions reductions required in paragraphs (b)(5)(iii)(B) ( 1 ) through ( 5 ) of this section. (v) Recordkeeping . Each owner or operator of a facility which is subject to the limitations of paragraphs (b)(5)(iii)(B) (1) through (5) of this section because of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section shall collect and record all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the limitations of paragraphs (b)(5)(iii)(B) (1) through (5) of this section for each emissions source and maintain the information at the facility for a period of five (5) years. The information shall be collected and recorded each day of each calendar year beginning in 2001 and ending with 2005. (vi) Testing and Monitoring. The Administrator may require, at any time, any owner or operator of a facility subject to the limitations of paragraphs (b)(5)(iii)(B) (1) through (5) of this section because of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section to perform tests using the applicable test methods and procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and/or to install monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(B) of this section to demonstrate compliance with the limitations of paragraphs (b)(5)(iii)(B) (1) through (5) of this section.

(a) General Provisions. (1) Applicability. The provisions of §52.2955 shall apply to all stationary emission sources located in the ``control area'' as defined as the Ventura County ozone nonattainment area in 40 CFR 81.305, and all other persons identified in subsequent applicability paragraphs in §52.2955(b). (2) Compliance dates. Compliance with all requirements of this section is required upon promulgation unless otherwise indicated by compliance dates contained in specific paragraphs in this section. This paragraph (a)(2) shall not operate to provide additional time for compliance under section 113(d) of the Clean Air Act, for sources subject to compliance upon promulgation. (3) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply. All terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in §52.2950. Actual emissions means the actual quantity of NO X emissions from an emissions source during a particular time period. ``Actual emissions rate'' means the actual quantity of NO X emissions from an emissions source per unit of actual production or throughput. Agency means the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Air contaminant means any solid, liquid, or gaseous matter, any odor, or any form of energy, that is capable of being released into the atmosphere from an emission source. Air pollution means the presence in the atmosphere of one or more air contaminants in sufficient quantities and of such characteristics and duration as to be injurious to human, plant, or animal life, to health, or to property, or to unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life or property. Air pollution control equipment means any equipment or facility of a type intended to eliminate, prevent, reduce or control the emission of specified air contaminants to the atmosphere. Allowable emissions rate means the most stringent of the applicable standards in 40 CFR parts 60 and 61; the applicable implementation plan; or a federally enforceable permit. Annual emissions report is a report which takes inventory of all pollutant emissions at a facility during a calendar year, submitted by the Facility to the EPA, within 30 days of the close of each year.
