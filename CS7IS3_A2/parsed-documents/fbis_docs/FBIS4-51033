At a session on "China in the 21st century" here today, Zheng Hongye, who is chairman of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, told the delegates that by the middle of the next century, China is set to be a middle-level developed nation and an important force in safeguarding international peace. By the end of this century, the Chinese people would generally lead a relatively rich life, thus greatly strengthening their purchasing power, raising their level of consumption, and providing strong support to Asian and world economic development, Zheng said. China will open its market in a even large scale by then, he said, and its total accumulated imports are expected to reach one trillion U.S. dollars in the seven years till 2000. However, Zheng added, although the overall economic strength of China will be markedly improved at the beginning of the next century, there will still be a big gap between it and developed nations in terms of per capita income. He said China together with other peace-loving countries will make painstaking efforts to establish a new world order for peace, stability, cooperation and development. "China is and will be a peace-loving country. It will never invade, interfere and bully others and never seek hegemony," Zheng said. At the same time, he pointed out, China will continue to follow its own development path. "It is impossible for the Chinese to accept the way imposed by outsiders who try to direct them to do this or that according to their models and intentions," he said. PBEC is a non-governmental organization set up in 1967. Its membership has risen to 17 with China, Russia and Colombia formally joining it at the current meeting. The three-day gathering, which opened on Monday [23 May], deals with the current economic situation, regional economic cooperation and specific business issues relating to telecommunications, air transportation, financial services, energy and tourism.
