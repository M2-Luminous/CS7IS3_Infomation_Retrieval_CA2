His 365 days in the homeland were really impressive days embroidered with the noble love and obligation and the unbreakable bonds of kinship between the illustrious leader and an ordinary soldier. The 43 years of Yi In-mo in a "hell on earth" and his one year in the earthly paradise make us picture to ourselves the incarnation of great human love that has made a dead tree blossom. Yi In-mo served as a war correspondent in the period of the fatherland liberation war unleashed by the U.S. imperialists 40 odd years ago. During the war, he got heavily wounded and was taken prisoner, leaving his fate unknown. The great leader President Kim Il-song awarded a certificate of the bereaved family of a revolutionary martyr to Yi In-mo's family in 1968 when his fate was not known, expressing unquestioned trust in the soldier. After it was known that he was alive and he fought undauntedly for 34 years in prison, the great leader, very pleased that his trust in him was not in vain, decided to confer the title of the Hero of the Republic upon him, highly appreciating his patriotic faith and will. Immeasurable are the efforts exerted by him to bring an old soldier on sickbed at a tip of South Korea back to Pyongyang where his wife and a daughter were waiting for him. At the time he was sent back to the North, he was, indeed, a "dead man." His internal organs were all abnormal and he was suffering from serious malnutrition, pyothorax and general famine by medieval tortures for more than 12,400 days in prison. Even officials concerned of the South wondered if he could reach Pyongyang alive. Yi In-mo, however, expressed his admiration for the fascinating reality of the North three days after he was embraced by the Republic and began writing some 70 days after. It was some 100 days after he returned to the North that he left the sickbed and toured different places of the socialist homeland together with his family, seeing its imposing reality at first hand. The great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il have always shown deep loving care for his health and life over the last one year. More than 100 kinds of tonics and expensive medicine sent by them for his health and their precious teachings on more than 120 occasions and deep love on over 40 occasions have brought him to the culmination of happiness and glory. Yi In-mo has visited time-honored Mangyongdae, Mt. Paektu, the ancestral mountain, the Tower of the Chuche Idea, the arch of triumph, Pabal-ri, his home town, and other places of the homeland. Touring the homeland, he has keenly felt that the love and trust of the illustrious leader is not confined to him but reaches all of the people. Therefore, he, out of the absolute worship to the illustrious leader, wrote poems "On My Fate," "Thought of Love" and "Song in Praise of Faith and Will" and words of the song "We Will Win Because You Are Leading Us" and other works singing of the noble love of the Workers' Party of Korea, and today contributed a full-length article titled "We Are Blessed With Sagacious Leader" to NODONG SINMUN. This is not only what Yi In-mo said from the bottom of his heart but the unshakable faith of the entire Korean people.
