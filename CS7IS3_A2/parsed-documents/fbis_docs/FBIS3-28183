Press statement by a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman: According to reports, Japan will soon ignite Monju, its first fast breeder reactor. This is an undisguised attempt by Japan to secure quantities of plutonium by itself and produce nuclear weapons at any moment. The annual capacity of the reprocessing plant of Japan is 800 tons, the biggest in the world. When it goes into full operation by the end of the present century, Japan will rank third in the world in reprocessing capacity after the United States and France. Even according to data released by the Japan science and technology agency, it has already stockpiled 1.6 tons of plutonium at home and 2.9 tons abroad and will possess 50 tons of plutonium at all times by 2010, an amount enough to make more than 6,200 nuclear bombs. Japan has already developed not only an electronic detonating device and other elements for the manufacture of nuclear bombs and their technologies but also has long-range means of nuclear delivery that can be used as intercontinental ballistic missiles. Facts show that Japan's nuclear armament now has reached a dangerous phase. In view of the tense situation in which Japan's nuclear armament is being stepped up around the Korean peninsula in earnest, we cannot but follow such developments with vigilance. Japan's stepped-up nuclear armament means creating an obstacle to the process of denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. The denuclearization of Northeast Asia must be realized if peace and security free from nuclear weapons are to be guaranteed substantially in this region, including the Korean peninsula. To this end, not only Asia but the rest of the world should pay due attention to Japan which is capable of possessing nuclear weapons and moving in that direction. The denuclearization of Northeast Asia should lead to a total elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide.
