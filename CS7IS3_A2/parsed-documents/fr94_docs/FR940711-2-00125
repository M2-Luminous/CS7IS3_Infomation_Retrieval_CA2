Abstract: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend the criteria for release of patients administered radioactive material under 10 CFR Part 35. The proposed amendment requires the licensee to provide the patient with instructions on how to maintain doses to other individuals as low as reasonably achievable, and to maintain a record of the released patient and the calculated total effective dose equivalent to the individual likely to receive the highest dose. These requirements are necessary to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety, and that dose limits to other individuals are maintained as low as reasonably achievable.
