He expressed concern in connection with the fact that the Russian Minatom [Ministry of Nuclear Power Engineering] had no money for the production of fuel cassettes for nuclear power stations, which Russia pledged to supply to Ukraine in exchange for nuclear warheads, in compliance with the trilateral agreement between the United States, Ukraine, and Russia on the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine. In this situation, pointed out the deputy prime minister, those $60 million that the United States was going to pass over to Russia would be of help, however, this has not been done as yet. U.S. Ambassador William Miller, who was present at the meeting, responded by saying that the money had already been transferred to the relevant bank account.
