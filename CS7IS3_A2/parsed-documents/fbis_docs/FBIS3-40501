Computed wall pressure data are compared with wind tunnel data to show that their agreement is quite good except for the secondary post-shock value, although the analytical value agrees quite well with the present computation. This discrepancy may be due to a three-dimensional effect in the wind tunnel experiments. A comparison among numerical solutions for an inviscid flow obtained by the use of several types of numerical flux expressions indicates that solutions are strongly affected by the flux scheme and a possible reason for this can be attributed to the scheme's capability of resolving linear characteristic waves. 1. Introduction A supersonic air intake is a device that efficiently acquires the air necessary for combustion in an air-breathing engine and compresses it to the required pressure. Much research work has been done in recent years including CFD. We here compare the results of our two-dimensional mathematical analysis with test results, and compare the numerical solutions based on several schemes obtained during the analysis. We then consider what effects the different schemes had on the solutions. 2. Supersonic Air Intake The model used in these calculations supports three modes, namely a supercritical, a critical, and a subcritical mode (cf. Figure 1). The restoration pressure is done [sic] most efficiently in the critical state, and progressively less efficiently as the degree of supercriticality increases. At subcritical, it sometimes becomes impossible to obtain the necessary flow volume. Accordingly, operation is normally done in a supercritical state that is near-critical, with a margin allowed prior to subcritical. When this is done, there is interference between the boundary layer(s) and the final shock wave inside the duct and this can trigger separation. If the vortices induced by such separation become large enough, not only is the flow pipe constricted so that the predicted pressure restoration cannot be effected, but the final shock wave may be pushed out so that a subcritical state is created. For this reason, when designing an intake, it is necessary to reproduce each of the modes that are determined by back pressure and find out what the separation situation is. Figure 1. Supersonic Air Intake Operating Modes 3. Calculation Model, Calculation Conditions In Figure 2 are diagrammed the shape of the model and the calculation grid. A virtual variable-choke nozzle is provided for the intake outlet so that any desired back-pressure can be simulated. Figure 2. Calculation Model and Calculation Grid The main flow condition is sea-level Mach 2. 4. The basic equations used are the two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations in which a two-layer algebraic turbulence model is employed.[.sup]1[/] We perform spatial integration using the finite volume method, and implement second-order precision with MUSCL. For the evaluation of convective factor flux at the cell boundary we use Roe's approximate Rieman solver.[.sup]2[/] The viscosity factor is discretized with the second-order precision central differences. Time integration is performed with the second-order precision rational Runge-Kutta method.[.sup]3[/] 5. Boundary Conditions As to the exit conditions inside the intake, supersonic outflow conditions are imparted by setting the virtual nozzle. Conventionally this should be connected to the intake downstream at subsonic speed, but it is very difficult to set subsonic outflow boundaries for flows containing vortices, and inevitably a non-physics result is imparted. With the virtual nozzle the back pressure can be controlled and it is possible to set simple boundary conditions which make sense in terms of physics. 6. Comparing Calculation Results Against Test Data In Figure 3, at (a) through (c), are shown density distributions at supercritical, critical, and subcritical states. As can be seen, at supercritical and subcritical, when the final shock wave becomes strong, the separation-induced vortices are large, while at critical the vortices do not grow all that much. The static pressure distribution at the lower wall surface is depicted in Figure 4. In this figure the test results for the supercritical state are represented by small circles. Except for the pressure rise caused by the second shock wave, the calculation results agree well with the test results. The calculation results coincide with the two-dimensional analysis solutions, so the differences in these results are thought to be due either to three-dimensionality or to measurement errors. The total pressure distribution inside the intake is diagrammed in Figure 5. It is evident that separation-vortex-induced distortion occurs close to the wall surface. Figure 3. Density Distributions Figure 4. Static Pressure Distribution at Lower Figure 5. Total Pressure Distribution Inside Duct We found that, in the Eulerian calculations that were done at the initial stage of analysis, differences occurred in the results with the Roe method and the van Leer method.[.sup]4[/] We, therefore, added other schemes and did the calculations using six different methods, and then compared the results. The first schemes we took up were the Roe method, van Leer method, Osher method,[.sup]5[/] Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLLE) method,[.sup]6[/] and modified Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLLEM) method.[.sup]6[/] With the Roe method, furthermore, we employed the Chakravarthy[.sup]7[/] and Lin[.sup]8[/] techniques in order to satisfy the entropy conditions. With the Roe method, it is necessary to add an artificial viscosity to the characteristic velocity _l_[.sup]k[/] in order to prevent expansion shock at points of sonic velocity. However, with the Chakravarthy technique, the _l_[.sup]k+/-[/][.sup]i+1/2[/] at the cell boundary obtained by Roe approximation is varied as follows, namely, at sonic rarefaction (_l_[.sup]k[/][.sup]i[/] < 0 < _l_[.sup]k[/][.sup]i+1[/]), p> With the Lin technique, there is a converging acceleration With the Lin technique, there is a converging acceleration effect, and an effect which inhibits the carbuncle phenomenon by which the Mach lines are distorted at the nose in hypersonic calculations for blunt objects. We next represent the Lin method. Equation where In these equations, u and a represent the Roe-averaged velocity perpendicular to the cell boundary, and the speed of sound, respectively. The factor k[.sup]1[/] helps prevent expansion shock, k[.sup]2[/] helps smooth out the shock wave(s), and k[.sup]3[/] helps eliminate instability. The k[.sup]p[/] factors are the same as those used in stabilizing the convective factor calculation based on the central differences of Jameson,[.sup]9[/] and are defined as follows. Equation where p[.sup]i,j[/] is the pressure. At the where p[.sup]i,j[/] is the pressure. At the cell boundaries, we use averages of the values of adjacent cells. The values of the constants are k[.sup]1[/] = 0.25, 0 � k[.sup]2[/] � 5, and k[.sup]3[/] = 15. Here we used k[.sup]1[/] = 0.25, k[.sub]2[/] = 5, and k[.sup]3[/] = 15. We show the results of Eulerian calculations done in relatively coarse meshes. The tip of the intake lip has become a flat head having twice the thickness of the grid interval in closest proximity to the wall (cf. Figure 6). By this means we obtained interesting results. In Figures 7(a) through 7(f) are depicted the density distributions based on the Roe (Chakravarthy), Roe (Lin), Osher, HLLE, HLLEM, and van Leer methods. The respective lower wall static pressure distributions are plotted in Figure 8. We can divide these into three groups, according to the separation conditions, namely (1) Roe (Chakravarthy) and Osher, (2) Roe (Lin) and HLLEM, and (3) HLLE and van Leer. In group (1), separation was caused by the final shock wave, and the induced vortices pushed the shock waves upstream, resulting in subcritical states. In group (2), slight separation does occur, but there is convergence in the supercritical state. In group (3), no separation occurs. The entropy profile in the vicinity of the intake tip is represented in Figures 9(a) and 9(b). Inside this high-entropy layer, the velocity is slower than outside of it, resulting in a boundary layer-like velocity distribution. We think that separation occurs here due to a steep pressure gradient produced by the final shock wave. The generation of the high-entropy layer occurs when the tip angle is exceeded, and we do not think it occurs when the tip is made sharper. The group (2) high-entropy layers are thinner than those in group (1), for which reason we do not think that large separation was reached. In group (3), conversely, the high-entropy layer is thick and the peak is low. We believe this is due to the fact that the linear wave resolutions are inferior with scheme (3), as they are known to be. Thus we think that the differences in local linear wave resolution cause large changes in the numerical solutions. Figure 6. Intake Eulerian Calculation Grid (Lip Figure 7(a).

It is also possible to do unsteady calculations by continuously varying the nozzle constriction. The results of comparisons against test results were good, but we need -- and in the future plan -- to work with systems of two equations on a three-dimensionalized turbulence model in order to investigate separation and vortices. With the inviscid flow calculations, we compared convective-factor flux calculation schemes, and found differences in the calculation results which appear to be caused by linear wave resolution [differences].
