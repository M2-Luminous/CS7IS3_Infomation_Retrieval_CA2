According to educators here, these schools are aimed at training talented people for Shanghai's modernization, and extending the friendship between local residents with overseas Chinese and foreign friends. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Shanghai's foreign contacts in education had been limited in the exchanges of students, inter-school academic activities and overseas donations. With the deepening of China's national reform and opening further to the outside world, many overseas institutions and individuals who were attracted by Shanghai's economic and social development wanted to cooperate with the city in running schools. The 15 schools were selected from overseas applicants with an approval of the State Education Commission. They are run jointly by the Chinese and institutions and individuals from Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Britain, the United States, Germany and Japan. Two of them are technical schools and the rest are junior, second and tertiary educational institutions, all of which are non-profit organizations. To ensure the healthy development of these schools, the Shanghai Municipal Government issued a regulation on administration of cooperation in running schools by overseas institutions and individuals in Shanghai early this year to protect the legal rights of people in running the schools. "To cooperate with overseas institutions and individuals in running schools may help us absorb overseas capital and use foreign experience for reference in running schools," said professor Wang Shenghong, director of the office of public health and education under the Shanghai Municipal Government and director of the municipal higher-learning education. "It will also be beneficial to training talented people needed for Shanghai's modernization and protecting the patriotism of overseas Chinese and promoting friendship of foreign friends," he said, "and it will benefit Shanghai's education." According to professor Wang, these schools are advanced in facilities and strict in administration and teaching, and their courses are in line with the needs of Shanghai's economic and social development. One example is the Shanghai-British qualification examination committee for certified public accountants, a joint venture between the Shanghai Pudong Continuous Education Center with the British chartered Association of Certified Accountants. Trainees from the committee have been welcomed and appreciated by enterprises. Students at a business training institute, which is jointly run by the Shanghai Institute for Training Young Managerial Workers and a Hong Kong company, are using advanced computers and other equipment provided by the Hong Kong side. Professor Wang noted that several higher-learning institutions in Shanghai are holding talks with overseas organizations on cooperation in setting up schools in the New Pudong Area to train more qualified people in industrial and commercial management. The New Pudong Area is a newly-established economic zone that is expected to lead the transformation of Shanghai's industrial and financial sectors.
