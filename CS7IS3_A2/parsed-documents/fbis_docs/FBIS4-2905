Qian said also he understood Pyongyang's reasons for immediately denouncing the statement, the chairman of the Japanese-language TOKYO SHIMBUN, Miichiro Kato, told reporters in Beijing after the interview Wednesday [13 April]. This is because North Korea insists that the issue should be resolved in negotiations with the United States, without United Nations intervention, Kato quoted Qian as saying. The U.S. had lobbied Security Council members to pass a resolution that would have prodded North Korea to accept international inspections of its nuclear sites, suspected of being part of a weapons development program. China, Pyongyang's last remaining major ally, convinced the security council to adopt the nonbinding statement, however, stressing the need for dialogue and warning against isolating North Korea further. On Wednesday, Qian said, "since the UN Security Council announced the presidential statement, it appears that (the situation) is heading gradually in a positive direction." "North Korea was against the issue being discussed by the Security Council, so I understand its denial (of the statement)," Qian added. The foreign minister said that there were "absolutely" no plans for North Korean President Kim Il-song to visit China or for Beijing leaders to journey to Pyongyang. Regarding the renewal by the U.S. of most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status for China, Qian stressed that support for an extension of the status, to be decided on by Washington in June, is "very strong" among American business leaders. "If the U.S. does not want its economic relationship with China severed, then problems should be resolved," he said Qian, without mentioning Washington's linkage of human rights concerns with a renewal of MFN. On the possibility of Japan obtaining a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, Qian said there were differing opinions among UN member nations, adding that no formal discussions are scheduled on the issue.
