Issei Inoue, vice chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], the largest among the seven ruling parties, also proposed sending a group of coalition Diet members to North and South Korea, China and the United States to seek support for the U.S.-North Korean summit. Inoue, who visited China between Friday and Sunday as head of an SDP delegation, put forth those proposals during a meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, officials said. Hata offered support for an idea of creating opportunities for North Korea to have dialogue through exchanges with Japanese Diet members. But the foreign minister was quoted as saying, "We should consider (sending Diet members) not only as the SDP but the coalition parties as a whole."
