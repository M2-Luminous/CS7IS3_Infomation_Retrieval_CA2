At about 6:00 on Wednesday, residents of the settlements of Chermen, Kurtat, Dachnoye, Saniba and Verkhny Komgaron, as well as Terek cossacks, blocked the main road between the villages of Oktyabrskoye and Kartsa in North Ossetia's Prigorodny District, brought traffic to a standstill and staged a rally of protest. The action was prompted by the recent murder by armed bandits of two civilians from the settlement of Verkhny Komgaron located within the safety zone under control of Russian peacekeeping forces and local law-enforcement bodies, according to Gatsir Dzagoyev, head of the Prigorodny District's local self-government and a North Ossetian deputy. The protesters demanded that North Ossetian authorities, the temporary administration and investigation bodies expose the criminals. Participants in the rally believe that troops assigned to the temporary administration do not perform their functions properly. They also accused the Russian Interior Ministry's investigation group investigating crimes in the zone under state of emergency rule of somewhat neglecting their official duties. The Prigorodny District's residents also demanded that the state of emergency be lifted in North Ossetia from March 31 and that the temporary administration be dissolved. To substantiate their demand, the protesters stressed there were appropriate power structures in the republic capable of taking control over the situation and of settling all differences with Ingushetia. According to Dzagoyev, who attended the rally together with an official of the temporary administration, villagers of the Prigorodny District would like these issues to be raised at the republican parliament's next session shceduled for late March. Meanwhile, North Ossetian President Askharbek Galazov met on Wednesday the head of the temporary administration in North Ossetia and Ingushetia, Vladimir Lozovoi. They discussed the situation in the context of the current developments in the zone under state of mergency rule.
