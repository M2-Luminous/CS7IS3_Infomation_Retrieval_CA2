[Kakubava] There used to exist in Abkhazia the Council for National Unity that had been elected on 9 May 1992 at the congress of the Georgian population living in Abkhazia. As we had been thrown off the territory of Abkhazia and were confronted with another stage in life, we considered it necessary to transform this purely political association -- the Abkhazian Council for National Unity that united 19 parties and organizations -- into a political and military organization that would lead [the struggle] for the return of the territory of Abkhazia. [Toradze] Your organization believes that we should use military force to recover Abkhazia. How realistic is this? [Kakubava] It is possible to recover Abkhazia only by using military force and only now for, if we delay, it will be too late. I also believe we are already eight months late and this is the fault of the head of state. We should not have started the war in Abkhazia at that precise time. We told Eduard Shevardnadze this right from the start. A group of 10 of us -- five members of the Abkhazian Council for National Unity and five from the Ilia Chavchavadze Society -- went to see the head of the Supreme Council then and we proved to him in detail that introducing tanks and soldiers into Abkhazia would have the consequences that we can clearly see now. Shevardnadze promised us then that he would not send armed units onto the territory of Abkhazia, but, one week later, the Georgian Army entered Abkhazia and the war began. In spite of our negative attitude, given that this, nevertheless, had happened, the war should have ended in our victory; we should have punished the separatists and their leaders and the enemies of Georgia and established Georgian jurisdiction over the territory of Abkhazia. This process should have lasted no more than 10 days. However, everyone knows that, precisely on Shevardnadze's direct instructions, Jaba Ioseliani [leader of the "Mkhedrioni" paramilitary group, first deputy chairman of the State Council at the time] arrived in Abkhazia, the Georgian Army halted its advance, and talks were held with the Abkhazians --as a result of which we were unable to cross the Gumista river. This led to the surrender of Gagra and later Sukhumi, the extermination of 30,000 people and the expulsion of the Georgian population. Today, there are no Georgians in Abkhazia. It is no longer Georgia. Yet, the greatest misfortune is that this war was called an Abkhazian-Georgian war, which is in no way true. This was Russian aggression against Georgia. The introduction of troops was planned by Russia. Whether it was Shevardnadze or [former Defense Minister] Kitovani who carried this out does not interest me. I know one thing: The Army was brought in on Russia's orders, it was made to halt its advance and play war, and Russia was given the opportunity to use the Apsua [Abkhazians' name for themselves] against us and this war was called an Abkhazian-Georgian war, whereas, in reality, it was Russian aggression. Many of those who fought in this war say that Gagra, Sukhumi, and Kochara were sold out. I do not know if this is true and do not support these kind of statements; however, I do know that we did not lose a single place in battle. Even in the position that we were then, we could have won any war in spite of the fact that Russian Army formations were opposing us; we could have won as the battle was being conducted on our territory. However, the Georgian authorities began to deceive the Georgian population by saying that we could not manage without Russia and that, for goodness' sake, we should not offend Russia and we should not say that it was precisely Russia that was waging war against us. In Parliament, we were attacked by a part of the deaf- and-dumb majority obedient to the authorities and were not even given the right to mention Abkhazia during the parliamentary sessions. I view this as betrayal. One cannot keep a country in a state of war for two years and finally state: I [Shevardnadze] did not allow our Army to enter Gudauta and Tqvarcheli because Abkhazians would have been killed there. Then, why did you go to war? Why are you the commander in chief of the Army who put us in a state of war? If you do not destroy the enemy but allow your Army to be destroyed in the meantime, what kind of person are you? Thirty thousand Georgians have died, Georgia has lost its best land, and no one is assuming responsibility for this. It would have been a different matter had you said that we had fought but lost the battle. However, when all actions are directed toward your army units losing the war -- you appoint people from the street to top positions, people who are absolutely incompetent, all levels are controlled by mafia structures, and a representative of the [criminal] underworld is raised to the level of the state -- if this is not betrayal, let any Georgian tell me what it is. The head of state's statements that we will return with dignity to Abkhazia are nothing but deception; this is a fact because he conducted negotiations with the opposing side against our wishes. Today, Abkhazia is known throughout the world as an independent land. Shevardnadze could have held negotiations with the head of the Russian state as a war was going on between Georgia and Russia, whereas we could have discussed the conflict with the Abkhazians and come to an agreement among ourselves. Shevardnadze had not sent even one of our representatives to participate in the meetings and negotiations that had been held up to that point. In spite of our daily protests in Parliament that this was a step toward recognizing the independent state of Abkhazia, the independent state of Abkhazia was established in the accord of 4 April. When we mention this, representatives of the majority raise an admonishing finger and say that, on the contrary, we have done a good thing and that this is a political statement and does not mean Abkhazia's independence. There followed a flood [of documents] on the state independence of Abkhazia that were based on the 4 April accord, in particular the agreement of 14 May according to which Russia was able to declare Abkhazia to be an independent state and to determine the Abkhazian-Georgian border along which Russian Army units are to be deployed. It followed from the final agreement that Russia was not satisfied with Abkhazia: Samegrelo has been declared a buffer zone and Russian troops will be located on its territory as far as Khobi. [Toradze] Why do you think people are negatively disposed toward you? Is it simply because they favor Shevardnadze or is it because they really do believe that it is possible to settle this problem by means of negotiations? [Kakubava] No, this is not what they think. I do not know of any person in Georgia today who could sign a document giving away Georgian territories. I do not agree with the view that Georgia cannot exist on its own. We are a country of 5 million, but we have the potential to maintain a state of 15 million. However, if we artificially create such conditions in which we kill the Georgian's desire for originality and, if we allow the view to prevail that we can do nothing without others and that the whole world is feeding us thanks to Shevardnadze, we will be unable to become an advanced nation. The view has been frequently expressed recently that we are not a warlike people and that war is not our business. Such statements should be condemned. We are indeed a warlike people and courageous as well and no stronger nation than ours exists in the world; we are truly a decent people, but we simply need a leader who will conduct a policy that befits an independent state. Today, we have a government that is dragging us toward enslavement. It contains people who, in their time, were nothing but thieves and who do not know what a nation is and what the state approach to a matter is. We now state the following: As they have brought us this far, they should now give us the chance to return to Abkhazia. I am not competing for anyone's job; I am a soldier. Of those 300,000 Georgians [refugees], there are at least 50,000 brave men who are able to fight. Shevardnadze can see our potential. The Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia can do this and this is why he, in principle, does not want to meet us. [Toradze] If you are able to fight, why didn't you fight then in Abkhazia? You had the opportunity. Isn't it now rather late for your self-sacrifice? [Kakubava] We stated at the time that we should have been given weapons and we could have defended our land by ourselves. We warned them: Don't send those inexperienced kids who are seeing weapons for the first time; give us the chance to fight alone. However, it is not only in Abkhazia, but also here that Shevardnadze is failing to help us in our concern to regain our own territory. [Toradze] You mentioned that we were fighting against Russia in Abkhazia. However, even with an army of 50,000 that is well trained, is there any chance that we can win? Have you taken this into account? [Kakubava] We can win on Georgian territory; this should not evoke any negative emotions in us. If Russia were to wage war with all its potential, it would conquer not only Georgia but also the whole world. However, it will not unleash such a war. We would always win the type of war that is being waged in Abkhazia. [Toradze] Today, you held a news conference at which you said that you were filing a law suit against Shevardnadze in the Georgian Supreme Court.... [Kakubava] Yes. I said that, if, on the instructions of Shevardnadze, Parliament does not disavow all those signed documents concerning Abkhazia within the next five days, we reserve the right to call upon the Georgian population to restore the territorial integrity of Georgia and will demand that the government be replaced by peaceful means, without any bloodshed or destruction. However, we do not want Shevardnadze to leave Georgia without assuming responsibility. Therefore, we have filed a lawsuit in the Georgian Supreme Court and with the procurator general in which we accuse him of betraying Georgia in accordance with Article 65 of the Georgian Criminal Code. [Toradze] Do you think that you will win this case? [Kakubava] The case is already won, as, to our surprise, he stated at a parliamentary session that the reason for his not permitting the Army to enter Gudauta and Tqvarcheli was that this would have resulted in the annihilation of the Abkhazian people. This crowns everything that he has done up to now. When the commander in chief does not allow his own army to destroy the opposing side and, meanwhile, it is his army that is destroyed, this is betrayal. [Toradze] Are you not afraid of making so many bold statements or even of filing a lawsuit? [Kakubava] Shevardnadze and his terrorist group should be wary of me because I will be a proper plaintiff at this trial. If I am killed, those left behind will behave in a different way. Furthermore, I will tell you another thing. Whoever intends to kill me will not be buried in Georgia as it will be impossible to find a burial place for him here.
