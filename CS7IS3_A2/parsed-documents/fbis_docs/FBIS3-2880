"A reporter asked me whether I would meet Christopher if he came to pay me a visit. I said, I have not requested to see Christopher. But if he wants to talk to me, I will be willing to meet him. Perhaps this has irritated the authorities. This morning three persons in charge of the party group of the China Academy of Social Sciences came over here to talk with me and asked me not to meet Christopher. They preached at me. They talked of state security, blah blah blah....I gave this offer to them. I said, I will consider your request if you have all the cops withdrawn, have Ding Zilin's telephone line reconnected, and have all the plainclothes men withdraw from around her house. If you do not do this, then I tell you I will probably request a meeting with Christopher on my own." Xu Liangying said with great indignation: "I want to tell the whole world what the situation is in China now -- whoever calls for reason and the improvement of human rights through rationality will immediately have his human rights infringed upon." [passage omitted] In this telephone interview Xu Liangying also mentioned Ding Zilin's case: "I went to see her yesterday afternoon. Her telephone line had been cut off. Those staying outside her house seemed to be behaving in a more civilized manner. Many plainclothes men were staying 10 to 20 meters away from the house. Those cops I had here were in uniform, they were from the Public Security Bureau. Whether the situation has changed today, I do not know. That is what I saw yesterday." [passage omitted]
