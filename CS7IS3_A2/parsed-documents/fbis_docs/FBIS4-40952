We have learned that after Aleksey Kazannik instituted a criminal case 26 January on the grounds that the book "Last Dash to the South" incited war and whipped up interethnic strife, its author -- V. Zhirinovskiy -- was questioned as a witness by an investigator from the Main Military Prosecutor's Office. A number of expert assessments of the case were made -- philosophical, psychological, and military-historical -- which concluded that certain passages of the aforesaid work did indeed contain indications of calls for war and the whipping up of ethnic strife. The work done at the Prosecutor's Office, in the opinion of Acting General Proseuctor A. Ilyushenko, makes it possible to charge V. Zhirinovskiy under Articles 71 and 74 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code. But, since he is a State Duma deputy, this requires his consent. Under Article 20 of the Law on the Status of Deputies, the Duma should examine the General Prosecutor's Office submission within one week and provide a reasoned response. The decision to agree ("yes") or refuse ("no") to institute criminal proceedings against Zhirinovskiy should be adopted under the ordinary standing order regulations by a majority of all the deputies. Most of the various faction leaders and deputies polled by this writer 15 June believe that the Duma will not hand Zhirinovskiy over to the Prosecutor's Office, however odious he may be. The submission will most probably not be backed by the Communists, the agrarian faction, the Democratic Party of Russia, or the "Women of Russia" -- not to mention Zhirinovskiy's supporters themselves. They do not need to vote against, they need only abstain or refuse to exercise their vote. The majority of deputies from "Russia's Choice," "Yabloko," the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and the "12 December Union" will vote in favor of the Prosecutor's Office submission, cunningly aware that their votes will still not be enough. The only original answer that differed from the common model was provided by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, who believed that an agreement could be reached with the left wing on "handing over" Zhirinovskiy if the favor were to be repaid, for instance, with a seat in the government. But nobody is likely to pay this price for him -- moreover, such complex and convoluted ploys need thorough preparation, whereas the General Prosecutor's Office submission was sprung on the Duma. The problem for the deputies lies first in setting a precedent by stripping a colleague of his deputy's immunity -- given that, in the future, the Criminal Code will unfortuantely smile not only on Zhirinovskiy and not only on this kind of "ideological" crime. Second, if Zhirinovskiy loses his mandate as deputy in any further development of this scenario, a collapse will threaten not just the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia -- his disappearance from the Duma (where, incidentally, he has been quite quiet of late) is likely to destabilize the equilibrium which has been achieved to a certain extent here and to reshuffle the entire makeup of the corps of deputies (with consequences which would be hard to predict). If we made the rather unprobable but not altogether impossible assumption that the majority of deputies would nonetheless back Ilyushenko's submission, then the Main Military Prosecutor's Office would have to continue its investigation, interrogate Zhrinovskiy as the accused, and, if necessary, hold confrontation interviews. Once the investigation is over the indictment would be sent to the court. Article 74 Part 1, which incriminates Zhirinovskiy (incitement of ethnic strife), provides for a fine and up to three years' imprisonment. Conversely, Article 71 (propagandizing war), which has hitherto never been actually applied in practice, provides for between three and eight years' imprisonment. But most probably (although we would once again add the rider that such a turn of events is unlikely) the courts would find a way to hand down a punishment that did not actually involve incarceration. In this event the subjugator of India would gain a criminal record and the status of convict, but would not lose his deputy's mandate, which would not be stripped automatically in this event, but only after a new Duma decision. The Duma could vote for the mandate to be retained even in the event of Zhirinovskiy being sentenced to a punishment actually involving incarceration (Article 4 of the Law on the Status of Deputies). The considerations which will guide his colleagues in this event are the same as in the case of stripping him of his deputy's immunity. But by following through the most extreme version of this unfolding scenario, we are geting further away from the genuinely likely outcome. Most probably, the criminal case against Zhirinovskiy will be reliably obstructed at the first stage -- that is, next week. And such a decision would fundamentally suit everyone. The Prosecutor's Office will do its formal duty, and Acting General Prosecutor Ilyushenko will score another point in the light of the likely resubmission to the Federation Council of his candidacy for the post of general prosecutor; Zhirinovskiy will get additional political publicity, without which he would become reminiscent of a deflated and wrinkled child's balloon; the Duma as a whole would retain the relatively balanced and monolithic nature of its ranks; deputies standing on nationalist positions would take great pride in having saved their soul mate; the democratic factions would be able to accuse their opponents of harboring instigators of war; and finally, the president will be given a pretext to level the selfsame accusation against parliament as a whole, a pretext which could usefully be held in reserve. Generally speaking, no one could lose.
