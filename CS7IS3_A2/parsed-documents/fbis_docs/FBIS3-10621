If the measures are successful he will be considered a hero; if they are boycotted by Congress, however, he cannot be held responsible for their failure. [Jereissati] On the contrary, his position is very difficult. He is completely involved and very much imbued in the Economic Stabilization Plan. He is a man of great historical perception and understands that he is on the brink of the historic possibility of solidly solving the inflation problem. He gained credit before the country as the man capable of crafting the great commitment that has been needed for years, a commitment that is known in many ways; the national pact, conciliation, etc. Thus Cardoso's decision to stay or leave is not easy. [Lins] Not long ago it was said that you, as president of the PSDB, would run as vice presidential candidate to PT [Workers Party] candidate Lula's [Luis Ignacio da Silva] presidential bid. Are the negotiations over? [Jereissati] The PT has a social democratic group, which is currently one of the most interesting political factions in the country. This faction is not the majority in its party. This was demonstrated during the last internal elections for PT regional executive boards. Lula is hostage of the rest of the party. Furthermore, the PT and the PSDB have different platforms. Although we have some points in common with Lula, unfortunately he is disavowed by his own party. [Lins] Are there no more negotiations with the PT? [Jereissati] The talks were hampered. Apart from the different platforms of our parties, we are unable to agree with the harsh criticisms by Lula of the Economic Stabilization Plan. Since our alliances are discussed around programs and objectives and not around names, our differences prevent a greater understanding. [Lins] But Lula has demanded an alliance and accuses your party of being indecisive. Has the PSDB decided that it will not share a ticket with the PT? [Jereissati] We are not indecisive. We are constant. We agree regarding a Parliamentarian government system, opening the economy, state reform, and privatization. The points that are constantly being changed are those upheld by the PT. [Lins] Does this mean that the PSDB will run its own candidate? [Jereissati] The party has already decided that. We are ready for the race, and it is currently very clear that the best candidate profile is a PSDB member. [Lins] With the success of the Economic Stabilization Plan, will that PSDB candidate be Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso? [Jereissati] If I said I would pull him out of his ministry I did not say so only as party president, but in face of a political fact. If there is one point on which everyone agrees in this country it is that the problem of Brazil is not economic but political. The political problem is the lack of a great national commitment in Brazil, capable of implementing a change. Fernando Henrique Cardoso did exactly that: he compromised several sectors of Brazilian society around a common objective, which is stabilization. Since the moment he attained that, and after proving his political competence, he earned the reputation of being the only man capable of negotiating this highly desired national commitment without making demagogic promises and without posing as a savior of the nation. He has his feet firmly on the ground, he does not pretend to be messianic, and offers realistic proposals. [Lins] So the Economic Stabilization Plan has made him a stronger candidate? [Jereissati] Society will clearly see the benefits and in 30 days everyone will see that he who negotiated a great national commitment must not remain stuck in a smaller project on account of calendar deadlines: Not only can he, but he must, launch himself on a more important project. [Lins] Like that, with what parties would you form alliances? [Jereissati] We want alliances because we are clearly aware of the size of our party. There could be an impasse if we win the elections but we lack majority in Congress. This is why we must agree upon a government program to guarantee governability and to finish with the endless exchange of favors and political patronage to get executive branch initiatives approved in Congress. [Lins] Then, with which parties will you talk? With the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], the PFL [Liberal Front Party], or with some PT sectors? [Jereissati] The coalition we dream of is with the PFL and the PMDB. It may seem strange but that is happening in the rest of the world. Without seeming presumptuous, the world is becoming social democratic. First we will establish the name of our candidate and then we will begin talks. We began talks with the PT. But now we must concentrate the best of our party with the best of the PFL and the PMDB. We can unite our ideas around a government program, we are open to support. [Lins] What did you think of the Bahia PSDB note criticizing an attempt to establish an alliance with the PFL? [Jereissati] Any alliance suffers regional resistance and this is exactly what is happening with Bahia. We do not fear the idea of distorting our convictions because of the candidates. We have a tradition of opposing when it was necessary but ours has always been a coherent opposition based on high principles. One can no longer engage in politics pressured by ideological commitments. I do not fear the calling-in of favors because I never occupied government-designated posts and have participated in the great movements such as the movement for direct elections. [Lins] On the subject of an alliance with the PFL, Deputy Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes is mentioned as a vice presidential candidate in a ticket headed by the PSDB... [Jereissati] He is a good candidate, but there has been nothing definite yet. There has been no talks regarding names. I can tell you that the PFL is supporting us in Congress regarding the Economic Stabilization Plan. [Lins] Do these discussions jeopardize the constitutional reform process? [Jereissati] Quite the contrary. The electoral atmosphere jeopardizes it far more. The plan seeks to speed up the reform, it pushes the reform forward. [passage omitted] [Lins] Are you candidate for the Ceara State governorship, for the Senate, or will you run as the possible replacement for the finance minister? [Jereissati] I intend to run for a seat in the Senate. For the moment I do not plan to return to the Ceara government but I have not fully ruled out this possibility. As for aspiring to replace the finance minister, that is mere speculation by the media. No one has asked me about this subject. [Lins] Are you in favor of the reelection of governors? [Jereissati] I have my doubts. It is not good to hold a post for long because power is nasty and tends to ruin people. On the other hand, three or four years are not long enough for someone who has a serious government program to implement. [Lins] Were you surprised by the Northeastern politicians' veto on the name of Senator Beni Varas for the Regional Integration Ministry? [Jereissati] It is regrettable that we are still influenced by political patronage, by petty and retrograde politics of certain Northeastern leaderships interested in maintaining that region in its current situation. That mentality not only exists in the Northeastern region, it exists throughout the country. Brazil needs statists, not men with limited and electoral objectives. This is why I believe our economic growth can take a huge and qualitative step forward with Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Individualism belongs to the past. We will work for the community and promote the State reform Brazil needs.
