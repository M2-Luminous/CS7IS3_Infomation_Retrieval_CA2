The deal would first ask Pakistan and then India to cap their nuclear programmes. To sweeten the pill for Pakistan, the undelivered 38 F-16s Pakistan has already paid for as well as some P-3 Orion anti-submarine attack planes would be delivered as a one-time exception to the Pressler Amendment. Both the nuclear programmes of Pakistan and India would be opened up to international inspection and verification. A five-power conference comprising Pakistan, India, China, Russia and the US, with the possible inclusion of Britain, France, Germany and Japan, would be convened to obtain pledges from Pakistan and India that they will ban nuclear tests. Both countries would be asked not to develop and deploy ballistic missiles as potential delivery systems for nuclear warheads. For some time now, conflicting signals have been emanating from the Clinton administration which indicate its desire to find a way round the Pressier Amendment, not out of any love for Pakistan, but in order to have sufficient leverage to persuade us to forego our nuclear option. Congressional opposition led by Senator Pressler has so far made that difficult for the US government. Even the package under discussion has come under fire during hearings of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Whether the Clinton administration will be able to negotiate all these reefs before Mr Talbott's arrival in South Asia is highly doubtful, given the strength of opposition to its proposals from Congress. It seems premature therefore for us to be speculating whether Pakistan has agreed to any of these proposals, which could hardly be said to have jelled even within the American foreign policy establishment, in any case. Mr Talbott's package hardly contains anything new or startling. All these proposals have been mooted in the recent past, some, like the five-power conference, by Pakistan itself. The obstacles too, are well known and formidable. The most intractable is India's continuing hegemonistic ambitions in the area which have led it to develop a nuclear weapon which it tested as far back as 1974, arm itself to the teeth despite possessing the fourth largest army in the world which lends it overwhelming military superiority over all its neighbours, and its stubborn refusal to engage in meaningful discussions let alone accept any reasonable solution to the Kashmir issue. It has tried to defect the US pressure for non-proliferation in the region by hiding behind the demand for global nuclear disarmament. It has tried to defect the US pressure for non-proliferation in the region by hiding behind the demand for global nuclear disarmament. It has not even been prepared to take seriously the five-power conference proposal which seeks to meet its argument that it faces a nuclear threat from China. Given this reality, it might be more productive if Mr Talbott could first persuade India to cap its nuclear programme and discuss the core issue of Kashmir seriously with Pakistan before the `demonstration effect' could assuage Pakistan's very real concerns. If, however, flying in the face of these facts, the US is training its guns on Pakistan because it thinks it can pressurise us more easily than India since it has greater leverage over us, it is seriously underestimating the will of our people to forego even badly needed aircraft in order to safeguard our national interests. In the furtherance of those interests, before Mr Talbott arrives, it would be in the fitness of things if the government were to take the nation into confidence and sit down with the Opposition to chalk out a joint position to resist any pressures the US may be planning to exert.
