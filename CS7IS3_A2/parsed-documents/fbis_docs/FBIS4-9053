FBIS4-9053 "dreeu076__a94071" FBIS-EEU-94-076-A Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Commander Signs Protocols With Czech Army Commander Signs Protocols With Czech Army AU1804200794 Prague CTK in English 1909 GMT 18 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1804200794 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava April 18 (CTK) -- Cooperation between the Czech and Slovak Armed Forces was discussed during a one-day visit of Chief of the Czech Army General Staff Major General Jiri Nekvasil to Slovakia. In Bratislava, Nekvasil met with Slovak Defence Ministry State Secretary Andrej Sobol and Slovak Army Commander Lieutenant General Julius Humaj. Generals Nekvasil and Humaj confirmed after the talks that four protocols to an agreement on cooperation between the two countries' armies were agreed upon so that the Czech and Slovak Defence Ministers, Antonin Baudys and Pavol Kanis, would be able to sign the agreement on May 2 in Bratislava. "There are no obstacles on the way of cooperation," Humaj said. The cooperation would primarily concern an exchange of experience in solving specific problems, for example the army's logistic support according to the Western model, Nekvasil said. He mentioned the possibility of joint exercises and joint armament projects but declined to give details. He admitted, however, that he liked the new Slovak howitzer Susana. The Czech and Slovak Armies are predetermined to cooperate in building their national defence by similar conditions, identical problems and tasks and the situation in the region, Humaj said. "Although we are aiming at integration into European structures and have adopted the Partnership for Peace programme, neither the Czech Republic nor Slovakia had their security guaranteed by any treaty. We therefore rely on our own forces and ought to build our national defence. In this we are finding a common tongue and will to cooperate," Humaj said. He said that the second major task which is awaiting both armies -- transformation in order to be able to integrate into NATO -- also requires cooperation and an exchange of experience. Humaj described as premature considerations about common armament systems. Given the shortage of finances, the two armies would concentrate on modernising the current combat equipment in the near future and only after this would they be able to develop new systems, he said. He added, however, that talks on this topic conducted so far were purely informative.
