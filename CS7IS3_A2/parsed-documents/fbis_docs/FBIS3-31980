Petro and his group not only could not get in but confirmed that the foreigners completely control the area. Only four of the group of 84 were allowed into the site and observe everything related to the presence of U.S. troops stationed at Malaga Bay. The group, People's Observers, headed by Petro, rapidly walked around the area and confirmed that Colombian authorities do not control the U.S. troops. The Marines control everything. [Begin Petro recording] The Colombian High Command does not control the U.S. weapons, which are locked in an 80 cubic meter green trailer. We also found that the Colombian military does not control the information dispatched from the site, which presently is being sent via microwave, but which later will be dispatched through a satellite whose ground station is being built. [end recording] Petro said it is impossible for the People's Observers to operate. Not only was he not permitted to film the installations, but an accompanying photographer was ordered to stay out of the area, although he held a card authorizing entry.
