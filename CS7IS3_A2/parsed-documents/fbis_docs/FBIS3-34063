Gunmen opened fire on the supporters of AL mayoral candidate Mohammad Hanif, who is leading in the weekend polls, in the Lalbagh area, killing six instantly. Several of the injured were in critical condition. "We do not have any details on who fired," one police officer at the Lalbagh police station said. The injured were being treated at a local hospital. During Sunday's first ever mayoral and city commissioner elections, one school boy was killed and more than 200 were injured in sporadic clashes between rival groups. Hanif is leading with a wide margin against Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) nominee Mirza Abbas in Dhaka, while another AL candidate, Mohiuddin Chowdhury, has won in the port city of Chittagong, according to preliminary election commission results. But the BNP clinched victory in the cities of Khulna and Rajshahi. The elections are seen here as the first popularity test of the two main political groups, and political analysts said the AL sees the municipal vote as a way of rebuilding its strength in crucial urban areas before the 1996 national polls, after losing all eight Dhaka seats and most of the other urban seats to the BNP in the 1991 parliamentary election.
