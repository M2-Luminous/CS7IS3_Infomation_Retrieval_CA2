It was a question that may never have been raised or answered. [as published] After 15 years, video clubs named cultural products stores and an organization affiliated to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance were set up, and a magazine named "Video and Satellite" was published. The video had remained an underground phenomenon for 15 years and now, when it is displayed in store windows, it has been drained in every possible way. This is why the cultural products stores were not greeted very enthusiastically. The video films had already exerted their destructive effect before they became public. In those days, the video cassettes circulated around the clock, from hand to hand, and perhaps this is still happening. The interior minister said in an interview: "The cabinet is discussing the confiscation of all unauthorized satellite antennae from rooftops and the Interior Ministry will take steps in this direction shortly." He said: "I give my word that in the next two months, with the forts of the law enforcement forces, all the satellite antennae in Tehran will be collected." Is this the way to combat the satellite [programs]? Can we not perceive the difference in the words and deeds of the interior minister? If the satellite programs can be considered immoral and contrary to values, why is the magazine "Video and Satellite" published? Why are we still acting defensively? When the first satellite dish appeared on the rooftop, was it so minute that it could not be seen? Now two years later it is being decided that since a certain Arab country has announced a punishment for having satellite dishes, we should also think on the same lines. When is the satellite authorized and when is it unauthorized? This commentary should not be considered a case in favor of satellite dishes on rooftops, but why was this done so late? The satellite is an international phenomenon and cannot be restricted in one region or even on one continent. One must view it in the international context and not as a minor issue. Satellite technology is progressing by leaps and bounds and perhaps by the next year satellite dishes with a diameter of only 35 centimeters may flood the regional and domestic market. Then what can be done? No promises will be of any use then.
