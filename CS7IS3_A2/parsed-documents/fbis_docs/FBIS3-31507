The Liberal Party-93 (PL-93) is also to be represented at the talks by a group favorable to unification. Asked to explain the situation created in PNL after the so-called "anti-ordinary" congress called by supporters of former PNL leader Radu Campeanu, both the present PNL President Ionescu-Quintus and PNL Vice President Viorel Catarama said the only chance for that grouping was to register as a new party, and said that Mr. Campeanu's supporters "brought grave prejudice to the liberal movement and to the opposition as a whole," and that the new leadership intended "no purge" in the party. "The National Liberal Party, one of the main engineers of the great union of 1918, has taken note with disappointment and apprehension of the irresponsible and strongly anti-Romanian statements of President Mircea Snegur of Moldova," a PNL statement read by its president at the same news conference runs. "PNL hopes that the true Romanians in the Republic of Moldova will be able to defend their national being and independence from these new attempts of turning Bessarabia into a Russian colony," the statement winds up.
