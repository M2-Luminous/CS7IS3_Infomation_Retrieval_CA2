He will seek a definition on the proposal to transform the Falda del Carmen plant. It was reported that Henry Kissinger's consulting firm is interested. Di Tella has scheduled a series of meetings to arrange the participation of President Carlos Menem in the summit of the Americas presidents with Bill Clinton, which still does not have a date, to discuss the supply of A4M planes with radars, and to discuss a possible association for the manufacture and sale of the Pampa 2000 plane. The foreign minister will meet with State Department officials to hear concrete proposals for converting the Cordoba plant, following a U.S. offer of economic and technological assistance. Depending on the answer, the Argentine Government will analyze other proposals by foreign firms, particularly one from France that arrived during the middle of 1993, and the alleged interest by Kissinger's consulting firm. It was reported that the company of the former secretary of state has links with a mobile telecommunications firm that won a bid in the interior of the country and expressed interest in installing its headquarters at the former Condor-2 missile project site. The sources told NA that Di Tella will ask the U.S. firm to define its position on the Falda del Carmen conversion plan so that the government can have "a free hand" to analyze other proposals which have arrived at the Defense Ministry. The Argentine foreign minister will also meet with Commerce Secretary Michael Kantor, State Secretary Warren Christopher, and Military Affairs Secretary Anthony Lake.
