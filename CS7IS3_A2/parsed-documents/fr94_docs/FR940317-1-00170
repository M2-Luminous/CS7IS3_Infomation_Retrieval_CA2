FR940317-1-00170 FR940317-1-00014 Basis for estimates: The statute allows States to submit their State plans every two, three, or four years. Our estimates are based on the average number of State plan submissions per year during the four year periods between Older Americans Act reauthorizations. We estimate that 11 State agencies will incur regulatory burdens in complying with the requirements under proposed sections 1321.17 (c), (d), and (e); 11 State agencies will incur regulatory burdens in complying with proposed section 1321.17(g); and 4 State agencies and trust territories will incur regulatory burdens in complying with proposed section 1321.17(h). Because some States have chosen two or three year State plans, they will either submit new plans or amend approved plans more than once during the four years between reauthorizations. The table above projects our estimate that on average 26 of the 57 State agencies and trust territories will incur burdens on complying with these proposed requirements once a year. We have submitted a copy of this proposed rule to OMB for its review of these information collections. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Allison Eydt, HHS Desk Officer, Human Resources and Housing, OMB, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Washington, DC 20503.
