Russia is important from a global policy viewpoint, and the United States regards the success of Russian reforms as the pillars of the new world order. As for the other former Soviet republics, the United States finds it important that Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan discard their nuclear weapons and the others stay "clean." If, as it promised, Moscow honors the independence of the new states, it will be able to emerge as a crisis manager, or even a judge with U.S. approval. Washington is for regional cooperation in the case of both the CIS and Eastern Europe. Despite all the Czech opposition, Washington supports and encourages the Visegrad cooperation as well. Prague, Warsaw, Budapest, and even the "immature" Bratislava are treated uniformly and placed in the same drawer of "local affairs" in the big global policy cabinet. Clinton lifted the ban on the purchase of U.S. weapons to all the four countries simultaneously, and Christopher also made it clear that the door leading to NATO can either become wider or narrower for these countries. They must prove their democratic maturity in solving their bilateral conflicts. Clinton specially remarked that violent nationalism and anti-Semitism are unacceptable for the United States. He did not hide the fact that the United States is providing greater political and economic support to the new democratic countries in order to help avoid the renewal of totalitarianism. Talbott added that the United States does not want to be the judge in the conflicts of small countries. Nor will the United States take it upon itself to "put in a good word" for them in Moscow. In case of a possible revival of the Russian threat, something that Christopher definitely regards as only a possible supposition, the Visegrad countries can count on U.S. security policy help " to be defined at the proper time." Perhaps this does not seem to be a big thing -- Christopher said -- but this is a very serious responsibility on the part of the NATO. It exceeds the mere consultations. If these countries get deeper into the peace partnership, conduct military exercises together with us, and make military plans together, then we will have relations with them in which their security will become very important for us. If someone turns back, we can again drop the security barrier used in the past, although we would definitely not like to draw a separation line in Europe again. The Russian leader who claims that we promised Moscow not to allow anyone into NATO is making a big mistake, Christopher said. Christopher's deputy Talbott places emphasis on a slightly different thing: "The real integration of Western, Central, and Eastern Europe is a very long process. Just like the Russians, we also fear that Moscow could again become isolated from the outside world. This does not mean that Yeltsin gets a veto right in the possible extension of NATO, but we will definitely take the viewpoints of the Russian reform into consideration," Talbott said. Behind the Visegrad goup, there are the other Eastern European countries. Most of them have not yet fulfilled the preliminary conditions of the peace partnership. (Civil and parliamentary control over the army is not firm enough, the military budget is not completely public and regulated, unsolved territorial issues might emerge, and the civil democracy is not stable enough). Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Macedonia are in this drawer; in addition, these countries are important for the foreign policy makers in Washington not because of themselves but because of the Yugoslav crisis. Given certain U.S. global strategic considerations, the same makes Albania slightly special. NATO could get access to an important port at Durres. Besides, Albania is an excellent place for "keeping an eye" on the Balkans. The third exception is the most developed country in the region, namely Slovenia, which, to its misfortune, is still regarded as a former member of Yugoslavia by the the United States and it is not part of the Visegrad group. (In addition, Slovenia could have a border debate with Croatia.) Small Yugoslavia is last on the list and, together with Bosnia, they are treated in a global policy connection rather than an Eastern European connection. In Brussels, NATO presented three conditions for the Serbs to avoid possible air strikes: 1. The aid convoys must be allowed to enter Srebrenica. 2. The Tuzla airport must be opened. 3. The "strangling" of Sarajevo should end. These are the most clearly formulated conditions, but who would be certain that the threat is more serious this time. Besides, it is questionable whether a Western military intervention is effective at all now that the Serbs have practically won the war. The United States' real dilemma now is which bad thing to choose. If it accepts the international recognition of most of the violent Serbian territorial gains, the moral and legal basis of the new world order will suffer an almost irremediable damage. In addition, this would lead to a long Muslim guerrilla war, which would reopen the conflicts in Croatia as well. If the United States wants to force the Serbs to come up with serious territorial compromises, then it must send troops to Bosnia and get involved in a serious war. It seems that the slogan in Washington today is "No solution is the best solution," and it continues to hope that the impoverished Serbia would be forced to retreat sooner or later. In conclusion, we must return to a factor that also received some new color before and during Clinton's trip. The United States has always regarded the situation of national and ethnic minorities as a security factor in words. However, it drew the conclusion that the more quiet the minorities stay, the better. Washington never supported the demand for collective minority rights in any form, mainly territorial autonomy. Now Clinton repeatedly condemned the etnocentric nationalist state and national concept, as well as the disadvantageous discrimination on an ethnic basis, and he also stressed that guaranteeing the democratic rights of national, ethnic, and religious minorities is a global interest and, thus, it is also important for the United States. Vice President Gore and National Security Adviser Lake stressed for the first time that the oppression of national minorities causes nationalism and incites conflicts. Clinton concretely took a stand on behalf of the Russian minorities in the Baltic, and his staff signalled that the United States supports the idea that international institutions and agreements should also guarantee the minority rights. In the first year of his presidency, Clinton concentrated on U.S. domestic policy, and this will hardly change in the future. However, the concrete balance of his European tour shows that our wider and narrower region, including Hungary, receives a place in shaping the new world order according to weight. It has become clear to a correct and open Hungarian foreign policy free of over or underestimation and a balanced foreign policy in its issues and style that it is worth continuing the Visegrad cooperation and the other subregional cooperation in the benefit of our Western integration, and we must seek an honorable rapprochement with our neighbors. The bad-taste rivalry, the old-style maneuvering between big powers, and all kinds of revanchism could only cause damage. On the other hand, a modern foreign policy that is clear and acceptable to the big powers and a foreign policy free of any exaggerated self-assertion can only strengthen us. One should not "sell" the particular Hungarian interests in any sense of the word; instead, we should harmonize them with the common interests or big powers. And there are more and better conditions for this now.
