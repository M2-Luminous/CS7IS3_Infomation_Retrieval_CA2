Your Excellencies, you are among those persons who have been witnesses to all the [words indistinct] of the republic, which need no explanation. However, I am confident that our hearts are in pain at the suffering of the nation and at the pains of the freedom and independence of the homeland. Tajikistan is [words indistinct] and bleeding. He who sprinkles the salt of hatred and animosity on these wounds and he who is eager for bloodshed is not among the wise. [passage indistinct] One can conclude from the course of events in Tajikistan that certain forces are bent on (?spreading) the devastation of the civil war to the ancient Khojand [present-day Leninabad]. One should remember the tragic events in Afghanistan and should refrain from repeating them in Tajikistan. Now is the time to ponder--for the sake of national sanctity, the integrity of the homeland, and the destiny of the present and future generations--to (?remove) the communist government. Efforts should be made to bring about a government that is for justice and that cares for its citizens and one that will bring prosperity to all the people of Tajikistan.
