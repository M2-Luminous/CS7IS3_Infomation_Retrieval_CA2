Denktas made the clarification in a meeting this afternoon with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, in the occupied areas. In a statement at the Ledra Palace Hotel roadblock, Feissel said the clarifications basically concerned the issue of access to Famagusta. He said there are some positive developments in comparison to the positions expressed by Denktas on 6 May, but added that it is uncertain if these developments will lead to the desired outcome. The UN envoy said he will brief the UN secretary general by tomorrow, who will then inform the Security Council.
