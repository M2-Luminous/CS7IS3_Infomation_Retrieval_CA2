[Ganic] They say that politics is mostly the sport of older people. They have the experience, they are realistic and patient enough. Younger politicians are good for winning battles, duels. Take the politics of the United States, its foreign policy in particular. You will see that it was mostly older politicians who made wise moves. Small countries need that kind of wisdom even more. [Kurtovic] Did we have enough of that wisdom? [Ganic] It was very difficult to have any kind of politics at the beginning of the war, when there was almost no Bosnian politics to speak of. Only the Bosniaks had some kind of program that reflected the moves of that politics. There was quite a lot of Yugoslav politics. One year before the war broke out, we abounded in ideas about how to preserve Yugoslavia. However, other republics did not even dream about that. We were trying to formulate some ideas about preserving Yugoslavia. Milosevic wanted to turn Yugoslavia into some kind of greater Serbia, we know what others wanted.... Later on, however, that politics boiled down to defending the country, the Bosniaks were trying to expand at the political scene. It is too early to say whether they succeeded in that. However, some people in this country are too selfish. They went away, kept aside, and looked after their own interests. [Kurtovic] You have recently returned from the United States. Considering their concessions at a time crucial for Bosnia-Herzegovina, do you think that the United States has two kinds of politics for Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Ganic] President Clinton and Vice President Gore are young people dealing with a serious challenge for the first time. It was by design that Bush would not do anything for Bosnia-Herzegovina. He had a relatively good rating owing to the successfully-ended Gulf crisis and Bosnia-Herzegovina was just another unnecessary risk for him. It is still not too late for Clinton, but that confirms my thesis that politics should be managed by older people. More experienced people would know that fascism and aggression cannot be stopped on a voluntary basis. There is not a single case in the history of international diplomacy of an aggressor willingly giving up its military advantage in negotiations. Speaking about just peace -- and we are faced with a mighty military machinery of our aggressor and with an arms embargo against us -- we cannot expect a just peace. Older (wiser) politicians would solve this problem immediately. In my opinion, the politics of the United States is not ambiguous but undetermined, which is again typical of young politicians. There is one thing, however, that is good for the United States: dodging, in the sense that Bosnia is a European problem and must be solved by Europe. They had two years to eliminate the problem and did nothing, so now we will get involved. Therefore, the United States is provided with an argument in favor of more active involvement.... [Kurtovic] What is really the goal of that indecisive politics? [Ganic] Vice President Gore told me that the politics of the United States is designed to bring peace to Bosnia, peace that has to be acceptable to the legal authorities. I agree with that, but we want a peace that will be a just solution for us. In my opinion, the involvement of the United States is much greater now. [Kurtovic] What prompted the more active involvement? [Ganic] My impression is that Gorazde was the turning point, for the 720 people who were killed there indirectly saved other enclaves. The United States knows that Karadzic's and Milosevic's Serbs (for I cannot blame the entire nation) lie and that they will try to outwit 30 to 50 percent of the ultimatums. The problem is that the European leaders are dwarfs, historically speaking. [Kurtovic] What about the United Nations, what is its role? [Ganic] The United Nations organization is lead by people who have no experience in political management and no refined sense for human rights and liberties. I told Butrus-Ghali he reminds me of a manager who has ruined a company. I told him he was responsible for Gorazde, that the catastrophe happened - - because of his lack of determination and because he had destroyed all the mechanisms -- not only for Bosnia, but for all small countries that counted on the so called UN shield. Butrus-Ghali told me he could do nothing. We talked for about an hour and a half and I think the conversation will stick in the memories of both of us as very unpleasant. Rumor has it that the United States is hiding behind the UN, behind Butrus-Ghali, who runs a house that is not functioning. The United States says it is in favor of lifting the embargo, but the United Naitons, i.e. Russia, can impose a veto. [Kurtovic] What are, actually, U.S. and Russian views about Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Ganic] I think that their views are alike regarding Bosnia, in the sense that they both agree about the integrity of the country. There is, however, an underlying Russian variant - - the Serbs should be given a large part and the Bosniaks have already made an agreement with the Croats and they will get the rest. However, that still presents a division. Our agreement with the Croats is extremely important and it is in the interests of both sides. I told the Americans that the constitution they wrote for us is of extreme importance, especially if it is applied on the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina territory. Together with the Russians, the United States must put pressure on the Belgrade regime to accept it. [Kurtovic] Akashi also advocates the policy of compromise. In your opinion, is he a representative of Japanese politics or just a "player" for key countries in the UN? [Ganic] I do not think he is a particular representative of Japanese politics. Akashi made some big mistakes and his responsibility is documented. He prevented air strikes on positions from which the Serbs were shelling Gorazde for an entire day during the ultimatum. At least 28 people were killed and more than a hundred were wounded. That is direct responsibility and Akashi could have prevented it. He himself did a lot to discredit his political career. Even in his own country. He is directly responsible, for people were killed as a result of his non-action. [Kurtovic] What is the influence of the Islamic countries on the United Nations and the United States? [Ganic] Perhaps we help Islamic countries more then they help us. Our problem seems to have united them for the first time. Before, each of them had their own views. They were not homogenous enough, not unanimous. They can help us rebuild the country, the market, create jobs, and in establishing good relations, which is very important. If Islamic countries were more homogenous, they could jeopardize the national interest of the West and dictate the solution for Bosnia to a large extent. Generally speaking, that is a very slow mechanism. They seem to be more and more involved. [Kurtovic] Could the Islamic countries have used an oil embargo to force the West to act more decisively? [Ganic] That embargo would be most harmful for the United States and Japan. However, these are major decisions, and they are not prepared to make them, at least for the time being. They built a nice unity on the tragedy of Bosnia. Many Islamic countries were not even aware that there are Bosniaks-Muslims living in Bosnia. [Kurtovic] Who is the main obstacle to lifting the arms embargo in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Ganic] It is probably not very likely that the embargo will be lifted in its entirety in the near future. When I was in the United States, I made it clear that we want limited quantities of defensive weapons. We do not demand tanks but antitank shells, we do not demand airplanes, helicopters, just guns. We do not want to win this war but to survive. We cannot use the word victory, for we have already been defeated by the international community. Their view on human rights does not allow us to talk about victory. We discovered darkness and we were hoping to wake up to the light. In a nutshell, if you are intent on having names, Britain is most opposed to lifting the embargo. It is the mouthpiece of such ideas. We know about the Russians, however. There are solutions that would force them to make some concessions. If we only had at least one antitank shell for every tank that attacked us, we would have stopped the war. However, they did not let us defend ourselves. They deprived us of the right to defend ourselves. [Kurtovic] Lately, on the occasion of the events in Gorazde, we have often heard the public blaming generals of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. What do you think about that? [Ganic] In every group of people of the same profession, just a few meet the essential criteria. We say: there are all kinds of weeds in God's garden. Our generals also range from bad to the best. The process of forming the army was a painstaking one and we must occasionally make some personnel changes, especially among its leadership, in order to create competition. One must not forget that we are still at war against an army with a very developed logistics, weapons, positions, an army of more than 50 years in the making. Naturally, every criticism is welcome, but it should not be destructive, it should only serve as a warning for the future. That became a topic which should be reduced to some reasonable limits. There are many unknown heroes and we must remember that. This should teach the generals a lesson in what people understand best. Be where the action is -- that is a message, not a topic for discussion. [Kurtovic] We more often hear that minor fighting for Bosnia-Herzegovina creates major fighting for power. Can you comment on that? [Ganic] With a few honorable exceptions, Bosnia is defended by poor people. And there are two kinds of authority in Bosnia -- those who were elected and those who joined them during the war. Whether we want it or not, we will be forced to send some people back. That will create a much stronger competition. Perhaps that is why some want to seize power today, for it will be more difficult to do it tomorrow. This will be a complex country. We more or less know, even now, what and how much one can do. However, our people are much smarter and we all understand what happened in this war. When the time comes, when those who are less courageous and more competent come, we will welcome them. [Kurtovic] You were recently appointed vice president of the SDA [Party of Democratic Action]. Since when have you been a member? [Ganic] I thought you knew that those two dates overlap (laughter). But there is more to this. I was overcome by the desire to help the Bosniaks as much as I can. According to a theory of my predecessors, the Ganics like many other Bosniak families were expelled from Bosnia. The circle is now complete -- now I return to Bosnia and my son will be born here. These are difficult times for the Bosniaks. They were abandoned by many, but the Bosniaks proved to be noble gentlemen. I felt I had political followers and the SDA leadership sometimes asked for my advice and opinion. I built my political views. However, I had offers from other political parties, perhaps for even better positions. I decided to join the SDA, for I think that my presence can make it a stronger party, not so much now, as after the war. Now most people are fighting on the front lines. On the other hand, we will have a different political system and all activities will go through parties. All those reasons influenced this decision of mine. [Box, p 4] Even With the Serbs A federation is a quite decentralized state. It will even allow the Serbs to be on their own. They can have a Serb flag in every room. And let them have it. But we will not let them divide the country and take what does not belong to them. We were asked whether we could live with the Serbs. We will live together in some areas, somewhere as neighbors, somewhere under the surveillance of the international community on the basis of some rights. Serb fascism, as did other fascisms, will come to an end. [Box, p 5] Helicopter and Morality One UN soldier was wounded in Gorazde and he was picked up by a helicopter around which hundreds of mothers carrying blood-covered, wounded children gathered. They begged to get their children in the helicopter, for that was the only possible help. No! The helicopter was sent out to pick up only that soldier. The United Nations was unrelenting. You all heard the mayor of Gorazde, Ismet Briga, who begged NATO to bomb the inhabitants of Gorazde to end their suffering. That is the result of the embargo and of the moral quality of that action.
