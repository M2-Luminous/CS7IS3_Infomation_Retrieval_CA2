During an interview with Cuban Ambassador Abelardo Curbelo, the Mexican official expressed Mexico's willingness to establish and expand technical and scientific relations throughout the continent. As an example of this, he highlighted Mexico's contribution of technological methods used in the production of corn, wheat, tubers, and vegetables, among other types of crops, which are not in use in several other countries. Curbelo said the Cuban Government was pleased with the progress achieved in its trade activities with Mexico. He proposed extending this exchange to include genetic studies for improving basic grain seeds and vegetable oil crops, as well as several species of cattle. He also stressed the Cuban farmers' interest in learning about new methods of controlling agricultural pests and disease, currently in use in Mexico. The Cuban official offered to transfer sugar cane farming and production technology developed by his country to Mexico in exchange. Hank Gonzalez also spoke with Japanese Ambassador Mitsuro Donokawi. They discussed the new conditions of the world market and the need to increase bilateral relations to ensure a fair and balanced commercial system. They also examined the cooperation programs currently being channeled through the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The JICA is in charge of administrating the Japanese Government's resources and the development areas it supports in its beneficiary nations. Furthermore, they evaluated three projects that are already under way. The first of these projects is a five-year agricultural development program for the mining communities in the dry desert regions of Guerrero Negro, Baja California. The second project is called Basic Silkworm Breeding Technology, which deals with silkworm breeding and collection techniques. This knowledge is currently applied in several states across the country and will receive $950,000 over five years. The third of these beneficiary programs is the production technology improvement plan for small-scale rice growers. This plan is now being applied in Morelos State. The officials exchanged points of view on another nine projects currently under evaluation for future implementation. An agricultural modernization plan, a reconversion study for Tapachula, an agricultural equipment and machinery test and evaluation center, and residual waters recycling and usage techniques for more efficient irrigation are some of the more significant topics being discussed.
