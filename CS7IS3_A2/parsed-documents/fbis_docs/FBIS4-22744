The sowing of perennial grasses is now being finished up. Among the first to succeed in this task were farms located in the Crimean Republic, as well as in Volyn, Zhitomir, Zakarpat, Zaporozhye, Lvov, and Nikolayev oblasts. Because of the lack of mineral fertilizers--the present demand for them is being satisfied only to the extent of 17 percent--the vitalization of winter crops has been restricted. Winter crops have been resown on 1,013,400 hectares, including grains and legumes on 939,400 hectares. According to the latest data, the area of ruined winter crops will reach 2.5 million hectares. The Crimean Republic, as well as Odessa, Nikolayev, Kherson, Zakarpat, and Chernigov oblasts have successfully coped with the tasks of sowing early spring crops and resowing winter ones. Work has begun on sowing sugar beets, in which close to 1.5 million hectares have been planted. Taking part in this work have been farms in the Vinnitsa, Odessa, Chernigov, Nikolayev, Cherkassy, and Kiev regions.
