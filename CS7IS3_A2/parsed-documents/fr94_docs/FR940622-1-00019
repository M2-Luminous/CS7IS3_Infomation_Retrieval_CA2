FR940622-1-00019 FR940622-1-00008 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 15 CFR Part 990 RIN 0648&hyph;AE13 Natural Resource Damage Assessments AGENCY: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of comment period. SUMMARY: Section 1006(e)(1) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) requires the President, acting through the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere to promulgate regulations for the assessment of natural resource damages resulting from the discharge of oil. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposed those regulations on January 7, 1994 (59 FR 1062). In response to comments and numerous requests NOAA extended the comment period from April 7, 1994 to July 7, 1994. (59 FR 9688) Today's Notice further extends the comment period on the proposed rule to October 7, 1994. DATES: Written comments should be received no later than October 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written inquiries are to be submitted to: Damage Assessment Regulations Team (DART), c/o NOAA/DAC, 1305 East-West Highway, SSMC # 4, 10th Floor, Workstation # 10218, Silver Spring, MD 20910. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda Burlington or Karl Gleaves, Office of General Counsel, DART, telephone 202&hyph;606&hyph;8000; FAX: 202&hyph;606&hyph;4900. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 1. Background On January 7, 1994 (59 FR 1062), NOAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the natural resource damage assessment and restoration regulations required by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. NOAA requested comments, recommendations, and technical information concerning appropriate assessment procedures and the overall assessment process. NOAA also announced a series of regional meetings to discuss and solicit comments on the proposed rule (59 FR 1189). On March 1, 1994, NOAA extended the comment period to July 7, 1994 (59 FR 9688). Through today's Notice, NOAA announces a further extension of the comment period to October 7, 1994. A summary of information gathered at the previously announced regional meetings and specific issues on which NOAA seeks further comment will appear in a future Notice. II. Comment Period for Proposed Rule Since its first extension of time for public comment from April 7, 1994 to July 7, 1994, NOAA has received numerous requests from States and other interested parties to extend the comment period for the proposed rule. As in the previous extension requests, most requesters need more time to review the compensation formulas and its supporting documentation. In addition, some requesters need additional time to review the body of literature supporting NOAA's proposal for the use of contingent valuation. NOAA is dedicated to encouraging a thorough and thoughtful review of all components of the proposed rule, and in particular review and comment on the proposed compensation formulas and the economic methodology for estimating lost nonuse values known as contingent valuation. Therefore, the comment period for the proposed rule on natural resource damage assessment under the OPA is extended for ninety days. Comments on the proposed rule are now due on or before October 7, 1994. NOAA is coordinating its rulemaking with a rulemaking being conducted by the Department of the Interior (DOI). DOI has published a proposed natural resource damage assessment rule under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) and the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). (59 FR 23097) In a separate Notice in today's Federal Register , DOI is announcing the extension of the comment period on its proposed rule. The standards proposed for the assessment of lost nonuse values contained in DOI's proposed rule are identical to those proposed by NOAA. Commenters on NOAA's proposed standards for use of the economic methodology known as contingent valuation are encouraged to submit copies of their comments both to NOAA, at the address provided at the beginning of this Notice, and to DOI at the address specified in its notice appearing elsewhere in today's Federal Register . Authority: Sec. 1006(e), Pub. L. 101&hyph;380, 33 U.S.C. 2701 et seq. Dated: June 17, 1994. Douglas K. Hall, Assistant Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15191 Filed 6&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;12&hyph;P
