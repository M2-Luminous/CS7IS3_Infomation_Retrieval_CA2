Saltenis, new chief editor of LIETUVOS AIDAS, by Kestutis Simonavicius; place and date not given: "`I Ended Up Here Very Unexpectedly', Says Seimas Member Who Has Become the New Head of LIETUVOS AIDAS"] [Text] LIETUVOS RYTAS has already written about the changes on the LIETUVOS AIDAS editorial staff and has published an interview with S. Stoma, who was recently released from his duties as chief editor of that daily newspaper. Today we present an interview with S. Saltenis, the new chief editor of LIETUVOS AIDAS. [Simonavicius] Will LIETUVOS AIDAS change now that there is a new chief editor? [Saltenis] You'll be able to judge by reading LIETUVOS AIDAS. However, there is no doubt that when a director comes to a theater, he imbues it with his own guidelines and his own character. Those who know me, my views, and my manner can easily imagine what the newspaper will be like. I view the newspaper as a certain component part of culture and of our collective creative work, and will without doubt try to ensure that the newspaper comprises an aspect of culture. I dream about a newspaper which contains information, information, and more information, and in which commentary appears separately and only after the information has been presented. [Simonavicius] Will there be a turnover in the ranks of journalists at LIETUVOS AIDAS now that you have become the chief editor? [Saltenis] I really am a vegetarian, not a cannibal. I have always said and still say that I can work with anyone, because each person has creativity. This is something I know back from my days in the Young People's Theater. There are times when it seems as if an actor is downtrodden, doesn't accomplish anything or display anything for 10 years; however, one has to have the ability to unlock him, to somehow awaken him, to find a place, topic, part for him. This is why I think that the composition of the editorial staff might change only in the event that some people are simply not working, or forbid the thought, undertake to harm the newspaper on purpose. However, I do not believe that this will be the case. [Simonavicius] A few years ago, you and S. Stoma were the founders of SIUARES ATENAI and worked together there. How did it come about that you are now replacing S. Stoma? [Saltenis] Perhaps it is fate. I never thought or knew that S. Stoma was like that, just as I also was not acquainted with A. Juozaitis, who was also among the founders of SIAURES ATENAI. [Simonavicius] The former editor maintained that the Conservative Party was involved in his dismissal. Can you confirm or deny this? [Saltenis] I cannot. I also have no intention of concealing that I am a member and a founder of the Fatherland Union-Conservative Party. However, it would be stupid of me--and it would also harm the newspaper and Lithuania's press as a whole--if I envisioned LIETUVOS AIDAS as a party newspaper. [Simonavicius] S. Stoma has indicated that SIAURES ATENAI was an unprofitable newspaper, but he managed to buy $60,000 worth of LIETUVOS AIDAS shares. [Saltenis] It would be great if SIAURES ATENAI would have that much money and could support other newspapers. However, SIAURES ATENAI is an unprofitable newspaper and stays on its feet thanks to donations and supporters. S. Stoma is apparently a fine economist and businessman, but such things are of little interest to me. S. Saltenis will channel all the money received from various existing and future funds supporting the democratic press into LIETUVOS AIDAS, and will not take one cent of this amount. S. Saltenis will truly not cost LIETUVOS AIDAS a cent, because he will work without salary, as he has also worked up to now at SIAURES ATENAI. [Simonavicius] All this notwithstanding, where did you get the money to buy LIETUVOS AIDAS shares? [Saltenis] There is no money yet, there are only supporters. [Simonavicius] Can you specifically name those supporters? [Saltenis] I will be able to say more precisely later, when these matters are settled. I am not taking care of this personally. However, the money will not be deposited for the purpose of making a profit on it; the money will stay in LIETUVOS AIDAS. [Simonavicius] How will you coordinate the responsibilities you have as a member of Seimas, as a member of the board of a private company, and as a newspaper editor? Doesn't this conflict with the Constitution? [Saltenis] There are, I believe, a number of Seimas members who head companies, firms, and newspapers. This question had not occurred to anyone up to now, because those members of Seimas belonged to the governing majority. However, if the type of problem to which you refer were to emerge, there would be a variety of ways to go about solving it, about which I would gladly inform you. I ended up here very unexpectedly and these are very difficult days for me now. A lot of psychological preparation has to go into something like this, and that is a great hardship, one which I wouldn't wish on anyone.
