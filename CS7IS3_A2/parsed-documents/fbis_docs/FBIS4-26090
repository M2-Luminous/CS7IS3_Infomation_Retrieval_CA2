The bill, introduced today by four democrats, including Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell and Representative Nancy Pelosy, advocates imposing sanctions on products made by the Chinese Liberation Army, defense-related companies and certain state-owned enterprises. Any such sanctions bill will undermine the president's leadership on China policy and cripple the ability of American companies to compete successfully in the fast-growing China market, affirmed the business coalition in its statement. Mitchell and Pelosy have been trying to revoke President Bill Clinton's decision on May 26 of renewing China's MFN [most-favored nation] status unconditionally and delinking trade and human rights. They had also played a leading role in the Bush administration in attempting to impose conditions on China's MFN. Approval of this bill could send confusing signals about the reliability of American suppliers and undermine the efforts of American companies to create exports, markets, and additional U.S. jobs, the business coalition declared. "We are prepared to work with the White House and our Democratic and Republican allies in Congress to fight any legislation that threatens to undermine the president's policy," it added. The Business Coalition on U.S.-China Trade is an umbrella organization of American companies and trade associations, representing thousands of large and small American businesses, farm organizations, and consumer groups that support continued U.S. trade with China. Nearly 800 American companies and associations signed the coalition's letter to the president early last month urging that MFN be separated from human rights issues. A week ago, Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy, said that if there was any further debate in the congress on the issue of China's MFN, the administration would oppose any effort to reverse the decision the president had taken.
