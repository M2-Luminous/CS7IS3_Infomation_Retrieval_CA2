[Clarke] No, I didn't think during the campaign it was likely there would be tax increases because I then shared the general view that the recession was shortly going to come to an end and we were not far from recovery. I think all three potitical parties campaigned on the same expectation, which was reinforced by quite a good proportion of the economic commentary we had. Also, I didn't actually say anything during the election campaign that has been held against me, which, given that I campaigned fairly prominently, shows I was not too misled by my expectations then of the recovery. But nevertheless I did not foresee that we'd have to have tax increases as we've had. [Smith] What was your reaction as a non-Treasury minister when you first heard of the tax increases Norman Lamont was planning? [Clarke] By that time it was beginning to be clear there was a crisis in the public finances. I believed it was necessary for Norman to tackle that straight away because if he didn't tackle it in that budget it would be too late. I was actually a supporter of the proposition that he should delay the tax increases as far as possible until April of 1994 because I was one of those still not certain that the recovery was strong enough then, in April 1993, to be able to carry it. Politically that proved to be a mistake but I am not sure that with hindsight I would necessarily change my mind because it was wise from the point of view of the economy to delay it for 12 months. [Smith] Do you think there is any danger that you have indulged in overkill on tax, in two senses: one in that the PSBR (public-sector borrowing requirement) looks as though it may undershoot, and second, in terms of the risk to the recovery? [Clarke] That's the serious judgment one has to make and that I made in preparing the November budget. I believed we needed to do a little bit more on tax, despite the fact we'd had an extremely effective autumn spending round. I just felt it was necessary in November to get completely on top of the problem of public-sector borrowing. My judgment remains that the increase in taxation this year is both necessary to sustain the recovery and also will not itself damage the recovery, which is now very much stronger than 12 months ago. You're right, the PSBR may undershoot; I always realised 50 billion pounds was an estimate but it was the best estimate anybody could make in the summer. At the moment we still don't know because the last month of the year can produce quite substantial figures. But it could be a little under 50 billion pounds. If it undershoots, so much the better. it does not make me regret the fiscal judgment I made at the time of the budget. Next year and beyond? In my opinion, the Treasury has tended to underestimate the effects of recovery on public finances. And it could be that the decline in public-sector borrowing might be rather faster than in the Red Book (the Treasury's budget report). [Smith] You were quoted once as saying the tax increases could check the recovery. That is no longer your belief? [Clarke] If you increase taxation it will take some of the edge off consumer spending compared with what it would have been if you had not raised taxation. In so far as it does take a little money out of the consumer's pocket, I do not believe it will damage the recovery. My forecast of 2.5 percent growth in GDP this year is regarded as completely credible by most of the commentators and by the markets. I hope to see a balanced recovery so I would like to see further improvements in investment and a good strong export performance alongside the consumer demand we already have -- which is, at the moment, satisfactorily up compared with 12 months ago. [Smith] Do you see this as a useful side-effect of the necessary, as you would regard it, fiscal adjustment -- a rebalancing of the economy away from over-reliance on consumer spending? [Clarke] It is a usefull side-effect but it is a side-eftect. It was not the principal motive. The principal motive was in order to get healthy public finances again and to make it quite clear that the public sector deficit was under control. You've been suggesting recently that the impact of the tax increases has been exaggerated, particularly by your political opponents. Is that purely a political point or does it reflect a concern that the public may be over-anxious about the impact of the tax increases, reflected in the fall in consumer confidence we've seen? It's largely a political exchange because I do think the Labour party in particular has been producing figures that cause serious alarm and obviously do political damage to the governing party. I also think that people have discounted the effect of the tax increases to a certain extent already but, plainly, I don't want over-the-top political campaigning to start unnecessarily damaging consumer confidence. I have always thought that surveys of consumer confidence tend to reflect what people have read in their morning newspapers. And if you look at consumer behaviour it has been pretty satisfactory in recent months. [Smith] You've said you will not make tax cuts for political reasons. Can you tell me what your criteria will be for tax cuts? Does the budget have to be back in balance before you make any tax cuts? [Clarke] No, we have an aim of balance in the medium term, which I always supported before I came into office and have continued to support since. But any further tax cuts will depend on my judgment of the effects on the public finances, on confidence and on the markets, and whether they would regard any further move to improve incentives and reduce marginal rates in the economy as responsible. At an uncertain stage like this when a recovery is beginning to grow, one of the key things is to build up a reputation for credibility and confidence and, politically, to retain the government's reputation for competence in economic affairs. Going back to tax cuts, I always think the public are more intelligent than most people give them credit for. They can judge whether tax cuts are the act of a chancellor who is trying to win votes, or the act of a chancellor who is pursuing an economic policy that he actually believes and thinks he is now able to do something with genuine desirable effects on people's behaviour. I intend to be in the second category. [Smith] Is it now your expectation that you will not have to make further big tax increases during this parliament? [Clarke] You're asking me to make my fiscal judgment for the next budget rather a long way in advance. At this stage, comparatively soon after the last budget, I am quite confident of the path I set out then. Also, I wouldn't be so unwise as to be drawn by your understandable interest in what I might do in the future. [Smith] You did say then that the budget sorted out the problem of the public finances once and for all? [Clarke] That was my aim, yes. My aim was to have one budget to sort out the problems of the public finances. I hope and I remain confident that that will not be the dominant issue in future budgets. Of course I might have had to decide that I couldn't do that. In the autumn of last year, looking at the recovery, I might have had to decide, well, there would have to be more than one bite before we get on top of this. But I didn't think so, and I still don't think so. Here we are at the beginning of April. The next two or three months are the critical time, which I believe will confirm my judgment that the recovery can take it and that we will continue on course towards our medium-term objectives. [Smith] What happens if the recovery can't take it? [Clarke] Given that I don't think that is going to happen, I'm not going to speculate on what I would do. Chancellors start earning their money when the economy starts behaving in a way they did not expect, nor did most other people. There have been times since I've been chancellor, particularly immediately after the budget, when there was something dangerously near consensus that Britain was now set for a period of sustained recovery. If that dominant body of opinion proves wrong, that's when the chancellor has to earn his corn, but I see no point in speculating about it. So far, I have not got a prickly feeling in my palms that it might happen. I cannot see what is going to stop the recovery being sustained. [Smith] Do you see yourself as a long-serving chancellor and, if so, what would you like to do? [Clarke] I would very much like to be a long-serving chancellor, not least because I think I was reshuffled too quickly from my last two jobs. What do I see myself as? I would like to see myself presiding over a sustained period of recovery, that's obvious, all chancellors would like to. I think I have a chance as chancellor for a few years where we regain the strong economic performance of the mid 1980s. More than that obvious ambition, the other thing I would really like to do is to be a chancellor in a Treasury that is an economic department which, alongside the departments of trade and employment, sees itself as interested in supporting the real economy, interested in making a positive contribution to improvements on the supply side in this country. [Smith] That suggests a more interventionist approach? [Clarke] No it doesn't. Because I'm generally not in favour of interventionism or industrial policies of the old-fashioned kind. The way I would describe it is that it involves a wider approach to the job. I take a close interest, obviously, in ihe behaviour of the markets I take a close interest in all those features of macro- economic policy which are necessary to set the right climate here, but the real acid test of the economic policy of the government is: how do you create a combination of circumstances that enables British industry to become more competitive and to become more prosperous and thereby, create jobs and prosperity? I do tend to judge the impact of what I am doing by thinking what is this doing to help those people responsible for managing British industry, selling British goods and services and creating jobs in this country? Most people in the Treasury are concerned with the control of public expenditure. This is the time when they've got to be good at the job. I have never joined publicly in the criticism of the Treasury in the past, so I don't see why I should now. I've done battle with it often enough. The system of government we have in this country does lead to a more effective system of public spending control than most other countries. But no good business is run solely by its finance director. This department should be concerned with economic affairs generally. [Smith] What about some of the issues that past chancellors have attempted to grapple with, not always successfully; I'm talking about an integration of tax and social security and a bigger shift from direct to indirect taxation? Are those the sort of challenges that appeal to you? [Clarke] Yes but what I never do is speculate about things I am looking at, until I've reached the stage where I want to speculate about them publicly. I've had a long-standing interest in the relationship between the tax and the benefits system, and a long- standing interest in work incentives at every level of society and their effect on people's performance, so while I am at the Treasury I don't expect my interest to lessen. [Smith] Direct to indirect taxation? [Clarke] Yes, I have always supported that, it is something we set out and embarked on when we came in in 1979, and we've made quite considerable advances. My public statements on the subject I have tended to regard as a reaffirmation of the long-standing basis of policy. [Smith] Do you hope to repeat the technique used successfully last November, when you ended up with a reduction in the spending total? [Clarke] Well, I haven't refined my techniques yet, but we have until July to set the spending remit again and in the autumn we'll discover how we're going to hit that remit and whether it's necessary and possible to beat it again. You should never revisit the scene of a disaster, which is one rule of politics. Another is: never expect success to repeat itself twice in precisely the same way. Michael (Portillo) and I will hope to repeat the success of last year but won't just go in for a straight replay on the assumption that it will work again. But it was a good operation last autumn and a very necessary reassertion of proper control over the level of public spending. What gave me the greatest pleasure was imposing real constraint over spending plans and at the same time preserving stated political priorities. [Smith] Many people in the markets say the government's political difficulties will impact badly on sterling. You are very much in favour of a stable exchange rate, so would you be rather concerned about any substantial weakening? [Clarke] Stability of exchange rates is preferable. Political events do have an effect on the markets and if governments are perceived to have political difficulties we tend to see, for a day or two, an effect on the markets whatever country you're in. Personally, I think as far as the fundamentals are concerned that kind of thing has no lasting effect. Were we to have any flutter in the markets I'd have to make a judgment about whether this was just three days' reaction to perceived political rows or whether it had any likelihood of lasting. [Smith] So you wouldn't necessarily respond to something that you thought was whatever the opposite of froth is? [Clarke] I don't think I should. I shouldn't make decisions on the basis that I wake up one morning, gaze at the Reuters screen and think: the newspapers have taken the edge off sterling, what am I going do about it? I do join in the process of asking why this is happening, is it going to last, and the key thing that makes it easier to react to events is if the markets share my feeling that the fundamentals are right. The markets have grown a little more worried about inflation in recent weeks. That's surprising. It comes slightly on the back of the markets being unsettled anyway by the Fed putting up interest rates in America, plainly as a precautionary measure against inflationary pressures there. Then we had a bad reaction to last week's inflation figures here. I didn't share that reaction. They were very much in line with what I expected. One or two commentators rosily expected they'd be even better than they were and the markets reacted badly. Long-term (interest) rates were very low before. They'ye now gone up quite sharply but we wait to see. [Smith] So you don't think, in the case of Britain, that inflation fears are justified? [Clarke] No. If the market has fears about inflation, I see no cause for that. [Smith] Can I ask you finally about your relations with the Bank of England? You said a little while ago that you were agnostic on the question of full independence. Has anything happened in the intervening months to shift your opinion? [Clarke] To change my public agnosticism? I remain on extremely good terms with the governor and the Bank and I operate at present so that decisions on monetary policy are in the end mine, after listening to the Bank, listening to the Treasury and all the other advice that pours in. I have tried to introduce step-by-step, slightly more transparency into the relationship. If you try to retain an air of total mystery, all that happens is that you get idle speculation and gossip which unsettles the market. But I'm genuinely agnostic about the right relationship between parliament, government and the Bank. A little more transparency might show that there's nobody infallible in this world. [Smith] You said you make the decisions, Are there circumstances when you'd perhaps overrule the Bank's advice? [Clarke] It seems to be constitutionally my role to do so if I feel it necessary. I always say I'll take responsibility for anything that's actually within my control. In the end, you make your own decisions but not in any impulsive or macho way. I continue to be more attracted by the idea of a little more openness in the whole thing. [Smith] So you've been in full agreement with the Bank? Some people say that in February you wanted a half-point cut, the Bank wanted nothing, so you settled on a quarter. [Clarke] Speculation surrounding that decision has made me interested in a little more transparency. At the moment we operate on the basis of total secrecy. Nobody is contemplating total openness because it is market-sensitive. Last February there was the kind of half gossip which seemed to me the least attractive. I think a quarter-point reduction then could hardly be described as harmful. [Smith] So if people knew the full story, they would realise it was genuinely a collective decision? [Clarke] All politicians believe that, if only people knew the full story all would be for the best and the best of all possible worlds. I actually think it was a good decision. In this job more than most, it's when you look back and see what actually happened that you can make the best judgment of decisions, which is usually a fairly frightening prospect for most chancellors of the exchequer eventually. The timing was rather strange. If you'd decided it, people would have said it was a politician who didn't understand the markets, timing it on that particular day. Well, the actual timing was decided by the Bank, on a decision that had been taken a week before. I decided on the reduction before the Fed increase. To be fair, I did decide after the Fed increase not to pull it. But as part of the new spirit of openness I left the exact timing to the governor.
