He told a press conference at the end of the summit that "actions are planned to open the airport at Tuzla (northeast Bosnia) and allow the relief of UNPROFOR troops in Srebenica," the Moslem enclave where a Canadian contingent has been trapped for six months. He said Britain and France had put forward the proposal to take concrete action. The proposal was added on Tuesday morning to the text of the final declaration and adopted unanimously, he said. Mitterrand said the wording had been drawn up by British Prime Minister John Major and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and checked by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Mitterrand refused to specify what kind of action was envisaged, saying that it was "not usual" to make such information available for security reasons. "We can no longer count on the goodwill of the three warring parties and the first duty of the United Nations forces is to ensure the safety of their comrades engaged in peacekeeping activities. That will be the case in Srebenica and at Tuzla Airport." Last August NATO announced it would resort to air strikes to protect UN troops on the ground and in Moslem safe areas if the United Nations formally requested it.
