Sourmelidhis] [Excerpts] At a time when Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller appears to be threatening Greece, Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis is ready to resign from his post as president of that republic to protest the secret negotiations between members of the UN Security Council and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' side and the negative decisions on a Cyprus solution being manipulated by the United Nations. Yesterday proved clearly that Greek-Turkish relations mainly "pass through" Nicosia and depend on the solution of the Cyprus issue. Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will meet his Turkish counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, today in Istanbul in a very bad climate that Ankara has created, aiming to get Greece involved in adventures and divert Athens from supporting the Cypriot leadership over the negative Security Council decisions. Papoulias and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will discuss the Cyprus issue and Greek-Turkish relations on the sidelines of the NATO foreign ministers' spring conference. The United States is particularly disturbed and dissatisfied with President Kliridhis' reaction and is trying to avert such a possibility. The United States is aiming to find a way for a political dialogue between Greece and Turkey. At the same time, however, the Security Council's actions protect Denktas' and Ankara's intransigence. A few days ago, Ciller sent U.S. President Bill Clinton another letter about the Cyprus issue. Kliridhis also sent a letter on the same issue. U.S. Ambassador Thomas Niles yesterday had a surprise meeting with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and discussed Greek-Turkish relations and the Cyprus issue. [passage omitted] The Cyprus Issue UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report on Cyprus essentially led the Cyprus issue into another deadlock. Of the five alternative solutions that Butrus-Ghali suggested, only one refers to Denktas' responsibility for the deadlock. The United States, as well as Britain and France, chose the solution that will lead to new, quick negotiations--without blaming the Turkish Cypriots--and to a new, supplementary report by the UN secretary general, which, however, will not refer to the substance of the Cyprus issue. When briefed by a U.S. diplomat, President Kliridhis reacted strongly to this development, saying that he is ready to quit. He also told the Cypriot people that they have been deceived by the allies and negotiators. Kliridhis was enraged when he learned that the United States wants to include in the supplementary report some of the measures it promised to Denktas and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Tugay Ulucevik last month in Vienna. The Cypriot Government never learned officially about these promises. President Kliridhis is waiting for Papandreou to extend an invitation to the Cypriot National Council to confer in Athens. He is also waiting for a final date to be set for his meeting with European Commission President Jacques Delors in Corfu before the EU summit. [passage omitted]
