The Thai delegation will be led by Transport and Communications permanent secretary Mahidon Chanthrangkun. Other members will include Civil Aviation Department director-general Dr Sisuk Chanthrangsu, Thai Airways International [THAI] president Thamnun Wangli, and Somnuk Hanphanit, THAI's vice-president for international relations. The US side will be headed by Carl Candiff, the State Department's head of special negotiations for transport affairs. The team includes representatives from the Department of Transportation and members of national air carriers, a source in the Thai Transport and Communications Ministry said. The Thai team will be listening closely to US proposals on implementing a new agreement the source said. THAI believes that an open-skies policy would hurt Thailand, the source said. "US carriers are anxious for the agreement since their flights to Thailand outnumber the flights THAI operates to the US." THAI flies four times a week to Los Angeles and has no plan to increase flights until at least the end of 1994. US airlines -- Northwest, United, Delta and Flying Tiger (a cargo carrier) -- operate 28 flights a week to Bangkok. American Airlines also wants to enter the Southeast Asia market. "Now they are flying under a seasonal agreement approved by the Thai Transport and Communications Ministry," said the source. "Under this agreement the US feels insecure, since they cannot make long-term plans and flight numbers will be frozen at 28 per week which is insufficient to accommodate the growing numbers of passengers and cargo." The source said this week's negotiations would be confined to broad principles.
