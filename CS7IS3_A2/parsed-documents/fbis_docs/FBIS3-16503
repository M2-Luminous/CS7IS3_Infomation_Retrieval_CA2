This was the aim which its leadership, together with the Russian Federation, had hoped for during previous weeks. Kazakhstani Prime Minister Tershchenko, in an exclusive interview to correspondents of ITAR-TASS and KAZTAG said: "This demarche is explained by a necessity for a much more thorough preparation for the Moscow summit. It certainly demands additional time and effort. The decisions made last year at the Ashgabat summit instilled hope for development of integrational processes in the CIS, but in reality implementation of the agreements reached on creation of an economic union is extremely slow. The economic situation in practically all CIS countries continues to deteriorate. In order to prevent the negative processes from acquiring a scale of catastrophe, a dynamic breakthrough is currently needed more than ever before toward a qualitatively new state of affairs in all main guidelines of our cooperation." "That is why, Tereshchenko goes on to say, we in Kazakhstan think it is extremely important to discuss a number of top priority issues at the forthcoming summit. First, issues concerning acceleration of the creation of a common customs space and zones of free trade. It is also necessary to take urgent measures to commission the interstate bank, which was set up over a year ago but is still inoperative. For this end, in our opinion, it is necessary to set up a payment center for settling payments through this bank and later to reorganize it into a currency union on the basis of introduction of a supranational currency. This way will once and forever overcome the crisis of payments and normalize payment and credit relations between the CIS states." "It is also time to set up a coordination organ of the CIS in Moscow. Without it, and this has been already proven in practice, neither agreements nor any other enforceable enactments will work as they are, and the economic union will remain, as before, on paper. This organ can be called a committee, a council or any other name, but it should by all means accumulate in it the highest intellectual potential and relevant research centers, including the CIS statistical board." The Prime minister said in conclusion: "I submitted these and other suggestions in mid-February to the head of the Russian Federation Government, Chernomyrdin, who is chairman of the Council of the CIS Heads of State. As far as I know, the Russian Federation and a number of other countries are currently actively elaborating and developing them. Thus, it is quite possible to expect that the forthcoming April summit will be a real milestone on our difficult, dramatic, tense and yet hopeful way to a real and prosperous economic union."
