The job assignment rate hit a record high and the job-awaiting rate dropped to a new low in many years. By the end of last year, more than 29,000 people were provided jobs, the job assignment rate being 92.36 percent, an increase of 4.27 percent over the previous year, overfulfilling the job assignment target set by the provincial government. Last year the job-awaiting rate in cities and towns dropped to 2.9 percent, ranking in the forefront of the country. Qiu Baichuan, chief of the provincial employment service bureau, said during an interview with our reporter that last year's good achievements in job assignments was mainly due to the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, which effectively promoted the carrying out of labor system reform and provided a policy guarantee and a relaxed environment for employment. Last year the province's national economy remained at a two-digit development rate, thus providing many job opportunities and positions for job-awaiting people and job seekers. In addition, the development of market economy greatly changed people's employment concept. Last year the number of people who obtained jobs in collective, individual, and private enterprises accounted for 80.41 percent of the total number of people who got employment.
