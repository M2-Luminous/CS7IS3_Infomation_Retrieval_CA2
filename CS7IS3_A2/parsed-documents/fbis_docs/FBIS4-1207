Meyer on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 23 April] [Text] The accord on Afrikaner selfdetermination which was signed by the Freedom Front, the ANC and the government, is the result of months of negotiations. In this process the government took an active part with great dedication. An [words indistinct] constitutional settlement has now been reached which offers the constitutional opportunity to the Freedom Front for continuing negotiations on the question of selfdetermination, even after the elections. The government has gone out of its way to make this settlement possible, also by amending the 1993 Constitution to ensure a constitutional principle on selfdetermination and a mechanism for continuing negotiations. Therefore no logical or sensible ground for parties like the CP [Conservative Party] to stay outside the constitutional dispensation and not participating in the elections, still exists. The government does not, however, wish to create the impression that either it or the NP [National Party] is in favour of the creation of an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] by their participation in this facilitation process. It remains an unrealisable idea because Afrikaners do not form a majority of the population in any region of the country. It is and will continue to be the viewpoint of the government and NP that selfdetermination could be exercised in other ways and through other mecanisms than a volkstaat with demarcated geographical boundaries. This viewpoint is in accordance with international trends. Other forms of selfdetermination can be achieved within a federal dispensation through the devolution of power to specific communities.
