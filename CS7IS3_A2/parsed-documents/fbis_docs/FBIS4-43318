But our talk can only begin with the event of the moment: the latest eruption of the Sulcis [Sardinian coalmine closure] issue on Tuesday [7 June]. [Locatelli] Minister, who has made you more angry? The miners demonstrating in front of Palazzo Chigi [government seat] for the implementation of the agreements, or Berlusconi when he contradicted you? [Gnutti] Neither the miners, who deserve the respect owed to people who work, nor Berlusconi, who has concurred with the technical criticisms that I expressed on the Sulcis deal, regardless of the decision to honor a pact signed by the previous government, have made me angry. However, the final word has not yet been said. I shall be visiting the Sulcis area in person and, as stated in the cabinet memorandum, I shall ascertain whether or not there are alternative solutions to the gasification plan that will make for better use of public funds in promoting real development in the area concerned. [Locatelli] The other surprise aspect of Tuesday's cabinet meeting was the lack of decisionmaking regarding the automobile industry. Why was that? [Gnutti] The simple truth is that these measures have never been discussed at government level, and I personally shall keep quiet on the subject, because talking about it would only upset the market. All I can say is that we are seeing the first signs of recovery in the automobile market, which I find very encouraging. [Locatelli] You claim that the best policy to adopt on industry at the moment is to remove the constraints rather than to provide financing. After the initial action taken by the government, what other measures are you thinking about? [Gnutti] We shall do away with the pointless chores, the bureaucratic burdens, and the confusion that pervades the statute books so as to render the laws governing business as simple as possible. The first step addressed taxation. The second will address the labor market, and the third the environment, on which I shall submit a framework bill clarifying rights and duties. [Locatelli] Is the removal of constraints sufficient to foster the growth of small businesses? [Gnutti] Of course it is not sufficient, but it is essential. However, an all-round policy of support for small businesses will require a series of new financial measures ranging from the creation of a type of NASDAQ or local stock exchanges for small- and medium- sized enterprises to the launch of pension funds and closed funds. [Locatelli] And to enhance the competitiveness of the few major corporations? [Gnutti] The one thing that we cannot do, because in the first place Europe forbids it, let alone our free-market convictions, is to adopt a policy of aid and financial handouts to sectors of industry. But this does not mean that the state must take no action. Quite the contrary. It must foster the development of the infrastructure and services, reform the education and training system, safeguard the environment, and, more generally, make the country reliable, on an international level as well, so that companies can be a match for the best on the market. [Locatelli] The government promises that privatization will be one of its battleships, but you have warned, with an eye to the public utilities, that there must not be a leap out of the frying pan of the state monopoly into the fire of private monopoly. Do you mean that new rules are needed for the grid utilities? [Gnutti] That is exactly what I mean. We must learn from the most advanced experience acquired in other countries, and British experience in particular, and set out to create authorities monitoring standards of service, to espouse the price cap model for charges, to safeguard competition, and to adopt the golden share system as a means of guarding against the country's major grids being colonized. [Locatelli] What sort of privatization does the government have in mind for STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company]? [Gnutti] The cabinet has not yet discussed the matter, but I think Berlusconi will call ad hoc cabinet meetings toward the end of the month to define the privatization strategy and to decide on the most appropriate solution for each individual IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] company, for ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation], or ENEL [National Electric Power Board]. However, I can say that, without making an issue of it, wherever possible I favor the most appropriate form of the public company model. [Locatelli] As far ENEL is concerned, you have long advocated separating its power generation, transmission, and distribution functions. Can you explain your idea in greater detail? [Gnutti] It has to be realized that, in its current form, the ENEL monopoly is on the wane and that the only natural monopoly that makes any sense is one on power transmission lines. Both generation (as is already happening as a result of autonomous generation) and distribution (via municipal or private corporations) can be carried out by a variety of operators. This in no way prevents the continued existence of a strong body with the capacity to plan, modernize, and expand the national electricity grid, but it must be borne in mind that, in view of the direction in which Community policy is moving, it may not be long before that same body is obliged to rent out its lines, for a fair charge, to carry the power that the end consumer has purchased from the most competitive supplier. [Locatelli] What will the implications be for ENEL? [Gnutti] It will mean that our major electricity corporation will have to be restructured and that its business as a monopoly must be kept distinct from the business that it handles within a competitive system. It remains to be seen how the restructuring operation, provided the whole government agrees to it, can be coordinated with privatization. [Locatelli] As regards IRI, on the other hand, it all looks easier, as you consider that it is now an empty box. It would appear that you would like a receiver appointed in place of [IRI Chairman] Prodi. Am I right? [Gnutti] Nothing is further from my mind than the appointment of a receiver for IRI; what is needed is a chairman who will conclude the privatizations in the full light of day, without traumatizing the companies or the markets. Anyway, I did not invent the notion that IRI has outlived its historical purpose: It is a fact that no one can deny. [Locatelli] One last question: You maintain that the Industry Ministry must cease to be a structure at the service of the minister and become a structure at the service of the business world. How do you mean? [Gnutti] The idea is to computerize the entire ministry so as to create electronic centers throughout the country, probably on the premises of the chambers of commerce, to act as local ministry offices, and to speed up and clarify all the procedures for which the ministry is currently responsible, decentralizing the ministry's functions without depriving it of its coordinating role at national level; on the contrary, the local centers will keep it supplied with reliable, up-to-date information regarding the problems faced by the various industrial areas. As I see it, this is also what federalism is about.
