Let us begin with a glance at current incidents in the occupied territories and their link with Israel's slowness in implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord. [Darawshah] The recent incidents that claimed the lives of innocent Palestinian and Israeli people are regrettable and painful. The criminal acts carried out by the settlers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and other regrettable incidents that followed and led to the fall of martyrs from our Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza have escalated the situation. This took place against a background of tangible slowness in implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord and the Oslo accord, responsibility for which lies with the Israeli Government, particularly the prime minister. In general, we can say that these incidents carried out by Israeli or Palestinian extremists aim to undermine the peace process. Acts carried out by Jewish settlers or the Israeli army are reciprocated with retaliatory measures by Palestinian elements. What links the Israeli and Palestinian extremists is their desire to end the peace process and preclude any progress. The Palestinian elements say the Oslo accord is not enough and do not want it implemented, while the Israeli extremists consider the Oslo accord a betrayal of Jews in Israel and do not want to give up an inch of occupied Arab land. Hence, they do their utmost to undermine this accord. I believe the Israeli Government and the PLO, the Israeli and Palestinian peoples, and the entire region's nations have a mutual interest in stopping the massacres, repressive measures, hostile acts against civilians, advancing the peace process, and implementing the accord. This is the real test of Rabin's government now. [Al-Jundi] Yesterday's fedayeen operation was supposed to coincide with the completion of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on 13 April. It came in light of Israeli statements, especially by the first man in the Israeli Government--I mean Yitzhaq Rabin--that the withdrawal dates are not sacred. Does this mean a direct answer to the Israeli slowness and continuing evasion of commitments? [Darawshah] We want the Israeli Government to adhere to the accord and the Israeli Army to withdraw immediately from Gaza and Jericho and from all the occupied Arab territories. This is our principled stance. Those who commit such acts aim to destroy the entire peace process. They do not want to encourage the Israeli Government to implement the accord but want to end the peace process. We strongly condemned the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and the painful incidents against Israeli civilians in 'Afula and Hadera. These acts harm relations between the two peoples, hurt the peace process, and intensify the old enmity in the region. We must work to curb these acts and advance the peace process to achieve Arab rights. Only through a peace agreement can the Palestinian people achieve their national legitimate rights. The main solution is a peace agreement ensuring an end to the occupation and recognition of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. When we say an end to occupation, we mean the removal of Israel's occupation of all the Arab territories in the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan, south Lebanon, and the occupied Jordanian territory. Israel must know that the Palestinians are a struggling people, eager for their freedom and independence, and cannot accept the continuation of occupation. The Israeli Government must realize that as long as the occupation continues, violence and resistance will continue and innocent victims from both peoples will continue to fall. The key is in the hand of the Israeli Government. I hope this government and the Israeli public will wake up and realize that continuing occupation means continuing bloodshed on both sides. One side cannot keep everything it wants and continue the occupation without expecting resistance from the other, the Palestinians. [Al-Jundi] The Israeli Knesset, of which you are a member, can put pressure on the Israeli Government, although the ruling Labor Party enjoys a majority in the Knesset. How can the Knesset and the Israeli public pressure Yitzhaq Rabin and his government? [Darawshah] Regrettably, the recent painful incidents in both 'Afula and Hadera in the past few days in which innocent people were killed and scores were injured boosted the rightist forces on the Israeli street. The Israelis reacted negatively to these incidents. This puts great pressure on the Israeli Government concerning the peace process. Even in the Knesset, the right-wing trend has gained ground. Although the government retains the majority in the Knesset, the rightists, primarily the Likud Party, have intensified their attack against the government, accusing it of adopting a weak position toward the Palestinians and of encouraging terrorism. These acts backfire on the Palestinian people and on the peace process. I do not believe that the killing of more citizens, Arabs or Jews, will resolve the conflict in the region. The solution must be peaceful and the Israeli Government must work to withdraw immediately from Gaza and Jericho and allow the PLO to assume Palestinian sovereignty on Palestinian territory there. Agreement on the permanent solution, not only the interim one, must also be accelerated. [Al-Jundi] Thank you. [Darawshah] You are welcome.
