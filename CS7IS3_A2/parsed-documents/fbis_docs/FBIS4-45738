The bank said that soil erosion has made China's loess plateau "something like the surface of the moon," and that per capita income there is only about 35 to 50 dollars a year. The bank said the project seeks to tackle the issue of poverty and the environment at the same time and is expected to increase grain production by 50 percent and fruit production by 400 percent. "The little rainfall the people get will be kept for crops and trees, where now it just runs off," said the bank's project manager Juergen Voegele. "They will also be able to convert highly eroded areas to production, utilize river beds and move away from unproductive and unsustainable planting on sloping hillsides," he said. The total cost of the project is close to 250 million dollars.
