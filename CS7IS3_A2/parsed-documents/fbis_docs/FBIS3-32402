[Begin recording] [Coffee grower Alfonso Lopez] I see this as something wicked by the government, because it is a well-known fact that this price will never cover costs. [Coffee grower Jairo Barragan] The price the government has just set is not what we coffee growers expected. We are demanding a 30 percent increase to make this profitable. [Coffee grower Manuel Hernandez] It does not make up for the costs involved, especially when you take into account the stalk borer plague. [Coffee grower Aurelio Suarez] The truth is that this government was unable to resolve the coffee problem. [Unidentified reporter] What are you going to do now? [Coffee grower Jose Acosta] Go hungry. What use is this increase? [Coffee grower Enrique Angel Mejia] We are disenchanted and worried about the new coffee prices because to balance out production costs and income the increase should have been at least double.
