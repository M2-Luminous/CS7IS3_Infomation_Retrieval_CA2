Current Onusal Chief Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, who has headed the delegation since March 1993, stressed that he is leaving El Salvador convinced that democracy will continue moving irreversibly forward. According to the peace agreements, the only pending issue concerns the full deployment of the National Civilian Police [PNC], scheduled for 22 September, and the dissolution of the current National Police on 31 October at the latest. In addition, Ramirez said that although there were delays in the land transfer process, it has been expedited in the past few weeks, as well as the indemnification for former fighters of the Armed Forces. [Begin Ocampo recording] To bid farewell, I have only words of gratitude for the Salvadoran people who accepted me with generosity, kindness, and cooperation. I must thank President Alfredo Cristiani and his government, which I believe has reached continental status, for promoting as successful a peace process as the Salvadoran peace process. I also want to praise the cooperation of and the work done by the Political Committee, headed by Coordinator Jorge Shafik Handal, of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]. It has proven that it is deeply committed to peace. This is why I am leaving with a clear conscience and with the sense of having accomplished the duties and mission assigned. I could predict that peace has indeed irreversibly rooted in this country. The parameters that shook our America for so many decades have been successfully overcome in El Salvador. The dedication, effort, commitment, and spirit of dialogue, which prevailed not only during the 28 months of negotiations that were so complex and difficult, in search of such agreements, have followed a similar trend after the Chapultepec agreement. [end recording] Meanwhile, new Onusal Chief Ter Horst pointed out that he already held significant talks with the presidential candidates, who will participate in a virtual run-off election, and with President Cristiani. They have all promised to comply with the agreements that are still pending in El Salvador. His stay in the country will be significant not only because of his personal experience, but because of the political and diplomatic experience he will gain as Onusal chief.
