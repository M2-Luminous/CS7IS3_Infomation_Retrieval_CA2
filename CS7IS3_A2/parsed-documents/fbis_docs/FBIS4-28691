It was also the solemn echo noticing the glorious [word indistinct] of our communist children's movement. For our KCU members, who are continuing the chuche revolutionary cause generation after generation, there is no greater honor and pride than to become the party's young vanguards who are infinitely loyal to the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il. [applause] The fifth congress of the KCU sends this letter of appeal to KCU members across the country, firmly believing that all KCU members across the country will advance staunchly with one breath and one step, upholding the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song's congratulatory message and following the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il. [applause] All the members of the KCU! Today, the members of our KCU who walked a proud road by upholding the slogan "Let us always be prepared for each stage of our revolution which is filled with glory," have upheld the banner of loyalty to firmly prepare themselves for their leader [yongdoja]. This is truly an exciting event. Let us highly manifest to the whole world the resolute will and firm faith of the members of our KCU who are trying to always be prepared for the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il. Members of the KCU, let us highly uphold the slogan, "Let us always be prepared for the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il," and be true young vanguards of the Workers Party endlessly loyal to the general. The true young vanguards of the party, this is a truly glorious title that makes all of our hearts beat. Becoming a true young vanguard of the party is to become a young revolutionary resolutely advocating and safeguarding the general and fighting for the general by sacrificing his life with the firm faith to follow only the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il from the time he is young. The members of the KCU must be true young vanguards of the party so that they can become reliable youth vanguards of the party in the future and thus become a glorious member of the Workers Party and grow up to be the party's true loyalists and dutiful sons. The basic character which the members of the young vanguards of the party must possess is pure loyalty, having faith in, and following only the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il. The great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song has taught: The members of the KCU must have a high pride of the fact that our party is the best and that the bosom of our party is the best, and always have faith in and follow our party, and study and live as taught by the party. From the time when they were young, the members of the KCU must know only of their leader and their party, and must loyally follow only the party and the leader. On the road of loyally following the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il by highly upholding the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song lies the true life of the members of the KCU and a magnificent future. All the members of the KCU, let us become loyal and dutiful sons of having faith in and following only the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il. The respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il is the fate of our people and the members of the KCU. There can be no delight, laughter, and happiness of the members of our KCU apart from the general's bosom. The minds of the members of the KCU who have faith in and who are following the respected and beloved general must be spotlessly clean. When the members of our KCU were born, the first thing they saw was the benevolent pictures of the great generalissimo and the respected and beloved general, and the first words they learned was, "Thank you Generalissimo Kim Il-song and thank you Mr. Kim Chong- il." With the pure mind of that time, let us all become sunflowers of loyalty having faith in and following the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il. Just like the pine tree that does not lose its appearance even if it is buried in snow, let us foster the members of the KCU to have high loyalty who are able to plow through thousand-ri of sea of fire and jumping over myriads of mountains if it is for an eternally unchangeable loyalty and for the great general. Members of the KCU, let us all the more vigorously carry out the movement of learning the glorious youth era of the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il to regard the generalissimo's and the general's lofty example as a basis and put it into practice every step of the way. [applause] Let us all take active part in the loyal exploration march toward Chongil peak, the march to find the old home of the Mt. Paektu secret camp, and the exploration march of Mt. Changja to deeply bear in their minds the high intention of the respected and beloved general who fostered the far-reaching plan to elucidate Korea. All the members of the KCU, let us firmly prepare ourselves to become reliable successors of the chuche revolutionary cause who possesses our party's revolutionary ideology and socialist and communist ideology. The members of the KCU who are the next shift of the revolution are young revolutionaries. The members of the KCU must be firmly armed with our party's revolutionary ideology and socialist and communist ideology from the time when they are young so that they can become a chuche-oriented revolutionary and a true young vanguard of the party. Members of the KCU: Let us firmly arm ourselves with our party's revolutionary ideology and the chuche idea. The chuche idea is a political nutrient for the members of the KCU and a compass indicating the road ahead of the revolution. Let us all deeply study the works of the great leader and the respected and beloved general, the [word indistinct] of the chuche idea, to make the deep meaning filled in the works become our bones and flesh, and let us always think and act only according to the demand of the chuche idea anytime and anywhere. The members of KCU must firmly succeed the existence of our revolution so that it will be possible to complete to the end the chuche revolutionary cause. The blood relationship linking the revolution generation after generation is our party's revolutionary tradition. Members of the KCU; let us firmly arm ourselves with our party's brilliant revolutionary tradition. Let us substantially carry out various traditional revolutionary studies such as the (?ideological) study of the participants of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and study of slogans to brilliantly succeed the revolutionary spirit of the anti-Japanese revolutionary patriotic forefathers who plowed through the march road toward Mt. Paektu by highly upholding the great leader. Let us all the more thoroughly embody the slogan, "Let us carry out study and live in accordance with the anti-Japanese KCU." The revolution which continues generation after generation is advanced through struggle opposing all kinds of class enemies. The dark intention of the class enemies does not change. Members of the KCU, let us correctly know the aggressive and exploitative true nature of the class enemies including the U.S. imperialists, the inveterate enemy, which brought about innumerable unhappiness and sufferings to our people. Let us always become a young revolutionary fighter endlessly hating the class enemies and fight resolutely opposing the rascals. The more happy we are let us all the more never forget even for a minute our people past days who were exploited and oppressed. Let us always be firmly prepared in our hearts to maintain happiness through struggle by singing the songs of happiness. All the members of the KCU, let us become true young patriots devoting their bodies and minds to elucidate the chuche socialist fatherland. Our socialist fatherland is the nest of the life and happiness of the members of the KCU. There can be no happiness today and a magnificent hope for the future of the members of the KCU, apart from the bosom of the socialist fatherland. The bosom of the socialist fatherland is the bosom of the great general [widaehan changjunnim]. [applause] Members of the KCU, let us treasure the socialist fatherland more so than one's life with the one mind of loyalty of upholding the great general and live enthusiastically. Having a love for the country is fostered when we treasure even a single blade of grass and tree of the fatherland, and when loving the mountains and streams of their hometown, parents, and their teacher. Let us all firmly foster patriotism to become true young patriots and young heroes unhesitatingly devoting their lives if it is for the party, the fatherland, and the people. All the members of the KCU, our fatherland endlessly prospering under the wise leadership of the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il is waiting for a brilliant future. The future is ours. Being possessed with knowledge, virtue, and a healthy body is an important struggle goal of the members of the KCU and a sacred task to bring about a brilliant future ahead of schedule. Let us all the more widely unfold the wings of knowledge, virtue, and a healthy body for the respected and beloved general and for the fatherland. Studying well is the first duty of the members of the KCU. The members of the KCU must first and second study well. Let us all highly uphold the slogan, "Let us learn for Korea," and learn the glorious youth days of the respected and beloved general to demonstrate the pride of being a top honor student. The respected and beloved general regarded the top honor students as a jewel and pride, and loved them most and put them in the forefront. Let us give happiness to the father and general by obtaining excellent grades. Let us become energetic and devoted scholars concentrating on studying during the days of the KCU so that they will be able to become doctors, associate doctors, and famous inventors world wide in the twenties and thirties. The members of the KCU must read many books during the KCU era which is filled with dreams. A book is a teacher without words and a traveling companion of learning. Let us vigorously carry out the reading trip toward Mt. Changja study site to read more books and actively take part in the school excursions, (?the blazing ideological activities), and the (?2 June) camping to all the more consolidate extensively and deeply the knowledge that we have learned. Like the new generation living in a civilized era, let us become members of the KCU who are developed in various fields such as reading poems, singing songs, writing, doing magic, and playing over one instrument. Let us fully develop our makings and talents in the bosom of the party which grows the valuable buds of the budding flowers rapidly and become little doctors, little writers, and little artists. Let us the KCU members have the beautiful communist morality and traits. The beautiful communist morality and traits of the KCU members are the bright face of our fatherland. We should foster the traits well in our KCU days so that we may become righteous people who are faithful, good-mannered, and add luster to man's dignity. The 10-point principles for the school children to observe in their moral lives set forth by the respected and beloved father General Kim Chong-il is the good textbook of morality education which the KCU members should always observe as they look in the mirror. The members of the KCU: Let us abide by these 10-point principles thoroughly and have the true traits with which we think of the interests of the group first, love our comrades, and devote all we have to the interests of the group. The strong physical health of the KCU members is the treasure of the country. The KCU members should maintain strong physical health so that the homes and society may be happy and gay with laughter and smiles and filled with romantic optimism. The KCU members should conduct various types of athletic activities briskly to temper their bodies and foster strong fighting spirit, bravery, and boldness. They should actively participate in various sports activities to acquire at least one sport skill and to actively contribute to the development of the country's development of sport skills. Loving to carry out the revolution and to work is the proud ethos of the KCU members. It is truly a proud thing for them to become the propagators of the party policy, helpers in the implementation of the party policy, little builders of the country, and little housekeepers of the country as KCU members. Let us the KCU members continue to conduct the sociopolitical activities vigorously and in high spirits with the sound of the drums and bugles of the KCU, in order to keep the streets, towns, and work places brisk and to give the people joy and rapture. Let us further develop our school-our guardpost campaign and prepare ourselves firmly in our mind to become the honorable sentries for the defense of the fatherland following the example of the brothers and sisters of the People's Army. Let us do more good deeds voluntarily for the country, the people, and the Army of the respected and beloved general. The KCU members: Let us participate ourselves in the core of the KCU's organizational life and prepare ourselves firmly to be the true juvenile honor guard unit and dependable inheritors of the chuche revolutionary cause. The KCU's organizational life is the school for revolutionary indoctrination for the KCU members. In order for the KCU members to become good members of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK] and to become members of the glorious WPK in the future, they should all carry on the KCU's organizational life well. KCU members: Let us treasure and love the KCU organization, entrust everything to the KCU organization, sincerely participate in the KCU life, learn the KCU rules and regulations, and live according to these rules and regulations at any time and place. Through the life of the KCU, let us develop ourselves vigorously to become the party's true housekeepers with organization- mindedness, discipline-mindedness, diligence, and simple mind, and faithfully abide by the pledge made before the KCU flag. [crowd chants indistinct slogans] In order to strengthen the KCU organization, we should make the branch unions, the basic organizational units of the KCU, function with vitality. All the branch unions should carry out their roles well so that the school children's unions are strengthened and the KCU is strengthened. The KCU activists, including the chairmen of the branch unions: Let us uphold the slogan of strengthening the branch unions and make all the branch unions strong branch unions. Let us become the example of the KCU members in all areas--study, organizational life, and so on--and lead the branch unions vigorously. The revolution's enemies, including the U.S. imperialists, are frenziedly maneuvering today to harm our-style socialism and to deprive our KCU members of their happiness. However, we have nothing to fear and we are brave because we uphold the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il, the ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, as the supreme commander. The three million members of the KCU: Let us all become three million bombs and six million hand grenades that defend the respected and beloved general at the cost of our lives and defend our beloved socialist fatherland, following the example of our brothers and sisters of the LSWYK who are preparing themselves to be five million bombs to cope with the situation created. [applause] All KCU members, let us all firmly renew our resolve, determination, and faith with awareness of the sacred mission for the times and the revolution as we embark on a new step forward with the Fifth Conference of the KCU as a turning point. As long as we have the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il and as long as we have the world's best socialist system, the future of us the KCU members will always be filled with joy and happiness. [applause] Let us all advance forward vigorously, following the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il, to expedite the chuche revolutionary cause initiated by the great leader. [applause] Long live the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song! Long live the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il! The Fifth Conference of the KCU, 7 June 1994. [applause]
