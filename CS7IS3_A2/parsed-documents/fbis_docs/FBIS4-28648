[Begin Hata recording] In terms of rear support, we will be able to offer medical services or other forms of assistance after hostilities have ended -- such as, for instance, the minesweeping operations we did after the Gulf War. However, operations which are an integral part of military action or the use of force will be very difficult. [end recording] Prime Minister Hata's remarks indicated that under the constitution, it would be difficult for Japan to participate even in nonmilitary operations which are an integral part of military action. Commenting further on intragovernmental deliberations on responding to a United Nations decision to impose sanctions, Hata said that while Japan was still persuading DPRK to seek a solution through dialogue, it might give the wrong message to North Korea to make public the detailed substance of such deliberations.
