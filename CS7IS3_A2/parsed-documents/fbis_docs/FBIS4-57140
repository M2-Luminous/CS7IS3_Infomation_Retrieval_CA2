The crisis in the barracks, the fears of the military high command, and the prospects looking toward the 1995 elections are the subjects covered here by the constitutionalist military officer. This interview was also broadcast over Radio "Miraflores" during the well-known political program, "Doble Sentido" [Double Meaning]. [LA REPUBLICA] General Salinas, the Army Information Office (OIE) has published a statement in which it is stated that "freedom of information is being improperly used" and that there is a campaign orchestrated by the media to make the Army look like a "violator of human rights linked to the narcotics traffic and an institution with internal problems." What do you think of this? [Salinas] In the Army there is a policy on the dissemination of information. More than anything else, it is the responsibility of the command to keep officers informed about military developments. However, in the information bulletin to which you refer there is a marked, political orientation. Unfortunately, its contents are going to contribute to greater divisions between civilians and military personnel because there is a great deal of misinformation in it. It is being said that the press is attacking the Army as an institution. As far as I know, and I follow the news very closely, none of the communications media has attacked the Army. The media have denounced some bad elements within the Army, which is something very different. This document to which you refer not only mentions the Peruvian media but speaks of a national and international campaign against the Army. The truth is that I do not understand this. In my view this is an error. And the principal person responsible in a vertically organized institution like ours is the commanding general of the Army. This document offers nothing good to civilians and military personnel, nor does it contribute to the democratic stability which we all desire so much. [LA REPUBLICA] Would you say that the high command of the Army feels threatened by news reports? [Salinas] The prestige of the armed forces has never been as low as it is now. In our view the person responsible for this situation is the commanding general of the Army, not because he has been involved in this or that matter but simply because he holds that position. He should resign, but what is happening? Instead of resigning, he is hiding behind the Army as an institution. He uses it to save his skin. He misinforms the officers, making them think that any attack against him as a person is an attack against the Army. Anyone who has any sense knows that that is not true. [LA REPUBLICA] Nevertheless, the president and General Hermoza himself state that the Army as an institution supports the commanding general. [Salinas] That is the version which they wish to sell to the Peruvian people. At present General Hermoza has no support within the Army. Military personnel obey him because hierarchically and in accordance with the Fujimori law he is the commanding general. We have heard, from meetings which General Hermoza has held and from the views expressed by officers on active duty that they are very critical of what General Hermoza has said. I am talking about officers on active duty. That means that the story about support for General Hermoza is a falsehood. He maintains his position at the top of the Army because he holds power, and that provides support for President Fujimori. Look, I am not the only one saying this. Within the Army there is a kind of Gestapo. Any officer who opens his mouth and who expresses an opinion is automatically marked down by that Gestapo. On the other hand, the man who informs on him is going to get a promotion or will be assigned abroad. There is a great deal of fear of speaking one's opinion freely. [LA REPUBLICA] Then is it impossible to have a change of commanding general? [Salinas] In the Army, speaking of it as an institution, there is no way in which the commanding general can be removed from office. There would have to be a complaint that he had committed a certain crime, and then the matter could be brought to the attention of the military justice system. As things are now the commanding general comes directly under the authority of the president. He holds a political position. Therefore, any kind of criticism within the Army is regarded as a political attitude and looks as if the intention is to stage a coup d'etat. For that reason General Hermoza is filled with hatred against us and is determined to make sure that we do not get out of prison. [LA REPUBLICA] Then President Fujimori is not on your side? [Salinas] I do not think so, because, however much he may be a nontraditional politician, as they say, or that he does not have much experience, he must understand that this is a political problem which is doing a great deal of damage to the image of the country. I am sure that on many occasions he would have liked to resolve this matter, but the anger comes from General Hermoza. He is afraid that if we are out of prison, we could cut the ground out from under him. This is not our intention, but everyone has his own kind of fear. What I can assure you of is that, within the armed forces, most of the officers are in total disagreement with this political manipulation of the Army as an institution, which is doing so much harm to it. [LA REPUBLICA] Among the things which are doing the most harm to the armed forces are the well-founded accusations that, basically, it is providing support for the narcotics traffic. What is going to happen about this? [Salinas] The worst mistake which the armed forces made was to become involved in the struggle against the narcotics traffic, because this would corrupt anyone. The power of money is very great and especially so since our officers are very poorly paid. However, in any case the guilty parties must be severely punished. [LA REPUBLICA] Are those punishments being handed out? General Hermoza has stated that no Army officer is involved in the "Vatican" case. Do you think that this is plausible? [Salinas] The information which Major Castillo has provided has been corroborated by officers on active duty who have made this known to us. Regarding General Hermoza's statement they have commented that, "Nobody believes him because all of us know that there certainly were officers involved in the narcotics traffic at the time when the `Vatican' was in the area." They must be punished for the good of the Army as an institution. [LA REPUBLICA] And why are they being provided with cover, general? Who is protecting them? [Salinas] I would not say that they are protected. This has come out at a time when the image of the Army as an institution has seriously deteriorated, and they are trying to make sure that this image does not get worse. In my view that is an error because if cases like that have occurred, it would be better to resolve the problem--once and for all. That is, cutting off a gangrenous leg so that the whole body is not affected. They are trying to hide things, and that makes people have doubts about the Army as an institution. [LA REPUBLICA] Would you say that the Army has become a political party? [Salinas] I would not say that. Yes, there is a high ranking, politicized group which is politically manipulating promotions. But the ordinary officer himself is not politicized. He wants to be a worthy professional soldier in the service of the fatherland. [LA REPUBLICA] Are you afraid that in the next elections the armed forces will participate actively in the election process? [Salinas] The armed forces have been improperly used in the CCD [Congressional] elections. I think that an attempt to do this will be repeated. However, on the basis of the information which I receive from officers in the Army they are going to oppose that attitude. They are not going to become involved in distributing leaflets and photographs or collecting signatures, as they were required to do in the previous election. The officers as a group are rejecting such an improper use of them. As far as I know, they want the Peruvian people to understand that the armed forces, and the Army in particular, is going to behave in a clean, open, and impartial way. Now, it is probable that the orders have been issued, because General Hermoza is going to want to place the armed forces, and the Army in particular, at the service of President Fujimori. [LA REPUBLICA] If Fujimori does not win the next elections, could this put the armed forces in a difficult situation? [Salinas] The armed forces owe their loyalty to the government elected democratically by the people and not to President Fujimori. Undoubtedly, within the armed forces, there are people who, because they have committed themselves politically, have gone beyond the limits of their duties. The next government will see what punishments apply to them. [LA REPUBLICA] Do you think that this will create a tense situation? [Salinas] Certainly, that faction in the Army will try to do what it can. Fujimori cannot be blamed. However, those who know that he is at fault are going to join together. Nevertheless, I think that the Army as an institution is not going to allow these manipulations to continue merely to save the skins of two or three people who have only done harm to the Army. However much that faction may wish to keep itself in power at all cost, come what may, the officers are not going to support them. [LA REPUBLICA] Although the candidacy of Javier Perez de Cuellar has not yet been decided, the political parties are not much prepared to join in getting behind him. How do you see the prospects for this? [Salinas] For me it is a matter of concern that the election problem has not been resolved and that Congress is postponing debate until April [1994]. This is just a delaying action. I do not understand how there can be people who believe that all of that is simply the result of some kind of real, democratic game. In fact, it is a carefully planned game to ensure that the opposition has the least possible time to prepare itself for the elections of 1995. [LA REPUBLICA] Do you think that the opposition is poorly prepared because of its lack of decision and not because of the problem of the elections law? [Salinas] There is a need for the leaders of the opposition to get together and reach agreement. My concern, and I believe that it is also yours, is that they are letting a lot of time to go by before they define their positions. There can be a single candidate or three or four opposition candidates. There can be a thousand solutions to this problem. What is needed is for the political leaders to sit down right now and adopt a strategy. [LA REPUBLICA] Is it a matter of no concern as to whether there is one or several candidates? [Salinas] Look, I have not been a politician but a military officer. I am involved in politics because I am in prison. However, I think that if the opposition disperses its forces, it will be more difficult to face up to Fujimori, because he is going to use all of the resources of the state to be reelected. If wasps attack me one a minute, I will continue to kill them with a fly swatter. But if a thousand wasps attack me at the same time, I am dead. In the Army that is called the principle of mass. You have to use mass in the right place and at the right time. It seems to me that a single opposition candidate would be better, but a single program would be worth more than that. You have to reach agreement on a minimum program which must be respected by all political groups. And once everyone believes that it makes no difference who is the candidate, because that program is going to be followed, only then should we decide on a specific candidate. [LA REPUBLICA] Could you be that candidate, General Salinas, as Javier Valle Riestra has stated? [Salinas] I am a prisoner in jail. I can only show my face behind the bars of my cell. No, that is out of the question. The person who should accept that challenge is someone who is free to move around, who can reach the people and explain to them what real, democratic choices they have in confronting the dictatorship. As far as I am concerned, a political decision has been made that I will not get out of here until after the elections. I have no ambition, nor do I wish to be a candidate. But even if I wanted it, I would simply be prevented from being a candidate. [LA REPUBLICA] Are the civic movements which are appearing in the provinces and here in Lima the nucleus of the future political party which you could lead within an opposition coalition? [Salinas] They have not been organized with that in mind. They are very far from politics. They have been organized to demand freedom for us officers who are unjustly in prison. They will close down as we are given our freedom. The solution for the eight officers who are with me could be facilitated with this type of pressure. This would not apply to me, personally. [LA REPUBLICA] Why do you say that? [Salinas] There is a particular kind of anger against me. The signatures which are being collected, calling for my release, are from all sectors and political parties. [LA REPUBLICA] Finally, General Cisneros has stated that coups d'etat are not out of the question and that another Sergeant Huapaya could emerge. What do you think? [Salinas] Our history is marked by a series of coups d'etat and democratic springtimes of very short duration. However, increasingly the armed forces throughout the world know that they are in the service of their country and not of a government. I would say that a coup d'etat is out of the question.
