The reason may be found from the following report. At 1800 on 20 May, the State Council General Office and the State Council Leading Group in Charge of Public Order called a telephone conference of leading party and government cadres in charge of public security, state security, and the armed police in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to report on social and political developments and public order throughout the country since the beginning of May. Organized "Subversive Activities" Have Arisen in 17 Provinces and 33 Cities As revealed at the conference, organized hostile underground activities of incitation which established ties to subvert the social system and the people's government arose in 33 cities and seven prefectures and districts in 17 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities throughout the country and, in particular, the situations were more serious in 12 cities and three districts in seven provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, comprising Sichuan Province, Shaanxi Province, Shanxi Province, Hubei Province, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Liaoning Province, Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Xian, Taiyuan, Urumqi, Wuhan, Yining, Yanan, Shenyang, Anshan, Dalian, Yichang, and three districts of the Beijing Municipality. Also disclosed at the conference were many instances of snipers firing shots at soldiers and policemen on the outskirts of Wuhan, Xian, Chengdu, and Beijing. On the three days of 3, 8, and 12 May, nine such incidents occurred, causing 11 casualties and five explosions. Party Members and Three Types of Persons in the Cultural Revolution in "Extremist Organizations" It was also reported that a handful of foreign-invested organizations in the mainland had taken part in or were used for hostile and illegal activities, including transmitting by facsimile instigating and offensive propaganda material to party and government departments and making anonymous phone calls to carry out activities of interference and sabotage. In a few areas, flaunting the banner of defending Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and taking advantage of problems existing and arising in the current process of construction and reform, underground organizations instigated cadres and the masses to slow down their work and go on strike and organized activities to overturn existing policies. They made open appeals to party members to step forward bravely to "rescue our party" and of "down with the old-line capitalist-advocate Deng Xiaoping." Party members and three types of persons in the Cultural Revolution were in these "extremist organizations. The conference urged party committees and departments concerned at all levels to stand fast at their posts, remain vigilant, face up to grimmer struggles which may arise, and smash and crack down on, without showing any mercy, organized sabotage and activities carried out by hostile forces. Petitions and Protests by Workers and Staff in 19 Cities On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the democratic movement in 1989, the whole country is on the highest alert and the CPC keeps on arresting dissidents. But in the latter half of last April, workers and staff from mines, enterprises, and units in 19 cities "illegally" assembled and lodged petitions and protests, and marches in which over 1,000 people took part broke out in eight cities. The 19 cities were: Shijiazhuang, Harbin, Qiqihar, Anshan, Xining, Baoji, Chongqing, Chengdu, Hefei, Taiyuan, Shenyang, Lanzhou, Xian, Urumqi, Changsha, Harmi, Zhangjiang, Guiyang, and Nanchang. The eight cities in which marches broke out were: Harbin, Anshan, Baoji, Urumqi, Nanchang, Xining, Chongqing, and Lanzhou. Over 5,000 Workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Works March in the Street In the latter half of last April, over 5,000 workers and staff in the iron and steel capital Anshan (most were workers and staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Works) took 120 cars to march around the urban district and shouted such slogans as "workers as the masters of the state," "protecting workers' class interests," "down with the newborn bourgeoisie," "yes to socialism, no to capitalism," and "long live the working class." The march went on for more than three hours. Baoji City Government Is Forced To Accept Workers and Staff's Demands In Baoji City, Shaanxi Province, over 2,000 railway, engineering, and metallurgical workers and staff assembled and held a demonstration in front of the city federation of trade unions building to oppose cutting down staff and abolishing medical benefits and ask for the granting of education allowances to children of workers and staff. Finally, the city government was forced to agree that staff would not be reduced this year and that all benefits would be kept unchanged. The marchers shouted "long live workers' unity" and sang the song "Unity Is Strength," and they even bought drinks from shops to celebrate. Over 2,000 People Marched in Urumqi Over 1,000 and over 2,000 people assembled and marched in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, on 26 and 28 April respectively. Marchers assembled at the People's Park, Nanmen Stadium, and the railway station and then went to the People's Square. The autonomous regional party committee and the regional government organized nearly 2,000 cadres to "dissuade" the marchers from going while stressing that "everything can be discussed and solved." However, more than 800 people still gathered at the People's Square to urge the government to protect the working class's interests, curb inflation, and crack down on corrupt bureaucrats. Some of the marchers even shouted the separatist slogan of "long live Xinjiangstan." A Marching Group of Workers Is Intercepted by Public Security Personnel and Armed Policemen in Lanzhou City In Lanzhou City, capital of Gansu Province, over 2,000 workers and staff from petroleum and chemical plants and woolen mills assembled at the Baitashan Park, and then proceeded to the provincial government building by car or on foot. Public security personnel, armed policemen, unit cadres, and militiamen were dispatched by the authorities to intercept the marchers on the way. Enterprise Cadres in Xining Support Workers' Demonstrations In Xining City, capital of Qinghai Province, more than 1,000 woolen workers and staff went on strike and marched on the street. They marched down Dongguan Avenue, Xiguan Avenue, and Xinning Road and then assembled in the People's Park. The wool-spinning industry is always the key industry of Xining City and there are nearly 20 woolen mills with a large scale of production. The cost of raw materials has kept on increasing year after year. It increased by 230 percent from 1985 to 1992 and by another 40 percent in 1993, but the selling price only increased by 180 percent. In 1994, the higher authorities decided to raise the price of woolen material by 62 percent. Therefore, 12 major workers' demonstrations have broken out since the beginning of this year, and some were supported by party and government cadres in the enterprises. The Authorities Dared Not Rashly Put Down Workers' Demonstrations Faced with the turbulent wave of workers' demonstrations which had spread to 19 cities in the Northeast, the North, the Northwest, the Central South, and the East, the CPC formulated and issued the "Decision on Using Weapons While on Patrol and Performing Duties" and even promulgated a nationwide alert order, yet they dared not rashly use force and there was no bloodshed. It seems that the CPC authorities understood that it was unwise to resort to high-handed means, so they could only beg the "official trade unions" for help. The CPC Strengthens the Work of the "Official Trade Unions" On 6 May, Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee's Political Bureau and the CPC Central Committee's Secretariat and president of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, issued a warning at the national work meeting attended by chairmen of trade union federations in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities throughout the country: We must strengthen our party's leadership over trade unions; give play to the vanguard role of trade union federations at all levels through organization, propaganda, and concrete work; and train trade union cadres from among party members and workers and staff who have a firm political stand, a mass foundation, and considerable prestige and working ability. This is the central task of the present organizational work. We must train new blood for our party and build up a key force, a contingent of veteran and advanced producers, and a contingent of grass-roots cadres and militiamen. Wei Jianxing said: We must adopt organizational measures to reverse the slackened situation existing in trade unions at all levels. Some trade unions have become rear-service and welfare departments; some have become the mouthpiece for making unreasonable demands on our party and our government; and a handful of them are under the control of evildoers and have played a part in instigating workers and staff to make trouble, go on strike, lodge petitions, or even establish illegal organizations and make illegal appointments to make rival claims as equals of our party and our government. Chairmanship of First-Grade Trade Unions Must Be Assumed by Members of Party Committee Standing Committees at the Same Levels On the night of 6 May, Jiang Zemin said while meeting with leading trade union cadres from all provinces: As far as socialist construction and deepening of reform is concerned, the working class is always the principal force. To score a victory in the cause of socialist construction and revolution, we must rely on the working class and give play to the leading role of the working class. On 9 May, the CPC Central Committee Secretariat issued a circular on "Strengthening the Leadership of Trade Unions at All Levels" to party committees at the provincial level. The circular stipulated that the chairmanship of first-grade trade unions at the provincial, prefectural, and city levels must be assumed by members of party committee standing committees or deputy secretaries of party committees at the same levels; that the chairmanship of trade unions of various large mines, enterprises, and units must be concurrently assumed by members of party committee standing committees or deputy secretaries of party committees; that vice chairmen of trade unions can attend meetings of party committee standing committees; and that party committee standing committees must place the trade union work at the top of the agenda. The matter is very clear. The CPC wants to work through its "official trade unions" to control the contingent of workers and staff and suppress the workers' movement and the democratic movement. But the question is: As the CPC--the "vanguard of the working class"--has lost its credibility, what capabilities do its official organs still have?
