Your highness expressed the view when you graciously granted me an audience on 17 December that the current situation required all the national forces, including your highness and myself, to meet frequently to discuss and exchange views with one another under different forms so that together we could solve the serious problem facing our Cambodian nation and community. Agreeing with this excellent concept, I and the entire PDK were very pleased when your highness graciously accepted that a technical group should be set up in response to my request in order to make it possible for frequent but comprehensive talks to be held on all issues without any preconditions. In addition, your highness graciously stated that the five-point political guideline put forth by his majesty the king constitutes the basis for the consultations of this technical group. I am confident that all of our nation and blood brothers in the countryside and the cities, at home and abroad, will joyously welcome this excellent development, because it is a step toward national reconciliation, national unity, and the rallying of all national forces in line with the enlightened initiative of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, the august, lofty leader of our nation. I believe that, in order to make the consultations between your highness and myself more advanced and fruitful, we should adhere to the above basis and go into greater detail and depth in accordance with the prevailing situation of our country and the sacred aspiration of our nation and people. I also beg your permission to use this opportunity to inform your highness once again that the PDK welcomes and fully supports without any preconditions his majesty's five-point political guideline graciously put forth by the king in his capacity as a Cambodian citizen in an essay on 21 November 1993. In these five-point proposals his majesty the king demands that the factions give concessions to each other and hold discussions, consultations, and working meetings on that basis. The PDK has always been prepared to honor this excellent royal instruction, and will do everything in its power to completely accomplish the king's political guideline as soon as possible. We have this stance because we firmly believe that this royal political guideline will surely bring about national reconciliation, national unity, and the rallying of all national forces -- with none rejected. Besides, we hold that the political guideline that his majesty the king has provided for all Cambodian leaders and for our nation and people stems from his profound meditation and reflection on how to cope with the prevailing situation, which requires that all national forces take part in all fields and sectors of state affairs, jointly helping to redress the worsening situation and responding to the desire of our entire nation and people. As I have already informed your highness, if supported by all national forces, this five-point political guideline of our king will become the second royal crusade, opening up for his majesty the king another opportunity to fulfill a noble mission for our Cambodian nation and people and giving the latter total independence and sovereignty in their territorial integrity -- the sacred goal of our nation and people. Based on all the above reasons, it is my opinion that we should make arrangements so that the technical group, set up in the spirit of the consensus reached between your highness and myself on 17 December 1993, can gradually begin to function and provide discussions and consultations on the basis of his majesty our august king's five-point political guideline with a view to implementing it on every point. So long as we have a chance to discuss and hold working meetings on such a specific and correct basis, and with the august instructions graciously given by his majesty as a beacon to help light up and steer our way, we will surely succeed in progessively solving the problems until we have fully carried out his majesty our venerated king's political guideline. Then, there will be national reconciliation, national unity, the rallying of all national forces, and peace as a positive response to the profound and sacred aspiration of our entire nation and people. I therefore ask permission to inform your highness of all the above. I have nothing against your highness at all. On the contrary, I myself and the PDK as a whole, who once worked along side your highness Prince Krompreah and the FUNCINPEC party in jointly fighting our national enemies, continue to support FUNCINPEC and seek by all means to offer your highness Prince Krompreah the full right to be the prime minister of a genuinely national royal government in accordance with the wish of our nation and people. It is my belief that if we proceed in accordance with this guideline, there will be no more problems. As for the problem of who is attacking whom, I believe that this problem can also be solved when the five-point political guideline of his majesty our august king is fulfilled through actual implementation, because then the armed forces of all national forces will be integrated into a single Khmer Royal Armed Forces, with the king as the supreme commander. Concerning this problem, I already informed your highness in person of what really happened during our meeting on 17 December 1993. Moreover, I ask permission to sincerely inform your highness that, during the past few months as well as at the present, there has been a lot of political propaganda and military activity aimed at destroying the forces of Democratic Kampuchea. In the provinces of Preah Vihear, Kompong Thom, Siem Reap, and Oddar Meanchey the forces of the former National Army of Independent Cambodia [the Sihanoukist ANKI forces] have been drawn up to join other armed forces in launching large-scale offensives in attempts to attack and destroy the forces of Democratic Kampuchea, such as those at Stoung and Phnum Chhat in August and at Anlung Veng at the beginning of last October. Since late-December another large-scale offensive to attack the forces of Democratic Kampuchea has also been launched. I ask your permission to raise this issue in order to show your highness Prince Krompreah that the situation is very complex and its solution requires joint efforts, just as his majesty our august king has most wisely pointed out. I take this opportunity to assure your highness that the PDK and the national army of Democratic Kampuchea support your highness and the FUNCINPEC party as a whole, including both its military and political apparatuses. This support stems both from our tradition of joint struggle and, more importantly, from our understanding that in order for our Cambodian nation and race to survive all national forces must rally around the throne and the king with the FUNCINPEC party, which advocates national reconciliation playing the main role as in the times of Sangkum Reas Niyum under the leadership of his majesty the king. I understand that this is also the wish and desire of our entire nation and people. It was for this reason that our blood brothers gave their votes of confidence to your highness Prince Krompreah and the FUNCINPEC party. And it was for the same reason that the PDK supported the election results and has demanded that arrangements be taken to fully comply with these election results; and the PDK continues to strictly maintain this position. Humbly yours, [Dated] 28 December 1993 [Signed] Khieu Samphan, president of the PDK
