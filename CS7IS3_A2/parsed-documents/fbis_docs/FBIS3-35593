The timetable includes full information about when one or another unit leaves Estonia and the number of men in it. "We hope that this step of Russia's to meet Estonia's wishes inspires also the Estonian delegation to take constructive steps to meet us halfway," Svirin said. As reported earlier, a general schedule for troop withdrawal was presented to Estonia during the last round of talks late in 1993. Svirin said that Estonia has recently been hinting at its wish to replace a comprehensive agreement on the troop withdrawal and the conditions for their temporary stay in Estonia with a short protocol containing only the date for the completion of the pullout with the timetable as an appendix to it. He emphasized that Russia has clearly stated it considers this approach absolutely unacceptable. Svirin explained that it would leave unresolved a wide range of problems concerning the pullout and the stay in Estonia of the troops, and the fate of the army's immovable property, which would only lead to deterioration of bilateral relations. Commenting on Vaino Reinart's appointment as the head of the Estonian delegation for talks with Russia, Svirin said the Russian side accepted it favorably, with full understanding and readiness to continue constructive cooperation. As to Russia's "ostensible concern" about Russians living in Estonia, Svirin said "we've heard it before." He referred to Reinart's Jan. 20 statement at a Council of Europe deputy ministers' meeting in Strasbourg when Reinart charged that Russia's accusations of human rights violations in the Baltic states stem, not from genuine concern about human rights, but from Russia's domestic political situation. "We regard such statements as carefully thought out speculations of some Estonian politicians," Svirin said.
