The elections were deemed valid in 17 out of 23 districts. That is, six deputies' seats will be empty for at least two months. But it is entirely possible they will be empty until the fall. The Duma deputies will now schedule the date of repeat elections. No municipal organs of power were elected in the cities of Rostov and Rybinsk. The elections of the municipal committee in the oblast center were also almost disrupted: Here only 15 deputies' seats acquired incumbents and in seven districts the voters essentially refused to use their legal "right to vote." The voters' level of activeness has been very low. Only 33 percent of people with the right to vote came to the polling stations. In two districts of Rybinsk and four of Yaroslavl, the number of those who went to the polls was lower than the control level of 25 percent. In all 14 districts were formed on the territory of these large industrial centers. And in eight of them where elections were nonetheless valid a critical level of tension persisted until nearly the very last hour of work of the polling stations. Here the control level of voting activity was just exceeded. The situation was saved by the inhabitants of the rural rayons. And not only because they are traditionally more responsive to appeals to take part in such campaigns. The inhabitants of villages and small towns were better informed about their candidates. I personally, compelled by my job to read the entire local press from cover to cover and to listen to the local radio and watch oblast and city television programs, managed to learn the names of the contenders for a seat on the municipality only at the polling station, from the ballot slip itself. It may be supposed that a substantial proportion of voters who wanted to vote did not want "improvisations" in front of the ballot box and preferred to stay home on Sunday. Others, although they did come, were unable to make a choice and marked the box "against all deputies." Probably the Yaroslavl people's activity was influenced to some extent also by "political fatigue" and the general political situation in Russia recently. A serious analysis by specialists is needed here. Especially as the election situation in neighboring oblasts -- Ivanovo and Kostroma Oblasts, where the voting is scheduled for the second half of March -- is similar to the situation observed in Yaroslavl Oblast. There is the same growing decline in voters' interest in the elections, the same lack of information about the candidates. And -- particularly important -- the same old idea of the new organs of power. At any rate, the majority of Yaroslavl people have obviously elected another soviet but not a legislative chamber of a fully empowered component of the Russian Federation. During a poll over 70 percent of respondents, for instance, unequivocally expressed themselves in favor of the idea that the new oblast Duma should work on the basis of voters' instructions. At a press conference devoted to the results of the elections, Yaroslavl Oblast Governor Anatoliy Lisitsin frankly stated that their results could have been utterly different had it not been for the constant attacks of Vladimir Varukhin, the president's representative in the oblast, who sought to disrupt the elections. "During meetings with inhabitants I was often asked: Why go to the elections if the president's representative states that the elections will be repealed, that they will be moved to the fall. That of course affected people's mood and introduced confusion.... The voters' activeness could have been far higher had it not been for the negative role of the president's representative." It is sad, but each disputing side has some truth. This became possible in the absence of precise, clear legislation on elections to the oblast legislative organs of power and self-management. The statute on elections in the oblast was reworked three times. For instance, the governor initially confirmed this statute io the basis of the "Penza option" guaranteeing representation in the Duma for each administrative formation irrespective of the number of inhabitants. Defending it, he appealed to the Constitution, which gives components of the Federation the right to determine the election procedure independently. Threatening a court investigation, the president's representative achieved a change to this statute on the elections but in the name of safeguarding citizens' constitutional guarantees to equal electoral rights. As a result the districts had to be re-formed in such a way that they contained an equal number of voters. This reorganization alone added to the confusion and disoriented both candidates and voters. One side, for instance, suggested that the elections be deferred. The other would not agree to this for anything. The local "red directors" recently "clashed" strongly with the governor. They used threats and ultimatums to force him to lower local taxes, established by the previous oblast soviet. Nothing can now patch up this breach in the budget. That is why the governor categorically refused to remain any longer without his legislator partner, without his protection and support. The president's administration tried to reconcile the quarrelling sides and to reason with them. N. Medvedev, leader of the administration's department for work with the territories, traveled to Yaroslavl. In vain. Three days before the elections, when everything was already prepared for the voting, the president's representative suddenly sent a representation to the governor (and published it in the press at the same time) suggesting that the elections to the local organs of power be cancelled. The elections nonetheless took place. But the last Sunday in February brought no conciliation. The situation now is taking shape in such a way that a succession of court cases on recognizing the elections to the municipalities as invalid may now ensue in the oblast.
