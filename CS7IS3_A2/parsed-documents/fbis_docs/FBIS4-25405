Vyacheslav Kostikov in a statement this afternoon denied that President Yeltsin was planning to replace Chernomyrdin with former Russian Security Council Secretary Yuriy Skokov. He said that the media reports about Yeltsin's meeting with Skokov on June 7 "were not in conformity with the facts." Chernomyrdin's aides also issued a statement saying that the reports about the prime minister's resignation were "absolutely groundless." "Spreading such rumors only serves certain elements and is exploiting the current situation," said the statement. Opinion polls show that Chernomyrdin's reputation has been surging since early in the year. But speculation that Chernomyrdin will leave his post this autumn has been rife since he flew to Germany for a medical check-up on June 5. The newspaper KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA today carried a front-page story saying that Skokov is going to replace Chernomyrdin as prime minister. It quoted informed sources around the Russian cabinet as saying that the president's advisors have agreed in principle that after Chernomyrdin's resignation for health reasons is accepted, Skokov will be appointed prime minister. Chernomyrdin seemed to have agreed to this arrangement before he flew suddenly to germany early this month, according to the newspaper. The reports have created a furor at home and abroad. Chernomyrdin's aides immediately responded by issuing a statement in Germany saying that the prime minister would return to Moscow later today.
