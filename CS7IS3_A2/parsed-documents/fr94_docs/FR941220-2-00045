FR941220-2-00045 FR941220-2-00031 [Release No. 34&hyph;35085; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;41] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Establishment of Uniform Listing and Trading Guidelines for Stock Index and Currency Warrants December 12, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on November 9, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange proposes to: (1) Amend its listing guidelines for stock index (``stock index'' or ``index'') warrants and currency warrants (``currency warrants''); 1 (2) establish various new rules for the trading of stock index and currency warrants; and (3) establish special customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency warrants. On Dec. 8, 1994, the NYSE amended certain surveillance related matters addressed in the filing. See footnote 3, infra. 1 Currency warrants, as used in this filing, may refer to warrants on individual currencies (or cross currencies) or to warrants on a specific currency index group (``currency index warrants''). The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, NYSE and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The NYSE proposes (1) to add a new Rule 414 (Index and Currency Warrants) in order (a) to prescribe procedures for approving and supervising accounts that trade currency warrants, currency index warrants and stock index warrants and (b) to prescribe stock index warrant position and exercise limits, (2) to replace Supplementary Material .30 to Rule 405 (Diligence to Accounts), which contains provisions that the proposed rule change proposes to supersede, with a cross reference to proposed Rule 414, (3) to amend existing Rule 431 (Margin Requirements) to modify currency warrant and stock index warrant margin requirements and to establish currency index warrant margin requirements, (4) to amend Para. 703.15 (Foreign Currency Warrants and Currency Index Warrants) of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual to modify the listing standards for currency warrants and to establish listing standards for currency index warrants, and (5) to amend Para. 703.17 (Stock Index Warrants Listing Standards) of the Exchange's Listed Company manual to modify the listing standards for stock index warrants. The provisions of proposed Rule 414 include (a) provisions governing the approval, supervision and suitability of customers, which for the most part follow the Rules that the Exchange applies in respect of trading in stock index options, and (b) stock index warrant position limits. It also includes a newly added stock index warrant exercise limit. A more detailed discussion of the provisions of the proposed rule change follows. Paragraph (a) of Rule 414 defines relevant terms. Paragraph (b) of Rule 414 specifies that the Rule applies to Exchange trading in currency warrants, currency index warrants and stock index warrants and that other Exchange Rules and the Exchange's Constitution also so apply. Paragraph (c) of Rule 414 establishes position limits for stock index warrants. For a position of stock index warrants with an original issue price of $10 or less, the position limit is 15 million index warrants. For a position of stock index warrants with an original issue price in excess of $10, the number of such warrants is converted to the equivalent number of warrants that the position would contain if the issuer had originally priced the issue at $10. Thus, 1 million stock index warrants with an original issue price of $20 would represent the equivalent of 2 million stock index warrants with an original issue price of $10 ($20/$10 Ã— 1 million stock index warrants) and the 15 million stock index warrant position limit would apply to the 2 million stock index warrant ``equivalents.'' Paragraph (c) also provides procedures for allowing limited exceptions to those position limits as circumstances warrant. Paragraph (d) of Rule 414 imposes exercise limits on stock index warrants equal to the position limits. The exercise limits are separate and distinct from any limits the issuer of the stock index warrant may impose. Paragraph (e) of Rule 414 applies the options rule counterpart to stock index warrant trading halts. Paragraph (f) of Rule 414 requires a member or member organization to have approved an account for options trading pursuant to the standards and procedures set forth in Rule 721 (Opening of Accounts) before the account can trade currency warrants, currency index warrants and/or stock index warrants. Paragraphs (g), (h), (i) and (j) of Rule 414 apply options rule counterparts to trading in currency warrants, currency index warrants and stock index warrants in the areas of supervision of accounts (see Rule 722 (Supervision of Accounts)), suitability (see Rule 723 (Suitability)), discretionary accounts (see Rule 724 (Discretionary Accounts)), and customer complaints (see Rule 732 (Customer Complaints)). Paragraph (k) of Rule 414 applies the options rule counterpart (see Rule 791 (Communications to Customers)) to communications to customers relating to currency warrants, currency index warrants and/or stock index warrants. In addition, Paragraph (k) requires those communications to state that currency warrants, currency index warrants and stock index warrants, unlike standardized options, are subject to issuer's credit risks and warrant terms and conditions that may differ from those that apply to other warrant issues overlying the same currency or index. The paragraph also advises that the prospectus requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 apply to certain communications.
