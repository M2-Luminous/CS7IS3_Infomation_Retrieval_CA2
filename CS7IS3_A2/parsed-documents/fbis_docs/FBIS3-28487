Calling attention to the exposure of the fact that Chon Kyong-hwan grabbed by forcible means more than 122,000 phyong (one phyong equals six feet square) of land around Yongjongdo, Inchon city, the ownership of which he claimed and filed a suit for it, the deputy spokesman said the money he paid in buying the vast tract of land must be an ill-gotten money. And he urged an immediate investigation into all the injustices committed by Chon Kyong-hwan in-mobilizing "government officials" in the forcible purchase of the land.
