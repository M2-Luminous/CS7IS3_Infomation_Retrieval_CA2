Mr. Germano said "Actually the European Union has not taken a decision on the 35 million ECU granted to Albania and in fact we cannot speak of a Greek veto but of their reserve expressed in one of the meeting of the Council of the Finance Ministers of the European Union, which they had not taken it back yet." European ambassador pointed out that we cannot take a decision on financial issues in the community, if there is no unanimity on it. He stressed that European Union wants to rediscuss the issue in the meeting of the foreign ministers of twelve countries, on June 13th. "We hope to take unanimous decision on this particular issue," said he, stressing "that it cannot be concealed that a tension exists, an obstacle between EU country member which Greece is and a country with which Europe has agreements of trade and cooperation, and once more according to this agreement an integration of Albania is foreseen, and above all your country is not a common partner but a privileged one. The Greek Government has expressed considerations of political nature, but it should be stressed it is only its stand," he clarified.
