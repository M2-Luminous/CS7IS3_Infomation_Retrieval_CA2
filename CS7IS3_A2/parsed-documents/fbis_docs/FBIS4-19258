We will now hear from our special correspondent in Marrakech, Jose Luis Garcia Sanchez. Good afternoon. [Garcia Sanchez] Hello, good afternoon. The Spanish administration is convinced that the signing in Marrakech will give a new impulse to world economic growth and to the wellbeing of all countries. State Secretary for Trade Apolonio Ruiz Ligero was in charge of reading the Spanish position which highlights the need for the new world trade body to study the social rights of workers in developing countries. Spain believes that forced labor, the lack of trade union legislation, and general wages agreements which fail to protect third world workers should be condemned. Furthermore, Ruiz Ligero says that the signing of the Uruguay Round will favor Spain in the long-term, it will not hurt our agriculture, and he calls upon Spanish businessmen to test their ability to compete in the world marketplace as well as at home.
