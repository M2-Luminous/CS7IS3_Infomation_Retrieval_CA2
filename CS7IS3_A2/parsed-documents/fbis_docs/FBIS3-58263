The neocentrists immediately seized this opportunity to argue again the "need" for a grand alliance comprising the nonconfessional groups, the DC [Christian Democratic Party], the League, and Silvio Berlusconi. To underline the significance of their demand, all the group's leaders have entered the arena -- Pierferdinando Casini, Francesco D'Onofrio, Clemente Mastella, Franco Fausti, Sandro Fontana, Ombretta Fumagalli-Carulli, and Silvio Lega signed a joint statement yesterday. In it they told Martinazzoli that "Christian Democrats must be clearly aware of the nature of a conflict that cannot be resolved by means of appeals -- though we consider them praiseworthy and sincere -- but only on the basis of a real and proper political clarification." This "political clarification" concerns the policy of alliances of the DC and of the future People's Party. Hitherto Martinazzoli has always said that the League and Berlusconi are not possible allies and that Mario Segni remains the only reference point. Now the "neocentrists" are reading with satisfaction the interview with Umberto Bossi published by IL GIORNALE yesterday in which the League leader says: "We have realized that our interlocutors are not yet ready for federalism, so we are scaling down our demands." Translated, this means that the League is afraid of the progressive alignment and will content itself with regionalism as long as Occhetto can be defeated. This remark prompted the "neocentrists" to say: "The League leader must begin a revision on the topics of national unity, democracy, and an end to North-South discrimination. These are some of the demands made by Christian Democratic `neocentrists' and by those, such as Buttiglione, who have no prejudices against sitting down at a common table to draw up a moderate, liberal-democratic cartel." The next step was a logical one -- another ultimatum to Martinazzoli. The neocentrists wrote: "This, and no other, is the only path capable of preventing Occhetto's victory. Martinazzoli must make it clear whether -- as Rosy Bindi, Mattarella, and Elia say -- there is on the part of the People's Party a predetermined rejection of an accord with the nonconfessional groups, Berlusconi, and the League." Rosy Bindi responded to this from Padua, urging DC Chairwoman Rosa Russo Jervolino to "take the legal steps to dissolve the party" so that on 18 January the National Council can officially announce the birth of the People's Party. Venice's "pasionaria" went on to demand once more that the People's Party include as few representatives as possible of the "buried party." Therefore, she said, it is better that all outgoing members of parliament stand aside and forego standing as candidates in the coming elections. This appeal, addressed for the present to deputies and senators of the Venice region, was made official yesterday at the meeting held in Padua to appoint the coordinators for the People's Party in the Venice region. These 111 "musketeers" will choose the candidates for the coming elections, in very close cooperation with Bindi. Defining how they will be chosen, "la pasionaria" said: "We will consider outgoing members whom it is important that we field as candidates again and who can provide evidence of lofty ethical standards, but everyone must first be willing to stand aside." So Rosy Bindi is issuing a new challenge. Just a year and a half ago, when she assumed the leadership of the Venice DC, which had been brought to its knees by the judicial inquiries, she asked all investigatees to stop attending party meetings; now she is directly addressing all those elected in the 5 April 1992 elections to agree to submit to an "examination" by her 111 trusted coordinators appointed yesterday. In theory, irrespective of the election results, 25 parliamentarians risk losing their seats, including two former ministers -- Carlo Fracanzani and Carlo Bernini -- and the current deputy secretary at the Treasury Ministry, Giovanni Malvestio.
