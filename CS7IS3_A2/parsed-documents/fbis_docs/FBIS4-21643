Jayraman] [Text] The reports that Japan's fast-breeder reactor is expected to go critical should be good news to India's nuclear scientists. India and Japan appear to be the only two countries pursuing the breeder technology in today's world that has become hostile to this new source of electric power. The hostility stems from two reasons. One is the safety consideration, because of the complex technology involved in breeder reactors. It is for this reason that France, which pioneered the breeder technology, decided to shut down its 1,200-megawatt fast-breeder reactor. To appreciate the second reason, one must know what a breeder is. The fast-breeder reactor has a core made of plutonium fuel surrounded by a blanket of natural uranium. During the chain reaction, more plutonium is created in the blanket than what is consumed in the core, and hence the name breeder. One simply has to remove the blanket, extract the plutonium, and build another breeder with it or use the plutonium to build a bomb. It is this possibility of nuclear proliferation that is at the heart of the American campaign against plutonium. In the United States spent nuclear fuel is not reprocessed to recover plutonium, and Washington does not want any other nation to produce plutonium, even for power generation, because of its fear that it can be diverted for bombs. Interest in fast-breeders declined for yet another reason. In the 1970's it was anticipated that a spread of conventional reactors would lead to a shortage of uranium and make plutonium the fuel of choice. But this did not happen. Japan relies almost totally on the outside world for energy. It sees fast-breeder technology is a promising route to reduce this dependence. Japan's prototype fast- breeder reactor Monju will produce 280 megawatts when it begins full operation next year. India's compulsion to go into fast-breeder technology is dictated by the fact that while its uranium resources are limited, it has large deposits of thorium, which can be turned into a nuclear fuel. In order to efficiently make this conversion, India has to build fast-breeder reactors with cores made of plutonium and blankets out of thorium. India's fast-breeder test reactor at Kalpakkam, near Madras, is about 10 years old, but its power level is nowhere near the designed 40 megwatt. It has succeeded in convincing Indian scientists that the technology is difficult to master but not impossible to learn. India no doubt is way behind Japan in harnessing this power source, but its consolation is that it is not alone in pursuing this technology. Whether India will be able to commit enough resources to pursue its goal like Japan is, however, a big question mark.
