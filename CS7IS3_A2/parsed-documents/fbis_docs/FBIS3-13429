In a vote, the UN Human Rights Commission, despite the fact that the majority of its members voted against or abstained, approved a resolution on the violation of human rights in Iran, supported only by Western countries. The statement by the Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Affairs Ministry stresses: Those who issued the resolution have remained silent in the face of the Zionist regime's crimes at the al-Khalil mosque and have even stopped, in the first round of its debate, a resolution that would have condemned the Zionist regime. The Foreign Affairs Ministry statement also mentions: It has been proved to the world that the Western countries who support such resolutions, are themselves practically assisting the anti-human crimes and the clear violation of human rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the heart of Europe, through their deception. The statement by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Islamic Republic of Iran emphasizes that the Iranian punishment laws are based on the Islamic legal concepts, accepted and respected by over 1 billion world Muslims, and such resolutions not only have no credibility or legitimacy, but will also damage the credibility of such forums.
