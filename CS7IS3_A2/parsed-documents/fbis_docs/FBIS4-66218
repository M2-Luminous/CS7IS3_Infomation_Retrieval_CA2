Chinese weapons experts, who had hoped to sift some useful information from the give and take of real battle and fighting at close quarters between the two sides, were particularly disappointed. They were very much dissatisfied with CNN's constant transmission of pictures showing laser guided devices locking on and hitting targets. They felt that this was scare tactics to a certain extent, and might even be showing off or bravado. Finally, they obtained some relatively firsthand material in the form of a stack of photographs taken on the spot by the Chinese observers that the UN had sent to the Iraq border to supervise the cease fire. When the war first ended, the scorched earth and the wreckage of tanks and armored personnel carriers as far as the eye could see conveyed the feeling of an enormous graveyard. Naturally, the Chinese observers' cameras focused mostly on Iraqi T-72 tanks inasmuch as these tanks were closest to China's own equipment in terms of historical background and performance. Thus, they were of greater interest to them. The scene in one photograph was rather sorrowful. The wreckage of a T-72 tank lay twisted in a destroyed desert revetment, its tracks buried in the desert sand, its large caliber gun wrenched to the side, but its anti-aircraft gun facing straight ahead. In the middle of the armor on the front of the tank was a large shell hole torn by the steel core of a low-grade uranium armor piercing shell from an American M1A1 tank. From a cursory glance, this seemed to confirm that the T-72 tank was not the equal of the M1A1. It had been hit straight on. However, our tank experts are not simpletons who parrot the views of others. After scrutinizing the photograph, they found the real reason this tank had been destroyed. "Look. Here's a clue," said one research institute tank expert explaining a detail he had found. "In the photograph, the T-72's gun barrel is not facing in the direction of fire of the American tank like the muzzle of the machine gun, but 45 degrees to the right.... What does this show? It shows that before it was hit by the M1A1 shell, the crew had run away. One feature of the T-72 is that the tank driver entry hatch is located under the gun barrel, so unless the turret is moved a certain amount, the personnel inside the tank cannot raise the hatch to get out. Clearly, the destroyed tank was not in combat mode at the time. It had been abandoned. How would you judge this kind of destruction? Should you blame the personnel or blame the tank?" This expert made a conclusion: "I do not feel this was a real tank war inasmuch as the morale of one side was undermined and it abandoned its equipment. They did not resist." The American M1A1 is one of the world's most advanced land warfare weapons. Of this, there is no doubt. However, the difference between it and the T-72 is by no means the difference between heaven and earth. For psychological warfare reasons, long before the ground warfare began, the American army conducted a lot of propaganda through the news media, claiming that it had "an effective range twice that of Iraq's best T-72 tank." Was it really all that wonderful? Our experts had reservations from the very beginning. They believed real data more. The fire control systems of the two tanks are on a par; they both use smooth-bore guns, and the T-72's gun diameter is 125 mm while the M1A1's is 120 mm. The T-72's armor piercing shells have an muzzle velocity of 1,800 meters per second; the M1A1's 1,650 mm per second. What is more, the T-72's trajectory is flatter; thus, it has a very high hit rate without using its complex fire control system. Therefore, our exports were anxious to find out whether these two weapons really battled each other in a true sense. Was the overnight collapse of the Iraqi armored corps, which was equipped with more than 1,000 T-72 tanks, because its personnel did not stand the test or because the tanks did not stand the test? The experts had sharp eyes. The above problems could not be approached solely from the angle of a confrontation between weapons. The Iraqi high command robbed the tank corps of its assault and maneuverability advantages by placing in defensive fortifications, where it became a target, a fine weapon that might have been able to fight off the enemy. Even when the enemy moved several hundred kilometers westward, leaving his flanks exposed, it did not organize a powerful counterattack. The soldiers carrying out the combat mission had also not recovered from the suffering and exhaustion of the war between Iraq and Iran before being sent into battle again. They also had a muddled idea about the goals of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and about this war. In addition, after the war broke out, command was paralyzed, supplies were cut off, and many soldiers were semi-starved or had no fresh water to drink, so how could their morale be good? Consequently, during 100 hours of ground warfare, the multi-national forces captured 2,100 Iraqi soldiers for every man they lost. For every tank they lost, they destroyed 1,878 tanks and armored personnel carriers. Certainly, this was unique in the annals of modern warfare. Nevertheless, anyone who knows anything at all about warfare also realizes that surrender without fighting, and abandonment of vehicles was also a very large factor. The detail that our tank experts revealed should not be belittled. It sets to rights the ballyhoo of some press media as well as the acceptance of this ballyhoo as true by some people. One should take the evaluation of the victors with a grain of salt! This is because the "one-sidedness" of this war did not stem completely from the too great technical backwardness of one of the contestants. The personnel were not tough enough. Even though the T-72 is slightly inferior to the M1A1, both can inflict severe damage on each other. The cost of manufacturing each M1A1 is $2 million, but a T-72 costs much less. Even a "gold dollar empire" cannot afford this expense except for a death-defying struggle. To regress at bit, the Iraqi army relied on the laying of more than 20 million land mines (including some high technology smart mines) in a defense zone, and the use of T-72s to organize several pretty good battles to oppose their removal (unfortunately they did not!). Naturally, in considering the above, the experts subconsciously thought something they did not say and that is not nice to say, namely: "No question about it; things would have been different had it been our troops in the same T-72s." Having said this, the writer feels a statement that Mao Zedong made some years ago in "On Protracted War" would be most appropriate: "Soldiers are the foundation of an army. Unless the armed forces are infused with political spirit, and unless progressive political work is done to make this infusion, the will to resist cannot be aroused to the maximum in officers and men, and the best technical and tactical foundation cannot be obtained for making the most of their effectiveness." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong). Truth may sometimes fade from people's memories, but it can never be eradicated.
