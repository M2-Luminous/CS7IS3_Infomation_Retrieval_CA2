FR940106-1-00078 FR940106-1-00011 These wetter years are an important component of the natural hydrology; 40 percent of the last 50 years have been in the ``wet'' category. They are years of very high productivity for the estuary, and are likely to provide a buffer for times of low productivity, especially for those species living longer than one or two years. Such variability also encourages diversity, such as the plant diversity in brackish tidal marshes bordering Suisun Bay. While many of the winter/spring flows during these years are presently considered ``uncontrollable,'' a number of new water projects have been proposed that would capture part of these flows. One concern about the future development of these ``uncontrolled'' flows involves a possible decrease in the frequency with which triggering conditions will occur. The level of protection afforded by the Roe Island standard would be reduced if additional upstream water developments decrease uncontrolled wintertime flows, thus reducing the frequency with which the standard is triggered. EPA welcomes comments on how this standard should be modified to reflect future changes in upstream water development facilities. An additional concern about the protection of conditions in wetter years is that some wet years are much more productive than others. By developing standards that can be met in all wet years some of the biological values associated with exceptional years is not included. Part of the difficulty of developing criteria to protect the biological value of these wetter years arises from the open-ended nature of the wet year category. Recent wet years include years as different as 1983 and 1986. In 1983, precipitation, both rain and snow, was heavy throughout the winter and spring. In 1986, on the other hand, a large tropical storm produced record-setting precipitation which lasted for a brief period and fell almost entirely as rain. Although both these were wet years, 1983 had about three times the amount of precipitation of 1986 and, because of the heavy snowfall, a much higher amount of water was available for use. Possible ways to protect the value of wet year habitats include the use of triggered standards downstream of Roe Island or by requiring more days at Roe Island in the wettest years. EPA welcomes suggestions on the proper level of protection that should be provided during these wetter periods. 5. One of the critical elements of EPA's proposal is the determination of the proper historical reference period for developing target numbers of days when the 2 ppt isohaline is at a particular point in the estuary. As discussed above, EPA is recommending a level of protection for the Bay/Delta similar to that existing during the late 1960's to early 1970's. To estimate the hydrological conditions during the late 1960's to early 1970's across the five water year categories, EPA is proposing using the 1940 to 1975 period as the historical reference period. The choice of years to include in the historical reference period can strongly affect the number of days when the 2 ppt isohaline is at a particular point. Incremental changes in the number of days have corresponding incremental effects on the water supply impacts of these proposals. Prior to the building of Shasta Dam, uncontrolled spring runoffs resulted in as many as 150 days when the 2 ppt isohaline was located at or below Chipps Island, even in critical years, whereas in recent years there have been as few as 0 days. In developing the proposed rule, EPA has used the period between October 1939 and September 1975 to represent the period when the conditions in the estuary were sufficient to protect the designated fisheries uses. As explained above, this span of years provides the greatest number of examples of each year type during the period after the massive changes in hydrology due to the construction of the Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River and the Friant Dam on the San Joaquin but before the most dramatic recent declines in fishery abundance. Even so, the chosen historical reference period contains no examples of critical years and only three examples of above normal years. One example of the variability of conditions within the chosen historical reference period involves the Chipps Island location. There is a great deal of variability in the number of days the 2 ppt isohaline was at Chipps Island within each of the drier year types in the historical reference period. Although the years with fewest days occurs later in the period there are examples of later years with more days than earlier years. The following table gives the number of days that the 2 ppt isohaline was west of Chipps Island for each dry and below normal year in the historical period. The latest examples of dry years in the proposed reference period, 1964 and 1961, had the fewest days at Chipps Island. These two dry years, however, were immediately preceded by a dry year (1960) with a number of days at Chipps Island substantially greater than the historical mean, and the year with the third lowest number of days at Chipps actually occurred in 1947. The absence of a strong pattern of decreasing days at Chipps Island over time was the principal basis for EPA's use of as broad a historical period as possible, the full period from 1940 to 1975, as the historical reference period.
