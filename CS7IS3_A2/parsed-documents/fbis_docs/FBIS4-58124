FBIS4-58124 "drnes084_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-084 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 SYRIA Minister on Christopher Visit, U.S. Role Minister on Christopher Visit, U.S. Role NC3004090094 Cairo AL-WAFD in Arabic 24 Apr 94 p 5 NC3004090094 Cairo AL-WAFD Arabic BFN [Interview with Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman by Sana' al-Sa'id in Damascus; date not given] [Text] [Al-Sa'id] It appears to many that the U.S. stands are inconsistent with peace and are inconsistent with what was agreed on at the Geneva summit between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad. Is Syria happy with the current U.S. stand? [Salman] The peace process started following former President George Bush's March 1991 initiative, which regarded the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region. As one of the two cosponsors of the peace conference that was held toward the end of that year and of the subsequent Washington talks, the United States played a major role in preparing for the Madrid conference through the clarifications and guarantees it gave and its promises to play the role of an honest partner in the peace process. The U.S. Administration remained committed to the Bush initiative when President Clinton came to power. It has made many statements that it will continue its efforts to achieve peace on all tracks, especially after the Washington talks were halted when Israel struck out on its own with the PLO and concluded the Oslo agreement with it, completely ignoring the bases on which the Madrid conference was held. The Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton reiterated the Madrid conference's terms of reference and the U.S. commitment to continue its efforts for a comprehensive peace on all the tracks of the conflict. Thus, Washington is still intent on its commitment to the peace process, though the role it is now expected to play fails to live up to its pledge to play the role of a full and honest partner in the peace process. We believe that, in light of its special relations with Israel--which have reached the level of a strategic alliance--the U.S. Administration is capable of influencing the Israeli stand, which is impeding the U.S. initiative entailing the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the exchange of land for peace. [Al-Sa'id] In view of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region, what is the United States specifically asked to do as a sponsor of the peace process and as an honest mediator? [Salman] What is required is very clear, namely to fulfill its pledges and commitments to implement its initiative and effectively fulfill the role of a full and honest partner. This does not mean exerting pressure on Israel, as some circles are narrowly trying to interpret this issue, but rather to not leave international legitimacy's resolutions suspended in mid-air or subject to Israeli blackmail and bargaining. Israel uses these tactics in order to avoid the UN resolutions and replace them with new secret channels, on the Oslo model, so as to deal on its own with this or that Arab country and thereby conclude unilateral deals that thwart a just and comprehensive peace. We hope that Christopher's visit will bring positive signs that the United States will act in conformity with its statements on activating the peace process and breaking the deadlock in the Washington talks, which was reached as a result of Israeli procrastination and intransigence. [Al-Sa'id] The rounds of talks have so far proved that Israel is not serious about establishing peace and that it will continue its procrastination in order to keep the land as long as possible. How is it possible to eliminate the obstacles facing the peace process? [Salman] This could be done if Israel acknowledges the inadmissibility of taking other people's land by force and accepts the land for peace principle. To do this, Israel must end its continuing occupation of the land and its rejection of Arab rights. Israel must also stop the its deceptive maneuvers on international level to disavow the requirements for peace. The Arabs' steadfastness in the peace battle; the international community's awareness of the dangers inherent in the obstruction of the peace process; the unbiased and full partnership in the peace conference's sponsors, particularly the United States; and the new reality imposed by the intifadah on the Israeli occupiers that geographical factors cannot assure security--it goes without saying that these are all factors in forcing Israel to abandon its policy that is hostile to peace and the international legitimacy and for placing the comprehensive peace process on the right path. [Al-Sa'id] Israel is convinced that the United States will not pressure it over talks with Syria due to Israel's internal situation and their coalition status. Can you comment? [Salman] This issue concerns U.S.-Israeli relations and the U.S. desire to maintain the credibility of its commitment to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region. We know well the strength of the U.S.-Israeli alliance. But this does not necessarily mean that the United States is unable to pursue a policy that serves its special interests or to entertain a peace plan that is not in line with Israel's, particularly since the United States is talking about a new world order based on the UN Charter and resolutions. We should note with guarded optimism how former President Eisenhower forced Israel to withdraw from Sinai following the tripartite aggression against Egypt in 1956. [Al-Sa'id] Do you expect a full or partial Israeli withdrawal from the Golan? [Salman] The withdrawal from the Golan must be complete. We hope that Rabin's remarks on withdrawal from the Golan are free of any ambiguity, such as we have been confronting at every session of talks on the principle of complete withdrawal from the occupied territories in return for peace. [Al-Sa'id] Israel claims that Syria is hedging its bets. On the one hand, it keeps peace exchanges going with Israel, while on the other, it uses Hizballah as a bargaining chip. How do you see this? [Salman] Our policy is not influenced by Israeli interpretations. The moment we endorsed the U.S. initiative we made it clear that peace is a strategic goal for Syria and the Arab world. To achieve this goal, we should employ our resources in the battle for peace. Therefore, we should adhere to our pan-Arab principles and support acts of legitimate resistance. The UN Charter endorses the right of nations to resist occupation. [Al-Sa'id] The Gaza-Jericho agreement led to a halt in negotiations on other tracks and to a discontinuation of the peace process. What can you say about that? [Salman] That agreement was an attempt to deprive the peace process of its foundation, namely, the two UN Security Council resolutions [242 and 338]. Yitzhaq Rabin admitted as much when he said: "The Oslo agreement proved the futility of the Washington talks." Rabin urged secret talks as a way of reaching separate agreements with other Arab parties to the peace process. By doing so, Israel hopes to renege on all commitment to the UN Security Council resolutions. But Rabin failed to achieve this, despite Israel's intentional obstruction of the Washington talks, which stumbled as a result. The Geneva summit ended the premature elation that accompanied the signing of the Oslo agreement. That summit confirmed that a comprehensive solution must be found on all the negotiating tracks. [Al-Sa'id] Arab world splits are a nightmare that weakens the Arab negotiating position vis-a-vis Israel. [Salman] Since the corrective movement [al-Asad's rise to power] in 1970, Syria has endeavored to cement Arab solidarity. President Hafiz al-Asad has said that: "The strength of the Arabs is in their unity." President al-Asad warned us not to worrying about secondary issues and forget crucial Arab matters. There are cracks in the Arab armor, but these can be sealed. We will do everything within our power to restore Arab solidarity. Those who fail to learn the lessons of the recent past have much to lose, and we are afraid the loss will be bigger this time. As for those who remain firm and faithful in word and deed to the will of the nation, they discern through the clouds of discord the need for strict adherence to pan-Arab principles and further commitment to the interests of future generations.
