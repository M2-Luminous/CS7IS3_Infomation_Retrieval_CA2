FR941128-2-00145 FR941128-2-00079 (4) The proceeds of the sale are used solely to discharge the Plan's obligations to participants and beneficiaries in connection with the termination of the Plan. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Plan is a defined benefit pension plan, with 30 participants as of December 31, 1993. The Plan was established in 1974 by Lucky Electric Supply, Inc. (the Employer), which is a closely-held Tennessee corporation engaged in wholesale and retail electrical supply operations, with its place of business in Memphis, Tennessee. The trustee of the Plan is Marylew Lewis who is a director of the Employer. 2. In 1991, the Employer took the actions necessary to terminate the Plan, and established May 31, 1991 as the termination date. The Employer represents that notice of intent to terminate the Plan was made to Plan participants, and was filed with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), in accordance with the requirements of the PBGC. 3. The sole asset in the Plan upon its termination was group annuity contract No. 03057 (the GAC) issued by Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company of New Jersey (Mutual Benefit). The Employer represents that Mutual Benefit was notified of the termination of the Plan, and that Mutual Benefit acknowledged receipt of such notification in a letter to the Employer dated July 22, 1991. Mutual Benefit also advised the Employer that effective July 16, 1991, Mutual Benefit had been placed in a rehabilitory conservatorship (the Conservatorship) by the insurance commissioner of the State of New Jersey (the Commissioner). 7 The Employer represents that the Conservatorship effected a freeze on regular payments and withdrawals from Mutual Benefits group annuity contracts, including the GAC held by the Plan. Since the Conservatorship commenced, the only withdrawals with respect to the GAC have been to enable hardship distributions under the Plan (the Hardship Withdrawals). The Employer represents that upon commencement of the Conservatorship on July 16, 1991, the GAC had a face value, referred to in the terms of the GAC as ``contract value'', of $147,477.68 (the Conservatorship Face Value), consisting of total principal deposits, plus interest at the rates guaranteed by the GAC (the Contract Rates), less previous withdrawals. The Employer represents that a total of $37,743.55 in Hardship Withdrawals from the GAC have been made by the Plan since the commencement of the Conservatorship. 7 The Department notes that the decisions to acquire and hold the GAC are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of Part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of the Act. In this proposed exemption, the Department is not proposing relief for any violations of Part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the acquisition and holding of the GAC. 4. In January of 1993, the Employer received a letter from the PBGC requesting a certification that final distribution of Plan benefits, in connection with termination of the Plan, had been accomplished. Due to the Conservatorship's freeze on withdrawals and payments with respect to the GAC, other than the Hardship Withdrawals, the Employer has not been able to accomplish final distribution of benefits to the Plan's participants, in accordance with requirements of the PBGC. In order to enable the Plan to accomplish complete discharge of Plan benefit obligations and distribution of assets in accordance with requirements of the PBGC, the Employer proposes to purchase the GAC from the Plan, and is requesting an exemption to permit such transaction under the terms and conditions described herein. 5. The Employer proposes a purchase price for the GAC which represents its new value as determined with reference to the Conservatorship, as described herein. As a result of the Conservatorship, a plan of rehabilitation of Mutual Benefit (the Rehab Plan) has been approved by the Commissioner, under which the terms of the GAC have been redefined and restated. Under the Rehab Plan, as the holder of a Mutual Benefit group annuity contract, the Plan had the options of ``opting out'' of the Rehab Plan, in which case the GAC would have been terminated, or ``opting in'', in which case the GAC would be restated, redefined, and would be supported and reinsured by a consortium of life insurance companies. By not submitting the forms necessary to ``opt out'' of the Rehab Plan, the Trustee allowed the Plan to be ``opted in'' automatically. Consequently, the GAC has been assigned a new value (the New Value) equal to 100 percent of the Conservatorship Face Value, less subsequent Hardship Withdrawals, plus interest on this amount as follows: (a) For the period of July 16, 1991 through December 31, 1991, interest at the Contract Rates; (b) for calendar year 1992, interest an annual rate of four percent; and (c) for calendar years 1993 and 1994, an annual rate of 3.5 percent. The Rehab Plan provides that subsequent to 1994, the New Value will earn an annual rate of interest determined each year by the performance of a separate account maintained by Mutual Benefit. On the basis of the foregoing, the GAC's New Value plus interest, as of December 31, 1993, was $123,422.43. The Employer represents that the Plan is unable to withdraw its investment in the GAC without the payment of a substantial fee, which would be assessed by Mutual Benefit under the terms of the Rehab Plan. 6. In accordance with the Rehab Plan's new valuation of the GAC, the Employer proposes to pay the Plan cash for the GAC in the amount of the New Value plus all interest accrued in accordance with the Rehab Plan as of the date of the purchase. The Employer states that such a purchase transaction will allow the Plan to substitute the GAC, which is illiquid due to the inability to withdraw its value, for the cash assets necessary for the Plan's participants to receive the full amount of the benefits due them under the terms of the Plan. The Employer represents that no participant will receive less than the full value of his or her accrued benefits under the terms of the Plan. The Employer estimates that the termination value of all Plan participants' accrued benefits as of March 31, 1995 will be $239,953.57. Commensurate with the Employer's proposed purchase of the GAC, the Employer will make cash contributions to the Plan to supply funding for the excess of the Plan's accrued benefit obligations over the purchase price of the GAC. 7. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (1) The transaction enables the Plan to liquidate it sole asset, the GAC, to enable distribution of benefits in connection with termination of the Plan; (2) The transaction is a one-time cash transaction in which the Plan will incur no losses or expenses; (3) The Plan will receive a purchase price for the GAC equal to its New Value plus interest through the date of sale in accordance with the Rehab Plan; and (4) All Plan participants will receive all benefits due them under the terms of the Plan.
