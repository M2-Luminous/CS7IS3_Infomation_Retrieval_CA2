Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says the Korean people cannot remain an onlooker to this but are keeping tabs on Japan's moves. The analyst says: The Japan defence agency has set it as a primary task to "increase the capacity of intelligence gathering.",it is putting fresh muscles into the system of gathering information on the Korean peninsula and training in secrecy information-gathering experts with the help of the U.S. CIA. Though the Cold War has ended Japan is now showing extra zeal in gathering information about the DPRK and other countries by using even satellite photographs provided by the United States. This is a tell-tale sign of its preparations for overseas aggression. The top political and military quarters of Japan are attempting to overpower the DPRK with strength in league with the United States and the South Korean puppets. This is an anachronistic and foolish design. The Japanese reactionaries must clearly know that their scheme to fulfil their design of overseas aggression, intensifying information gathering against the DPRK, will lead them to destruction.
