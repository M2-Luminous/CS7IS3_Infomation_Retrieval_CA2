[Sanjines] That it is important, necessary, and good for the country. This is why we should have it and keep it. Under this concept the Armed Forces will always be subordinated as a disciplined military organization and organized through a vertical structure in accordance with the Constitution, which entrusted us with the mission that must be fulfilled. Sometimes it is difficult to satisfy every expectation within and outside the institution. Like all institutions, we are currently basically affected by the economic situation, and we must adjust to what is available, to the conditions of the country. We have thus drawn up the Initial Concept Plan which basically means that the budget, which is allocated by the state, must be used by the Armed Forces to modernize and improve their operational capabilities and to carry out the assigned mission which has two parts: To defend sovereignty and to help the country's development. The Initial Concept Plan is a document that will be distributed by the Central Command to the Armed Forces commanders once the government's basic plan has been settled, taking into account the guidelines of the commander in chief of the Armed Forces on foreign relations, domestic relations, etc. This document was issued last January, and there has now been time to discuss it and to devise the best method of action, as is called in the general staff. Orders will soon be issued to the commanders to make the required changes on matters related to operations, personnel, and material, etc. [PRESENCIA] In general terms, what is the Initial Concept Plan? [Sanjines] It is a logical reorganization of the Armed Forces equipment and other resources. I believe we expanded too much, and our budget does not allow us to cover that expansion. We have tried to improve some units and to strengthen others to be more effective because they may not carrying out a logic, positive action. We want to improve the social aspect within the Armed Forces, to improve the life of officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers. This is not easy because we have expanded too much. In other words, sometimes we created units where we should not, where our logistical needs were great and not well taken care of. There was maybe no need to create those units. We want a more coherent situation within the institution. In the past the Armed Forces bought things that were not really needed. We must now adjust to a new situation. If we have to sell some of those superfluous things, we will do it. We are trying to be more realistic. [PRESENCIA] Does this means personnel reduction? [Sanjines] No, this does not mean reducing personnel. We are adjusting things. Sometimes useless spending is approved, for things that are not needed. For example, there is no need in the Air Force to have a special type of computer in a unit that will make no good use of it, but there is a need in the Air Force for communication equipment for planes. This is the type of change we want to make. The same idea applies to the Army. There are places where personnel were increased, but they were not very effective operationally (not for lack of know-how but for lack of budget). Some units should control their personnel, but are unable through a lack of effective communications system. If we lack an effective communications system, why should we have a division that has no control over the units dispersed over a wide area? This is what we are doing. [PRESENCIA] What does support for the development of the country means? [Sanjines] The Armed Forces have supported the country's development for a long time, but we were unable to explain this to society because we are not experts on this matter and also because the Armed Forces do things anonymously, the way it should be done. This was lacking; for many years society did not receive a clear image on this aspect of the Armed Forces. We continue to support the country with the same trustworthiness of the past, but perhaps in a more organized manner. Education particularly pleases us, because in addition to training a soldier, we are also giving him a technical education so that when he returns to his community he can teach others how to improve agriculture, how to protect the environment and so on .... We carry out several activities which, beyond just the military training of handling weapons, also teach a soldier do that type of work. [PRESENCIA] The Constitution says military men cannot become a deliberating body. Do you agree with that concept? [Sanjines] Yes, I believe it is important. Yet this does not mean military officers cannot have political views like anybody else. Obviously our echelon of command, our regulations, foresee that when views emerge, they can be made known to a superior in a military unit, in meetings with a commander. This is how ideas reach the high command. The commander then conveys these ideas to the president who should know about them. It would be unprofessional for a military officer to issue his own personal opinions. [PRESENCIA] Have the Armed Forces made any suggestions for the constitutional reform? [Sanjines] Yes, we have worked in some seminars, but I don't want to get into this issue ... [PRESENCIA] What is the meaning of sovereignty for Bolivians at the end of the millennium? [Sanjines] It means having a real participation in the international community. Without it the factors of sovereignty would be weakened. If we continue to be dependent, we continue to be vulnerable. I believe the country should begin to develop and work on a stronger national character without seeking divisions. Major disagreements should end. I believe national unity should be achieved first in order to demand more work from everyone based on that achievement. We must all work much harder. It is not enough to work eight hours a day for the next five or ten years, we should work at least two more hours a day. If we do that we will strengthen our sovereignty. [PRESENCIA] Regarding strategies, when we talk about borders, are there any threats ahead? [Sanjines] One never knows how the world will react in the next five or 10 years, how regions, countries will react. What we know for sure is that as time passes needs become greater, and in the face of those needs the countries will try to satisfy them. We must bear that in mind, that we are the only ones who will defend what is ours. This is why we must make long-range plans which means thinking about a national doctrine. [PRESENCIA] Is the doctrine being drawn up? [Sanjines] Yes, we are working on a joint doctrine because we haven't had one for a long time. In some way this is a criticism. We in the military wasted our time on other matters outside the Armed Forces. Perhaps there was a time when everyone was thinking of the government either for personal reasons or for lack of political leadership. We should have learned from the Chaco War experience and turn our entire attention to the Armed Forces. As military men we should seek to improve the doctrine and have something well defined. It is never too late, we are involved in it, and I believe it is important for the country to define a doctrine. [PRESENCIA] How do the Armed Forces view the demand for decentralization? [Sanjines] This issue should also be handled with great care. We are the protectors of national unity and on this issue we want to be very clear: We are concerned about a total decentralization. We recommend that decentralization should be just administrative, or we could reach a situation no one wants. [passage omitted]
