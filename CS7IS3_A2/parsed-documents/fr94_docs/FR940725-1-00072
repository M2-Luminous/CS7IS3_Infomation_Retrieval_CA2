FR940725-1-00072 FR940725-1-00010 12. Section 23.57 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) introductory text, (b), (c)(1), (c)(3) introductory text, (c)(4), and (d); and by adding a new paragraph (e) to read as follows: §23.57 Takeoff path. * * * * * (a) The takeoff path extends from a standing start to a point in the takeoff at which the airplane is 1500 feet above the takeoff surface at or below which height the transition from the takeoff to the enroute configuration must be completed; and * * * * * (b) During the acceleration to speed V 2 , the nose gear may be raised off the ground at a speed not less than V R . However, landing gear retraction must not be initiated until the airplane is airborne. (c) *␣*␣* (1) The slope of the airborne part of the takeoff path must not be negative at any point; * * * * * (3) At each point along the takeoff path, starting at the point at which the airplane reaches 400 feet above the takeoff surface, the available gradient of climb must not be less than_ * * * * * (4) Except for gear retraction and automatic propeller feathering, the airplane configuration must not be changed, and no change in power that requires action by the pilot may be made, until the airplane is 400 feet above the takeoff surface. (d) The takeoff path to 35 feet above the takeoff surface must be determined by a continuous demonstrated takeoff. (e) The takeoff flight path from 35 feet above the takeoff surface must be determined by synthesis from segments; and (1) The segments must be clearly defined and must be related to distinct changes in configuration, power, and speed; (2) The weight of the airplane, the configuration, and the power must be assumed constant throughout each segment and must correspond to the most critical condition prevailing in the segment; and (3) The takeoff flight path must be based on the airplane's performance without utilizing ground effect. 13. Section 23.59 is amended by revising the introductory text for this section, paragraph (a)(2), and paragraph (b) to read as follows: §23.59 Takeoff distance and takeoff run. For each commuter category airplane, the takeoff distance and, at the option of the applicant, the takeoff run, must be determined. (a) *␣*␣* (2) With all engines operating, 115 percent of the horizontal distance from the start of the takeoff to the point at which the airplane is 35 feet above the takeoff surface, determined by a procedure consistent with §23.57. (b) If the takeoff distance includes a clearway, the takeoff run is the greater of_ (1) The horizontal distance along the takeoff path from the start of the takeoff to a point equidistant between the liftoff point and the point at which the airplane is 35 feet above the takeoff surface as determined under §23.57; or (2) With all engines operating, 115 percent of the horizontal distance from the start of the takeoff to a point equidistant between the liftoff point and the point at which the airplane is 35 feet above the takeoff surface, determined by a procedure consistent with §23.57. 14. A new §23.63 is added to read as follows: §23.63 Climb: general. (a) Compliance with the requirements of §§23.65, 23.66, 23.67, 23.69, and 23.77 must be shown_ (1) Out of ground effect; and (2) At speeds that are not less than those at which compliance with the powerplant cooling requirements of §§23.1041 to 23.1047 has been demonstrated; and (3) Unless otherwise specified, with one engine inoperative, at a bank angle not exceeding 5 degrees. (b) For normal, utility, and acrobatic category reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight, compliance must be shown with §23.65(a), §23.67(a), where appropriate, and §23.77(a) at maximum takeoff or landing weight, as appropriate, in a standard atmosphere. (c) For normal, utility, and acrobatic category reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of more than 6,000 pounds maximum weight, and turbine engine-powered airplanes in the normal, utility, and acrobatic category, compliance must be shown at weights as a function of airport altitude and ambient temperature, within the operational limits established for takeoff and landing, respectively, with_ (1) Sections 23.65(b) and 23.67(b) (1) and (2), where appropriate, for takeoff, and (2) Section 23.67(b)(2), where appropriate, and §23.77(b), for landing. (d) For commuter category airplanes, compliance must be shown at weights as a function of airport altitude and ambient temperature within the operational limits established for takeoff and landing, respectively, with_ (1) Sections 23.67(c)(1), 23.67(c)(2), and 23.67(c)(3) for takeoff; and (2) Sections 23.67(c)(3), 23.67(c)(4), and 23.77(c) for landing. 15. Section 23.65 is revised to read as follows: §23.65 Climb: all engines operating. (a) Each normal, utility, and acrobatic category reciprocating engine-powered airplane of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight must have a steady climb gradient at sea level of at least 8.3 percent for landplanes or 6.7 percent for seaplanes and amphibians with_
