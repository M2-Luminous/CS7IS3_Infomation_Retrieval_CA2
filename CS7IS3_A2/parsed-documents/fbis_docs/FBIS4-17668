Such a system is characterized by the existence of a political center, with ultraright and ultraleft oppositions. A political center is usually formed by social-democratic, liberal, and conservative parties and movements; the leftist opposition by communists; and the right is represented by neofascists. The stability of this system, and thereby the integrity of the political basis of the state, is entirely dependent on the centrist parties which form the bodies of power. When the centrist parties weakened in Italy during the 1970's, ultraleft "red brigades" unleashed their terror. In contrast, the ruling right-centrist coalition in modern France set a reliable barrier to the ultraright National Front headed by the notorious Le Pen. Preliminary results of the legislative elections in Ukraine show a relative weakness of the center. The Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR] (Kuchma-Hrynoyv bloc) can be called a centrist one. "Pure" MBR members will receive no more than 20 seats. We can expect that 30-40 "independent" deputies will join them. The second part of the center is represented by the party of power. Their number of seats varies from 60 to 70, with an additional 20-30 "independent" lawyers, economists, and entrepreneurs. Therefore, the center is amorphous and resembles "a bog" more than the basis of our state's legislature. To the right of center there is the national-democratic bloc, of which Rukh is the leader, having 28 "pure" Rukh deputies and around 10 Rukh-sympathizers. Uniting with representatives of various parties, the national democrats will likely establish the so-called Supreme Council 2, with 60-70 deputies. The ultraright Ukrainian National Assembly and Ukrainian National Self-Defense and Khmara's Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party won five seats, and will hardly pull any strings in the legislature. The ultraleft -- communists, who won 86 seats -- are dangerous. Closer to the center are socialists (14 seats) and "agrarians" (18 seats). Slogans advocating the restoration of the USSR, which characterized election campaigns by communists in Donbass, question the "system" character -- respect for the fundamental basis, first and foremost, of our statehood -- of the revived Communist Party of Ukraine. With what will the new legislature begin? With elections of its speaker, his deputies, and committee chairmen, because no force has a majority, "independent" Ivan Stepanovich Plyushch has a chance of becoming twofold champion in the legislative game. Communists will likely head up to two-thirds of the commissions and bear no responsibility for the formation of the government, which will likely remain unchanged, or change only slightly, pending the upcoming presidential elections. The key issue is presidential elections. Leonid Makarovich has a weak lobby (a little over 10 presidential representatives have been elected deputies). In addition, some presidential agencies, having erroneously forecasted the nonelection of the required number of deputies -- which is sufficient for the normal work of the legislature -- have rendered clumsy assistance to the president, who was only once doubtful of the possibility of electing a legislature. Currently, simply out of a spirit of defiance, many deputies will not fail to remember all this. However, external influences can work in favor of a possible subjective presidential wish to "postpone" elections. First, many potential candidates will wait for the beginning of the elections. A month and a half is not sufficient time to conduct a campaign (the legislature will begin its work on 10-15 May, while presidential elections are scheduled for 26 June). Secondly, the voting could be postponed until fall because the Rukh and other parties are not ready for the elections. This unreadiness will be masked by truly necessary constitutional changes to specify the powers of a newly elected head of the state. In addition, communists, who favor the liquidation of the post of president, will also play their part here. In addition, though Ivan Stepanovich favors the holding of timely elections, he cannot but consider the opinion of his supporters from the local soviets, who wish to shift the elections to prolong their existence and "resolve" issues of ownership. Leonid Kuchma, who ranks first in popularity polls, could always oppose the shifting of elections, but he will hardly have majority support among the new legislators. Given the legislative and presidential elections, we have forgotten about the election campaign for local representative organs. The battle will hardly be any easier because control over property remains the key issue. I would like to hope that a new legislature will have enough willpower to change the past legislature's decision and limit direct elections for the heads of local administrations in towns, villages, and settlements, thereby leaving only the opportunity to nominate executive heads in rayons and oblasts. Otherwise, Ukraine will face the danger of irreversible decentralization. However, the leftist bloc (more than a third of all deputies) will hardly assist in preventing the soviets' next round of attacks. Finally, Ukrainian membership in the CIS economic union can become a key issue in the new legislature. The MBR members (potential partners of the national democrats in domestic economic reforms) could unite with communists and socialists. It is easy to foresee that many lances will be broken over the CIS economic union, which has value on paper rather than in reality.
