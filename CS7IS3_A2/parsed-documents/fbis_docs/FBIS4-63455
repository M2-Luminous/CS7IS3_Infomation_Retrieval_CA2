FBIS4-63455 "drsov099_e_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-099 Daily Report 21 May 1994 UKRAINE International Affairs Senior Aide Attacks Yeltsin Warning To Kravchuk Senior Aide Attacks Yeltsin Warning To Kravchuk LD2105193194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1737 GMT 21 May 94 LD2105193194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] A senior source in the Ukrainian president's staff has criticized Russian President Boris Yeltsin's comments on a telephone conversation he had on Friday with his Ukrainian counterpart, Leonid Kravchuk. The comments, made in a television interview, "do not reflect the real content of the conversation," the source told INTERFAX-Ukraine. He said Yeltsin's words that "the main thing is that neither Ukraine nor Russia should interfere in Crimean affairs" were "surprising." They suggested that Russia, in its relationship with Crimea, would like to have the same status as Ukraine, of which Crimea is part. As for Yeltsin's statement that Ukraine must not use force against Crimea, the source said, "Ukraine is an independent state, and the methods it uses to solve its internal problems depend solely on the will of its people and parliament. Undoubtedly those methods would meet the Constitution and laws of Ukraine. Ukraine has observed and does observe international legal standards." "What was also surprising was the rhetoric of the Russian president, who was speaking about the Ukrainian president in a disrespectful and admonishing manner," the source continued. "The statement of the president of the Russian Federation would be much more constructive if he appealed to the separatists in the Republic of Crimea not to put in jeopardy peace in the region," the source summed up.
