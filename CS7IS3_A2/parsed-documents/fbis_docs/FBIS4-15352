This is the ninth session in the history of the Commconwealth, but it is the first time that it has been possible to gather together the full complement. In an interview with IZVESTIYA Russia's reprsentative, Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, indicated that the 100-percent quorum is evidence of the "partners' maturity" in realizing the importance of jointly guarding the CIS' external borders. The council participants cited the fact that a political concept is needed for cooperation in this field. Regardless of whether the Commonwealth is reorganized into a Eurasian Union in the future, border guards must have a clear system of mutual commitments in order to ensure the security of the whole area. The possibility of each CIS member unilaterally introducing relaxed entry visa procedures for other states' citizens is precluded. Until now border guards have cooperated on a bilateral footing. But in the future the intention is to sign regional agreements. Russia, Armenia, and Georgia and Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan are preparing to sign such agreements. Steps are being taken to further strengthen the Tajik-Afghan border with the participation of five Commonwealth states. Ukraine and Moldavia [Moldova] have expressed a desire to join in the common work for the first time. Admittedly, Ukrainian representative Valeriy Gubenko did not wait for the council to completely finish its work before leaving for home "on official business." Viktor Chernomyrdin received the generals and asked them to step up vigilance on the borders in order to protect Russia and the other Commonwealth countries from wholesale misfortune -- the incursion of illegals from Asia and Africa. The premier promised on the government's behalf to afford every assistance in providing external borders with equipment. It was decided to man on the "ethnic principle" outposts where Russian border guards have hitherto mainly served. New recruits will swear loyalty to their independent homeland and at the same time swear a "solemn vow" to Russia. Russian officers will keep their role as military advisers and technical experts. The recommendations made by the council of commanders will be presented to the meeting of CIS heads of state and government, which is due to start work in Moscow 14 April.
