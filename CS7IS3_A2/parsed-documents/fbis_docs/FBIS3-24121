Our Industry Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow"] [Text] The past year added many bitter pages to Georgia's history. This must not happen this year. Whatever it takes, we must restore our economy to health and turn people back to the economy. This is the aim of the head of state's 18 December 1993 edict directing the various ministries, state committees, departments, concerns, and other structures to work out programs and plans to be activated in their departments and systems in order to solve the crisis and restore stability. What is the republic's industry doing in this regard? It is, after all, a key sector of the nation's economy, accounting for a third of our national income and over half of the gross social product. The Industry Ministry today supervises mining and metallurgy, chemicals, machine-building, light industry, lumber and woodworking, the medical industry, and other multisector complexes, and takes part in formulating and implementing unified policies to develop them. It must play a crucial role in inplementing programs to solve the country's crisis and restore stability. That is the subject of this article. The social-economic processes taking place in industry today show that the sector is firmly on its way to market relations in the economy. Still, the results of the activity show that the transition is proceeding painfully under difficult political and economic conditions. Output is falling, and hyperinflation is rampant. Like the other economic sectors, industry is in a deep crisis. Even year before last (to say nothing of 1992 [as published]), production volume declined precipitously. The causes are many, but the main ones have been the country's political instability, banditry and lack of roads, the breakdown of money and credit relations, and the breaking of traditional economic ties. Due to the inefficiency of our customs service, stocks of hides, wool, timber, and other essential raw materials are being taken out of the country. The sector suffers from acute shortages of fuel, electricity, supplies and raw materials, so that a big part of our industrial potential is out of circulation (and resulting losses add up to tens of billions). In addition, privatization has been hampered while the state sector is not functioning well. For the past three years, industry has been operating by inertia, without any advance plans or programs, thus creating an atmosphere of irresponsibility and laxity. Unsound policies have generated certain difficulties between production and the ministries and left their mark on the whole economy. Unfortunately, some high officials are still acting that way. Over the years, enterprises under all-Union jurisdiction went unsupervised. The lack of state orders has forced them to lay off mass numbers of engineering-technical personnel and specialists. Through disuse, many installations have broken down, and much equipment has been sold off improperly. In addition, privatization has often been carried out illogically and harmfully. We could go on listing the objective and subjective causes of industry's failures, but the Ministry cannot afford a policy of whining and blaming others. Sad to say, the crisis has reached the pathetic stage; there is no room to retreat. What we need now is in-depth analysis, measures to correct mistakes and find our proper way--especially now that we have Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze's edict "On a Program To Overcome the Crisis and Restore Stability" to guide us. The ministry is doing intensive, fruitful work in this regard. We are encouraged not only by our economic potential and irreversible reform processes but also by vitally important changes due to the restoration of traditional ties with former Soviet republics in all industrial sectors. We are also encouraged by contacts with other foreign countries. The first steps have been taken in this regard. We have signed documents with the Russian Federation's Military Industry Committee and Machine-Building Committee, also an agreement with its Metallurgy Committee and with the appropriate departments of other republics. We have an intergovernmental agreement in the military industry sector (on technical-economic, scientific, and cooperative relations) which exempts organizations in this sphere from all quota-allocation [Russian kvotirovaniye], licensing, and customs fees. The ministry is firmly on its way to a market economy. We are doing everything we can to create the organizational and program base to implement radical reforms as quickly as possible. For this purpose we have set up an actively functioning Reform Headquarters. Our task is: --to achieve a certain level of balance and regulation in sectors of industry; --to stabilize the production level of traditional products and to turn out world-standard, advanced products on the basis of structural transformations of the economy; --to organize the production of strategically-important goods, to diminish state influence on other sectors and enterprises, and to privatize them in an expedient and timely manner; --to foster the development of promising programs of industry in all approved and lawful forms and give the green light to market structures; --to enhance the competitiveness of leading industrial sectors and, on this basis, put them into the orbit of world markets and integrative processes; --to make optimal use of the country's geopolitical factor, adopt leading foreign and domestic technologies, effectively exploit local resources, and meet the demands of the domestic market. Industry cannot develop properly unless regulating parameters are made part of production management. This refers to indicative planning and other market mechanisms which have considerable mobilizing power. Soon we will have a specific-action, integrated inter-departmental and intersectorial program and comprehensive plans to be created jointly with the Saknavtobi, Sakenergo, and Sakgazi departments. For the first time in recent years, the ministry, enterprises, and organizations have jointly worked out a specific-action program (for 1994) designed to halt production decline and take comprehensive measures to stabilize production. It is not a plan imposed from above but a program conceived by the enterprises themselves to generate optimism and exert mobilizing power. We think the republic's industry can double its output over the 1993 level, which will be reflected in the overall end results, especially increased contributions to the budget. This alone, however, is not enough to achieve a real turnaround in the economy, which cannot be done solely with present resources and reserves. We need to attract foreign investment, which requires a favorable political and economic atmosphere and real, concrete efforts to interest investors. During the time of transition to the market, when many enterprises face the threat of bankruptcy, it is the ministry's crucial task to look realistically at their prospects in boosting the republic's economy. We want to set up an investment fund for industrial reconstruction and development--that is, a strategic transformation fund designed first to stabilize the work and then to foster accelerated development of priority directions. We are pursuing a vigorous policy of structural transformations. The ministry (whose apparatus includes 16 scientists) is working to perfect industrial sectors in accordance with their existing situation and prospects. I have in mind the enterprises' technical base and their cadres' ability to turn out high-quality, competitive goods, prospects of supplies of raw materials and manufactured components, anticipating sales and market conditions and meeting domestic market demands, and ecological, social and other factors. Still, our main problem this year is to speed up privatization. A state privatization program is being formulated and implemented, which calls for the phased privatization of systems, enterprises and organizations in three main directions: converting a certain number of state enterprises into stock companies; buying out leased property for collective ownership; and selling enterprises by competition or auction. The ministry is involved in the work of privatization commissions; it examines and approves privatization plans and monitors their implementation. True, joint-stock company formation is proceeding slowly, but that cannot be blamed on the ministry's position. In fact, the ministry is encouraging effective privatization and joint-stock company formation efforts. We are convinced that the prime task is to convert inefficient state properties into efficient private properties. This will result, of course, in a diminution of the state's role in management. It does not, however, entail any corresponding weakening of state control. Transition to the new structure must be made in a way that preserves the production potential. This is what is most vital and important now. Probably, moreover, the laws and statutes on privatization need to be overhauled. We think, for example, that we need to make a timely decision on procedures for distributing funds generated by privatization. These funds must be used to remodel and develop fixed assets at the ministry's disposal which are not subject to privatization. Otherwise it will be too hard, given the unprecedented budget deficit, to assure the necessary investments in the economy. We think this approach is a realistic way to get out of the crisis. Privatization must not result in the loss of our accumulated industrial and scientific potential. The state privatization program will create a new stage in the republic's economy. It will certainly result in shaping subjects adapted to the market environment, and in addition to boosting economic activity they will take responsibility for the end results. Naturally, the ministry's organizational activity will take on new content and should be reflected in overall efforts to boost the economy. In addition, the ministry is paying close attention to the care of defense industry factories and problems of their conversion. We are trying to activate research institutes in the sector and supply the Georgian army's military equipment needs by means of technical cooperation with the enterprises. It is gratifying to note that the UN's Industrial Organization has complied with our ministry's request and has allocated 150,000 dollars for the development of operating enterprises. Investment brochures for every sector in the system have been developed and published in English for foreign partners, giving specific proposals. Relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran are being developed. Preliminary talks on future cooperation have been held with business representatives of Australia, Austria, Germany, Ethiopia, Turkey, Italy, and a number of other countries. Another thing. In order to assure radical reforms in industrial management, the implementation of the country's accelerated socio-economic development, appropriate activation of commodity-money relations, and major strengthening of the role of credit and money circulation, we think it is advisable to create a specialized state commercial bank for industrial reconstruction and development. We are also counting on the International Machine-Building Bank that is now being formed (our Ministry is one of its founders). It will take care of clearings between countries and do much to foster economic ties with foreign countries. Hence, the problems of industry are not the concern of the Ministry alone, although under the right conditions it can take the lead role in the national economy. Indeed, industry's priority in solving the country's most important tasks is unlimited, and we hope our ministry, through joint efforts, can successfuly cope with the tasks it faces.
