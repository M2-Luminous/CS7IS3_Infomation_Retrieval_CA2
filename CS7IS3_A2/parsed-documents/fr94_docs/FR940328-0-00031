FR940328-0-00031 FR940328-0-00012 Rollandia crispa , a member of the bellflower family, is an unbranched shrub with leaves clustered at the ends of succulent stems. The broad oval leaves, 12 to 30 in (30 to 75 cm) long and 3.5 to 6.3 in (9 to 16 cm) wide, have undulating, smooth or toothed leaf margins. Each leaf is on a stalk 0.3 to 1.6 in (0.8 to 4 cm) long. Clusters of three to eight fuzzy flowers grow on stalks 0.8 to 1.2 in (2 to 3 cm) long, with each flower borne on a stalk 0.4 to 0.8 in (1 to 2 cm) long. The calyx lobes are oval or oblong, 0.2 to 0.5 in (6 to 12 mm) long, and often overlapping at their base. The fused petals, 1.6 to 2.4 in (4 to 6 cm) long and fuzzy, are pale magenta with darker longitudinal stripes. The fruits are spherical berries 0.4 in (1 cm) in diameter, that contain many minute, dark seeds. Rollandia crispa is distinguished from other species in this endemic Hawaiian genus by its leaf shape, distinct calyx lobes, and the length of the flowers and stalks of flower clusters (de Candolle 1839, Hillebrand 1888, Lammers 1990, Rock 1919, Wawra 1873). Historically, Rollandia crispa was known from scattered locations throughout the upper elevations of the Koolau Mountains of Oahu from Kaipapau Valley to the north to Waialae Iki Ridge to the southeast (HHP 1991j1 to 1991j15, 1991j17 to 1991j19; Skottsberg 1926). This species is now known from State and private lands in Hidden Valley (26 plants), Palolo Valley (1 plant), Kapakahi Gulch (1 plant), and Pia Valley (1 plant) (HHP 1991j8, 1991j16, 1991j17; HPCC 1990c; Lammers 1990; D. Herbst, J. Obata, K. Nagata, B.P. Bishop Museum, S. Perlman, pers. comms., 1991; L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). The four populations are scattered over a distance of about 19 mi (31 km). Three of the populations contain a single, mature, flowering individual. The other population (Hidden Valley) contains 7 mature, flowering plants and 19 juvenile plants, giving a total of fewer than 30 individuals for the entire species. Rollandia crispa is found in habitats ranging from steep, open mesic forests to gentle slopes or moist gullies of closed wet forests, at elevations between 600 and 2,400 ft (185 and 730 m) (HHP 1991j2, 1991j5, 1991j8, 1991j9, 1991j12, 1991j13, 1991j16; HPCC 1990c). Associated plant taxa include ke'oke'o, Cyanea acuminata (haha), Microsorum spectrum (NCN), common Cyrtandra species, Pisonia, Touchardia latifolia (olona), and the introduced strawberry guava, 'awa, kukui, and Cordyline fruticosa (ti) (HHP 1991j8, 1991j16; J. Obata, pers. comm., 1991; L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). The major threats to R. crispa are habitat alteration and predation by feral pigs, competition with noxious alien plant taxa (Koster's curse and strawberry guava), and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of remaining individuals, their limited gene pool, and restricted distribution.
