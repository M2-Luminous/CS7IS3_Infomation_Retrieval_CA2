At the same time, the Pentagon admitted and confirmed that it trained military leaders from Latin American countries, which were later charged with violating human rights in their respective countries. Regarding this, sources from President Clinton's own administration have confirmed that the review the Pentagon refers to began after it was reported that 45 Army officers from neighboring El Salvador, who were trained in the United States, have been implicated in the massacre of unarmed civilians in El Salvador during the 1980's. This has been confirmed in a report by a special UN commission, appointed to investigate this, and recently delivered to the amazement of the peoples the world over. The special UN report revealed in detail who and how six Jesuits were murdered in a San Salvador university, clearly establishing the Salvadoran Army's responsibility in this crime, which shook the world at the time. What is most ironic in all this is that the Salvadoran military members were trained in the School of Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia, United States, not to kill priests, but to defend democracy and human rights in their country and in Latin America. The review the Pentagon refers to is to determine which countries are to receive U.S. military and police training and equipment. The situation taking place in the United States is of such a nature that many of the human rights defense groups in that country are pressuring President Clinton to change its programs for International Education and Training and for Foreign Military Financing, created to encourage stability, democracy, and respect for human rights in U.S. allied countries and especially in our Latin American countries. There is awareness in the United States that money from "gringo" tax payers has been used in the name of the defense of democracy and respect for human rights, precisely to violate those rights in the countries from which these soldiers came, and were educated, taught, and trained in U.S. military schools. In the name of human rights and using democracy as a pretext, savagery has been committed in Latin America against the civilian population, and this continues. One can very well say that in a certain way the United States has much to blame with what has taken place with regard to human rights, which still continues to happen in our countries.
