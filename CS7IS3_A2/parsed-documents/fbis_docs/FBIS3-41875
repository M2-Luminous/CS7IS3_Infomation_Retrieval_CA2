The federal minister informed the prime minister that the manner in which the 300-megawatt nuclear power plant's monitoring system is being constructed is certainly unsafe, and it may cause a Chernobyl-type situation. The minister told the prime minister that some changes were made in this nuclear power project during the rule of former Prime Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, and that the project is now being built on the basis of [words indistinct] instead of ``manufacturing.'' No Pakistani engineers have been involved in the construction of the project, and none of the 2,800 unskilled workers working on the project is Pakistani. The federal minister also informed the prime minister that Japan and the European countries have declined to provide a reliable monitoring system for this 300-megawatt nuclear power plant. Under these circumstances, the monitoring system will have to be built locally. In this manner, the Chashma plant will be used as a laboratory to develop this monitoring system for the first time. This will be very dangerous and may create a situation similar to the one witnessed at the Chernobyl nuclear plant.
