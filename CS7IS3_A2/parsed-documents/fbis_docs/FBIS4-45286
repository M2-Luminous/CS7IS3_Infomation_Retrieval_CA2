Sanchez Belisle] [Text] Banking confidentiality in Panama "should be redefined" to avoid the legitimate right to privacy from being used as a means to protect the laundering of money from drug trafficking, Olegario Barrelier, president of the Panamanian Banking Association, has told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA. "As part of the services banks offer to honest local and foreign customers, banking confidentiality should be redefined in explaining the rights banks, their employees, former employees, the National Banking Commission, and other authorities should have," Barrelier has said. He has said the National Banking Association will present specific proposals to the national government "when appropriate." According to Barrelier, total banking secrecy in Panama, as in other countries, "does not exist." The banker has said: "We would rather say there is banking confidentiality," and he has said the legal provision on this issue "is a part of the legitimate right to privacy an individual has regarding his home, mail, telephone communications, assets, and businesses." According to Barrelier, the proposals at the international level, particularly those coming from the United States, advocate a limitation on bank secrecy in nations "attempt to avoid" individuals or companies linked to drug trafficking that use banking services "to camouflage," through banking confidentiality, the illegal nature of their revenues. Although the Panamanian Government has taken significant measures to avoid the dishonest use of banking services, the Panamanian Banking Association "has a great willingness to continue cooperating in the struggle against money laundering," Barrelier has said.
