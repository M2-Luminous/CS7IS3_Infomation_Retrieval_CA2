Jordanian Foreign Ministry sources stressed that these contacts have begun with the visits to Jordan by the foreign ministers of Qatar, Syria, Egypt, and Palestine. The sources said that these contacts will resume next week when the Omani foreign minister visits Jordan on Saturday [8 January]. The Foreign Ministry sources said that these political Arab moves constitute a translation of the official and popular stands of Jordan, which feels that coordinating Arab stands and achieving Arab solidarity constitutes the first step toward the Arabs' entry into the modern age as an influential political and economic force. The sources noted that Qatar and Oman are currently seeking to expand their political activities to hold a summit that will be the most important and prominent Arab summit, especially since it will put an end to fragmentation and estrangement and achieve Arab unity and solidarity.
