FR940428-1-00032 FR940428-1-00008 The current rule at §222.7(a)(4) allows an authorized officer to withdraw recognition of an association if it does not hold an annual or special meeting during a 24-month period. However, if an association does not meet at least once a year, the organization cannot effectively assist in the management of allotment(s), which is the purpose of the Forest Service cooperating with the association. Therefore, the proposed rule at §222.15(c) would require an association or district to meet at least once every 12 months. Failure to meet at least annually would be grounds for withdrawal of recognition. The proposed rule further clarifies that the loss of recognition would result in cancellation of the grazing permit to the association or district. Proposed Section 222.16_Cooperation with National, State, and County Livestock Organizations and Others This section of the proposed rule encourages Forest Service officials to cooperate with national, state, and county livestock organizations, other agencies, institutions, organizations, and individuals having an interest in the protection and management of the rangeland resources on National Forest system and private lands. The proposed rule is very similar to information in the current rule found in §222.7(b), (c), and (d), and §222.8. The text of these sections of the current rule has been edited for clarity and consolidated into a revised section of the proposed rule at §222.16. Additionally, §222.11 of the current regulation, providing direction for the establishment and operation of grazing advisory boards would be removed, as the statutory authority mandating such boards has expired. In addition to editorial changes for clarity, proposed §222.16(b) would make clear that cooperation with other agencies and units of government is subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Also, the word ``farm'' would be eliminated from the term ``noxious farm weeds'' in proposed §222.16(b) (1) and (2) to broaden the term to include undesirable plant species which may occur on rangelands or farm (cultivated) lands. Animal damage management is added to paragraph (b)(3) as a specific activity in addition to surveillance of pesticide programs for which the Forest Service cooperates with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The authority for Grazing Advisory Boards, established under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, expired December 31, 1985. Thus, the current regulations at §222.11 concerning Grazing Advisory Boards are obsolete and need to be removed. However, the proposed rule at §222.16(d) would note that the Secretary has the authority, under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 1), and the implementing regulation at 41 CFR part 101&hyph;6.10, and the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2281, et seq.), to establish advisory boards reflecting a variety of points of view and resource interests to advise the Forest Service on management of the resources of the National Forest System including forage production. Other Considerations In addition to the changes noted in the preceding section-by-section discussion of the proposed rule, gender specific references have been identified throughout the current rule and eliminated. Also, wherever possible, the language_but not the intended meaning_of the existing rule has been revised for clarity and ease of reading; for example, text written in passive voice has been rewritten in active voice whenever possible. In addition, the organization and arrangement of the sections of the rule have been revised for easier use by permit holders, agency personnel, and other readers. Publication of the final rule will require concurrent modifications in the standard conditions and clauses of grazing permit forms. Public comment on this proposed rule, is invited and will be considered in adoption of the final rule. Due to the great volume of comments anticipated on this proposed rule the Department requests that reviewers identify the specific section and paragraph label for the regulatory text on which they are commenting. Specific statements of what regulatory text the reviewer feels should be modified, and the reasons for the recommended changes, are encouraged. By separate rulemaking, the Department also will propose a revision in the system used to determine the fees for grazing livestock on National Forest System lands in the Western States.
