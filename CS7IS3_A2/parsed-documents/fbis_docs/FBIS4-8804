FBIS4-8804 "dreeu074_b_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-074 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 BULGARIA Zhelev Spokesman Cited on UN Convoy Passage Zhelev Spokesman Cited on UN Convoy Passage AU1504174594 Sofia Khorizont Radio Network in Bulgarian 1600 GMT 15 Apr 94 AU1504174594 Sofia Khorizont Radio Network Bulgarian BFN [Text] The decision of the National Assembly to allow the passage of the UN convoy to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] prompted the following statement of Valentin Stoyanov, spokesman for the president of the Republic: [Begin Stoyanov recording] In connection with the numerous queries as to whether there is a change in Bulgaria's position toward the conflict in former Yugoslavia I must state the following: The president of the Republic of Bulgaria supports the decision of the National Assembly to allow a one-time transshipment of UN property and equipment through our territory for the Blue Helmets in the independent and sovereign Republic of Macedonia. It is well-known that our country has good-neighborly relations with Macedonia, which is not a participant in the military conflict. This is a prudent decision that conforms to Bulgaria's national interests and the measures for security in the Balkans and to ending the war in former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria supports the efforts of the United Nations, NATO, and the European Union to settle the conflict peacefully and establish peace in the Balkans. The decision of the National Assembly does not contradict the basic principles of Bulgaria's Balkan policy, to which our country has firmly adhered since the beginning of the war, according to which Bulgaria, as a neighboring country, should not commit itself in any manner in the conflict. Bulgaria insisted and continues to insist that all Balkan countries, Yugoslavia's neighbors, strictly adhere to this principle. Therefore Bulgaria opposes sending Blue Helmets from Turkey or any other Balkan on neighboring country of former Yugoslavia. This is the essence of the special message that President Zhelev sent one month ago to Butrus-Ghali, UN general secretary. The equipment the United Nations sends to the Blue Helmets in Macedonia has a preventive and deterrent purpose. It is a barrier against the eventual spread of the conflict in the direction of Macedonia. This corresponds to our national interests, because Macedonia's security means security for Bulgaria. As far as the party games and speculations are concerned about some corridor through which Turkish Blue Helmets will pass through Bulgaria, I am authorized to state most categorically that no one has requested or discussed such a possibility. No such commitment has been assumed. [end recording]
