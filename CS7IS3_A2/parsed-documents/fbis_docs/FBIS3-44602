The tenth part, which lasts for 50 minutes, is entitled: "Splashing Water Amid the Stream," and focuses on Mao's passion for swimming. After video shows an on-screen prologue read by an unidentified narrator: "Mao Zedong said: It was rather comfortable to swim at Beidaihe during a grade-seven typhoon...." the documentary begins with historical footage of Mao swimming at Beidaihe beach, in the Chang Jiang, and at Shisanling Dam during the last two decades of his life; as well as his last recorded swim in a Changsha indoor swimming poor in 1974 at the age of 81. As the video shows shots of places associated with Mao's sporting activities, the narrator recounts his endeavor to improve his physique and temper his will through rigorous training, and notes that swimming and mountaineering were Mao's two main hobbies. The narrator adds that while climbing mountains, Mao never made detours and always blazed a new path whenever he encountered a dead end. As video shows places where Mao used to swim, the video cuts to show interviews with Mao's bodyguards, nurses, doctors, and his daughter Li Na, reminiscing about Mao's preference for swimming in large rivers and lakes over small ones, to long distances over sprints, and rapids over still water; and noting that when he swam he never did a specific stroke -- he simply swam "free style" as he pleased. While the video continues to show footage of places and events associated with Mao, the narrator explains: Mao's approach toward swimming fully reflected his indomitable spirit to conquer nature. He once expressed a wish to swim in the Mississippi and the Ganges. As a sportsman and romantic poet, Mao often composed poems after swimming. Deeply concerned about floods along the Chang Jiang, Mao inspected the Three Gorges time and again in a bid to find a way to tame the river. His dream finally came true when the Fifth Session of the Seventh National People's Congress approved the Three Gorges Project in April 1992. As the video shows historical footage of Khrushchev's "secret visit" to China in July 1958, the narrator recalls an episode: After turning down the Soviet proposal to establish a joint fleet during a rigorous debate one morning, Mao invited Khrushchev to his swimming pool in Zhongnanhai to conduct the afternoon session. When Mao and Khrushchev showed up at the pool, Chinese and Soviet officials present were stunned at Mao's casual attire, a pair of swimming trunks, and his superb swimming skills. The narrator continues: Mao disliked being bossed around, and that was one of his invaluable assets which transcended into a dauntless spirit in the face of stormy waves. While the video continues to show historical footage of related events, the narrator says: "From the late fifties to the early sixties, China encountered one upheaval after another on both the domestic and international fronts: The deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations, armed rebellion staged by separatists in Tibet, the Taiwan Strait crisis, Sino-Indian border conflicts, and an anti- Chinese wave abroad. In the wake of such setbacks, especially the natural disasters following the blunder of the Great Leap Forward, Mao exhorted the Chinese people to foster the spirit of fearing no devils. Thus, fearlessness against devils became the slogan for Chinese people to tide over difficulties at home and abroad. In 1962 the Sino-Soviet polemics began. Consequently, Soviet experts were withdrawn from China, contracts were scrapped, and Soviet-aided construction projects were suspended. However, Mao never panicked; he told Soviet comrades that in spite of the war of words with the Soviet Union, life would go on as usual in China. As the video shows historical footage of a party in which close shots are seen of Mao, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhu De each dancing with a female partner, the narrator cites American journalist Anna Louis Armstrong's observation during her stay in Yanan: "Zhou Enlai's waltz was first rate, Liu Shaoqi's steps were as accurate as numbers, and Zhu De danced with the strides of the Long March; Mao Zedong danced to the tune of his own rhythm." The narrator adds: Therefore, unlike ordinary people who like to swim in still water, Mao had a passion for splashing in the rapids. While video shows historical footage and interviews with people concerned, the narrator recounts the events leading to the start of the Cultural Revolution: In June 1966, Mao stayed for 10 days at a resort in Shaoshan, doing nothing but reading, writing, and swimming. Shortly afterwards, in Wuchang on 16 July, he plunged into the Chang Jiang and swam 15 kilometers in 65 minutes at the advanced age of 73. Big crowds of people along the river cheered him and shouted: "Long live the chairman," and he responded with "Long live the people." The Chinese media gave exceptional, extensive coverage to Mao's latest swim in the Chang Jiang. As the video cuts to show historical footage of Mao waving to the sea of Red Guards during parades in Tiananmen Square, the narrator says: "In the brief period of 33 days after the swim, Mao, waving an army hat, stood on the rostrum atop Tiananmen Gate. The blue sea was turned into a red sea. Mao Zedong could not have dreamt the red sea he stirred up would last a decade." At 1300 GMT, the documentary concludes by showing historical footage of Mao walking, talking, and swimming to stress the carefree nature of his personality.
