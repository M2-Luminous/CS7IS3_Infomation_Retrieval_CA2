Fuad Akhundov, a presidential spokesman contacted by AFP, said that the explosion was caused by a delayed-action bomb. The blast ripped through two coaches of a train in the January 20 subway station, the Azerbaijani news agency ASSA-IRADA said. First the head wagon, then the second exploded, both being engulfed by fire, it said. "According to all probabilities, it was the Armenians," Akhundov said. Azerbaijani troops have been fighting a six-year war against Armenian separatists from Nagorno-Karabakh, a territory populated mostly by Armenians but controlled by Baku. More than 20,000 people have been killed in the fighting since 1988 and the Armenians were widely seen in Baku as likely perpetrators of any bombing. However, no explosive device had been discovered by Saturday evening to back the bomb thesis. A local journalist reached by phone said that about 100 wounded people were evacuated from the station which was closed by police shortly after the blast. Tensions have been running high in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, in recent weeks after security forces began a crackdown against opposition forces supporting exiled former president Abulfaz Elchibey. Several members of the Popular Front headed by Elchibey have been arrested and police have staged raids on the headquarters of the opposition party. After the blast Saturday, Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev called an emergency meeting of internal security officials, but the outcome of the meeting was not immediately known. The explosion occurred around 1:00 p.m. (0800 GMT) in the subway station located in the northern district of the city and named "January 20" after the 1990 crackdown in Azerbaijan by Soviet troops. At least 170 people died in the crackdown ordered by Moscow to quash weeks of violence between Armenians and Azeris in the northern suburb of Sumgait. A diplomat in Baku said the number of casualties was probably increased by the fact that people were out in force to go shopping ahead of the new year celebrations Monday (as calculated by the old, pre-Islamic calendar). Another explosion took place a month ago on a train coming into Azerbaijan from Russia, without causing any casualties. Responsibility for the explosion was not established.
