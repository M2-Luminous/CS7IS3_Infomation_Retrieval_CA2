Khergamvala: "A Black Mark Against Indian Foreign Policy"] [Text] Manama (Bahrain), May 10. Mrs. Hillary Clinton, wife of the U.S. President, has described the events in South Africa today as the greatest day of the 20th century. Few would disagree with that, but among those few are the Indian political leadership, including the Opposition. Otherwise, considering every foreign policy denominator, India should have been represented in Pretoria at the highest political level from each party. The Vice President, Mr. K.R. Narayanan, is no doubt high ranking in the Indian order, but on the world scale the post of an Indian Vice President does not count. Not for this event in any case. By any yardstick, the presence of over a million Indians in South Africa, India's historical leadership in the fight against apartheid, future economic and political interests in the Indian Ocean region with a major power and purely from the point of national sentiment should have compelled the top Indian leadership to be present in Pretoria, irrespective of whether it is close to a working visit to the U.S. This is a sentiment very widely shared among senior Indian diplomats. Without exception, it is their view that Rajiv Gandhi would have certainly not missed the moment. Those who pretend to swear by his ideals certainly have missed the opportunity of shaking the hand of one of the greatest men of this century during his finest hour. Pakistan, Portugal, Ireland, to name a few, have hardly any ties or a historical record to speak of with South Africa, compared with that of India. But they are all there either represented by the President or the Prime Minister. One commentator perhaps diagnosed the malaise accurately. He felt that beyond the U.S. and Pakistan nothing ever makes this leadership sit up and grab an opportunity. The fundamental moorings of Indian foreign policy are being taken apart, root by root. Despite all the noise against Islamabad, any objective Indian observer must hand it to Pakistan that it seldom loses an opportunity to make its point. The Commonwealth summit in Limassol was a case in point, where Ms. Benazir Bhutto rushed there immediately after her inauguration with New Delhi left making excuses. Dr. Fidel Castro, Mr. Yasser Arafat, Dr. Robert Mugabe, all cause celebre of the Non-aligned Movement rubbed shoulders with the likes of an American Vice President and the country's First Lady. Even Israel's President was there, a true indication of how countries can dexterously indicate recognition of new interests. It is something to be noted that of all countries that are touchy or sensitive about foreign leaders being absent from an event being hosted, India ranks at the top. The poor attendance at the second attempt at a G-15 summit a month and half back was perhaps a good indication of how others respond to a country whose leadership is appearing increasingly insular. Spokesmen will, of course, provide all the reasons, that a warm message was carried by the Vice President, that India was suitably represented, but the fact remains that in Pretoria's record books India did not take the occasion seriously enough. New Delhi knows this very well because the Ministry of External Affairs [MEA] itself keeps a close account of which country did or did not send leaders for funerals in New Delhi. There had been some speculation among Indian officials that India's Prime Minister wished to avoid encounters with his Pakistani counterpart. It would probably more accurate to say that the age and infirmity of Indian leaders lies behind their reluctance to undertake such a historical mission. The leaders of each of India's political parties are doubtless either very old or not fit enough. Ordinarily, a strong External Affairs Minister would press the country's Prime Minister to attend such a world event. But then the quality of the political leadership in the MEA is all too well known. Correspondingly, the visit of key Opposition leaders is either initiated and organised by the External Affairs Minister or requests come in from these opposition figures that they would like to be present in an official Indian delegation at such events. A bit sarcastically, perhaps there is indeed a consensus in India among the opposition and with the ruling party. All they think of and speak about are Pakistan and the U.S. The message sent out to the Indians in South Africa and those who now govern them is not a healthy one.
