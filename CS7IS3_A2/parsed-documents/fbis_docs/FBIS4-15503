On April 6 a source in the Kremlin reported to Interfax that the wording about the creation of a military base in Latvia "is the result of an inappropriate phrase which was included into one of the documents of the Defense Ministry and then appeared in a corresponding order of the Russian president." The message of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry underlined that "unilateral actions by Russia aimed at the creation of military bases in the Latvian Republic despite the will of this sovereign state contradicts the principles of international law and international obligations taken by Russia as a member of the UN and CSCE."
