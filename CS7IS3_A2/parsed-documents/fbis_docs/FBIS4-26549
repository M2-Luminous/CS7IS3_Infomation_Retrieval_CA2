"We've covered a lot of ground. The atmosphere continues to be constructive," chief British negotiator Hugh Davies said after the second day of Sino-British Joint Liaison Group talks. He declined to give details, but Davies and Chinese counterpart Guo Fengmin promised to say "something more" when their meeting winds up on Thursday. On Friday the Joint Liaison Group's specialized airport committee is to discuss the vexed issue of how much debt to raise to pay for the 20.3 billion U.S. dollar Chek Lap Kok airport and related public works. The Joint Liaison Group is the diplomatic body charged with hammering out technical details of Hong Kong's 1997 handback to China. This week's meeting is its first in six months. In an interview with the Asian Wall Street Journal, Beijing's top official for Hong Kong affairs, Lu Ping, said China was "very flexible" on the financing issue. "Britain has been indicating that it wants to cooperate with the Chinese side on the economic front," Lu was quoted as saying. "We are waiting to see their deeds." The airport financing issue has been overshadowed since 1992 by Governor Chris Patten's pre-1997 democratic reform plans, the final stage of which is to be adopted next week by the Legislative Council. Picking up on Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's statement last week that China was willing to bury the hatchet when it comes to Patten's political reforms, Lu said: "Chris Patten is someone beyond our control." Under a 1991 agreement with Britain, China must be consulted if Hong Kong wants to raise more than five billion Hong Kong dollars (646.83 million U.S.) of airport-related debt maturing after 1997. But Lu said Beijing now was ready to accept a debt level "far about five [as received]." He did not elaborate. Hong Kong favors tapping world capital markets to help pay for Chek Lap Kok, taking advantage of the best interest rates in many years, but China dreads that too much debt will be left behind once Britain departs in 1997.
