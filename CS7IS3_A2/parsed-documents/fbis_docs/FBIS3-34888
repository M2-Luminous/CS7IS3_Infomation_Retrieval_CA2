Culture and Islamic Guidance Minister 'Ali Larijani has been appointed to replace him. It has been decided to appoint Mohammad Hashemi as the UN envoy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in place of Kamal Kharrazi, while the latter is to assume office as the Culture and Islamic Guidance minister. Mohammad Hashemi has been the head of the largest propaganda apparatus of the regime, the radio and television, for the past 12 years. During the past two years, he has been subjected to the taunts of those in the regime who have been displeased with Hashemi-Rafsanjani's policies. They have objected that the radio and television has exceeded the boundaries specified by the Islamic Republic of Iran and their activities have not conformed to Islamic criteria. Until now, the radio and television apparatus has been accused of seeking to propagate a non-Islamic culture and to induct non-Islamic personnel. In reaction to the criticism of the radio and television by the Majles deputies and individuals affiliated with what is known as the hardline faction, the Majles set up a special panel. The results of this panel's investigations mostly affirmed the views of the critics and those who were displeased with the radio's and television's performance. The ruling faction in the clerics' regime did not wish to magnify this issue and, to give the impression that it takes notice of the criticism of opponents, finally removed Mohammad Hashemi from this post. At the same time, to maintain his official status and to prove that the government had not been influenced by the views and beliefs of Hashemi-Rafsanjani's critics, he was appointed the regime's UN representative. In view of the fact that these critics had also intensified their objections against the former culture and Islamic guidance minister and had forced him to resign and that recently they did not have much to say about 'Ali Larijani, the Minister for Islamic Guidance and Culture who has taken Mohammad Hashemi's place, it indicates that the stronger faction inside the regime has taken into account the views of the people known as the hardline faction and has sought their approval. It is likely that the appointment of Mohammad Hashemi, the brother of President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, as the regime's ambassador to the United Nations may be designed to divert Western opinion about the president. The appointment of Mohammad Hashemi to the United Nations gives the impression that certain developments have taken place showing flexibility and leniency toward the West. The main question about this reshuffle of the regime's pawns is: Will the internal critics of the regime be pleased with the actions of Kamal Kharrazi, who is being considered for Islamic Guidance minister? In general, regardless of whether they conform to public interest, these changes seem to be aimed at placating the opponents and supporters of Hashemi-Rafsanjani and eliciting their concurrence in the form of a deal between the two sides, while the hardline faction considers it a kind of victory.
