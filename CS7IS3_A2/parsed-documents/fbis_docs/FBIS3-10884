In a note delivered today to the press and signed by this group of lawyers who say they represent various ideas, the group states the request was made on 24 February in a letter addressed to the ANPP deputies who on that date had served one year since the time of their election. The amnesty request includes prisoners for crimes "against state security" or for illegal departures or entries, those imprisoned for being a "menace to society," and those officials penalized while exercising their duties in office. The lawyers state that in 35 years of the revolution, there has never been an amnesty, "even though it is included in Cuban legislation." The lawyers also say many of the individuals who will probably attend the conference with the Cuban community abroad, which the government has scheduled for April, "left the island where they were born for the same reasons why the others are imprisoned today." The lawyers' letter concludes: "We are not moved by political passion or ideological stands, rather, by the purpose of helping alleviate social tensions of the fatherland with the resources of our profession and your solidarity."
