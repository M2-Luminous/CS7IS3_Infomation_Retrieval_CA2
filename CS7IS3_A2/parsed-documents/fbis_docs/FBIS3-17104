This is normal, we should not blame the Russian Bank; this is a normal agreement. If you are going to introduce the ruble, you have to become a branch. Then, the newly elected deputies will gather in the Supreme Council and will have to adopt decisions concerning their money, on [words indistinct], taxation and they will be told that this does not correspond to the interests of the Russian National Bank. This is normal. Therefore, under these conditions, the people will be allowed to elect deputies, but the deputies will not be allowed to adopt (?independent decisions). Therefore, we -- myself, the prime minister, and the National Bank chairman -- are here to stress that this is a symbol of our independence. If you hear talk about something else, this is only a deception and represents an attempt to swindle the people. I do not want to focus your attention on this particular aspect, but money, finances, and banks are symbols. When reforms begin -- well, they have already begun -- [words indistinct] in Ukraine will set up our own banking system.
