For two days, some 400 participants have been taking stock of the work done in 1993 and discussing their goals for the current year. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources faces a great deal of work. According to its head, Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, in many respects -- the discharge into the atmosphere of ozone-destroying substances and sulfur dioxide, the generation of radioactive waste -- Russia, on whose territory live only 2.5 percent of the earth's population, accounts today for a tenth of the world's amount of pollutants. It was pointed out at the conference that the uncertainty of the nature watchdogs' status sometimes led to confrontations with representatives of the other agencies in resolving ecological issues. This problem has been partially eliminated by the Russian Federation Government decree "On Specially Authorized State Organs in the Area of Environmental Protection." Currently a new decree is in the works whose draft gives Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources staffers broader rights, up to the use of punitive sanctions. There is still no unanimity, however, on the role of territorial nature protection structures. According to a departmental poll conducted by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, nearly 30 percent of territorial nature protection bodies see their functions in being only coordinators, 24 percent see themselves as coordinators and inspectors, while the majority -- 47 percent -- are prepared to become the only special nature-protection management bodies.
