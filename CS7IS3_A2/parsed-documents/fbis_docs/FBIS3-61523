Voloshko, O.V. Gavrilova, Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry Institute at Russia's Academy of Sciences and Biological Scientific Research Institute of the St. Petersburg University; UDC 574.64] [Abstract] The ability of heavy metal ions--the most common contaminants in the hydrosphere which cause numerous reactions in natural ecosystems at the cell and population level, e.g., the development of morphological anomalies in cyanobacteria and algae--to serve as environmental condition indicators and thus help resolve the issue of the mechanisms of heavy metal ions' impact on cyanobacteria and the character of their primary contact with cells prompted a study of the cyanobacteria sensitivity to the toxic effect of zinc sulfide. To this end, the Anabaena variabilis Kuetz strain CALU 787 from the collection of the St. Petersburg Biological Institute was examined due to this genus proliferation in stagnant water. The culture was grown in liquid medium No. 1 in 50 ml bulbs at a 25ï¿½C temperature with round-the-clock light at a 2,000 lx medium level. The experiment procedure is outlined. The data reveal three types of zinc ion impact on the culture growth: stimulated growth for 5 days (at 0.001 ml/g or 0.1 MPC), a prolonged lag phase after which the growth rate is the same as in the control group (at 0.01 ml/g or 1.0 MPC), and a drop in the cell density, especially in the steady-state growth phase (at 0.02-0.2 ml/g or 2-20 MPC). Both the growth inhibition and stimulation were equally treated as undesirable phenomena since any deviation from natural productivity is quite dangerous for aquatic ecosystems. The A. variabilis cell population behavior under various concentrations of zinc ions is plotted. The results confirm the A. variabilis high sensitivity to Zn ions. At zinc ion concentrations above 5.0 MPC, intensive trichome fragmentation, morphological anomalies, and irreversible ultrastructural defects of the photosynthesis apparatus were observed. A 20 MPC concentration is lethal for A. variabilis. It is speculated that the morphological anomalies under some experimental conditions are not caused by the specific effect of zinc ions, and may be used as bioindicators of the habitat.
