Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports on the situation overnight and says that "this has been one of the hardest nights since the beginning of the chetnik aggression and particularly since the outbreak of the armed rebellion organized by the Kladusa outlaw [Fikret Abdic] in the border areas of the Cazin and Velika Kladusa communes. Overnight, and particularly after 0300, the chetniks from the so-called Serbian autonomous province of Krajina used artillery to pound the wider areas of Skokovi, Pecigrad, Todorovo, and [name indistinct]. In addition to howitzers, they used multiple rocket launchers, so that the Cazin citizens are in shelters. The forces of the traitor army savagely attacked Pecigrad and Todorovo. As the attacks are still in progress we have no information on the consequences." The 206th Chivalrous Zvornik Brigade Information Service correspondent reports that "the aggressor is continuing the usual cease-fire violations. In the course of the afternoon hours until late into the night, antiaircraft machine gun and small arms provocations were registered in Sapna, Kraljevici, and Kobilici, and along the forward defense lines in the area. The aggressor used 120-mm mortars to target our positions on Skakovica and Pandurica. The chetniks are continuing their provocations in the morning hours, but our troops are not responding." Kladanj correspondent (?Muris Seho) reports that "in the course of the night, our defense lines on the southeastern part of the Kladanj front were targeted by the Romanija chetniks. The enemy mortars, Praga, and antiaircraft machine guns were particularly directed at the region of Konjevici. Ten 82-mm shells landed in the area. The chetniks from Hadzici continued small arms' provocations." The 3d Corps Press Center correspondent reports that "the chetniks must have signed the cease-fire agreement using invisible ink, because events on the fronts in the 3d Corps theater of operations cannot be described as a cease-fire. The attacks were fiercest on the Zavidovici front, where the attacks began with the pounding of our defense lines in Hajdarevici and Imamovici. An infantry attack followed. Antiaircraft and small arms' provocations were registered on the Doboj and Teslic fronts. The rapid passage of buses and trucks on the Doboj-Pridjel-Preslica route is proof that they are preparing to launch fresh attacks in this area. The situation was similar on the (?Seric) front. Our troops are not responding to the provocations."
