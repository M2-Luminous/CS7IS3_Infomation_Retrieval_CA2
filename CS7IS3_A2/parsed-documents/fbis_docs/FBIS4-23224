At the meeting, Renamo asked for the closure of its assembly areas in Timanganine and Chinhanguanine, and the reopening of two new assembly areas in Tete and Zambezia Provinces. The government delegation protested against the accusation made by the head of the Renamo delegation, that the Mozambican Government is said to have abducted a eyewitness connected with the alleged training of troops in Nachingwea, Tanzania. The government demanded that an investigation be carried out as soon as possible to clarify the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the eyewitness.
