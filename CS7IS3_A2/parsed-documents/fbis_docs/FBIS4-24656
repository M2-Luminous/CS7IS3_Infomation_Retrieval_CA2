"We believe that 8.7 renminbi to one US dollar is a reasonable rate under present circumstances," Hu Xiaolian, deputy director of the State Administration of Exchange Control Policy and Regulation Department, said. "And the People's Bank will, like central banks in other countries, stabilise the renminbi at what it believes to be the beneficial rate." Hu said that although the bank would look to keep the renminbi at 8.7 to the dollar, this was not cast in iron. "The rate is not a fixed one," she said. "It will have to adjust to the economic situation in China and, more specifically, the austerity programme and the need to rein in inflation." Hu said the conditions were not yet right for foreign banks to be allowed to undertake renminbi business. She did not put a timetable on the opening of the sector. Chinese officials are understood to be reluctant to allow foreign banks to compete with domestic banks until the main land banking system is put on a sound footing. China has just launched an ambitious reform programme aimed at turning its former state-owned banks into commercial banks. Hu said the inter-bank foreign-exchange trading network would be expanded to 18 cities this year from 12, but there were no plans at present to expand it further. "Its further development will depend on demand," she said.
