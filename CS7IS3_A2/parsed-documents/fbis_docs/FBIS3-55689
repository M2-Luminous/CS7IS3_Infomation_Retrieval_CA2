Consultations upon NATO membership began in mid-1993 and a letter to NATO secretary-general Manfred Woerner was sent last October. Brazauskas was induced to formally apply to NATO by "a resolution concerning NATO membership accepted by various parliamentary factions on December 23 and NATO summit taking place on January 10-11 in Brussels". By the way, Lithuania's application was received and distributed to NATO leaders and a "preparatory work" had been done, Brazauskas said. Brazauskas confirmed he consulted with Latvian and Estonian presidents before sending the entrance application and they had approved the Lithuanian step. Besides Russian reactions already announced in the press, Brazauskas said he did not receive any other statements from the leaders of that country. Waiting for an answer from Brussels, it is worthless to expect any concrete date of admitting Lithuania into NATO, president said. He noted a lot of money would be needed for integration into NATO. More than five per cent of national income -- 130 million Lt [litas] /about 33 million dollars/ -- are allotted to the needs of National Defence system this year. But it would hardly be enough to reconstruct Lithuania's military structures according to NATO standards, so Brazauskas is "expecting support from other states as well".
