Isuzu said it is the first Japanese maker to develop such a device, called an idling-stop-and-start system. The system stops the engine when the driver stops the bus and shifts the gear into neutral and frees the clutch pedal. It starts the engine again automatically when the driver steps on the clutch. Isuzu said the system can reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by nearly 10 percent when running in urban areas and improve fuel efficiency by about 10 percent. The system will be available from April 5 for 350,000 yen, the company said.
