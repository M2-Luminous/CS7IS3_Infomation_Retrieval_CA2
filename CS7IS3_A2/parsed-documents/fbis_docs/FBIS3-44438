The law is aimed at reducing the number of seriously sick and disabled babies, safeguarding the health of mothers and children and, finally fostering healthier generations in the future. The draft law requires doctors to advise a couple to terminate a pregnancy if a hereditary disease is liable to result in the birth of seriously sick or disabled babies, or if continuing the pregnancy would put the women's life at risk or seriously jeopardize her health or that of the fetus. The spokesman explained that abortions could ultimately be carried out only with the agreement of the pregnant woman or her guardian. This provision indicates that the law respects the right of individuals to make their own judgments, and reflects the principle of combining government guidance with individual choice, he said. China is the most populous country on the globe, with one-fourth of the world's people. Its birth policy focuses not only on controlling the size of the population but also on improving its quality. The previous four decades have seen remarkable improvement in the health of Chinese people, with the maternal mortality rate dropping from 1,500 per 100,000 before 1949 to 94.7 per 100,000 now. Marriages between close relatives, endemic diseases and congenital hereditary ailments, however, make it difficult to control the births of seriously sick and retarded children in some areas, especially remote and impoverished rural regions. The situation therefore calls for a Law of Better Birth and Health Care for Mother and Child to be enacted as soon as possible, he said. "Better birth" in this law is completely different from the racist "eugenics" pursued by Adolf Hitler under the guise of better birth. The law entitles Chinese citizens to premarital health check-ups; health care before, during and after delivery; antenatal diagnosis; health care for the newborn; screening for neonatal diseases; and better counselling for parents. According to the draft law, certain couples will be required to postpone marriage or take long-term contraceptive measures after marriage. This would apply to people diagnosed as having reproductive diseases, hereditary diseases that lead to seriously sick or disabled children, schizophrenia, manic-depressive psychoses and other severe psychoses, or acute infectious diseases, including venereal diseases. Such a mandate is compatible with some provisions in the nation's Marriage Laws. According to the spokesman, in drafting the law of better birth and child care the Ministry of Public Health conducted feasibility and necessity studies on a national scale. In the past 40 years, a relatively complete network of medical care has been established throughout the country. Six medical universities in Beijing and Shanghai offer courses on maternity and child care. Moreover, China has six national institutions on better birth and child care, and 346 maternity and child care hospitals. There are 149,105 maternity and child care technicians in the nation, and 533 clinics have been set up for antenatal diagnosis. In 1992, the premarital check-up rate reached 99 percent in Shanghai and 72 per cent in Liaoning Province. According to the spokesman, there is still a long way to go in improving the quality of the nation's population to the point where the belief that a large family means good fortune can be overcome.
