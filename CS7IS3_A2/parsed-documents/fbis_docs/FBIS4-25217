Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, executive secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP) Rafeeudin Ahmed, and chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) Zheng Hongye were present at the opening ceremony of the fair, which is co-sponsored by CCPIT and UN-ESCAP. The 80,000-square-meter exhibition includes about 3,000 participants from 30 countries and regions such as China, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Russia and the United States. Exhibits display light industrial products, mechanical equipment, electronics technology, communications equipment and products, environmental protection facilities, high-tech and patented products, jewelry, ornaments, garments, traditional handicrafts, and real estate projects. During the fair, five symposiums will also be held on the electronics trade, China's current economic situation and investment environment, China's reform of its foreign trade system and investment policies, and China's financial and taxation reforms. The Philippines and Hong Kong have sent large trade delegations to the fair to conduct business talks. ASPAT '94 is aimed at demonstrating economic achievements in the region, highlighting economic and trade complementarity and potential, promoting economic development and cooperation throughout the Asia-Pacific region and with other countries in the world, and exploring ways for strengthening cooperation and jointly achieving prosperity among the Asia-Pacific countries in a new world situation. ASPAT was first proposed in 1962 by the United Nations Asia and Far East Economic Commission, which is the present UN-ESCAP. The first three ASPAT fairs were held in 1966, 1969 and 1972 in Thailand, Iran and India, and proved to be fruitful. The fourth ASPAT fair, which was held in Beijing in 1985, was also a complete success.
