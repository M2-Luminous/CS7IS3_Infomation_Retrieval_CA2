In his classic work "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Problems Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses," the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has comprehensively elucidated, based on his scientific analysis of the inevitable demand of the development of socialist society and the reality of the rural economy of our country, the theoretical and practical problems arising in the successful realization of the work to turn cooperative ownership into all-people ownership. The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We must solidify and develop the agricultural cooperative economy and successfully realize the work to turn the cooperative ownership into all-people ownership. Turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership is an inevitable demand of the development of socialist society. Socialism means society based on collectivism. The economic basis of socialist society is cooperative ownership and all-people ownership which are both socialist ownership. Collectivism demands that all social relations, including the ownership relations, develop continuously in the common interest of the entire society. Turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership is an enormous social change, but this change is different from remaking the private ownership into socialist ownership because it is the development of cooperative ownership--which is the lower form of socialist ownership--into all-people ownership--which is the higher form of socialist ownership. Cooperative ownership--the lower form of socialist ownership--must develop in such a way as to enhance its level of socialization, and it must ultimately be turned into all- people ownership--the higher form of socialist ownership. When cooperative ownership is turned into all-people ownership and all the workers work incorporated into the unitary economy of all-people ownership, the communist principle of "one for all and all for one" will be satisfactorily embodied, thereby realizing the classless society. Turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership is an important problem in the development of the socialist rural economy of our country today. Under the wise leadership of the party and the leader, we have vigorously carried out the ideological, technological, and cultural revolutions in the rural areas in our country according to the basic principle for the solution of the socialist rural problems set forth in the rural theses, closely combining all-people ownership and cooperative ownership and continuously enhancing the role of all-people ownership. The chuche agricultural guidance system with the county cooperative farm management committee as its basis has been firmly established, its function and role enhanced, and the managerial and operational standard of cooperative farms improved nearly as much as the standard of advanced industrial enterprise management. With the active material and technological assistance of the state to the agricultural cooperative economy, production relations between industry and agriculture have been strengthened, all people ownership and cooperative ownership have been organically combined, and the material and technological means of all-people ownership accounted for an overwhelming share in agricultural production. At the same time, all cooperative farms firmly developed in the direction of large-scale all-people ownership system farms. In our country, all the agricultural workers are firmly united in comradeship, helping one another; large-scale major nature-remaking projects--unimaginable in terms of private farm economy or small-scale economy--are underway in the rural areas, thus making the agricultural production develop at a high speed continuously. This not only demonstrates the superiority of the socialist rural economic system based on collectivism, but shows that the conditions are coming to maturity in our country whereby cooperative farms are gradually converted into all-people ownership farms. In his work, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught that the work on turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership be carried out gradually in conformity with the degree of maturity of all the conditions and possibilities. Under a condition which is yet ripe ideologically, materially, and technically, hurriedly turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership would prevail the unsound ethos of living idle in rural areas, thus dropping the agricultural productivity and laying a big obstacle in the path toward overall socialist construction. The fundamental conditions for turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership will enhance cooperative farmers' level of ideology and consciousness and will strengthen the material and technical foundations of the cooperative economy. What is important here is the work of revolutionizing farmers and assimilating them into the working class by remolding their ideologies. Farmers' ideological consciousness works very importantly in the development of ownership relations. The work on turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership can never be realized without remolding farmers' ideological consciousness. Originally, the existence of cooperative ownership along with all-people ownership is closely connected with the farmers' low ideological consciousness level, and their technical and cultural level compared to that of the working class. This is because ideological remnants of individualism and egoism in the heads of farmers are very conservative and are unlikely to be erased in a short time. Leaving these intact, the work on turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership will not only fail, but, even if it succeeds, it will bring about evil effects. By raising the farmers' level of ideology and consciousness, we should let farmers become deeply aware that their individual interests lie in that of society and group and that their worthwhile life and happiness can be found in the prosperity and development of the socialist fatherland and in the prosperity of cooperative rural areas. We should also let them display high patriotic zeal and devotion. When these are fulfilled, we can then say that the important conditions for turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership has been prepared. Consolidating the material and technical foundations of the cooperative economy is one of the important conditions for turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership. The material and technical foundations of the agriculture is weaker than that of the industry. Since remolding the people's ideological consciousness is connected with material foundations, and society's production relations are related with the degree of productivity development, consolidating material and technical foundations is an important problem rising in the work of turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership. The rural technical revolution's four tasks--irrigation, electrification, mechanization, and chemical application--set forth in the socialist rural theses have been basically carried out in our country. In doing so, we have laid solid foundations for modern agriculture and made a remarkable progress in the struggle to industrialize and modernize agriculture. We should further expand and consolidate the accomplishments achieved until now. We should also industrialize and modernize agriculture, and develop the farming method and land cultivation system so as to gradually eliminate the differences between industrial and agricultural labor and to resolutely increase the production efficiency of agricultural labor. With these conditions fulfilled, we can then say that solid material and technical foundations have been prepared for turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's illumination of the fundamental conditions for turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership in his work comes as a guiding principle for triumphantly carrying out the work without any slightest deviation or turns. In his work, the abundant and profound experiences of the great leader, who led socialist rural construction at the van for a long time with uplifted banner of chuche are summed up, and our party's solid will to lead our rural area into the one road of socialism is contained. In his work, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song also expounded in detail the question on how to carry out the work on turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership. What is important here above anything else is that the work on turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership be carried out with the county as a unit. Carrying out the work on turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership with the county as a unit is related with the role and position assumed by the county in the socialist rural construction. In our country, the county is the base for linking the towns with the rural areas in all spheres of politics, economy, and culture, and serves as the basic unit for the direct leadership and management of the rural economy. A county has the farm machine stations, farm implement factories, irrigation administration offices, and other state enterprises which serve the rural economy, and equipment and farming materials are supplied to cooperative farms with the county as a unit. Therefore, cooperative ownership must be transformed into all-people ownership with the county as a unit. Even after cooperative farms are converted into the state farms of all-people ownership, the rural economy must be developed on a county basis. The forms and methods of converting cooperative property into all-people property, too, must accord with the socialist rural economic system of our country and the specific situation in our rural communities. Since a well-organized agricultural leadership and management system has been established with the county as a unit in our country, the most reasonable form and method is to convert cooperative farms in the county into state farms under all-people ownership and let the county undertake their unified guidance and management. This will make it possible to manage satisfactorily the farms which have come under all-people ownership, using and strengthening further the comprehensive leadership and management system of the rural economy and the material and technical means that serve agriculture, which have already been prepared in counties. In a county of moderate size where the level of management of the county cooperative farm management committee and cooperative farms is high, all the cooperative farms and the state enterprises that serve agriculture in that county may be merged into a state farm with the former cooperative farms made its branch farms and the former enterprises its workshops. The general farms, which have been organized as model units in Sonbong and some other counties through the merger of not only agriculture but also local industry, goods distribution, education, culture, health care, and all other local administrative and economic functions, must continue to operate, further improving their management. Even after cooperative ownership is converted into all-people ownership, all state farms should be managed under the self-balancing system and the socialist principle of distribution should be thoroughly implemented. In particular, it is important to set up ways to avoid possible deviations and loss and in the course of transforming cooperative ownership into all-people ownership and must smoothly carry out the task. Also important in the work of turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership is making the county play an important role as the base linking town and rural areas and as an all-embracing unit of leadership and management to the rural economy. Therefore, it is necessary to build up the county, further develop local industry, and improve education, culture, health care, and public welfare. The county must expand and strengthen the enterprises and the production establishments serving the rural economy to speed up the development of agriculture. All the counties must make it their major task to develop agricultural production and improve the living standard of the rural population, and must push forward the socialist rural construction. In his classic work "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Problems Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses," the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has set forth concrete tasks and means arising in the work of turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership. This comes as a militant banner for the ultimate solution of the rural problems and the complete success of socialism. All party members and working people should traverse the road of the socialism of our own style, the road elucidated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. By doing so, they should brilliantly accomplish the historic tasks of eliminating the differences between towns and rural areas, eradicating the class distinctions between working class and farmers, ultimately solving the rural problems, and realizing a classless society.
