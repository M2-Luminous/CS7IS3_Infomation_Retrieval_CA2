About 50 Khmer Rouge guerrillas on Saturday blew up a section of a bridge which connects Sisophon to the town of Mongkol Borey, eight kilometers (five miles) east, he said. The bridge on National Route 5, part of the government's supply route, had been made impassable for large vehicles, according to officer with the Cambodian-Thai Coordination Office (CTCO). Government troops managed to drive off the guerrillas from the structure and reinforcements had been sent, he said. Mongkol Borey was believed to have been attacked by Khmer Rouge forces at the same time, the officer said. Detailed reports from the area were unavailable.
