FR940607-2-00148 FR940607-2-00090 Attachment Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation's Designation of Certain Loan-Registry Data Elements as Proprietary1 I. Proprietary Confidential Data Elements A. Single Family Data Elements • Acquisition UPB [positions 80&hyph;85] 1 Each data element is identified by the field description and the position numbers shown in the January 14, 1994, letter from HUD that set forth the loan-registry requirements. • Loan-to-Value Ratio At Origination [positions 86&hyph;88] • Date of Mortgage Note [positions 89&hyph;94] • Date of Acquisition [positions 95&hyph;100] • Cooperative Unit Mortgage [position 102] • Refinancing Loan From Own Portfolio [position 103] • Special Affordable, Seasoned Loan Proceeds Recycled [position 104] • Product Type [positions 105&hyph;106] • RTC/FDIC [position 108] • Term of Mortgage At Origination [positions 109&hyph;111] • Amortization Term [positions 112&hyph;114] • Seller Institution [position 115] • Mortgage Purchased Under FHLMC/FNMA Community Lending Program [position 118] • Acquisition Type [position 119] • FHLMC's Real Estate Owned [position 120] • Public Subsidy Programs [position 121] B. Multifamily Data Elements • U.S. Postal Zip Code [positions 13&hyph;17] • Acquisition UPB [positions 71&hyph;76] • Percent Participation [positions 77&hyph;80] • Date of Mortgage Note [positions 81&hyph;86] • Date of Acquisition [positions 87&hyph;92] • Refinancing Loan From Own Portfolio [position 95] • Special Affordable, Seasoned Loans: Are Proceeds Recycled? [position 96] • Cooperative Project Loan [position 94] • Mortgagor Type [position 97] • Term of Mortgage At Origination [positions 98&hyph;100] • Loan Type [position 101] • Amortization term [positions 102&hyph;104] • Seller Institution [position 105] • Acquisition Type [position 107] • FHLMC's Real Estate Owned [position 108] • Public Subsidy Programs [position 109] • Special Affordable_45% [positions 115&hyph;123] • Special Affordable_55% [positions 124&hyph;132] • MF Unit Type XX_Affordability Level [position 133+4_fifth unit-level field] Rather than making this data element available, Freddie Mac suggests that HUD instead disclose the element Affordability Category [position 70] (which is defined in terms of four ``buckets'' or range of values rather than as a particular percent)_ along with the unit-level data and in a manner that is entirely severed from any information from which one might determine location. Alternatively, or in addition, Affordability Level could be recoded into ``buckets'' or ranges of values rather than being expressed in terms of a specific percent of adjusted local median income, and then could be released with the unit-level data as described below. II. Data Elements That Should Be Released Only in Unit-Level Files We request that the following unit-level data for two- to four-unit and multifamily properties be released only as a separate file or ``package'' of data_severed entirely from the geographic and other data: A. Single-Family Unit-Level Data Files We request that the following single-family elements for each two- to four-unit property be released only in a separate file, which file would contain no other data elements: • Number of Units [position 133] • Unit 1/2/3/4 Number of Bedrooms [positions 134, 147, 160, 173] • Unit 1/2/3/4 Owned-Occupied [or Tenant] [positions 135, 148, 161, 174] • Unit 1/2/3/4 Affordability Category [positions 136, 149, 162, 175] • Unit 1/2/3/4 Reported Rent Level [positions 137&hyph;141, 150&hyph;154, 163&hyph;167, 176&hyph;180] •Unit 1/2/3/4 Reported Rent Level Plus Utilities [positions 142&hyph;146, 155&hyph;159, 168&hyph;172, 181&hyph;185] B. Multifamily Unit-Level Data Files Similarly, we request that the following multifamily elements for each multifamily property be released only in a separate file, which file would contain no other data elements: • Number of Units [positions 110&hyph;114] • Unit Type XX_Number of Bedrooms [position 133_first unit-level field] • Unit Type XX_Numbers of Units [position 133+1_second unit-level field] • Unit Type XX_Average Reported Rent Level [position 133+2_third unit-level field] • Unit Type XX_Average Reported Rent Level Plus Utilities [position 133+3_fourth unit-level field] • Unit Type XX_Affordability Level [position 133+4_fifth unit-level field] As is described above, we would propose that this data element be included in a unit-level file only after it is recoded to show affordability level by ``bucket'' or range of values rather than by a particular percent of adjusted local median income. In its current form, the data element is proprietary and should not be released_even in a unit-level file. • Affordability Category [position 70] III. Data Element That Should Be Recoded Consistent With HMDA Before Being Made Publicly Available The data element Occupancy Code [position 132] indicates whether a single-family mortgage purchased by Freddie Mac was for a ``Principal Residence/Owner Occupied,'' ``Second Home'' or ``Investment Property (Rental).'' We request that this element be released only after it is recoded so that the second homes would be combined with investment properties as ``Not owner Occupied'' consistent with the treatment of second homes under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (``HMDA'').
