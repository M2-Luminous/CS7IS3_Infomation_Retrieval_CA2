Mr. Prime Minister, if your cabinet resigns en masse, political parties will move toward nominating a candidate for prime minister. Do you intend to become prime minister again? In your opening statement, you referred to a new government framework and said you would aim for a new government formed by political parties sharing the same policies. Do you think the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] should return to the ruling coalition? [Hata] Regarding your first question, I think the question of whether or not I seek the premiership again should be left to the Diet. I will follow the Diet's judgment. As far as I am concerned, I am at zero. A way can start from there. Hence, I am not thinking about it at all. As for the new government, I hope the SDPJ will break with its status as an opposition party. I also hope the SDPJ will become a responsible political party and play its part in Japan's politics. I have wanted this since the Hosokawa government's inauguration and the last generation election was held. During the two months of my cabinet, I strongly urged the SDPJ to return to the coalition government and share the responsibility of running it. As I have just stated, I will leave the question of whether or not I seek the premiership again to the Diet. I hope everyone will think seriously about their country's future. [Dean of the Press Corps] In your opening statement, you referred to a political vacuum on the eve of summit talks with the United States and the summit [G-7 Naples summit]. If the prime minister is replaced, Japan will be unable to avoid stagnation in politics and national strength. Mr. Prime Minister, you once stated that you considered dissolving the House of Representatives so Japan could avoid such a situation. Mr. Prime Minister, if a general resignation by the cabinet creates such a situation, how will you take responsibility for it? [Hata] Japan was forced to host the summit [G-7 Tokyo summit] last year while the House of Representatives remained dissolved following the Miyazawa cabinet's defeat in a no-confidence vote in the Diet. If the House of Representatives is dissolved, no one knows for sure how the political situation will develop. I do not believe the House of Representatives' dissolution is a responsible act, and therefore, have decided not to do so. I once thought doing so would change public opinion by causing it to seek confidence in my cabinet. But no one knows what would result in the House of Representatives's dissolution. I want to avoid that based on the thinking that would lead to a loss of trust in Japan. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, you held long talks with Mr. Ozawa [Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) secretary general], which began last night and lasted until this morning. Did you and Mr. Ozawa discuss the possibility of dissolving the House of Representatives? [Hata] We did not discuss such a possibility. What I have always said is that Japan's politics must be reformed. The centerpiece for political reform is the reform of the current electoral system. I have also said the current electoral system must be reformed to build a new political system wherein real political debates are held. The House of Representatives should not be resolved to reform the current electoral system. Given the economic situation and a host of issues facing Japan, the House of Representatives' dissolution should be avoided. I have also said I would not renounce my power to dissolve the House of Representatives under any circumstances when my cabinet clashes with the Diet. [Hata continues] After seriously considering the situation, I held consultations with representatives from each of the parties of the coalition -- rather than saying I talked with Mr. Ozawa alone. We discussed what we should do to create a stabilized government, but eventually, during the course of our discussions, I came to the conclusion that the House of Representative's dissolution should be avoided. Since the no-confidence motion had been submitted, I decided to sum up my conclusions. I wanted to avoid a political vacuum at any cost. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, in general, when a cabinet is dissolved, in view of regular constitutional government procedures, it is natural to hand over power to the largest opposition party. What do you think of this? [Hata] If we give power to the LDP, that will mean another minority government. It will be similar to my cabinet, which has been criticized for being a minority government. Unfortunately, there is no party in the Diet that has a majority of seats. For this reason, I do not think power should be given to the first opposition party. Rather than giving power to the opposition, the issue should be left to the Diet's judgment so that the people will be able to see how politics work. As has been pointed out, since the people cannot see what is going on in Japan's politics or the obstacles facing it, the matter should be left to the Diet -- some say it is quite difficult to translate the word "yudaneru" [verb, leave or entrust] -- and follow the Diet's judgment. [Unidentified reporter] The no-confidence motion has been submitted. What was the underlying reason for your cabinet's resignation, even before a vote on the no-confidence motion was taken? [Hata] If we accept the vote on the no-confidence motion, we must have the power to reject the motion, or at least, to make efforts to reject it. However, since my cabinet is a minority government, it is very difficult to reject the motion with our current power. We can no longer spend the time needed for a vote. It will also take much time to create the next government. We should avoid spending such time. For this reason, I have decided to take action before a vote is taken. [Dean of Press Corps] The last question please. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you stated it is time to put an end to political strife. There is no persuasive force in what you said because you yourself used to get involved in political strife when you were an LDP member. What is your opinion on this? [Hata] I would like you to review my 25 year political career. I have always thought of nothing but the nation. During the so-called 40-day strife within the LDP, wherein such influential leaders as Eiichi Nishimura, Susumu Nikaido, Shin Kanemaru, and Noboru Takeshita, were involved, I refuted them, saying that what they were thinking was unclear to the people. I then personally told them that I would take new action. What happened at that time is widely known. Moreover, I have repeatedly said that it is necessary to take the initiative in managing the government. I am a man who has never acted to seek his own authority or higher gain. If you check the details of my political career over the past 20 years, you will understand what I have done. I am sorry I cannot explain these things now, but I do want you to review what I have done. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you said at a press conference yesterday that you leave the matter of negotiations between the ruling parties and the SDPJ. But now you have announced your cabinet's dissolution before letting us know what went on at the meeting between the ruling parties and the SDPJ. Can we take your announcement as a full acceptance of Mr. Murayama's call for a voluntary resignation? [Hata] In a meeting with the SDPJ -- I do not remember clearly what time it was -- there were no big differences in policy matters. But on other issues, we failed to reach an agreement at the meeting -- I think it was around 0400 or 0500 PM. Given the situation, the ruling coalition presented our policy accord proposal to each party. This time, however, each party still had doubts as to the direction the situation would go, even though the no-confidence motion had been submitted. Under such circumstances, it was impossible to bring negotiations with the SDPJ to a successful conclusion. Prolonging such a situation is not good for the people, and therefore, I chose to dissolve my cabinet en masse. I strongly hope the other parties will understand my true intentions. I have made a decision not to comply with somebody's intention but to avoid a political vacuum. Pursuing the SDPJ's cause of breakup from the coalition will eventually lead to a political vacuum. I came to the conclusion that the Diet's judgment should be followed, and I made the decision. It's time to end. Thank you very much.
