Cameroon State Minister for Communications Kontchou Augustin Kouomegni said Saturday at a press conference in Yaounde, the capital, that heightened French military and diplomatic activity was aimed at averting the possibility of a war between the two African neighbors. Kontchou said Cameroon can only go to war if it was imposed on her. "We are fully committed to solve all our problems peacefully and we call on Nigeria to do the same," he said. Dismissing Nigeria's claim to the oil rich peninsula, Kontchou said Cameroon had allowed Nigerian settlers on the islands to continue living there out of good neighborliness,"but this does not mean that the land belongs to Nigeria." In a letter to the United Nations Security Council dated 28 February requesting a debate on the matter, Cameroon alleged that Nigeria violated its territorial integrity by attacking its troops stationed in the peninsula on 18 February. Cameroon said also that Nigeria annexed two villages in the disputed area on 31 December 1993. Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema met Camerooonian President Paul Biya and Nigerian leader Sani Abacha on Thursday in efforts to resolve the dispute. Cameroon bases its claim to the peninsula on a 1913 agreement between Britain and Germany. It said former Cameroonian President Ahmadou Ahidjo and Nigerian leader Yakubu Gowon signed an accord which reinforced Cameroon's ownership. Nigeria said the Gowon-Ahidjo Agreement was not binding because it was not ratified by the Supreme Military Council, the then ruling body in Nigeria.
