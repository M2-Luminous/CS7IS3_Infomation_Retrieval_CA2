Will it provide us with easier access to export markets and advanced technology? Will it promote job-creating foreign investments and partnership projects in Tunisia? In a word, will Tunisia's accession to GATT and the concluding negotiations for a final signing of GATT by the big powers as it was written serve our country's interests and enable us to achieve the goals of the Eighth Development Plan? Is there free choice when 117 countries out of 170 have signed and the international financial community makes accession to GATT a condition for receiving its development assistance? With those facts as our background, how should we proceed in order to ensure that our accession will have the maximum positive fallout on our economy and our society? It all depends on our ability to ensure the competitiveness of our firms and reform the structures of our economy. Dangers, Challenges of GATT Tunisia acceded to GATT in July 1990. It is therefore bound by the obligations set forth in that agreement and enjoys the benefits it provides. But certain domestic changes and conditions are essential if Tunisia is to benefit from the agreement. As a signatory country to GATT, our country has access to a tremendous data bank concerning world trade: information on quantities, prices, and the quality of all products and all destinations make it possible to better direct the efforts of our exporters and manufacturers so as to produce better and sell better. This makes it a powerful means of diversifying our exports in an environment of nontariff barriers and of customs obstacles that are easier to get around. Also, belonging to GATT strengthens Tunisia in its disagreements with the big powers, since it means that Tunisia can have recourse to often effective arbitration in which it will be able to put forward the interests of its firms and entire sections of its economy. GATT and Our Agriculture The GATT agreements call for a 21-percent reduction in direct and indirect agricultural subsidies over a six-year period. That will be followed by a reduction in the volume of subsidized sales of meat, milk, and cereals (all staple products essential for feeding the population). The world price of wheat, which is heavily subsidized in the United States, is currently $125 per metric ton, whereas the price of Tunisian hard wheat is 24 dinars per quintal, or twice as much. Some people have said that Tunisian cereal production is too expensive for reasons having to do with productivity, whereas U.S. agriculture, although highly mechanized and productive, is heavily subsidized. But why deprive the Tunisian consumer of milk and meat from the EEC, whose surpluses benefit from particularly large subsidies: who can compete with meat from the EEC that costs from 12 to 15 French francs per kilogram net, CIF [cost, freight, and insurance] Tunis? The fact is that such competition with Tunisian agriculture is unfair. The danger of GATT, then, is that it will lead to a short-term rise in the cost of living because it will reduce subsidies at the source of our imports, and our own production cannot meet our domestic demand. On the other hand, our exports will enjoy improved access to foreign markets: sales of olive oil, citrus fruit, and so on will increase in volume and value, since the similar European products with which they compete will no longer be subsidized. That is the framework for our country's efforts to intensify the irrigated production of fruits and vegetables, modernize cereal growing, and develop our fishing and stockraising potential to increase production and the profitability of farming in order to feed a steadily growing and ever-more demanding population and improve the food trade balance. Our agriculture must modernize its structures and increase its ability to withstand foreign competition through an increase in added value. The state has done a great deal to improve the infrastructure, and private operators must assume their responsibilities and take advantage of the state's incentives. Our Industry and GATT The gradual disappearance of the MFA [Multifiber Agreement], which provided the rich countries with artificial protection from the commercial aggressiveness of textiles from the Third World, will open up the markets in those countries to us. They are big consumers of all kinds of clothing. But production costs in our country are too high for us to compete with the four "dragons" of Southeast Asia (where the hourly cost of manpower is $2.60, compared to $12 in Tunisia). Provided that our firms are able to grow and restructure rapidly, modernize their equipment, and achieve more integrated production, our salvation lies is specializing in the upscale end of the market through the use of more capable and skilled manpower. We find, however, that our industrial firms continue to be small, family-scale enterprises with financial resources and especially capital funds that are limited by the refusal to open up their family capital to the public and other investors, the reason being their fear of losing majority control on the boards of directors. We have few PME [small and medium-size businesses] and no Tunisian multinationals, but what we do have mostly is microbusinesses lacking the resources to stand up to the big international financial groups. It is true that they have management flexibility, but that is not enough to ensure competitiveness. GATT and Services It is true that we have great potential in the field of services: tourism, engineering, commercial companies, advertising firms, banks, insurance, and so on. But we must restructure our firms so that they will have the size, managerial staff, and "sales strength" of the big firms as well as the necessary management and marketing. Our building and public works industry, which lost 50 percent of its potential in 1986, must modernize in order to export. There are not several ways to go about it: the only solutions are partnerships and a strengthening of capital. Otherwise, we are in danger of being invaded by large financial groups that will set up local branches and conquer a good share of the market. Our company heads must strengthen their potential for competing locally and for exporting their activities: they need to look around elsewhere and see what they can do. Safeguarding Our Specific Culture In the face of the audiovisual multinationals--the Hollywood giants that turn out films and fiction thrillers at an industrial pace and extol sex and violence, we are in danger of being irrevocably invaded and seeing our children's education spoiled by the Western media, which have "proven themselves" in the negative sense of that expression. We must safeguard our cultural and artistic heritage, which is unique and finds its source in our ancestral values. We must avoid the artistic and cultural veneer of the civilization represented by Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and rock and roll, which has led the youth of New York's neighborhoods and of the Paris suburbs to the spiral of delinquency.
