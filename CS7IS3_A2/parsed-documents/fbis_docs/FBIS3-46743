Honma resigned as governor in early October in connection with a bribery scandal. Vice Governor Ryoichi Kabaya said the cash was kept in the prefectural government's secretarial section. The investigation revealed that Governor Honma allegedly approached Seiki Sugawara, deputy chief of the commerce, industry and labor division, in April 1992 and asked for fat expense accounts. Sugawara promptly started securing a total of 4 million yen by writing false business travel reports by the time of the February 1993 gubernatorial election, prefectural government officials said. In addition, they said, another 6 million yen was withdrawn as money gifts and wedding and condolence money from the governor's annual official expense account of 17 million yen. Vice Governor Kabaya said the retrieved 10 million yen will be turned over to the Miyagi government as revenue under its fiscal 1993 budget. Incumbent Governor Shiro Asano expressed shock at the results of the in-house investigation and vowed to set up a system to prevent a repeat of such a bogus expense account scheme. Honma resigned as governor in October last year after his arrest in late September. He was indicted October 18 on charges of taking a 20 million yen bribe from Taisei Corp., a major Japanese construction company, in connection with a prefectural project to build a cancer center. He was also indicted again on December 1 on charges of receiving a 100 million yen bribe from the de facto owner of Japan's No. 3 paper manufacturer, Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co.
