Kumagai was asked at a news conference to comment on a move by some U.S. lawmakers to introduce a bill aimed at reducing the U.S. chronic trade deficit with Japan. "The move had been expected in the aftermath of Japan saying `no' (to U.S. demands) at the Japan-U.S. Summit. It is important for Japan to demonstrate it is making efforts to open its markets so that we can avoid an exchange of retaliatory measures," Kumagai said. Kumagai revealed he has urged the auto industry to map out a voluntary plan to expand purchases of U.S.-made auto components. Washington's displeasure over Japan's stance has been "significantly strong," he said, adding that the industry should play a leading role in improving the situation. He said he expects automakers to make "a wise judgment" on the matter. Kumagai also voiced the government's resolve to do whatever it can do to expand Japanese auto imports from the U.S. He said it is not convincing to ignore everything that the U.S. says about the matter by citing the principle of free competition.
