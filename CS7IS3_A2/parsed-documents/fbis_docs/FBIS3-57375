The electoral debacle of Mykola Bagrov, speaker of the Crimean parliament, in the first round of elections is virtually a defeat for the Party of Crimean Economic Rebirth [PEVK], which decided to support Bagrov at its convention. As a matter of fact, the PEVK could propose for president one its members -- there are suitable candidates in this party. However, entrepreneurs have always been noted for their realistic and sober thinking and their ability to predict things. They understand that experience gathered at rallies is not enough to become a good president. Czars, for example, were prepared to rule from the day they were born -- and not all of them were good at it. When someone's background includes only a higher educational institution -- and a Soviet one at that -- and slight experience as an attorney, he would find it somewhat hard to run the state. Yuriy Meshkov never got a chance to hold even a low managerial post. Of course, he did not even plan to become the president. He was elevated this high by the All-Russian idea and ample promises generally distributed at rallies during the first round. Here is what Oleksandr Dudko, member of the PEVK Presidium and president of the Union of Crimean Entrepreneurs, told us. [Begin Dudko recording] If you carefully read programs of the PEVK and Meshkov, you'll find them consisting of basically the same elements -- salaries paid in rubles, removal of customs barriers, etc. -- only our program is without any heavy political shading. To achieve all this, one doesn't necessarily have to quarrel with our current situation and replace one border with another. [end recording] The PEVK will soon try to demonstrate to Crimean residents its implementation mechanisms and expose all of its advantages. However, it will be up to electors to decide for whom they should cast their votes. Whatever the case, they will get what they elect.
