This was stated by the deputy minister of roads and transportation and PNO head in an interview with our correspondent yesterday. He said that Nowshahr's loading capacity has been increased and is about 1.5 million tonnes. Commenting on the facilities extended for the transport of goods at Nowshahr Port, he said: [Begin recording] [Unidentified PNO head] In 1372 [year ending 20 March 1994] we allocated more than 3 billion rials there to create a trade port for the imports and exports of Central Asian countries. As our dear people know, this port is the closest one to the capital, about 200 km away. Last year the port was equipped with high tonnage forklifts of 60, 45, and 35 tonnes. One of the problems that this port faced was the bridges on the Tehran-Nowshahr highway, which trucks carrying high tonnage cargo could not pass. Also, transportation costs on this route were double the costs of other routes. But fortunately, with the repair and strengthening of these bridges, they are now ready for high-tonnage trucks. This will also help to decrease transportation costs by 50 percent. [end recording]
