Beginning with the article ``Electric Power: Another `Bottleneck' for China's Economy,'' the series eventually ran for two months, during which it produced 12 articles--all of them carried in a prominent place--and attracted widespread attention from various circles. The following article is the last in the series. In coming days, this paper will carry a synopsis by Shi Dazhen, minister of power industry. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all the comrades who cared about and supported the electric power report series, and to those who offered assistance to reporters in their coverage. The entry of nuclear power into our country's economic life is only a recent event. On 15 December 1991, the Taishan nuclear power plant, situated on Hangzhou Bay, delivered powerful electrical current to the east China power grid. Toward the end of this year, the No. 1 generator at the Daya Bay nuclear power plant in Guangdong will go into commercial operation. There will be a continuous supply of nuclear power to Guangdong and Hong Kong, turning a new page in the history of China's energy. At the time we were cheering the takeoff of nuclear power in our country, nuclear power alrady had supplied one sixth of the world's power generation, and in 1992 there were 424 nuclear reactors operating in countries around the world. Changes in the energy consumption structure determine economic upturns and downturns. Following coal and petroleum, the peaceful use of nuclear energy has changed, in its turn, the world economic pattern. I: Nuclear Power--the Key To Solving Problems in Development In the last 40 years, nuclear energy has been one of the main reasons why many countries along the Pacific rim and on the two shores of the Atlantic Ocean achieved rapid economic development despite their remoteness from or shortage of energy resources. In the 1960's and 1970's, when southern China relied on the constant supply of coal from the north, nuclear power rose rapidly to the fore in Europe and the United States. In the course of 30 years, the United States built more than 100 nuclear reactors and became the country with the largest nuclear power capability. France made developing nuclear power its national policy for solving the energy shortage, and in the 17 years from 1973, increased its proportion of nuclear power from 4 to 72 percent. A cheap and quality-constant nuclear power base has supported the French economy. Now, all the EC countries, which once were plagued by energy shortages, see one-third of their electric power generated by nuclear energy. Given all this, the developed European countries and the United States still believe that they will not make it into the 21st century without nuclear energy. In the 1980's, the center of economic growth shifted to the Asia- Pacific region. Countries along the Pacific Rim, having pierced the dark clouds surrounding the nuclear incidents on Three Mile Island in the United States and at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union, now see nuclear energy as the golden key to solving difficulties in economic development. Japan, with 44 nuclear power plants, sees nuclear power as the ``key energy source.'' The government, the economic sector, and the power companies worked jointly, formulating long-term development plans. By the year 2000, Japan's nuclear power will account for 40 percent, as compared with the current 27.7 percent of national power generation. India has announced the building of another 22 nuclear reactors by the end of this century. The ROK and our country's Taiwan Province began developing nuclear power in the mid- and late 1970's, respectively. By 1988, it was accounting for about half the total power general in the ROK and Taiwan. Taiwan was able to halve its unit power price after it had successfully developed nuclear power. News keeps arriving that Pakistan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand either are studying or are developing nuclear power plants. The trend of developing nuclear power plants in Asian countries is growing. Meanwhile, nuclear technological sectors in Europe, the United States, and Japan have joined forces in researching a safer, cleaner, and more economical fast-reactor that can use nuclear resources more efficiently. Developed countries also have intensified research into nuclear fusion, a study that might offer mankind unlimited energy. By now there is no doubt that nuclear power will be the main source of energy in the 21st century. It is now a global consensus that countries which fail to attain nuclear energy will never become developed. II: Nuclear Power--The Ideal Recipe for Economies Along the Southeast Coast To Get Out of the Impasse Power shortages have become the ``bottleneck'' in our country's economic development--something the southeastern coast has felt most acutely. The region is reeling under the pressure of transportation bottlenecks and environmental pollution. These transportation and environmental pressures all can be traced to the region's unbalanced energy structure. Our country's coal energy is concentrated in the ``three Xi's'' (Shanxi, Shaanxi, and western [xi] Inner Mongolia), while 70 percent of its water resources come from the southeastern coastal region. Eighty percent of the electric power supply to the southeastern coastal region is generated from coal. The north and west supply the south and the east with coal. Forty-six percent of the rail freight on the Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Guangdong lines is coal for power generation purposes, and 30 and 26 percent of the freight traveling the busiest waterways and highways--again--is coal for power generation. This rate, however, is still far from meeting the demand. At one time, 40 percent of Jiangsu's state-managed generator units were shut down because they had run out of coal for power-generating purposes. Coal-generated power is the engine of economic development, as well as the cause of high transport volumes and environmental pollution. A million-kilowatt thermal power plant each year releases tens of thousands of tonnes of toxic particles, such as sulphur dioxide and oxidated nitrogen, and hundreds of kilograms of such carcinogenic particles as mercury, cadmium, and trityl ditacene. How can we solve the three great problems--energy, transportation, and environment--afflicting the southeastern coastal region? In the manner of curing the pathological sources of three diseases with one surgical operation, it would be ideal to have one kind of energy, with a one-time investment, benefiting all quarters. Beyond the horizon of long-distance hydropower energy, people can catch a glimpse of nuclear power. The advantage of nuclear power, compared with coal-generated power, is plain and obvious. A one-million kw water-pressurized nuclear reactor need change only 30 tonnes of fuel each year, one- 100,000th of the transport volume required by a coal power plant of the same capacity, thus solving the transportation problem at one stroke. The environmental pollution caused by a nuclear power plant operated under safe conditions is practically negligible, its radiation release being smaller than that from a coal power plant of similar capacity. Therefore, Dr Sieberg, a Nobel Prize-winning nuclear chemist, said on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the nuclear fission of plutonium: ``Nuclear energy is the safest and most environment-friendly source of electrical power.'' As early as 1970, Premier Zhou Enlai said in a relevant debriefing session: We will have to rely on nuclear power if we want to solve the fundamental power shortage problem of Shanghai. Nuclear power has solved a wide range of problems for many places having large populations and rapid industrial development, but suffering from a shortage of energy resources. No doubt it will prove a good recipe for the southeastern coastal region of our country. Although the advantages of nuclear power are very obvious; Although our country has a relatively rich uranium resource, sufficient for the development of nuclear power; Although in the process of developing nuclear weapons, our country has fashioned a complete nuclear technological and industrial system, ranging from mining and the fission of uranium isotopes, to the production of nuclear-fuelled components, the design and construction of nuclear reactors, and the reprocessing of volt-amperes reactive fuel [fa ran liao hou chu li 0040 3595 2436 0683 5710 3810]; Although our country has a 30,000-odd strong nuclear technological contingent, all members of which have been tested by decades of field work and are quite capable of hardship and working under pressure; Although our country's infrastructural industry has experienced considerable development so that it can meet the needs of the development of nuclear power; Nuclear power still plays a negligible part in our lives. By the end of this September, the Taishan nuclear power plant, which now is operating steadily, had generated an accumulated total of 1.7 billion kw of power. This, plus the total power volume generated by the two 900,000 kw generator units in the Daya Bay nuclear power plant up to the end of 1993 and mid-1994, respectively, has amounted to only about 1 percent of our country's total power generation. We are late in starting; we missed the best time for development. On 28 February 1990, Qian Sanqiang, Li Jue, Jiang Shengjie, and Wang Ganchang wrote to Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, urging them to outline a long-term nuclear power development program, an action demonstrating the earnestness for the country and the people of these four highly decorated veteran scientists. Premier Li Peng replied to them on 30 April: ``A plenary session of the State Council Leading Group for Nuclear Power Plants on 15 March this year confirmed that nuclear power has been incorporated into the national economic development program.'' Today, coastal provinces such as Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Liaoning, and Hainan, as well as inland provinces like Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Hunan, all are submitting requests for the construction of nuclear power plants. The strategic task confronting us now is to speed up development in order to catch up. In August 1993, the China National Nuclear Industry Corporation centralized facilities and talents in the design and construction of nuclear projects and in equipment procurement and technological services, so as to establish the new China International Nuclear Power Engineering Group Company, in order to benefit from the advantages of group companies in the nuclear power market. Although we are working hard to catch up, every step along the way has proved extremely difficult. The status and functions of nuclear power in our country's economic development have yet to be fully appreciated by decisionmaking departments. The state nuclear power management is unable to muster enough muscle to centralize leadership, which has become a major constraint on the development of nuclear power. The absence of assured financing through institutional channels also has affected nuclear power research and pursuits. Nuclear power plants require a relatively large initial investment, and their success ultimately depends on safety guarantees and financing pledges. The two nuclear power plants slated to be built--in Guangdong and on the Bohai Bay in Liaoning--have been assured of meticulous designs, but will they get stable financial guarantees? The development of nuclear power is a complicated systems-engineering project. Owing to the highly specialized nature of the intensive research and production of key installations, the production of matching equipment for designated projects, the supply of nuclear fuel, the reprocessing of volt-amperes-reactive fuel, the disposal of ``three kinds of waste products,'' the determination of sites for the power plants, and arrangements for their retirement, the process of actual implementation requires highly centralized and unified leadership, and firm and efficient day-to-day management. Otherwise, nuclear power will not be able to display its advantages in freeing us from economic ``bottlenecks.'' This is the eager wish of the majority of dedicated nuclear power workers and the true voice of countrymen eagerly hoping for a full power supply and never-ending light. Nuclear power, may your light and heat help push us out of ``bottlenecks!''
