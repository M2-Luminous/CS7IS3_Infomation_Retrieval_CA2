Therefore, the state has decided that beginning in 1994, all the imports of raw tobacco will be put under official control. As early as 22 September 1993, the Customs General Department issued Notice No. 793/TCHQ-GQ, which points out: Those cigarette manufacturing units wishing to import raw tobacco from Cambodia must seek quota allocations from the Ministry of Commerce and must correctly comply with all stipulations of the state governing the import of goods." At the request of the Vietnam Tobacco General Corporation, the Ministry of Commerce on 3 February 1994 allowed the general corporation to import $10 million worth of raw tobacco. After that, the general corporation assigned the Nam Raw Tobacco Company (in Thong Nhut district of Dong Nai province) the duty to import $2 million worth of raw tobacco. "Nevertheless, in late March to early April 1994, this company continued to buy large quantities of raw tobacco through their imports beyond the quota allocated." In view of this violation, the 3d Market Control Team inspected the company and seized over 152 tons of tobacco from it. Later, however, the market control team somehow chose to put this case into limbo, arguing that "it found only a small amount of tobacco -- 4,709 kilos -- kept by the company in excess of the quantities of its duty-paid tobacco." After securing the release of its confiscated goods, the company again bought 14 truckloads of raw tobacco. This time the company's action could not go unoticed by members of the C-15 Economic Police Unit who found the company had 98 tons of duty-not-paid raw tobacco in its storage. Because the company registered 6,000 dong as the import price per kilo of tobacco, compared to the real price of between 18,500-20,000 dong per kilo, it is believed that the company "delared the import price of its raw tobacco below the real buying price to evade tax."
