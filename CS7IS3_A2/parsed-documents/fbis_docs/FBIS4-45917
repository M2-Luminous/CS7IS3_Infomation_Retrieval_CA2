"Such a secret agreement does not exist as the government has been saying," Kakizawa told a press conference. According to a book to be published Thursday, Japan and the U.S. concluded the secret deal during summit talks between then Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and President Richard Nixon in November 1969. The author of the book is Kei Wakaizumi, a former professor of international politics at Kyoto Industrial University, who, as Sato's special envoy, negotiated the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese control with Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security affairs adviser.
