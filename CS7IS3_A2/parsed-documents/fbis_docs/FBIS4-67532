The activists from the social movement ``for nuclear safety'' were particularly incensed by the arrival of another train shipment of such dangerous materials from Finland. The environmentalists say that the processing of nuclear waste is worsening the none-too-bright environmental picture in Russia's Ural Mountains and demand that ``Mayak'' stop accepting shipments for processing. But spokesman for the plant Yevgeniy Ryzhkov told ITAR-TASS that ``the plant's current load in processing used nuclear fuel does not even reach half-capacity and causes no harm to the environment.'' He added that ``the Russian authorities have to fulfill contracts signed yet by the USSR and, what is more important, the processing is the main financial source for the implementation of large-scale environmental programmes in the region.'' According to Ryzhkov, the Soviet and Russian nuclear industry produced a huge amount of liquid radioactive waste in their 45-year old history. It is difficult and dangerous to store it for long periods. The only solution, he said, is to turn them into compact, solid wastes. The appropriate technology for such operations, the specialist explained, ``has been created and is operating in our plant. It is necessary only to increase the machinery's capacity and build a few new furnaces. All this is being done at our own expense, and the main source of money for `Mayak' has become the regeneration of used fuel which is transported here. One must take into account that the fuel contains from 90 to 95 percent uranium, which we put back into nuclear energy. And fuel regeneration produces much less waste than the production of nuclear fuel,'' he said. Ryzhkov added that the shipment of used nuclear fuel, which caused such a commotion among the ``greens'' in Finland and Russia, had been successfully delivered to ``Mayak,'' unloaded, and was being processed ``in a safe way.''
