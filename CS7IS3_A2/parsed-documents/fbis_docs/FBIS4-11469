According to Firmino Rodrigues Alves, vice president of the Association of Sao Paulo Supermarket (Apas), since 18 April, 80 percent of the products already are being billed in URV's with prices between 8 and 12 percent higher than the last quarter of 1993. Provisional Measure No. 457, however, is quite clear: The conversion must be based on the average price of that period. In March the supermarkets suspended purchases from the industrial sector in URV's. Since then they have been getting their supplies from the wholesale market or from the industries that continue to sell in real cruzeiros. The supermarkets started running out of this alternative two weeks ago when the wholesale market's stocks started running low. Alves stated: "Now they [wholesale dealers] also will have to negotiate with the industrial sector." [passage omitted]
