The tension is still high in Batna. The queen of the Aures Mountains, the attractive city of Batna, which until recently was still a little haven of peace, is now living in anguish and fear. This can be easily read on the drawn faces of its residents. It has now been more than a week since Thursday, 10 March, at about 1900, when "a squadron" made up of 150 to 200 terrorists attacked the well-known high security prison (the Tazoult Lambese Detention Center) and freed about 900 prisoners, among them dangerous terrorists sentenced to death by the special courts, mainly for murders. This prison, which houses approximately 2,200 detainees, is located less than 15 km from downtown Batna, making it a prime refuge for certain escapees. Besides, some of them were found and captured in town. This is basically why the residents of Batna are afraid. It is a fear that set in very early and continues to turn Batna into a town that is virtually dead. Elsewhere, in Tazoult, where the prison is located, the pot-holed streets are still wet with last night's rain. In the square opposite the prison, some young men are playing with a ball. A herd of goats and sheep walks lazily by. A few more minutes go by and a gate at Lambese opens: About 50 guards emerge in a quick procession--these guards were on duty during the attack--and, as they push on, they just raise their hands to stop any questioning: "I have nothing to say"; only those who were not on duty that night agree to talk about the event. But there, in their neighborhood, they saw only shadows moving taking up positions in the village's dark streets. As was only proper, the attackers had cut off electric current. How many of them were there? "A great many," "they came in groups from everywhere," pushing aside the few residents who were still in the street when the fast was broken. At each entrance to the city of Batna checkpoints were set up. If in downtown you could mention two permanent gendarme roadblocks staffed by several men armed with Kalashnikovs, as you entered the city, coming from Barika, as on the road leading towards the village of Tazoult Lambese, much more impressive means were deployed. At the two ends of the city, the army was on the watch, backed up by tanks and big troop carrier trucks. Just about every vehicle was gone over with a fine-toothed comb, with taxis given "special treatment." The same thing for passengers. The more careful checking of taxis can doubtless be explained by the fact that many vehicles of this type had been stolen from their owners by the terrorists at the time of the attack. They had even stolen identification papers and sometimes citizens' professional cards. At regular intervals, helicopters belonging to the gendarmerie and the National People's Assembly [APN] fly over the region, most particularly the many mountains and vast stretches. Indeed, these flights take place in practically every wilaya bordering on Batna. The first planes we could see were patrolling over the plains of the Setif, about 150 km away from Batna. However, we were told, the principal mission of these helicopters is to ensure air coverage for troops carrying out sweeps searching for groups of escapees and attackers, a goodly number of whom, if certain information is to be believed, are still entrenched in the Aures Mountains. According to leaked information, numerous caches have been discovered and food and medicines as well as bedding have been recovered. On the road linking Setif to Batna, going through Barika, the first and only major roadblock has been set up by soldiers and gendarmes as you leave the village of Megra slightly more than 100 km before Batna.
