The Russian Federation Government Is Leaning Toward This Decision"] [Text] Among the many peculiar things shaping the present-day picture of missile technology proliferation are a number of international protocols and memoranda which apparently have no legal force but which nonetheless are actively being used to bring pressure to bear on those "falling" out of this picture. It would seem a good cause to restrain the proliferation of missile nuclear technology, limit the number of states possessing means of mass annihilation, keep the so-called "threshold" states at the threshold.... Yet not infrequently proliferation control, with respect to its initiators -- primarily the developed Western countries and the United States -- becomes a kind of tool to maintain the competitiveness of their domestic high technology companies and limit infiltration of Russian and other firms into capacious arms/space markets. At the Russian-U.S. Information Center in Moscow journalists met with participants in a session of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Expert Group: B. Dluzhnetskiy, A. Pikayev, G. Pike, W. Potter, and Chen Yong-pin. The missile technology proliferation control regime was established in 1987 by seven leading Western powers with the dominant role belonging to the United States. It primarily concerned limiting the export from developed countries of various know-how which could be used to create combat missiles and, naturally, also noncombat rockets, because it is quite an uphill task telling one from the other. The MTCR was also tested on Russian rocket producers. In October 1993 Russia and the United States signed a bilateral memorandum on observing the basic control regime principles, and its results were not slow in coming. The contract between the Indian Space Research Organization and the Main Space Administration for the delivery of cryogenic missile boosters was in the end "revised" under U.S. pressure; true, the United States will partially compensate Russia for corresponding losses, but the damage to Russian-Indian relations and the commercial reputation of Russian firms has already been done. Moreover, the Salyut scientific and production association has been left without a lucrative order. At present the Russian Government, as mentioned earlier, is closely examining the question of full accession to the control regime. Still, it is believed that the MTCR "pluses" for this country outweigh its obvious "minuses." On one hand, who knows where -- God forbid -- missiles sold in violation of the regime to more or less aggressive states will fly? Considering the "half-life" of the former Union's single air border control system, the consequences could prove catastrophic. Furthermore, it is thought that the signatories to MTCR agreements, having thus recorded their commitment to the regime's ideas, can enjoy certain export privileges and breaks -- "in the working process".... "We are against," it was stated at the press conference, "the control regime's being used by certain states to obtain commercial advantages." In place of sanctions, expert group participants propose cooperation: primarily in creating an international orbital station (it is another matter that Alfa is not a panacea, and that the engine makers themselves will hardly find a worthy place in this international program). Meanwhile the U.S. AEROSPACE DAILY from time to time publishes selections of commercial propositions opening with such "teasers" as: "A Russian space scientific and research organization with extensive experience of work during the days of the Cold War offers...." -- and offers you name it. What about a strict technology control regime? Oh, come on! As long as achievements by scientists and designers remain unclaimed in their own country, no control regime will be able to stop "cooperation on the threshold." Except, perhaps, the personal responsibility and good will of the missile workers who understand what can and what cannot be offered to the new "tigers" and "dragons" seeking to supplement their economic accomplishments with missile-nuclear and space "toys."
