The southwestern region is one of the regions in our country having the greatest potential for economic development. However, in the early 1980's its per capita gross industrial and agricultural production output value was 320 yuan less than other parts of the country. Since the establishment of southwestern economic cooperation in early 1984, the vast southwestern region has made great achievements in jointly acquiring and exploiting markets. In 1993, gross industrial and agricultural production output value of the region was more than 230 percent higher than 10 years ago. At present, southwestern region has become one of the regions in China whose economic development is most active. Over the past 10 years, the five provinces and regions and seven areas have removed restrictions and customs barriers, and opened up their markets to one another. They have cooperated in more than 6,000 economic projects of all kinds. In the transport and telecommunications field, they made joint investments of more than 200 million yuan to build 49 interprovincial and interregional highways, which are 918 kilometers in length. They have built 40 gigantic bridges or so in Sichuan and other places. They have opened up more than 100 new provincial-level passenger-cargo transportation routes. Thanks to the support unanimously provided by various quarters, the projects of electrifying the Chendu-Chongqing, Guiyang-Kunming, and Chongqing-Guiyang railways have been completed ahead of time. Key postal and telecommunications projects, microwave communications station projects in important cities like Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming and others, and the television satellite communication station project in Tibet have been brought into operation. Various parties have also made great progress in their joint exploitation of resources.
