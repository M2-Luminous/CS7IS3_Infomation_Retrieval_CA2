FBIS4-18678 "drweu068_i_94009" FBIS-WEU-94-068 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 FRANCE Armed Forces Special Operations Command Outlined Armed Forces Special Operations Command Outlined BR0704124394 Paris LE MONDE in French 6 Apr 94 p 12 BR0704124394 Paris LE MONDE French BFN [Report signed "J.I.": "Armed Forces Staff Creates Aircraft and Helicopter Squadrons for Special Actions"] [Text] A number of aircraft and helicopter crews are currently undergoing training with a view to working for the Special Operations Command (COS) placed under the command of the Armed Forces chief of staff. The mission of the COS, which is similar to that of similar units in the United States and Great Britain, will be to carry out raids deep into enemy lines. This was announced by COS "chief" General Maurice LePage in a communique sent to LES CAHIERS DE MARS, a magazine published by "Mars," an association of former higher military students. This is the first time the head of COS has spoken on the structure of the new unit, the need for which was felt after France proved unable to surreptitiously go into Iraqi territory to destroy Scud missile batteries, as was done by special U.S. and British commandos. Basically, in addition to its general staff, the COS consists of several types of special units, including the whole of the 1st Regiment of Marine Paratroopers based in Bayonne (four companies); five marine commando units (including one unit of naval frogmen); and one recently created unit, the 10th Air Force Paracommando Unit (CPA 10). These various units are qualified for missions such as air searches, special actions into enemy lines (in forested or urban areas), attacks against vessels at sea, reconnaissance of beaches, naval counterterrorism, guiding aircrafts or helicopters in hostile areas, attacking airports, or recovering personnel lost in enemy territory. General Le Page indicates that, if necessary, COS units can be reinforced by commandos from the 11th Division of Paratroopers (DP) as well as search and communication teams from the 13th Regiment of Dragons Paratroopers (RDP), or specialists from the 9th Marine Division (DIMA) and the 27th Alpine Division (DA). Worth noting is the fact that the 11th Regiment of Shock Paratroopers (RPC) and the "clandestine" civilians belonging to the "Action" service of the DGSE [General Directorate for External Security] remain under the latter's control and do not belong to the COS. A first squadron will use Puma helicopters fitted with special equipment for all-weather missions. It could be stationed in Evreux (Eure). A second squadron will use Transall [transport] aircraft for all-weather, deep penetration purposes. It could be assigned to the Poitou Wing, based in Orleans-Bricy (Loiret), which is part of the Military Air Transport Command (COTAM). Last, a third squadron belonging to the Alpilles Wing based in Aix-les-Milles (Bouches-du-Rhone) will use helicopters to recover personnel lost far behind enemy lines.
