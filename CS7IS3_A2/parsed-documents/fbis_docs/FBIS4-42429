Domestic rows over economic policy and street beggars were bypassed as Labour and the Liberal Democrats rounded on the Prime Minister, claiming he was relegating Britain to Europe's second division. But Mr Major again made the campaign running launching a strong defence of his call for a more "flexible" Europe and accusing opposition parties of a "craven" surrender to Europe. He said his call for a Europe in which member states were free to do "some things in their own way" was in tune with public opinion. With the campaign past the half-way mark, he said the Conservatives were the only party addressing the important European questions and resolutely committed to a realistic assessment of Britain's place in Europe. "So far we are the only party which has not played fast and loose with the national veto. We are the only party unequivocally committed to maintaining the veto," said Mr Major. Addressing a Tory campaign conference in London, Mr Major stood by his call for a "multi-speed, multi-track, multi-layered Europe." He said it did not contradict his original aim to see Britain at the heart of the Community and described talk of Britain in the "slow lane" of Europe as defeatist and old-fashioned. A multi-speed Europe was already happening, and he cited an agreement between France, Germany and the Benelux countries to dismantle their border controls -- a policy not adopted by other EC members. European governments had to note a "sourness" among voters towards the way the Community was developing. "I approach this question from the angle of someone who wishes to see Europe succeed. This is a very great venture. It is vitally important it is not pushed aside by sourness and moving too rapidly. We have to carry the people with us." Emphasising the Government's determination to maintain the veto on policies affecting Britain's vital national interests, he said Labour and the Liberal Democrats would be at the "tail of Europe," following policies advocated by other states. "That is the most craven foreign policy I have ever heard from any British political party. If that is the policy of Labour and the Liberal Democrats, they have forfeited every conceivable right to be trusted in Government with British foreign policy." Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, Mr Jack Cunningham, accused Mr Major of trying to play "hokey pokey" with Europe: "In-out, shake it all about. It is a recipe for a weak Britain in a strong Europe." He said it was vital for Britain to be up with those in the fast lane in Europe. But the message from Conservative Britain to its EC partners was "go ahead without us," he added. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader' said Mr Major's two-track Europe speech could mark a "historic" turning point in British politics -- which could pave the way for the Tories to become Britain's anti-European party, like Labour in the 1970's. In Edinburgh, he said: "It was a speech which revealed at once the weakness of his leadership and the poverty of his ambition for Britain."
