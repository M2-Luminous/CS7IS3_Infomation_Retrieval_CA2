Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion of reunification, at his bier. By blocking the South Korean visit of our mourners' group under an unreasonable pretext the South Korean rulers revealed themselves as the truculent fascist dictators, human scums and unprecedented barbarians who took off "civilian" veil, bereft of elementary human morality and etiquette, the statement said, and went on: "The South Korean `regime', which is still branding the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon) as an `organisation benefiting the enemy', invented by the military dictators of the `Sixth Republic' to suppress and stifle it, is little different from the preceding military fascist regimes, and, accordingly, it is clear to everyone that the fascist `regime' cannot be called a `civilian government'. "Worse still, the South Korean authorities refused to accept our offer for mourning visit, a purely humanitarian and compatriotic issue, by linking it with the fictitious `nuclear problem'. This goes to prove that the `nuclear issue' loud-mouthed by them is a product of a sinister political purpose. "The Kim Yong-sam group must act with discretion, well aware that angry voices condemning this anti-human and rude act are ringing out not only among the people of all strata, the opposition parties but among members of the `Democratic Liberal Party' of South Korea."
