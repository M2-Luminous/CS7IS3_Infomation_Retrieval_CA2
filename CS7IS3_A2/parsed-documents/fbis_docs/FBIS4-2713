While implementing the new taxation system, the taxation policies for the Hainan Special Economic Zone [SEZ] will remain unchanged. When the new taxation system converges with Hainan's preferential policies, the 15 percent income tax for enterprises and other policies concerning the term of exemption will continue to be effective. The specific contents of the term of exemption include: First, a 15 percent tax rate will be levied on the income from the production and operation of enterprises run by foreign and interior province investors in Hainan. They are exempted from local income taxes. Second, preferential treatment will be given to income taxes delivered by enterprises in light of different trades, term of operation, and investment amount. For example, enterprises engaged in harbor, port, airport, highway, railway, power station, coal mine, water conservancy, and agricultural development, whose term of operation exceeds 15 years, may be exempted from income taxes for five years from the year they start making a profit, and their income taxes will be reduced by 50 percent from the sixth to the tenth year. Enterprises engaged in industrial, transportation, and other productive trades, whose term of operation exceeds 10 years, may be exempted from income taxes for two years from the year they start making a profit, and their income taxes shall be reduced by 50 percent from the third to the fifth year. Income taxes of the enterprises regarded by the Hainan Government as advanced technological enterprises shall be reduced by 50 percent from the sixth to the eighth year. When the period of aforementioned tax exemption expires for enterprises engaged in industrial and agricultural production, an enterprise must pay income tax of 10 percent if its exports exceed 70 percent of its output value in the year. Enterprises engaged in service and catering trades whose total investment exceeds $5 million, or 20 million yuan, and whose term of operation exceeds 10 years, shall be exempted from income taxes for one year from the year they start making a profit; their income taxes shall be reduced by 50 percent for the second and third year. Foreign-funded banks, Sino-foreign banks, and other foreign-funded financial organizations may enjoy the preferential treatment of exemption and reduction in income taxes. More preferential policies shall be granted to the use of foreign capital in developing basic facilities and productive enterprises in Tongshi and the nationality autonomous counties. Third, foreign-funded enterprises which use their profits made in Hainan to reinvest in running enterprises in Chinese territory or expand production for a term of not less than 5 years may get a refund of 40 percent of the income tax paid for reinvestment. If the reinvestment is made in Hainan's infrastructure, agricultural development, and exports or if the enterprises are regarded by the Hainan Provincial Government as advanced technological enterprises, they will receive all the income taxes paid for reinvestment. If the enterprises withdraw within five years, they must pay the aforementioned refunded income taxes. Fourth, dividends, interests, rent, franchise royalty, and other incomes gained by investors outside the territory which have no offices in Hainan may be exempted from income taxes. Moreover, there are preferential treatment for exchange taxes in the following three aspects: First, the consumption and value-added taxes in the production process imposed on the goods produced and marketed on the island, except cigarette, alcohol, sugar, and mineral oil, will be reduced by 50 percent. The consumption and value-added taxes in the production process on other goods will be exempted. Second, the dutiable consumer goods exported directly by the production enterprises in Hainan or the dutiable consumer goods exported through the foreign trade enterprises shall be exempted from consumer taxes in the production process. There will be no value-added tax on direct export goods. An application can be filed to the taxation organs for tax reimbursement on imported items. Value-added and consumer taxes will be levied on products sold to foreign trade enterprises for exports. After the goods are exported, the foreign trade enterprises may apply to the taxation organs for tax reimbursements in light of relevant provisions. Third, income of foreign-funded banks and Sino-foreign banks (insurance companies) in the Hainan SEZ shall be exempted from business taxes for 5 years, beginning from the date of their operation. When the exemption period expires, the business tax imposed on these banks shall be reduced by 3 percent.
