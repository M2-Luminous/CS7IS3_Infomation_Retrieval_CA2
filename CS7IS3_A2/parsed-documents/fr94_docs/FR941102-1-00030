FR941102-1-00030 FR941102-1-00006 Proposed §42.6(c) would require that the district manager's decision be in writing and include certain information. The district manager's written decision would inform the certified person of the district manager's conclusions. For example, the letter may state that the record contains information which refutes the allegations in the notice of proposed action, and that the matter has been closed. The decision could contain a description of the remedial action that the certified person must take in order to retain his or her certification. Finally, the decision could also serve as a notice of temporary decertification, with time limits and conditions for re-certification, or as a notice of permanent decertification, if such a result were warranted by the evidence. The proposed rule would require that the district manager's written decision detail the specific facts which provide the basis for the decertification action, and include a clear and concise statement of the reasons for the decision reached by the district manager. The proposed rule would also provide that the decision would contain notification of the certified person's right to appeal any adverse decision to the administrator under §42.6(c)(3). Section 42.6(c)(4) would also require that the district manager's decision contain a statement that the administrative record is available for review at the MSHA district office, and that the certified person may obtain a copy upon request. Because certain appeal rights may attach, MSHA is proposing under §42.6(d) that the Agency would send the decision by certified mail, return receipt requested. The decision would be effective 15 calendar days after receipt by the certified person, unless it is appealed. Section 42.7␣Appeal to the Administrator Proposed §42.7 would allow a certified person to appeal an adverse decision of temporary or permanent decertification or other remedial action ordered by the district manager to the appropriate MSHA Administrator for Coal Mine Safety and Health or Metal/Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health. This appeal would be required to be submitted in writing. Specifically, proposed §42.7(a) would allow a certified or qualified person to appeal, in writing, the decision of the district manager to the appropriate MSHA administrator. The administrator must receive this appeal within 15 calendar days from the individual's receipt of the certified letter containing the district manager's decision notice ordering remedial action, or temporary or permanent decertification. Upon receipt of the written appeal, the administrator would send written acknowledgment of the appeal to the certified person, including an acknowledgment of an automatic stay of the remedial action or temporary or permanent decertification. The stay would remain in effect pending the outcome of the appeal under proposed §42.7(b) (1) and (2), and would allow a certified person to retain certification until the administrator reached a decision in the matter. MSHA believes that an automatic stay would be appropriate because the matter would still be under consideration by the Agency. The decision by the administrator would not be reached until after the administrator has had the opportunity to review the record and make a decision. Under §42.7(b)(3) of the proposal, the district office would be required to forward a copy of the administrative record to the administrator. In addition, the proposal would allow the certified person to request a meeting with the administrator under proposed §42.7(b)(4). Such a meeting must be requested by the certified person within 15 days of the certified person's receipt of the administrator's written acknowledgment of the appeal. When such a meeting is requested by the certified person, MSHA intends that the administrator would be permitted to consider evidence in addition to that presented to and considered by the district manager. MSHA intends that this subsection would allow the certified person to submit relevant information to the administrator in lieu of a face-to-face meeting. Proposed §42.7(c) would provide the administrator with a time limit of 30 days to issue a written decision after either his or her receipt of the administrative record and district manager's decision, or 30 days after his or her meeting with the certified person. MSHA believes that this is a reasonable amount of time for the administrator to review the evidence and issue a reasoned decision. In some instances, post-meeting submissions to the administrator may extend the time to issue a written decision. Section 42.7(c) (1) and (2) would provide that the administrator would have several possible options after his or her evaluation of all of the evidence. The administrator could issue a decision that upholds the decision of the district manager, and in such a case the remedial action or temporary or permanent decertification would become effective 30 days after receipt by the certified person except as provided in §42.8(e). The administrator could also issue a decision overturning the district manager's decision. Finally, the administrator may also refer the matter back to the district manager with appropriate instructions, based on the receipt of new evidence or information that was not available to, or considered by, the district manager at the time that his or her decision was rendered. Proposed §42.7(d) would require that the written decision contain a clear statement of the basis for the decision, including specific references to the evidence contained in the record that was considered in arriving at the determination. The written decision would be served upon the certified person by certified mail, return receipt requested.
