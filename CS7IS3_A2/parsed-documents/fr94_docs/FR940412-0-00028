FR940412-0-00028 FR940412-0-00006 In the 197 instances (35%) where the participants walked down the curb ramp and did not stop before the street: •There was traffic on the street perpendicular to the participant's line of travel in 116 cases (59%). The traffic was moving in 75 cases and idling in 41 cases. •The participants took two or more steps into the street in 151 cases (76%). Although the participants reported the presence of the traffic on the street perpendicular to their line of travel and the upslope or texture change at the street as frequently used cues to detect the street, the research data indicate that these cues are not sufficient to consistently and dependably identify the street. 3 3 The research project also analyzed participant variables such as frequency of travel, travel proficiency, cane lengthen in relation to stride length, cane technique, hearing, and organizational membership. Travel proficiency and cane technique were found to be marginally significant factors in detecting the street. The other factors were not significant. The research data suggest that there is a strong relationship between the slope of the curb ramp and the detection of the street. 4 4 The research data also suggest that there is a strong relationship between the rate of change in slope between the walkway leading up to the curb ramp and the ramp itself. The participants had a greater rate (85%) of detecting the street were the change in slope was abrupt and a lower rate (57%) where the change in slope was gradual. •Where the slope was 6 ○ or more (1:10 or more), the participants stopped before the street in 172 of 194 instances (89%). •Where the slope was 5 ○ (1:11 to 1:13), the participants stopped before the street in 31 of 44 instances (70%). •Where the slope was 4 ○ or less (1:14 or less), the participants stopped before the street in 157 of 319 instances (49%). 5 5 The ten most difficult streets to detect (i.e., where most participants stepped into the street without stopping) had a ramp with a slope of 4 ○ or less and at least one of the following characteristics: a curb ramp parallel to the participant's line of travel; a very quiet street or busy street with surges of traffic and gaps in traffic cues; no building line or a building line that was different from others on the route; and little or no texture change or upslope at the street or a change which was considered gradual. At one blended curb, all ten participants stepped into the street without stopping and five of them crossed the entire street without detecting it despite an abrupt end to the shore line, a surface texture change, and a slight lip where the street pavement overlapped the sidewalk. The report made the following recommendations for additional research: [F]uture research could more precisely measure the curb ramps included in this project, and analyze performance with relationship to these more accurate measurements. It may be possible that ramps which have 1:12 slopes facilitate high detection rates, while ramps of lesser slopes (e.g., 1:15) may be clearly associated with low detection rates. If ramps of 1:12 facilitate high street detection rates, then it is possible that the [ADAAG] requirement for detectable warnings on curb ramps could be limited, e.g., to ramps having slopes less than 1:12. The requirement that detectable warnings extend over the entire surface of curb ramps is not supported by empirical evidence that such an extensive tactile cue is necessary to alert blind travellers to the end of a curb ramp and the beginning of a street. It is possible that a lesser amount of warning (24 ’ ’ or 36 ’ ’) may be sufficient. If so, the optimal placement of the warning still remains to be determined. Suggested locations are (1) on the lower end of the ramp, immediately adjoining the street; (2) on the upper end of the ramp; and (3) around the sides and at the top of the ramp. Dimensions and location of detectable warnings need further empirical research. Effect of Detectable Warnings on Persons With Mobility Impairments and Other Pedestrians Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and two State organizations representing persons with mobility impairments expressed concern that detectable warnings could have an adverse effect on persons who use wheelchairs and other mobility aids, especially on sloped surfaces. 6 They generally supported suspending the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and reflecting pools while additional research is conducted. 6 Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association (EPVA) initially supported the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings and explained that it had changed its position after reviewing the data from the earlier Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Metro-Dade Transit Agency studies. The BART study conducted tests on level platform surfaces with 24 persons with mobility impairments, including four manual wheelchair users. Five participants (21%) responded that the detectable warnings would be helpful; eight (33%) responded that they were ``not affected''; seven (29%) responded that they would be ``insignificantly affected''; four (17%) responded that they would be ``moderately impaired''; and none responded that they would be ``seriously impaired.'' Three of the manual wheelchair users responded that they would be ``insignificantly affected'' and the other one responded that he or she would be ``moderately impaired.'' Peck, A.F. and Bentzen, B.L., Tactile Warnings to Promote Safety in the Vicinity of Transit Platform Edges, Cambridge, MA: Transportation Systems Center (1987). The Metro-Dade Transit Agency conducted tests with seven wheelchair users on level platform surfaces. Five of the participants responded that they were ``not affected'' or ``insignificantly affected.'' The other two had difficulty with the detectable warnings but their specific responses are not reported in the study. Mitchell, M., Pathfinder Tactile Tile Demonstration Test Project, Miami, FL: Metro-Dade Transit Agency (1988). Carsonite International, the manufacturer of the detectable warning materials used in the BART and Metro-Dade Transit Agency systems, submitted a letter from BART stating that in over five years experience with detectable warnings on its rail system, no problems have been observed with wheelchair users entering or exiting the trains.
