The cause was Moldova's failure to pay the Russian "Gazprom" organization debts amounting to 150 billion Russian rubles, specified the quoted source. Ion Grau said that in order to economize supplies the pressure in the gas pipelines is to be reduced. According to Grau, many people did not pay in time for natural gas and that is why the debts were not repaid. Natural gas worth about $700,000 is consumed each day in Moldova, specified Grau.
