The accord allows each nation's airlines to operate flights between the northern Japanese city of Aomori and the Russian Far East city of Khabarovsk and between the central Japanese city of Toyama and the Russian Far East city of Vladivostok, ministry officials said. Under the agreement, Russia's Aeroflot Airline plans to run two weekly flights on both routes as soon as related customs, immigration and quarantine facilities are set up at the Japanese airports, they said. The first flight between Aomori and Khabarovsk is expected as early as fiscal 1996 and that between Toyama and Vladivostok is expected in fiscal 1994, they said. No Japanese airlines reportedly plan to serve the two routes at the moment. The agreement also calls for raising the number of weekly flights between Niigata and Vladivostok to three from the current two starting in fiscal 1994, the officials said. The two countries also agreed to hold a meeting in Tokyo of Russian and Japanese aviation controllers to improve related technical skills. During the talks, Russian officials assured Japan that the current restriction on trans-Siberian flights will be lifted as early as March, the officials said. Because of a lack of necessary aviation control equipment, Russia has limited the number of trans-Siberian flights to six per hour.
