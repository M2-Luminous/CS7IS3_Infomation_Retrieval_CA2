The document was signed by Prime Minister Peter Boross. At the same time, Pangalos confirmed that Greece would continue to help Hungary attain full EU membership. On presenting the document, Jeszenszky said, "I deem it a great honor that I can present Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross's letter to the president of the Council of the European Union in Athens, which cradled Western civilization, in the country where the concept of Europe was born. In this letter, the Hungarian government expresses its intention to apply for admission to the European Union under article 'O' of the Maastricht Treaty." "The application to join the greatest and most successful venture of European peoples reflects the Hungarian nation's commitment to return to the road which it chose a thousand years ago. After a long, forced waiting, history has again provided a chance for this move." "Our government believes that over the past four years Hungary has taken the steps needed to join the organization of democratic European market economies." "Our membership bid has the broadest possible support: The freely-elected Hungarian Parliament unanimously approved the relevant proposal." "While filing our request, I would like to restate the position of Hungary's government and Parliament that we completely identify with the aims of the European Union, laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. We are ready to accept the commitments entailed in membership and wish to strengthen the process of European integration by joining the organization." "I would like to assure you and the European Union that in the coming years Hungary will adopt all legal and economic measures necessary for full EU membership as soon as possible." "Hungarian culture was part of European culture even when foreign occupiers attempted to isolate us. It is largely thanks to art and science that the spirit of European affiliation has survived and attempts to subvert our national interests failed." "It is Hungary's conviction that joining the EU makes the political processes of the past four years irreversible. This is how our nation's security and continuing economic reform gains a favorable framework and guarantee. European integration is the only way to Hungary's modernization." "I ask, Mr President, that the EU Council discuss our application at its April 18 session and forward it to the Commission for comment," Jeszenszky said.
