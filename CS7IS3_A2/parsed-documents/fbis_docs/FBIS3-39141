[Salvati] The first really essential point is the selection of the persons to head the government, and the principal ministers. Beyond all the statements of principle, it is much more important to the potential voter to have an idea of the team that will make the decisions. It makes a big difference, and the message is immediate, to entrust reform of the bureaucracy to Cassese instead of Gasperi, for example. [Biello] Therefore, you believe it is useful to announce the names of the prime minister and the team along with the program? [Salvati] In a sense, the names of the principal ministers are even more important than that of the prime minister. Precisely because the things that need to be done for this country involve primarily modernization and civility, and not questions of right or left, the persons selected are decisive. Everyone will say in their programs that the fundamental issue is state administration, reform of government finances; everyone will repeat a series of obvious key points. [Biello] What distinguishes the progressive program from that of the moderates? [Salvati] If I had to give a very general picture, I would say that, compared with the center-right, the moderate left should be more attentive to industrial growth and employment than to financial rigor. [Biello] Rigor and resources. How will a progressive government operate? [Salvati] The truth is that many of the measures that must be taken and on which a government of left-center should commit itself have little to do with the macroeconomic side, for which the road is rather obligatory. There can be some differences: for example, I believe that a government of the left would be less disposed to be the best pupil in the class in Europe, on monetary and financial matters, and instead would defend more strongly the interests of industry and workers in its own country. However, the important differences are to be found at the structural level, in the tax structure, government spending, reform of government administration. Let us be clear about rigor. The problem is the an eventual left-center policy runs the risk of being too rigorous. Let me explain with an example: did not a large part of all those votes for Fini in Rome come from government employees angry with Cassese? Is that not rigor? In effect, the policy of left-center recognizes on the one hand that not much can be done at the macroeconomic level, on the other hand it insists on measures of rationalization and structural reform that could be unpopular. [Biello] You are saying that only a government of the left can carry out a policy of the right? [Salvati] It is not a question of right or left. For example, if strong elements of equity and responsibility are introduced into the government administration, a work of justice is accomplished. This is almost a revolutionary decision for the left. The Cassese plan is justice and only justice: it completes equalization of working conditions in the public and the private sectors. So that today a bit of justice goes arm in arm with efficiency. [Biello] And besides government administration? [Salvati] There are situations that separate the two sides. Situations of real social hardships, such as dismissals, for example, about which the left cannot close its eyes and think that they need not be assisted. There are also certain requests, such as flexibility in lay offs, which certainly must be faced, but in a detailed way. A different matter is the attack on injustice, wherever it may be, at the fiscal level, the bureaucracy, or high incomes. Today we have a profoundly unequal distribution of income and the picture of industrial efficiency is desolate. Therefore, supervisory institutions such as the "Antitrust" or the Consob [Commission for the Supervision of Companies and Stock Exchanges] must be greatly strengthened. If there is to be rigor, it must be for everyone. [Biello] Do you favor greater flexibility in the labor market? [Salvati] I do not question certain measures of flexibility. For example, I would be in favor of encouraging "part-time" work, which is substantially ignored in Italy. It would be necessary to discuss others in detail, one by one. [Biello] What do you think of the Confindustria decalogue? [Salvati] I think it was an intelligent and timely political move. Seven or eight of those requests show good sense. The political significance however is: we will abstain from the immediate political struggle and evaluate the facts. It is a responsible and democratic position. [Biello] But what would you respond to the specific points? [Salvati] It would be necessary to go into it in detail. But for the most part, we would agree. [Biello] What are the names of the government team? [Salvati] For certain ministries I would not go further than those in the preceding government, partly to avoid problems. For others, it would not be difficult to find names. The problem is a different one, it is the creation of a new leadership class. [Biello] And Ciampi? [Salvati] He has been useful in this transitional phase. This has been an important government. What happened during this period was amazing: the government, passing the budget bill, and kept on its feet by the Lega and the PDS. [Biello] But could this responsibility shown by the PDS have been only tactical? [Salvati] If being tactical means being responsible, fine. I understand the perplexity of certain observers. However, I do not share certain very skeptical statements by a person I esteem, such as Andreotti. Some of his comments went too far: it is true that, following the logic of the past, the PDS played the game like all the others. But we are in a very different situation now: watch what the PDS does and judge it on that basis.
