The U.S. Administration demands exact minimum import quotas for certain U.S. products from the Japanese in Tokyo. The Japanese Government rejects this. It is understandable that in the long run the United States is concerned about the horrendous Japanese trade surpluses with their own country. However, it is not convincing to claim again and again that the Japanese market is closed. Since the European auto industry sold altogether 1.1 million vehicles in Japan by the end of last year, the reasons for the failure of the U.S. automakers to sell more U.S. cars in Japan are to be found elsewhere. One cannot talk of free world trade if products that are hard to sell are to be pressed into a market in the form of minimum import quotas, as the U.S. Administration is trying to do in Japan. At the same time, one must not fail to see that every solution to that effect finally has to burden suppliers from third countries -- that is, exactly the European industry. Minimum import quotas are a bad relapse into foreign trade regulated by the state.
