Today, accompanied by Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan, Song Jian visited the work site of the Land Information Industry Base inside the New Technology Industrial Development and Experimental Zone in Beijing and discussed with entrepreneurs from privately-run science and technology enterprises. Before discussions got underway, Song Jian extended Spring Festival greetings to the entrepreneurs on behalf of the State Council and the State Science and Technology Commission. He said management at the Beijing Experimental Zone, by taking advantage of the state's preferential policy and by adopting an flexible operating mechanism, has seen rapid development in the zone. In it there were now a number of science and technology enterprises including the Stone Group, Lianxiang, Fangzheng, Jinghai, Huasheng, Huake which had attracted attention both inside and outside China. The Beijing Experimental Zone was taking the lead among the nation's 52 science and technology development zones. Song Jian said one of the results of China's reform of the science and technology structure was the vigorous search for and development of different types of privately run science and technology enterprises. Privately run science and technology enterprises, which had emerged in large numbers lately, had become the driving force for developing the cause of science and technology and for the science and technology industry, and had become an important part of the socialist market economy. Private operations would remain the main form of enterprise in China's science and technology development zones in the future. The state would continue to work toward the rapid development of big, privately run enterprises engaged in the development of new and high technology. Song Jian also expressed the hope that operators of privately run enterprises, as commanders of the "field army" of China's rising science and technology industry, would work out strategies and be prepared to wage a major campaign. For privately run enterprises to develop, it was necessary for them to persist in developing high technology; to train their own research and development personnel; to rely on science and technology to get ahead of others in market competition; to maintain and develop superiority; to rapidly expand production and scale of operation and enhance economic strength; to develop the international market and take part in international competition through cooperation with financial institutions and with domestic or foreign counterparts; to further improve enterprise management; to study advanced foreign management theories, systems, and methods; and to train professional management personnel so that the production and operation of enterprises would be adapted to the requirements of socialist production. In conclusion, Song Jian said that to promote the development of high technology industry, and to bring about the launch of China's national economy mainly through reliance on the new and high technology industry, the state would adopt measures to create a more relaxed environment for the development of new and high technology industry development zones and encourage more scientists and technicians, scientific research institutes, and institutes of higher education to run private high technology enterprises.
