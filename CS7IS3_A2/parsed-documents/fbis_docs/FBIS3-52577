A spokesman for IM in London told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that "over the past two days, a large IM force occupied the mountain range of Ahmad Awah" overlooking the road between the towns of al-Sulaymaniyah and Halabjah near the borders with Iran. He added that the villages of "Balkhah, Ahmad Awah, Byara, and Tawilah are now under the control of IM forces" and that the IM forces "have killed or wounded no less than 15 PUK members and taken prisoner 25 others." PUK sources denied that, but said that "limited fighting" took place the day before yesterday near the village of Tawilah on the border with Iran. They added that "remnants of the IM along with some members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard attacked the village but were immediately driven out of it." According to the same sources, the "IM remnants are trying to regroup inside Iranian territory with the help of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard." [passage omitted] In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Dr. Barham Salih, member of the PUK and "Kurdistan region government" representative in Washington, said that his party "which was compelled to fight the IM" did not wish to end the IM "as a political oraganization.... We just want it to comply with the decisions and laws of the (Kurdish) parliament and government, and to operate in accordance with the law organizing freedom of partisan action in Kurdistan, which prohibits the presence of armed party militias outside the framework of the unified Kurdistan army."
