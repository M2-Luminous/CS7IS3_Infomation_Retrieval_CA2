Hata told reporters early Tuesday he will make a last-ditch appeal to the SDP, the largest component in the coalition, to drop its decision, which would strip a new coalition government of a crucial majority of seats in the 511-member House of Representatives. Hata added he is ready to meet SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama at any time over the matter. Political sources said Hata will appeal to middle-of-the-road and right-wing members of the SDP to take part in the coalition if the party does not reverse the decision. Hata and the coalition leaders are also likely to maneuver to gain support from elements of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the sources added. Non-SDP coalition party leaders are scheduled to discuss the situation at 10 a.m. [0100 GMT] Tuesday morning in the wake of the SDP's announcement. On Tuesday morning Murayama reiterated the party's determination to leave the coalition in protest at the abrupt formation of a new 130-member parliamentary group named Kaishin in the lower house by five groups, including Hata's Shinseito. The SDP views the formation of Kaishin as a "breach of trust" by its coalition partners, because it was not consulted about the new group. Murayama stated the SDP's position in an interview on a Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) television news program. But he was very cautious about seeking an early general election in the middle of an economic slowdown. The SDP will formally decide to withdraw from the coalition at an emergency meeting of its central executive committee at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, SDP officials said. Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, one of key coalition strategists, told reporters early Tuesday morning that Hata will definitely form a new cabinet despite the SDP's departure from the coalition. The LDP is also scheduled to have an executive meeting Tuesday morning on how to cope with the newly emerged situation, with the focus on maintaining its unity, LDP officials said. A large-scale reshuffle of cabinet ministers is expected because the SDP had six cabinet ministers in the coalition cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Hata's policy speech to the Diet scheduled for Tuesday afternoon has been postponed because of the delay of forming the new cabinet, Diet officials said.
