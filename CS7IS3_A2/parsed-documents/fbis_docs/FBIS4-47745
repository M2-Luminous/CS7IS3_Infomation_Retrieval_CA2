"The air agreement should be concluded first for the two nations to promote bilateral relations including exchanges of personnel and goods," Choe said. South Africa finished its first multiracial elections late last month and is counting the ballots to form a new government, which will formally put an end to apartheid. Nelson Mandela's African National Congress had captured more than half of the vote after the counting of 32 percent of the ballots. "South Korean businessmen have been reluctant to invest in South Africa because there has been a lot of political violence, robberies and other crimes in the country. "But crime and political violence may drop considerably after a democratic government is established and reconciliation between blacks and whites is realized," the ambassador said.
