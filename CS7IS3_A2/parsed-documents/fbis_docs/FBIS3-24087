Nugmanov: "The Chairman Has Reported and Announced a Recess"] [Text] The Kazan City Soviet 17th Session, which opened on 2 March, worked literally for several hours. Of the packed agenda containing more than a dozen items, only the first may be considered settled. A report on the socioeconomic and political situation in the capital of the republic was delivered by Kamil Iskhakov, chairman of the Kazan City Soviet and chief of the city administration. Having, after the report, answered deputies' questions, he announced that the session would suspend business until 16 March. The reason for the recess is preparation for the approaching elections. But was it in this case worth opening the session prior to 13 March at all? The information communicated from the platform of the session was of interest inasmuch as it analyzed the present socioeconomic and political situation that has taken shape as of the present in Kazan and attempted in respect to certain items to find a way out of the difficult situation. K. Iskhakov devoted a large part of his speech to problems of the defense enterprises, which are experiencing a sharp--almost 23 percent--fall in production and a wholesale reduction in orders. Despite the measures that are being adopted--a number of fair-exhibitions with the participation of the defense enterprises and the enlistment on a competitive basis of the potential of the military-industrial complex in a solution of the crisis in agriculture--and despite loans obtained in accordance with a bill of exchange of the National Bank of the Republic of Tatarstan, the situation remains very difficult. But things have become somewhat easier for "defense" following the signing of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan. There has been a change in attitude toward the problems of our republic in "high" Moscow offices, and there is hope that the difficulties of Tatarstan's military-industrial complex will gradually be surmounted. A whole set of most acute problems has built up in capital construction, public utilities, and power engineering. Despite the multibilllion-ruble injections, for the first time last year not a single key-ready preschool was handed over. The returns on R1 of invested capital in construction are currently only 36-39 kopeks. The wear and tear on the service lines of the municipal economy has increased, and basic housing availability has declined, and extremely little new housing is being commissioned. The privatization of industrial facilities is not justifying our hopes. As experience shows, the formation out of the enterprises of stock companies has been no panacea against the crisis. Touching on the fulfillment of the recently adopted program for fighting crime, the chairman of the city soviet observed that approximately R1.5 billion had been invested in it already, that the numbers of the Kazan militia were increased in the past year by 1,200 persons, and that a growth of its ranks by a further 1,000 officers in the present year was contemplated. Although positive trends in the crime-solving rate has emerged, we expect of the law enforcement authorities more effective work. Many difficulties still have to be overcome in the accomplishment of social tasks and an improvement in the system of tax collection. As of today the arrears of the city budget constitute R59 billion, and the next item after the recess will be the session's consideration of the question of Kazan's budget.
