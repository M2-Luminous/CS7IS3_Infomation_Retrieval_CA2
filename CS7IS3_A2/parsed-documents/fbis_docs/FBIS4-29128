Our Democratic Kampuchea delegation attends this meeting of the roundtable commission -- which was born of the roundtable meeting under the lofty chairmanship of His Majesty [H.M.] King Norodom Sihanouk in Pyongyang on 27 May -- with a profound will to continue the process and efforts to achieve national reconciliation, national union, and genuine peace in Cambodia. The roundtable is the inspiration of the king, who initiated this with a resolute desire to see the Cambodian motherland achieve national reconciliation, national union, and permanent peace so that all his children can live and earn a living normally. II. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] fully assists and supports the king's astute initiative because national reconciliation and national concord to unite all national forces and genuine and permanent peace in Cambodia are the sacred and profound aspirations of our entire nation and people at home and abroad. The Cambodian nation and people [words indistinct] do not need war. The war of more than a decade has made our nation and people go through great suffering and destruction. Therefore, whatever is making the war continue does not correspond to the interests of our nation and people. All kinds of problems, national and social, which are already serious, will worsen. War brings outside interference and allows foreigners an opportunity to split the nation and fuel the war even more. These are great dangers directly affecting the suvival of our Cambodian nation, people, and race. As the king has reminded us, war will lead Cambodia to death, peace and national reconciliation will lead us to national survival. The king has shown that the way to save the nation and prevent it from extinction has only one magic formula: national reconciliation and union. As long as there are meetings and discussions, gradual results, be they small or large, will be achieved. The samdech royal representative: III. Our PDK delegation is happy with this meeting of the roundtable commission. We agree with the two items on the agenda set up by H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk on 5 June. These are: 1. Discussion of the unconditional, immediate, and permanent cease-fire throughout the country; 2. Discussion of the minimal policy program for national reconciliation and peace. The two items are due for discussion at this meeting and at subsequent meetings of our roundtable commission because they are topical issues that have to be discussed. IV. Concerning the item on the cease-fire, H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk has asked for a yes or no reply. Therefore, we would like to express our view on this matter in accordance with the king's question. We, the PDK, are happy to have a cease-fire. We are happy for a cease-fire, now, we have been in the past, and we will be in the future because the PDK, like the rest of the nation and people, has been the victim. The PDK does not want to wage war and fight. The Cambodian nation and people do not want fighting and war. We want the war to end quickly and we want to achieve national reconciliation and peace quickly. We hold that it is necessary to establish a genuine and permanent cease-fire throughout the nation with proper and adequate control over the commission or technical group to be set up for this purpose. V. On the minimal policy program, our view is that to achieve national reconciliation in accordance with the profound will and aspiration of our nation and people, all parties ought to compromise and make mutual concessions. We hold that to achieve national reconciliation and national union, all of us ought to have an acceptable basis on which to work together. On this basis, we will discuss together what the PDK should give to the two-prime ministers government and what the latter should give to the PDK. The samdech royal representative: VI. We hold that in the past, now, and in the future, all of us should put national reconciliation and national concord above everything else and strive to meet to discuss and gradually achieve results until we reach full achievement. In this spirit, we would like to propose that our roundtable commission meet once or twice a month from now on. Finally, we wish for good results from the meeting of our roundtable commission, chaired by the samdech royal representative, to move toward achieving national reconciliation and to rally all Cambodian national forces so that Cambodia has peace and that every Cambodian can live and earn a living peacefully forever.
