Aryirou--passages in parentheses published in English] [Text] London--With the confidence-building measures, the return of all refugees to their homes and property is being sacrificed and the Cyprus problem is being restricted to the Famagusta issue. This is the appraisal of [UK] constitutional expert Mrs. Claire Palley, a consultant for the Cyprus Government. According to our information from official Cyprus Government documents, Mrs. Palley has recommended against accepting the confidence-building measures. "For a desert that belongs to them," the English constitutional expert says (meaning Famagusta), "the return of all the Greek Cypriot refugees is being sacrificed." The English constitutional expert also accuses the other experts whom the government has used of giving distorted opinions because they were ignorant of international law. Commenting on the confidence-building measures, Mrs. Palley maintains: "All the refugees will be sacrificed for the return of a desert area, that is, Varosha (to get the return of a desert to which its owners are entitled, all other Greek Cypriot refugees are being sacrificed-- what used to be called Famagustization of the Cyprus problem).'' Mrs. Palley also reproaches the experts whom the Cyprus Government used as consultants on the confidence-building measures and accuses them of naivete on matters of international law. The English constitutional expert says that their opinion ("...just proves the legal and political incompetence of the experts") and adds: "The experts' naivete in international law is revealed," [quotation published in English] and that ("ignorance of international law is revealed by purported factual statements").
