"Apathy and indifference to the present-day developments are rapidly spreading to growing numbers of Russians. They are losing respect for any form of power: for the reformer president, for `tough economically-minded' premier and for legislators who now know `their place' well. "What can be expected after the end of the summer interval in the Russian political life? According to the most optimistic forecasts, both politics and economy will gradually sink into a state of stagnation which can continue for long months. "The president will pay no attention to permanent parliamentary wrangles and the government -- to trade union ultimatums and pickets. If such a situation will stabilise, it may turn advantageous (due to some reasons) for most political forces. Nobody will want to take the risk of upsetting the balance." The same newspaper writes the following in another article: "Everyone sees now the vital need for setting up a `flexible' centre for pooling all social democrats and socialists to exchange information and for discussions. "Mikhail Gorbachev's participation would be also desirable in such a centre: His name has become a double symbolic borderline of a kind, dividing the centre-left space from communists, on the one hand, and from liberals, on the other. "This structure would become not only a discussion club for Russian social democrats. It would enable us, at long last, to participate in the international movement on a regular basis, including the socialist international, contacts with which convince Russian politicians that, until Russia has only disunited parties and groups, nobody will speak with them seriously." NEZAVISIMAYA also claims that "head of the president's office Sergey Filatov who remained at his post only thanks to a ballyhoo raised concerning his possible resignation, decided to prove his worthiness to Boris Yeltsin in the recent past. "According to Filatov's plan, it is necessary to have a subdivision (some 120 staffers) in the president's office, which will launch even now a campaign for a new Russian president --Boris Yeltsin." According to information available to the newspaper, many former legislators of "democratic" orientation received proposals to join this subdivision. Some of them refused, not in a very proper form at that. Referring to a statement by deputy chairman of the state statistics committee Aris Zakharov, the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA newspaper writes that "industrial production in Russia dropped by 26 per cent over the past five months. "While the fall amounted to 12 per cent in the fuel and energy complex, its figure stood at 22 per cent in the food industry, 45 in machine-building and 35 per cent in the chemical and petrochemical industries. "Every fourth major or medium industrial enterprise in Russia stood idle for more than one shift in may. Whereas a shortage of material resources was the main reason for the drop last year, difficulties with marketing and the problem of non-payments were to blame this year." ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA also reports that "former Russian Prosecutor- General Alexey Kazannik and his supporters from the Urals-Siberian region are establishing a party of people's conscience. Its first congress will be held in Yekaterinburg on Friday. "Preparatory documents say that the party intends to direct its efforts at conducting a scientifically substantiated policy of reforms and forming competent governing structures, including the government. The party intends to announce right away their `constructive opposition' to the present authorities of the country." The same newspaper runs an interview with Komi Republic President Yuriy Spiridonov who regards struggle against bureaucratic omnipotence as his main goal. "Small and big bureaucrats are our main enemies as well as the enemy of all Russia," he said. "The most spectacular projects and initiatives are scrapped at the level of a bureaucrat. Mr. or Mrs. Smiths often have powers incomparable with the power of minister or president." The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper informs its readers that 7,948 people fell ill with diphtheria between last January and April, or 3.5 times more than over the corresponding period last year. The incidence of the infectious disease in Moscow is two or four times higher than the country's average. The same newspaper reports that the last terrorist out of four who captured hostages at a prison in Yekaterinburg surrendered to law enforcement officers. All hostages were freed. One terrorist was killed during the operation, and another escaped. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports that law enforcement bodies exposed eight serious crimes over the past 24 hours. According to the public relations centre of the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS), the Moscow FCS department completed a multi-stage operation to bust a gun-running mob which supplied the Moscow region with firearms. The same newspaper expresses an opinion by chairman of the Russian Social Democratic Party Anatoliy Golov about former Vice- President Aleksandr Rutskoy's party. "I'd like to remind our new colleagues that social democrats are reformers in their essence rather than revolutionaries," he notes. "Regrettably, `popular' social democrats are closer, in spirit, to Pamyat (eds: nationalist organisation). I'm afraid that they will want to call themselves a national social democratic party with time." Despite a refutation from Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov, the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper, referring to reliable sources in the Russian Government, continues to assert that "quarters close to President Boris Yeltsin decided, in principle, the question of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's resignation for health reasons and the appointment of Yuriy Skokov to this post". The PRAVDA newspaper features an interview with Dmitriy Olshanskiy, director of the Strategic Analysis and Forecast Centre and co-chairman of the Russian Patriotic Movement "People's Alliance", who says: "People got tired of politics and stopped treating it seriously. "The time of rallies has passed. It is time to come to agreement inside the political elite. Zyuganov's communists understand this. Indeed, neither Yeltsin, nor Yerin nor still anybody else stand at the helm of the state but elite forces--analysts, financiers and politicians--they rule the roost." Some 100 enterprises will be offered at voucher auctions in St. Petersburg till the end of June, including two huge shopping centres and munitions factories, reports the SANKT-PETERBURGSKIE VEDOMOSTI newspaper.
