This figure shows a radical change in the trend in unemployment, since there was a net increase in the number of jobs being created for the first time since the crisis began. Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra asserted yesterday that "there are now signs of economic recovery which make it possible to say we have rounded the corner in the crisis and the worst is over." Nevertheless, he emphasized that unless society as a whole -- government, trade unions, and employers -- continues to keep up a considerable effort, it will not be possible to maintain sustained growth as a job-promoting factor. Speaking to Spanish National Radio, Serra said that the February unemployment figures, which the Labor Ministry will present officially Saturday, "will represent the beginning of a radical change in the trend in unemployment in Spain." Nevertheless, this recovery in employment has not been enough to absorb the increase in the working population. Serra stated that the fact that the first signs of recovery are appearing is causing a larger number of citizens to register at INEM offices. This is why the number of unemployed will continue to rise, although at a much more moderate rate. "The number of unemployed will begin to fall significantly during the summer months, which is when there is the greatest activity in services." The Labor Ministry emphasizes that the most significant thing about February is that for the first time there is a net increase in employment, since the number of enterprises' labor contracts exceeds the number of job losses. Net Jobs Are Created The second indicator of the labor market's recovery comes from the increase in social security contributors, whose numbers grew for the first time by 71,000 contributors. It must be pointed out that this rise comes after a systematic fall for 24 months, which represented a drop of over 800,000 contributors. According to government sources, this improvement in the labor market is due to a recovery in the economic situation and to the first fruits which the new apprenticeship and practical training contracts are producing. Up to 20 February, 35,000 contracts of these kinds were signed. These figures show that there has been no "replacement effect," as the trade unions have been maintaining. According to the available figures, it is not true that enterprises have dismissed permanent workers in order to hire apprentices. Labor Minister Jose Antonio Grinan said in the Congress [of Deputies] lobbies yesterday that February's figures represent the breaking of a trend for unemployment to rise. "While waiting to learn the official figures, it must be stated that February was hopeful, since this month is traditionally bad for employment, and yet there was a net increase." After asserting that the new forms of hiring "are going very well," he stressed that, contrary to the fears expressed by various sectors, apprentices have not replaced permanent workers, since "the number of of apprentices coincides with the increase in hiring which has occurred in general." He emphasized the construction sector's good performance and expressed his confidence that "the trend will continue over the next few months." On the economic situation, Narcis Serra believes that the signs the recovery has begun have been reflected not just in the trend in the labor market but in industrial activity, car sales, cement and power consumption, and the sharp fall in interest rates.
