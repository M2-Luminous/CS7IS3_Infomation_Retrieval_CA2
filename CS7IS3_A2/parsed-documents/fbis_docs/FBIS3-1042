Addressing several thousand Zulus in Ulundi, he reiterated he could not recommend to his loyal subjects that they vote in the April poll. "I call on all Zulus to unite in the name of the kingdom of kwaZulu. I call on all Zulus to fulfil their sacred duty to defend our freedom and sovereignty to anyone in southern Africa who dares to challenge it." He alleged State President F.W. de Klerk's "contingency plans" for the Natal/kwaZulu region entailed the deployment of security forces "to clamp down on my people should they choose not to participate in the elections". Elections under the interim constitution were "an immediate denial of our claim for sovereignty and self-determination". "I find it quite impossible to recommend that any of my subjects who are loyal to the throne should participate in the forthcoming election, unless this matter (a sovereign Zulu kingdom) is settled." The king said Zulus had gathered in Ulundi on Friday to proclaim before the world their freedom and sovereignty, and their unwavering will to defend these at all costs. He revealed that recent discussions between himself and Mr de Klerk on the Zulu king's claims had made little progress, adding the government had denied sovereignty to the Zulu nation and would not restore a sovereign kwaZulu kingdom. "Under the terms of a final proposal of the South African Government, the Zulu nation and the kingdom of kwaZulu are left at the mercy of the unitary state established by the 1993 constitution. We have reached the end of a road and we are faced with the harsh reality that the SA Government cannot and will not facilitate the restoration of the sovereign kingdom of kwaZulu." Zulus were faced with an historical dilemma of either succumbing and forever relinquishing their sovereignty or to take it upon themselves "and bring into existence what is ours, what belongs to our fathers and what belonged to our children". The king alleged Mr de Klerk had threatened to deploy his security forces if Zulus did not vote in the April poll. "I protest for the betrayals that the Zulu nation have suffered from President de Klerk again and again."
