Such a statement was made in an interview with INTERFAX on Tuesday by the Foreign Ministry's Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin following accusations made in the course of congressional hearings in the U.S. recently. He reported that in keeping with an intergovernmental memorandum on chemical agents, Russia and U.S. had exchanged data on their military and chemical potentials in May. "This data is being studied and analyzed in Russia and the U.S. after which, in accordance with the memorandum, each country will carry out five inspections of the other country's facilities. This will enable them to make sure that the data is correct," Karasin said. He said Russian experts note that the information received from the American side needs to be clarified. "We believe that the proper channels of interaction should be used if these doubts are to be removed."
