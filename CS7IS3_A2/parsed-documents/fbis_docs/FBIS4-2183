For a while, "fighting against corruption" appeared in the newspaper almost everyday and was quoted quite frequently in Chinese political life. Foreign media generally believed that China was unleashing another attack at corruption. Results Scored by Anticorruption Drive '93 Marks the Completion of One Stage Broadly speaking, anticorruption work in 1993 consisted of three main tasks: Leading cadres maintaining self-discipline and staying clean themselves; investigation of serious and important cases; and correcting unhealthy practices in trades and professions. It can safely be said that in all three tasks the planned objectives have been achieved. The requirement of staying clean and maintaining self-discipline for leading party and government cadres at or above the county and departmental levels stood out as more important than the other two parts in 1993 anticorruption work. The requirement was made directly of leading cadres at the county and departmental levels. Media generally believed that this was the key as well as the difficult point for the three main tasks and would determine the outcome of the struggle. It was also the area which the masses were most concerned about. Stories from authoritative organs show that leading groups at or above the county and departmental levels across the country all made self-inspection in terms of "11 prohibitions" in 1993, and dealt with the problems thus uncovered according to relevant provisions. Leading cadres throughout the country handed in a great variety of gifts and largess: renminbi, Hong Kong dollars, US dollars, credit cards, various high-grade merchandise such as cameras, wristwatches, small video cameras, miniature color televisions, and gold coins, necklaces, rings, scissors, monkeys, and rams. In Shanghai, 318 bureau-rank cadres returned largess, gifts, credit cards, and securities worth about 272,900 yuan. News from Hunan revealed that by early November 1993, 18,000 cadres at or above the county and departmental levels in the province had by themselves uncovered 2,563,700 yuan of largess and securities, 3,380 Hong Kong dollars, 14 gold necklaces, 39 gold rings, 26 miniature televisions, 21 cameras, and so on. Concentrating on investigating serious and important cases was the second of the three parts of anticorruption work in 1993. The central authorities demanded vigorously pursuit of law- and discipline-breaking cases perpetuated by leading party and government organs, leading cadres, and judiciary, administrative and law-enforcement organs, especially cases involving serious abuses of power. Notable results were scored in this area. Localities and departments investigated and handled a number of cases: Xu Zhonghe, former mayor of Ruzhou City, Henan, accepted and solicited some 475,000 yuan in property and embezzled 10,000 yuan in public funds. Hong Yonglin, former chief of the Huizhou City Public Security Bureau, Guangdong, accepted 914,000 Hong Kong dollars and 348,000 yuan in bribes, and failed to account for another 1.444 million Hong Kong dollars and 693,000 yuan. Chen Binggen, former head of the Shenzhen City Housing and Property Administration, accepted a bribe of 12,000 yuan and a house and embezzled 110,000 yuan. Cases involving staff in law-enforcement and supervisory organs are as follows: Li Jianhui, an inspector of lieutenant rank with the Beijing Municipality Border Defense Bureau, and Zhao Dong, a deputy section head of major rank and a lieutenant-ranking inspector Wang Lin at the same bureau, accepted a total of 1,601,800 yuan in bribes. Parasites in the banking sector include: Xue Gen, former accountant at the Dongfeng Office of the Haikou Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and co-conspirator Chen Yiquan together accepted 33.44 million yuan of corrupt money. Feng Yang, former financial planning section head of the Huzhou City Trust and Investment Company of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and his co-conspirator Xu Jianxin together accepted 5.1 million yuan of corrupt money. Luo Yuhai, a former staff member of the operation section of the Bank of China head office, took some $400,000 in bribes and embezzled some $776,000 public funds.... Other economic crimes include: Wu Weidong, former transport section head of the material supply company of the China Huabei Electric Power Allied Corporation, took some 498,000 yuan in bribes. Guo Min, former operations section head of the Beijing Branch of the China National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation, took some 960,000 yuan and embezzled some 880,000 yuan public funds. The Supreme People's Court upheld in the first half of November the death sentences for the five main offenders in million yuan corruption cases, who are: Lu Lanzhen, Liu Guifen, Jiang Jiaxu, Li Qiang, and Chen Haiqiang. The investigation and bringing to justice of once-notorious corrupt elements greatly enhanced the deterrent power of law and discipline, prompting hundreds with serious economic offenses to confess and surrender themselves to law- and discipline-enforcement organs. The third job in the 1993 anticorruption drive was to curtail a few unhealthy practices which the masses had reacted to most strongly. Following the second plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, administrative fees charged by central state organs since 1991 were screened, and some considered to be arbitrary levies were subsequently revoked over time. In the second half of October, the Ministry of Railway was the first to cancel 272 unreasonable charges and stop 84 surcharges levied on behalf of local governments. In the first half of November, the Ministry of Finance and State Planning Commission jointly announced the abolition nationwide of the first batch of fees, 75 in all, charged by the eight departments of public security, labor, personnel, railway, transport, post and telecommunications, banking, and civil aviation. In the second half of the same month, the State Education Commission abolished 21 arbitrary fees in secondary and primary education, and localities screened and abolished arbitrary local fees. Regarding curbing publicly sponsored overseas trips (or those outside the borders), figures from 21 central departments, 11 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities show that up to mid-November, 1993, 715 publicly sponsored travel groups of about 7,555 people were canceled, saving the state enormous amounts of foreign exchange. By the end of the year, the unhealthy practice of sponsoring overseas (or outside-the-border) travel with public money had basically been halted. Many professions and trade also singled out and dealt with unhealthy practices the masses reacted to strongly, and scored notable results. The railway sector dealt with the procurement of personal gain by illegitimately offering freight cars and train tickets; the post and telecommunications sector did the same with abuses in telephone installations; the banking sector dealt with the same problem with loans and discounts; the publication sector tackled the problem of "selling ISBN [book] numbers"; the news sector was against "news stories written for a price"; the public health sector addressed the problem of medical workers accepting "red packets"; agricultural departments made efforts to reduce peasant burdens, and so on. All these efforts addressed people's complaints and improved relations between the people and the party and government. There Are Still Problems We Cannot Ignore All the three anticorruption tasks in 1993 achieved their targets. But there are still problems we cannot ignore, and the anticorruption mission remains very arduous. Regarding cadres staying clean and maintaining self-discipline, some cadres are not taking this requirement seriously enough, or are just going through the motions. One situation that is often seen is: Revealing lesser offenses and avoiding serious ones or those that have been seen and not those that have not been seen, and addressing general problems instead of particular aspects of them. Some cadres revealed that they had received gifts such as fountain pens, briefcases, neckties, and shirts; but not cash, gift coupons, credit cards, and high-quality consumer goods. Some admitted to the things and money they had received from attending ribbon-cutting and various ceremonies, but not those secretly sent to their homes. Some looked at only the general aspect of the problem, such as grass-root cadres accepting party invitations and indigenous and special gifts such as tea and fruit, but not benefits and advantages received by individuals. In short, most of the problems exposed did nothing to the reputation or interests of the accused; only a few were followed with rectification, refunds, or investigation. Some localities and departments refused to meet the central authorities' requirement of soliciting mass opinion prior to regular democratic-style party activity meetings, and failed to ask discipline inspection committees and organizational departments of a higher level to attend such meetings and to report to the masses the results of self-inspection. They only conducted such meetings perfunctorily, blatantly just going through the motion. We should draw our attention to this situation: The monitoring mechanisms of supervisory departments do not follow closely enough the state of cadres staying clean and maintaining self-discipline. As a norm for conduct and education, staying clean and maintaining self-discipline is a measure that relies only on self-awareness. As such, its effect is very limited, and almost none for people with serious problems. That is why it has been called a method "binding only on gentlemen, not on scoundrels." So far self-inspection and self-correction have not made any corrupt elements come forward with confessions of their wrongdoings. Extra-judicial pleas for mercy seriously obstruct investigations into big and important cases, making the investigations very difficult. This is a glaring problem in current anticorruption struggle. The popular practice of pleading for mercy points to many deep-seated problems. First, there is not a direct command chain running from top to bottom in the supervisory system. Judiciary and discipline inspection organs are under and run by local authorities, much of their work depends on the support and help of various departments. When someone pleads for an accused, especially when he is a leading cadre, the investigators are under pressure to weigh up the matter, thus affecting the impartiality of their investigation. Second, there is nothing in our law and discipline to stop or curb extra-judicial pleading. The person who pleads for an accused does not commit any crime or a discipline-breaking act, but he may gain gratitude without too much effort. Third, in some departments and units, some people are actively building personal networks, forming factions and sects, resulting in a situation of "officials protecting each other." As regards correcting unhealthy practices in trades and professions, there are the following situations: Orders and bans are openly defied in some localities; some people have reined themselves in but are waiting for a chance to spring into action again. The central authorities and departments have issued circulars stipulating the items on which arbitrary charges are to be stopped, only to see them ignored by local authorities, who have continued to charge arbitrarily. Some local authorities committed fraud and forgery in order to legalize their arbitrary charges. A county falsely reported its per-capita income to be twice as high as its actual amount to make it look as if the money it levied in fund raising was no more than five percent of its per-capita income, as set by the State Council. These problems cannot be ignored if the fight against corruption is to be pursued on a long-term basis and to come up with results. Further Improve Policies, Laws, and Regulations One big problem in the current anticorruption effort is the lack of explicit legal and policy provisions on new problems thrown up by changes in the economic situation. Some policy and legal provisions are too rigid and not amenable to application. Of the "11 prohibitions" concerning leading cadres staying clean and maintaining self-discipline made in last year's fight against corruption, people had complained most strongly against "prohibiting stock trading." First, though leading cadres were barred from buying stocks, there were no explicit bans on stock purchases by their spouses and sons and daughters. Second, there were no provisions stating whether there were refunds for returned internal worker stocks. Third, the spirit of the relevant regulations was that cadres at or above county and departmental levels with government duties were barred from buying or selling stocks. But there were no specific provisions advising ways to deal with changes in the identity of stockholders. A discipline inspection cadre in charge of stock screening told this writer the following similar cases: A person was transferred to a government unit, where he now works, after he had purchased some stock as a leading cadre in an enterprise; another was a serving cadre when buying stocks, though now he is retired; a cadre -- a department head -- was the head of a section when he bought in stocks; and a cadre had bought stocks before being demoted from department head to section head for some mistakes he made. It has been said that the ranking was not a scientific guideline deciding who can and cannot trade in stocks. Some section head-rank cadres wield enormous powers, and there are strong complaints against failure to inspect their corrupt behavior. There is also the question of properly defining high consumption. Are the many local authorities' policies of rewarding bids that have successfully attracted capital and projects in order to develop local economies to be counted as paid intermediary activity? How do we handle the capital (from government unit investments, bank loans, money raised by cadres, and so on) sunk into party- or government-sponsored economic entities? All these problems call for investigations and study, corresponding measures, and explicit policies and legal provisions. Anticorruption Efforts Must Solve Deep-Seated Problems The fight against corruption is a long-term, arduous, and complicated mission. For it to get real results, it is necessary to create a supervision and management system at a deep level. Regarding supervision, our guiding thought has been that most of the people are good, and only a very few need to be punished. The shortcoming of such thinking becomes obvious when used to guide the effort to correct unhealthy practices. Most people caught in unhealthy practices are involved in general, minor corruption offenses. If we concentrate on only corrupt elements and leave most of the people unguarded, we would be letting these people committing minor corruption offenses escape our supervision, in effect encouraging them to continue making offenses. This is the reason many units, especially monopolies, law-enforcement and supervisory departments, and positions with financial or personnel powers, have without exception, many anticorruption provisions, which, however, were enacted to fool inspection from higher levels rather than supervise and bind the leaders themselves to rules. These anticorruption rules are written on paper and posted on walls, but are hardly implemented. In particular, when unhealthy practices such as arbitrary levies are linked with the awards, welfare, and work conditions of a unit, these unhealthy practices will be hardened into interest group behavior and become even more entrenched for the unit to do anything on its own. Social supervision, including media and public opinion, has only made vague criticisms and provided general guidance, or has exposed some typical incidents, none of which has had much practical supervisory impact on widespread unhealthy practices. As for management, the biggest loophole is that under the new situation, we do not have a full package of methods to ensure rational employment of state-owned assets. In the eyes of many, the least valuable assets are public funds. There have been incidents of reckless spending of public funds, funneling state funds to unit coffers, and lining one's own pocket with public money. So widespread and frequent are these incidents that no amount of prevention and crackdown seem to be able to stop them, with the result that state-owned assets are actually providing the material basis for some unhealthy practices. Regarding the economic structure, changes in governmental functions have been slow. Powers that should be delegated remain concentrated, streamlining and personnel cutbacks have not been carried out, and cumbersome procedures have not been simplified. Economic administrative departments do not coordinate among themselves in work and set up barriers against each other and complicated procedures, lowering efficiency. For their own local or departmental interests and to get things done, people have to "burn incense to pay homage to buddhas," and suffer the consequences if they forget to worship a certain budhha. People compete in holding banquets, giving gifts, and building up networks. The general standards for gifts become "giving the kind of gifts others do not have; new ones when others do have the same; or gifts in amounts larger than those given by my rivals." Gifts become increasingly expensive and banquets more upmarket, and in this twisted competition certain unhealthy practices gain ground and become generally acceptable "normal" behavior. In the area of the financial system, one noted problem is the difficulty of maintaining regular funding for state organ expenditures, especially for organs related to social stability such as the public security apparatus, which has not been getting even remotely enough appropriations. Some public security organs cannot pay travel allowance to their personnel handling women's and children's abduction cases, and have to rely on "arbitrary levies" to subsidize operating expenditure. Such a situation, in which "another loophole appears shortly after one has been plugged," has caused some units to rely on arbitrary levies for both their regular and irregular expenditures. When departments of higher levels cannot solve problems, they can only turn a blind eye, in effect encouraging the unhealthy practice of arbitrary levies. The current travel allowance arrangement for government cadres are also very unreasonable. When a government cadre pays a work visit to organs at a lower level, cadres at that level without exception have to pay for his accommodation and food allowances, which forces them to engage in unhealthy practices. There are also numerous problems in the cadre personnel system. In some units, promotions and dismissals depend entirely on certain individuals. When many who are ideologically unhealthy want to advance their official careers, they become eager to spin relationship networks, look for backers, pave their way by giving gifts, and recklessly spend public funds instead of making real efforts at their work, thus corrupting officialdom and fanning unhealthy practices. There are also numerous loopholes in law and policies. Some tend to be too simple and exist merely as general principles, and therefore fail to clearly define encouragement, permission, and prohibition and areas between them. As such they cannot effectively regulate government workers. The scope and severity of punishments for some law- and discipline-breaking acts vary considerably, are hard to operate under, and therefore mutilate against the purposes of punishment. In particular, there are almost no constraints on collectives intent on engaging in unhealthy practices, with the result that many unhealthy practices are made under the excuse of providing welfare for workers and in the name of units and collectives to ensure that they will not be banned. 1994: The Fight Against Corruption Will Deepen Looking back at the 1993 anticorruption struggle, we have scored certain results in the three tasks proposed by the central authorities. Localities and departments which did well achieved outstanding results in some areas, where various negative and corrupt phenomena have been stopped or curbed. More importantly, through the year's anticorruption effort, people are now more confident. In the second half of February 1994, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection convened its third plenary session to sum up experiences of the early phase of anticorruption drive and plan for anticorruption work in 1994 according central instructions. The anticorruption work this year will have the same format of concentrating on three tasks, which will, however, have new content as the situation has changed. The work of enabling leading cadres of party and government organs at or above the county and departmental level to stay clean and maintain self-discipline will continue to implement last year's "five regulations" and reiterate the following regulations: 1) There is to be no buying or exchanging imported luxury sedans; there is to be no abuse of powers to exchange or borrow cars from enterprises and subordinate units or have them contribute money for car purchases. Cars used by leading cadres cannot be purchased with loans, money from raised funds, or special-purpose appropriations. Leading organs and units at the county (city) level owing workers pay are not allowed to buy sedans. 2) Cadres are not allowed to use their powers to depress prices of residential houses they intend to buy--that will be a violation of the State Council's regulations for housing reforms; or to provide better house buying terms for themselves, their sons or daughters or relatives; or to renovate their own houses with public money on a scale exceeding official limits. 3) Leading cadres must be economical in conducting domestic business travel, their lodging and meals must not cost more than set by local reception standards. No one is allowed to hold functions specially for leading cadres. 4) No one is allowed to make use of his or his family members' weddings, funerals, job transfers, birthdays, or house removals to spend recklessly or too much for the occasion, nor to hold celebrations for these occasions with public money or public property, with or without a view to pocketing money from such celebrations. 5) No one is allowed to use his powers to delay or refuse to pay back public money, to buy or build houses for themselves or their relatives or friends, or to engage profitmaking activities with borrowed public money. Subject to local situations, localities and departments can increase some other regulations as they see fit. Case investigators must remain firm in their insistence on focusing on the law- and discipline-breaking cases involving leading party and government organs, leading cadres, judiciary departments, administrative and law-enforcing departments, and economic administrative departments and their workers. Investigators must concentrate their effort on big and serious cases and focus on bribery, corruption, and power abuse by leading cadres; jobbery, stealing confiscated goods, obstruction of justice, and law and discipline breaking by law and discipline enforcers; and law- and discipline-breaking cases by legal entities. In the effort to correct unhealthy practices in professions and trades, it is necessary to continue to curb arbitrary levies vigorously. The focus is on implementing provisions of the central authorities' policy of "parallel lines between income and expenditure" in connection with administrative fees and income from fines and confiscations, and adopting effective measures to detach economic entities launched by government organs. This year, we also need to seriously screen and tackle the problem of party and government organs and their workers abusing their powers in using firms' cars, computers, and telecommunications without payments, and the problem of whether or not this equipment belongs to organs or individuals; screen and inspect the practice of funneling firms' funds into the pocket of units or spending these funds on workers' welfare under various excuses. We must resolutely curb the bad practice of asking sponsorships from enterprises under various excuses and continue to pursue the task of reducing peasants' burdens. We must conscientiously implement the "circular from the Central Committee General Office, State Council General Office on strictly forbidding overseas (or outside-the-border) travel, in whatever forms, which is sponsored by public funds" jointly issued by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection supervision department and six other departments. Moreover, we must make special efforts to tackle outstanding problems in this regard. The review and approval of travel under the 1994 official overseas (outside-the-border) travel scheme will also be tightened up.
