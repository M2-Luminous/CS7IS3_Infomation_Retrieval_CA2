The reason China does not want to wreck Hong Kong is because in recent years, Hong Kong's industrial and commercial circles have firmly supported the position of the Chinese Government, and the PRC would not wish to see their benefits adversely affected. Therefore, in my personal estimate, the possibility of the Sino-British talks collapsing is not great; even if they did collapse and agreement could not be reached, the resulting impact would not be very great. On the one hand, this is because Hong Kong residents have low expectations that the negotiations would be successful, and the shock of not having any agreement would therefore be correspondingly limited. On the other hand, from a more serious perspective, any agreement that might be reached between the two sides will likely be a tactical rather than strategic agreement; as both sides can no longer cooperate sincerely, any agreement reached will only involve cooperation to the extent that it minimizes damages to both sides while maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. In point of fact, however, beginning in early April, the points of view and observed tendencies among Hong Kong's pro-PRC media have shown that China intends to separate politics from economics, and even if no agreement is reached on the political system, maximum effort will be made in the economic area to maintain cooperation, for example, in approving the land-fill engineering project for the Central District; Wang Qiren [3769 0796 0086], Hong Kong-Macao Affairs Office Deputy Director, has also publicly stated that it is China's intention to continue to support the development of Hong Kong's economy. The above line of reasoning assumes a rosy scenario; that is, even if China and Britain really cannot reach any agreement on the political system, the shock for Hong Kong will not be too great. However, undeniably also is the fact that without an agreement, there will be some side effects. To begin with, Britain will face considerable difficulties in turning the Hong Kong Government over to a Special Administrative Region [SAR] government. The turnover, in and of itself, will involved myriad details, but from the mid-1980s to the present, not a great deal has been accomplished in terms of preparatory work. Now with only a little over three years left before the 1997 turnover, one must wonder whether it will be possible to complete all the necessary preparatory work for the turnover. If the situation should remain unchanged, the SAR government will certainly encounter difficulties during its initial establishment phase in 1996 and 1997. Furthermore, the lack of any agreement will impact on the rank and file civil servants in Hong Kong. Under the circumstances in which Britain and China cannot cooperate with any degree of sincerity, how can these civil servants concentrate on their work? Will the status of senior civil servants be maintained? The highest-ranking civil servants have various options, namely, to leave, to emigrate or to stay and join the private sector in industries or commerce. It can thus be anticipated that without any agreement the civil servants will have no basis for making suitable plans. Furthermore, as the Hong Kong Government becomes increasingly a "lame duck" government, it will have even greater difficulties gaining majority support in the Legislative Council. At the same time, as the Hong Kong Government must perforce concentrate on managing the difficult Sino-British relationship, it will also have to devote what energy it has left to solve the larger issues of people's livelihood, and many problems such as housing (particularly the problem of subdivided, multi-storied buildings) will become even more difficult to handle. Another example is medical services, where the whole set of concepts is no longer applicable; with costs of medical care continuing their upward climb, the per-bed intensive care cost is over a thousand Hong Kong dollars but patients now pay only some 40 dollars; the government in fact will not be able to continue to provide large scale subsidies to medical care, and without such government support, the standard of medical services will certainly decline. The government should encourage the younger generations to purchase their own medical insurance before this problem can fundamentally be solved. But if the government lacks the political will, how can it proceed to institute such reform? Confronted with [challenges of] the 1990s, the Hong Kong government should have new policy measures to deal with such issues, but the government has dragged its feet, not getting adequate support from the Legislative Council to take any action, and leaving many social problems of people's livelihood begging for solutions. We can well imagine in the days to come, the government will need to cope with the 1994 and 1995 elections on the one hand, and with the transition in 1996-97 on the other; larger issues of people's livelihood may well have to be put off to the next century before they can be dealt with. Aside from the above, in a situation of Sino-British contention, with two clearly defined camps facing each other, both sides may well lack the ability to compromise. The closer we get to 1997, the stronger the pro-China forces will become; among them, some political parties may well decline to take part in elections, and the democratic faction facing no opposition will score another big win. This type of situation will make things much more difficult, for while it is normal for any political party to win big under normal competitive circumstances, the situation would be much more complicated if the victory was the result of elections boycotted by other political parties. Naturally, if the Sino-British relationship should really deteriorate, some economic projects will of course face great difficulties, such as the No. 9 container dock and the new airport. But the major difficulties will be on the Chinese side, because under the circumstance of mutual suspicion and extreme non-cooperation, it will not be easy at all to reach agreement on any individual economic projects; this is not so much a case of the Chinese side refusing to grant permission, but when China and Britain distrust each other, no Chinese official would dare take on the responsibility to approve any individual economic projects. As for the stock and real estate markets, Hong Kong people have gradually adapted themselves to the Sino-British disputes, and will not attach great importance to the lack of an agreement. For after all, any agreement will only be a tactical move, and given the fact that 1997 is close at hand, the importance of an agreement is declining daily. Major investors pay even less attention to the question of Sino-British cooperation or to 1997, since the factor they most emphasize is still the future development potential of China. If China continues to reform and open up, and remains a good place to invest, then these investors would basically pay no attention to the Sino-British dispute; were they to behave otherwise, investment activities in Hong Kong in recent years would certainly have been affected; yet on the contrary, the stock market and real estate market have continued to score new highs. Based on present development, unless Chinese economic adjustments hit rock bottom, and that coming on top of the Sino-British dispute, Hong Kong would not be affected to any serious extent.
