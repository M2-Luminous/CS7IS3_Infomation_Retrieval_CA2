A statement issued by the Interior Ministry in Tehran yesterday pointed out that the Chinese citizen, whose identity is not known yet, was working on the uranium mining project in Rudan. The policy of developing uranium resources is considered part of Iran's nuclear program, that is with technological support from China and North Korea. It is believed that the three abducted people handle very sensitive information concerning Iran's nuclear program. It is not clear whether the abduction operation is political in nature or was carried out by a gang of robbers active in that area. The abduction of foreign nationals has over the past few months become a big problem for the government in many parts of Iran. In January, a 22-year-old Australian tourist disappeared while on his way to Shiraz, capital of the south. There has been no news of him since. In February and March, three North Korean technicians said to have been working on military projects near the Gulf were abducted. They still have not been released. Last month, the body of a North Korean man was found near Ahvaz, capital of Khuzestan. It was said that someone lured him and then killed him for unknown reasons. The government has advised foreign nationals not to leave major cities individually. Excursions organized for European tourists have been canceled or their routes altered to avoid the danger of being attacked by armed gunmen on the road. The Iranian Interior Ministry's report shows a big increase in all types of crimes, from small-scale riots through to organized and large-scale armed robbery and murder. This coincided with the smuggling of thousands of arms from Pakistan and Afghanistan to all areas in east and south Iran. Sometimes convoys of smuggled goods and drugs travel for hundreds of miles inside Iranian areas, protected by armed groups supported by personnel carries and tanks. The number of foreign nationals working in Iran is estimated at about 18,000, compared with 1.2 million before the mullahs' revolution in 1979. But there are also 2.2 million Afghan refugees, 1.2 million Iraqi refugees, mostly Kurds and Shiites, and at least 1.2 million illegal immigrants from Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan.
