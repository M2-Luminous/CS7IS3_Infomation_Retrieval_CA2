This means that the ongoing voucher privatisation process will end on June 30. Chubays stressed that "it will be rounded off with flying colours by June." He told the press conference that he signed an order today to auction off 63 enterprises, which will be sold for privatisation vouchers. They include the "Apatite" production society, the Leningrad "Svetlana" association, the "Beryozka" trade house, and the "Norilsk Nickel" concern". This will allow the future share-holders to make use of their remaining vouchers. As many as 126 million vouchers out of the issued 148 millions have already been used. Chubays noted that the actual size of dividends received for invested privatisation vouchers proved to be not as fantastic as initially expected. They fluctuate from 10 to 200 percent a year.
