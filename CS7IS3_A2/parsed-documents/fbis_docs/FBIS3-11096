[Begin recording] [Correspondent Paulo Henrique Amorim] Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso came to Washington to begin negotiations with the IMF on a loan for Brazil. After a long lunch, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus read a communique praising the Brazilian economic program, the conclusion of an agreement with banks, the fiscal adjustment cutting government spending, the privatization program, the strong Brazilian position on the balance of payments, and the liberalization of trade. The communique says the IMF promised to work closely with Brazil to defeat inflation. The implementation of the new currency, the real, could coincide with a loan for Brazil. I asked the IMF managing director if a loan would only be granted with the implementation of the real. He replied that the new monetary unit could be a powerful anchor and an important instrument for a possible loan. He said Brazil has to face the key issue of hyperinflation. Does this mean, minister, that it will first be necessary to create the real to get the IMF loan? [Cardoso] No, it means that the IMF already considers the plan positive. We do not need an IMF loan; what we need is that positive signal to conclude negotiations with the banks. [Amorim] Do you interpret this communique as support for your economic policy? [Cardoso] It was expressed in that sense. He clearly said that the Brazilian Government's policy has his support. He saw the seriousness of our program. Camdessus went even further than that; he personally conveyed his support to me and I am conveying it to the president of the Republic. [end recording] The economic team is concerned about the finance minister's political future. We have a live report by Alexandre Garcia from Brasilia: [Garcia] The minister left Brasilia saying he is tied up with the Finance Ministry because of the economic plan. He really wants to make quite clear that despite the insistence of political leaders to become a presidential candidate, the economic plan should not be mixed with electoral goals. But today the Finance Ministry economic team said the plan's most difficult part already has been done, that the team alone can continue implementing the program in the ministry. The team said the minister can be more useful as a senator by returning to Congress to help in the constitutional reform, to do the other part of the plan to eliminate the structural causes of inflation, such as the excessive size of the state, that affect the people's pocketbooks. The economic team believes the minister, since the plan is a long-range plan, should begin to think about next year, and this is why the economic team wants the minister to become a presidential candidate, to guarantee the conclusion of the plan. Because if government guidelines are changed next January, the plan will fade away.
