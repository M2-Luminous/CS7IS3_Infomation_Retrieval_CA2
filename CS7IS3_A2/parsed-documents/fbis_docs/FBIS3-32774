In an interview granted to DPA, Niehaus pointed out: "We strongly believe in the principle of juridical equality of the states," and he recalled that in the four decades since the OAS birth, the secretary generals have always been South Americans. The Costa Rican politician, who is of German descent, added that "Costa Rica holds a special place for the OAS because, thanks to this organization, we have lived 40 years without an Army." He emphasized that it is uncommon for a country, regardless of how small it is, to live without an Army. It was precisely the OAS which guaranteed the protection of Costa Rica's sovereign interests. He described his chances of winning the election at the next OAS Assembly in Washington, D.C. as "excellent." He added: "We have 23 sure votes and only 18 are required." In addition to the six Central American nations and 13 Caribbean countries, he has the support of Chile, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, and Argentina. Niehaus doubts those who say the United States opposes his candidacy and pointed out: "I sincerely do not believe that the United States opposes my candidacy." He believes that what the United States could oppose is a break in the tradition of larger countries occupying such a high position. He said that this would be unfair because all states are equal. According to Niehaus, the secretary general does not have to be a former president, as in the case of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, who the White House supposedly favors. The 52-year-old statesman, who has been an international law professor for 20 years and foreign minister twice, noted: "I think that have a knowledge of international law is more important." He believes that some countries are afraid that the small nations of the continent would unite to create a so-called "mechanical majority" against larger nations. He added that "this is stupid because we are not that foolish." Niehaus feels that the most important thing for an organization like the OAS to do is "to reach its basic goal: to defend democracy." This means that all countries must give democracy the special treatment it deserves. He cited Cuba as an example. He believes a change toward democracy and respect for human rights will soon come to that country. "That change must be promoted so that it will be peaceful and nonviolent," he said. Niehaus advocates rapprochement with Cuba to promote development. In this specific case, which is very different from Haiti, he feels the blockade is inappropriate. "Isolation does not lead to positive results," the outgoing foreign minister concluded.
