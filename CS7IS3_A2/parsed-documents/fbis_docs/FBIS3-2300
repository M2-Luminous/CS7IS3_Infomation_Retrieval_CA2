As a result the company's main board will this week discuss plans to delist its six companies from the Hong Kong stock exchange, a move that would deprive the market of nearly 7 per cent of its capitalisation. Despite intensive lobbying at Government House, Jardine has failed in its attempt to persuade the watchdog Securities and Futures Commission to allow it to be exempt from Hong Kong's takeovers code. The company has waged a five-year battle to free itself from the conditions that regulate the behaviour of other public companies. Having led the exodus of public companies to a Bermudian domicile in 1984, Jardine dropped another bombshell in 1992 by shifting the group's primary listings to the London Stock Exchange. Since then it has been arguing for the right to be governed by Bermuda's takeover code. Sources close to the company say that the directors are fearful of China's intentions for Jardine, and worry that the Keswick family's less than 10 per cent shareholding, which has hitherto secured control over the group, will prove inadequate for the historic owners to retain their hold. Last night Neil MacNamara, a Jardine Matheson spokesman, declined to comment. Robert Nottle, chairman of the Securities and Futures Exchange, said he could not disclose discussions with listed firms. Jardine has mobilised its biggest guns in the fight to maintain overseas control over its affairs. The Governor, Chris Patten, has been drawn into the controversy following intensive lobbying by Sir Charles Powell, a special adviser to the former British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Powell now serves as a trouble-shooter for Jardine. From the start of the controversy Jardine has threatened to walk away from the Hong Kong stock exchange it helped to create. It is still possible that the company might be bluffing, as regulators believe it has more to lose than gain. As a result Jardine has been firmly told that it has reached the end of the road as far as concessions from the Securities and Futures Commission are concerned. It is also reliably understood that the stock exchange has taken a similarly robust attitude towards the group. The authorities have already made a number of concessions to the powerful hong in the past few years. Jardine escaped penalty despite being found guilty of breaching listing rules in 1991, when it bought back 3.4 per cent of its own shares through an affiliate. The exchange excused the group on the grounds that the ban on share repurchasing was about to be removed. The exchange also set a precedent when it granted Jardine companies secondary listings despite the fact that 80 per cent of the group's shares traded in Hong Kong rather than London. The Jardine stable of public firms consists of Jardine Matheson, Jardine Strategic, Hongkong Land, Dairy Farm, Mandarin Oriental and Jardine International Motors, all of which are chaired by either Simon or Henry Keswick. When the group moved its primary listings to London after local authorities refused to grant it a special trade-only listing status in Hong Kong, the group accounted for around 10 per cent of the market's total capitalisation. This has shrunk to about 6.7 per cent. With a secondary listing in Hong Kong, the group is regulated by the territory's listing and takeover rules although when there is a conflict between local and London rules, the latter prevail. If it wants to delist from Hong Kong, it has to give a 90-day notice to the exchange. One of the group's key concerns has been maintaining control and fortifying itself against hostile takeover bids. In 1985, the group sold its controlling stake in Hong Kong Electric to Li Ka-shing after Hongkong Land ran up a mountain of debts. In May 1988, Li and three other tycoons made a hostile bid for Hongkong Land, forcing the company to later buy back the 8 per cent stake the tycoons acquired, on condition that Li's group agreed not to take major stakes in any Jardine firm for seven years. This agreement expires in 13 months, fuelling speculation that Jardine has plans to raise its 33 per cent stake in Hong Kong Land. But under local takeover rules, Jardine will have to make a general offer once its holding reaches 35 per cent.
