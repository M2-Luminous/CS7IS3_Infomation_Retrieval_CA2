For Aerospatiale, 1993 was a very bad year. The traditional annual results presentation by its chief executive officer [CEO], Louis Gallois, perfectly illustrated these difficult conditions. Sales shrank by 5 percent, to 49.3 billion francs [Fr], and new orders dropped by 25.6 percent, from Fr39 billion in 1992 to Fr29 billion last year, with a Fr130-billion backlog of orders (2.5 years of operation). "The helicopter and aircraft market was awful; all three manufacturers just broke even, with practically as many cancellations as new orders," the CEO commented. In spite of all, Louis Gallois wants his group to remain on the offensive, and he is starting work along four lines: to strengthen the group's alliance in its branch; to reconfigure the group with a view to its privatization; to prepare for the future by overhauling its product line; and to negotiate with the labor force. Being an optimist, he predicts that 1994 will be "a year for conquest and ambition." Thus, Aerospatiale pursued its strategy of national and international alliances. In France, it signed an agreement with SNPE [National Powders and Explosives Company] concerning the CELERG company, a specialist of tactical missile motors (see next page). With DASA [German Aerospace Company], its partner of 30 years, Aerospatiale is planning new partnerships based on the Eurocopter model; these partnerships will materialize in the next few months in the fields of missiles, space, and commuter aircraft. For the latter, Louis Gallois believes that "because of its dynamism, the ATR [commuter aircraft] economic interest group should serve as a pole for turboprop aircraft production, and that the new ATR-82 project might be used as a basic program." Preliminary talks, therefore, started in all directions, both in Europe (with Fokker, Dornier, Saab, and British Aerospace) and in many Asian countries. Concerning satellites, which represent sales of Fr1.5 billion and orders of Fr3.2 billion for Aerospatiale, Louis Gallois believes that the four-partner Alliance formed with Alcatel, DASA, and Alenia and which holds 49 percent of Space System Loral, is "somewhat weak." This in spite of the fact that it was through the Alliance that Aerospatiale's Cannes plant (which just delivered the photography unit of the Helios military observation satellite to MATRA [Mechanics, Aviation, and Traction company]) obtained the contract for the Intelsat-7 satellite integration. He wishes, therefore, to strengthen the Alliance as soon as possible, and Eurocopter might be used as a model. "Our ambition is to place each of our operations in the partnership structure most likely to promote its development," Louis Gallois indicated. In France, this ambition already resulted in the creation of an Aerospatiale maintenance group. This restructuring is part of the efforts the group must make with a view to its privatization. These efforts also involve financial reorganization, which started in 1992. The resulting improvement affected the net result which, although still a loss, showed a "marked improvement" thanks to the austerity measures adopted by the personnel as a whole. It also affected the debt, which was stabilized and even decreased by Fr1.5 billion. Finally, the capital should be increased to Fr3 billion. The objective is now to restore equilibrium as soon as possible, by 1995 at the latest.
