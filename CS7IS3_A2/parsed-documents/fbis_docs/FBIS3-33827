In an article published today, the paper, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, adds that the Zionist entity is known for its expansionist course, for its use of force and military aggression to consecrate its occupation of Arab and Palestinian territories, and even for military aggression against Arab countries not adjacent to Palestine, as happened in its aggression on Iraq and other Arab states. The paper wonders how Washington can convince the Arabs that it can be an honest broker in Middle East peace talks when it makes moves to consecrate the Zionist aggression and ensure its superiority over the Arabs. AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: Washington is talking of democracy and human rights at a time when it wages wars and kills tens of thousands of people in various parts of the world every year in the name of democracy. It has continued to provide the Zionist entity with unlimited military support despite this entity's criminal record, which is replete with repression and human rights abuses. The United States has chosen to overlook the Zionists' criminal record, their demolition of Palestinian homes, and their detention every day of hundreds of Palestinians. It has continued to provide the Zionists with additional sophisticated weapons. It is committed to aiding their military superiority at a time when it is stripping the Arabs of the requirements of self-defense. The paper says: The United States would not have gone to excess in this course had it not seen a willingness on the part of some Arabs to squander the Arab nation's funds in return for U.S. crumbs, in return for useless and obsolete weapons and aircraft. AL-THAWRAH adds: Those who followed U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the past two decades must have realized that the United States has plundered tens of billions of dollars in return for obsolete weapons used in World War II. Nobody knows for sure whether or not these weapons have actually been received by Saudi Arabia. For, after all, the U.S.-Saudi arms deals might have been fictitious. Nonetheless, what is certain is that Washington has received billions of dollars just to maintain the Zionists' military edge over the Arabs. The paper concludes by saying: The big powers, particularly the United States, are required to take more balanced positions in their relations with world states, and also in their handling of issues related to world security and peace. It should be unreasonable for them to continue to work to perpetuate the unfair embargo imposed on Iraq although it has honored all its commitments as enshrined in UN Security Council Resolution 687.
