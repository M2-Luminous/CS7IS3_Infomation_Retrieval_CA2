"The arms deal is proceeding as scheduled," Air Force Major-General Lin Yu-ching, deputy chief of staff of the Air Force General Headquarters, said during a report to the Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee. The Air Force has sent 33 servicemen to the US to prepare for the commission of the four aircraft, Lin said, adding that another 72 will be sent to the US later. Lin also countered reports that the four planes are out of date. The US, he said, responded favorably to Taiwan's request for four E-2C Hawkeye early warning aircraft in 1991, but demanded that some parts from the older E-2B be used in the planes. The change was made to comply with the 1987 Shanghai Communique, which governs relations between the US and Mainland China. The legislature earlier approved a Ministry of National Defense budget of NT [new Taiwan] $5.2 billion (US$192.6 million) for the purchase of the four aircraft.
