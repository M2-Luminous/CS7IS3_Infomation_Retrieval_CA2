The minister of defence and security of Indonesia at a press conference on March 24 said Indonesia would make positive efforts to see the aggravated situation of the Korean peninsula solved peacefully, not develop into an armed conflict. He added that Indonesia would support the efforts of all sides concerned to avoid confrontation and find a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue. In a joint statement published on March 26, seven members of the State Duma of Russia including V. Ilyukhin, chairman of the Security Committee of the State Duma who is member of the Federal Communist Party of Russia, said some quarters of the United States were again straining the situation by raising new unreasonable conditions. They urged that all measures should be taken to continue the talks to maintain peace on the Korean peninsula, instead of resorting to pressure with strength. Anzuluni Bembe, first vice-president of the Transitional National Parliament of Zaire-the higher council of the Republic, held that the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should be settled in a peaceful way. Thomas Ronstrom, co-chairman of the Nordic Cooperation Committee for Friendship and Solidarity With the Korean People, in a statement March 23 said inconsistent reports spread by the western media show their partiality against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and it is an act of blindly following only the false argument of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Alexandru Mica, chairman of the Romanian Promoting Committee for Supporting the Reunification of Korea, and Faustin Justin Zabe, national first secretary of the youth of the Congolese Socialist Party, in their solidarity messages, and Jose Fanequico Lissane, executive secretary of the Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of the DPRK, in a statement stressed that the United States and some quarters of the IAEA Secretariat should apologize for their diabolic crimes against the Korean people and mankind and observe the principle of impartiality.
