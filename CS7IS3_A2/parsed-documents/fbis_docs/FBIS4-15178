FBIS4-15178 "drsov067_u_94007" FBIS-SOV-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Latvia Decree Seen as Threat to Summit Decree Seen as Threat to Summit LD0704101294 Riga Radio Riga Network in Latvian 0900 GMT 7 Apr 94 LD0704101294 Riga Radio Riga Network Latvian BFN [Text] As you know, a decree signed by the president of the Russian Federation, in which Boris Yeltsin agrees with a proposal from the Russian Defense Ministry to create military bases on the territory of CIS member states and in the Republic of Latvia, became known yesterday. The aim of the proposal is to ensure security of the Russian Federation and the above-mentioned countries, as well as to carry out tests for new kinds of armaments and military equipment. Commenting on this reasoning, Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs stressed that at least on the part of Latvia nobody has asked for such a security guarantee and that the Russian Federation has no right to willfully take responsibility for Latvia's security. The decree instructs the Russian Foreign Ministry, together with the Defense Ministry, to hold talks on this issue with the Republic of Latvia and to enshrine reached agreements in corresponding documents. According to Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, this decree contradicts the treaties initialed at the talks between the government delegations of the two countries and casts doubt on the Russian delegation's true intentions in the process of preparing the treaties. According to the state president's office, the Russian side's move is causing anxiety about a meeting scheduled to take place between the presidents of the two countries. In a telephone conversation with [Latvian Prime Minister] Valdis Birkavs, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt gave a cautious assessment of the Russian president's decree and voiced the assumption that Russia may rescind the document, as has already been the case many times with Russian statements. A session of the security council took place at the Maikapara House this morning. At this moment, the Russian Embassy in Latvia is holding a news conference.
