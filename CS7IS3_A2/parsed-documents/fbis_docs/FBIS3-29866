Sales by wholesalers totaled 537.08 trillion yen, down 4.1 percent, while those by retail stores came to 136,376 billion yen, down 3.8 percent. Wholesalers and retailers both incurred a drop for the second year running for the first time since statistics were taken in 1953, MITI said. A MITI official attributed the poor performance by wholesalers to falling fuel and materials prices due to the strong yen, as well as sluggish personal spending and slack corporate capital spending, particularly by manufacturers. Retailers were affected by an increasing consumer tendency for buying bargain-priced products and a drop in import prices amid the strong yen, the official said. On a quarterly basis, sales by wholesalers dropped 3.1 percent in the October-December quarter from a year before, which was also attributable to the strong yen. The fourth-quarter sales by retailers fell 3.5 percent, affected by an unusually warm winter, MITI said. Business performance among both wholesalers and retailers is expected to remain stagnant in the near future, the official said.
