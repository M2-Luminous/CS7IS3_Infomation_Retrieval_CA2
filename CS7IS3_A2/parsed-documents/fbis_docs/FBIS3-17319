A source in the Foreign Ministry of the self-proclaimed Transdniestrian republic reported to INTERFAX that "the proposals of the CSCE permanent mission in Moldova and proposals of the Russian Federation are to become the starting point for these negotiations." According to the sources, the new stage of the negotiations may start in the near future, immediately after the new Moldovan parliament starts its work. This coincides with the proposals of the CSCE mission which pressed for resumption of negotiations after the parliamentary elections early this year. The source pointed out that at present an official envoy of the Russian president Vladlen Vasev takes the same position. The same source reported that in accordance with Russia's proposals "working groups will be formed at the new stage of negotiations, in addition, plenipotentiary representatives of Moldova's and Transdniestria's presidents will be appointed to coordinate the negotiating process along with President Yeltsin's envoy." The final decision on the time of the resumption of bilateral consultations to be held under the mediation of Russia and the CSCE mission is expected to be adopted this week after the conclusion of Vasev's visit to Kishenev and Tiraspol.
