PANPRA [Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party Of Haiti] leader Serge Gilles so stated this morning at our microphone. He was the guest in the morning broadcast: [Begin recording] [Gilles] The position of my party is clear. It is the same position as that of the socialist bloc. We have expressed it already. It is clear. We are against Article 149 and therefore we do not agree. This government does not have our support. [Reporter Renois] Does that mean, Serge Gilles, that PANPRA will not agree to participate in the formation of the future government that Mr. Jonassaint will establish? [Gilles] Not at all. Not at all. We have said so. For the past two weeks, it has been clear. We are against Article 149; since the coup d'etat, we have been against Article 149. We have always said that a negotiated return is necessary. It is necessary to go back to the negotiation table, to dialogue. [Renois] In your opinion, is negotiation still possible today? [Gilles] Negotiation is always possible; I am convinced of that. Dialogue is always possible. But good faith is necessary on both sides, by the two protagonists. This is what we say. And for a dialogue to be fruitful, it is necessary to listen to each other. It cannot be a dialogue of the deaf. [Renois] Are not the doors closed for this dialogue that your party hopes for? [Gilles] No! I hope that the doors remain open. We want to force them. It is necessary that the doors remain open. It is necessary that we return to negotiations. It is necessary to return to dialogue. For us, it is an obligatory passage. This crisis, as we have said, is so deep that it will not be solved with sanctions, not with an embargo, not with Articles 149, 148, or 111. This crisis cannot be solved with a constitutional cover. A political compromise is necessary. It is necessary to reach a compromise. It is necessary that the protagonists resign themselves to finding this compromise on specific points regarding Haitian society, the Haitian people, the Haitian nation. [end recording]
