FR940505-1-00076 FR940505-1-00012 This proposed rule is based largely on SCAQMD Rule 1171 (Solvent Cleaning Operations) as adopted on August 2, 1991. Evaluation of the environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of the proposed FIP rule's requirements can be found in SCAQMD's final staff report for Rule 1171, dated July 1991. This proposed FIP rule also incorporates changes from the draft amended Rule 1171 released by SCAQMD on October 6, 1993 and components of the VCAPCD Rule 74.19 (Graphic Arts) as adopted on August 11, 1992. EPA is in the process of developing an Alternative Control Technology (ACT) Document for solvent cleaning operations. The ACT will primarily address recordkeeping and will not establish national guidelines for solvent content and work practices. The proposed FIP rule requirements on VOC content and work practices do not conflict with the draft ACT. As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total 10.44 tpd in Sacramento in 1999, 11.82 tpd in Sacramento in 2005, and 3.55 tpd in Ventura in 2005. Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 6.75, 7.66, and 2.66 tpd respectively at an overall cost savings of $991 per ton VOC removed (1990 dollars). A cost savings is projected because CARB and the Districts have identified compliant solvents which are less expensive than high-VOC solvents currently in use. (c) Wood Products Coatings (Sacramento, Ventura) Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(b) controls VOC emissions resulting from commercial and industrial application in the Sacramento and Ventura nonattainment areas of coatings while manufacturing wood products. Emission reductions are achieved by: (1) limiting the VOC content of various wood coating products; (2) allowing the use of add-on control equipment that reduces VOC emissions by 85 percent in lieu of meeting the VOC limits on coatings; and (3) restricting application of wood coatings to application methods and equipment with high transfer efficiencies. The proposed rule applies to all persons applying coating, inks, stains, and/or strippers in wood product coating operations for the purpose of manufacturing wood products, including furniture and other coated objects made of solid wood and/or wood composition and/or simulated wood material. The proposed rule does not apply to residential noncommercial operations. The majority of the affected wood products coating operators are expected to comply with the proposed rule through the use of reformulated coatings rather than add-on emission control devices. The proposed rule is based largely on SCAQMD Rule 1136 entitled ``Wood Products Coatings,'' as amended on August 2, 1991. In addition, EPA has incorporated some of SCAQMD's proposed amendments to Rule 1136, dated July 23, 1993. Evaluation of the environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of Rule 1136 can be found in SCAQMD Staff Report ``Proposed Amended Rule 1136_Wood Products Coatings,'' dated April 19, 1988, and SCAQMD Supplemental Staff Report ``Proposed Amended Rule 1136_Wood Products Coatings,'' dated July 5, 1988. EPA has prepared a draft Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) document on wood products coatings that is entitled ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Wood Furniture Coating Operations.'' Upon publication of the CTG, revisions to this FIP rule may be appropriate for consistency. EPA expects, however, that the proposed FIP rule may be more stringent than the CTG in some regards to reflect the unusually difficult air pollution problems in the FIP areas. As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total 0.49 tpd in Sacramento in 1999, 0.55 tpd in Sacramento in 2005, and 0.65 tpd in Ventura in 2005. Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 0.45, 0.51, and 0.61 tpd respectively at a cost of $18 per ton VOC removed (1988 dollars). (d) Automotive Refinishing Operations (Sacramento). Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(c) controls VOC emissions from automobile refinishing operations in the Sacramento nonattainment area. Emission reductions are achieved by: (1) limiting the VOC content of various automobile refinishing coatings; (2) allowing the use of add-on control equipment that reduces VOC emissions by 85 percent in lieu of meeting the VOC limits on coatings; and (3) restricting application of automotive refinishing coatings to application methods and equipment with high transfer efficiencies. The proposed rule applies to facilities that apply coatings to motor vehicles and mobile equipment or their existing parts and components for the purpose of on-site refinishing and modification. The proposed rule does not apply to application of original equipment manufacturing coatings applied at manufacturing plants. Affected facilities include autobody repair/paint shops, production autobody paint shops, new car dealer repair/paint shops, fleet operator repair/paint shops, custom-made car fabrication facilities, and truck body builders. Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(c) is based largely on SCAQMD's Rule 1151, Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Non-Assembly Line Coating Operations (September 6, 1991). Portions of the proposed FIP rule are based on CARB's Determination of Reasonably Available Control Technology and Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (RACT/BARCT) for Automotive Refinishing Operations (January 8, 1991). An evaluation of the environmental, economic, socioeconomic, and other impacts of Rule 1151 requirements can be found in SCAQMD's staff report for the proposed amended Rule 1151 (August, 1991); this evaluation is also applicable to this proposed FIP rule. As described in the technical support document, uncontrolled VOC emissions from affected facilities are projected to total 4.23 tpd in 1999 and 4.71 tpd in 2005. Implementation of this proposed rule is projected to reduce those emissions by 3.77 tpd and 4.19 tpd respectively at a cost of $7,200 per ton of VOC removed (1990 dollars). Under section 183(e)(3) of the Act, EPA may in the future issue either national regulations or a CTG for this source category, as well as for other categories discussed in this section. If EPA does so and the FIP rule is less stringent than the national guidance or rule, EPA will amend the FIP rule appropriately. (e) Adhesives and Sealants (Sacramento) Proposed 40 CFR 52.2961(d) controls VOC emissions resulting from industrial and commercial use of adhesives and sealants in the Sacramento nonattainment area. Emission reductions are achieved by: (1) limiting the VOC content of various adhesives and sealants; and (2) allowing the use of add-on control equipment that reduces VOC emissions by 85 percent in lieu of meeting the VOC limits on coatings. This proposed rule applies to certain facilities that supply, sell, or use adhesives, sealants, or adhesive primers. Affected facilities include (but are not limited to) manufacturing plants, architectural and construction companies, and welding operations. Various activities are exempt from all or part or the proposed rule, including tire repair, undersea-based weapon systems manufacturing, research and development, and small quantity users.
