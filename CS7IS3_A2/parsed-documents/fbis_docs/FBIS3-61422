M. Chernov, Samar State Aerospace University, Russia; UDC 681.325.5] [Abstract] This article examines discrete orthogonal transforms in Galua fields implemented without multiplications. Algorithms in which multiplication is replaced by register shifts are found to be more efficient. Discrete orthogonal transforms are examined in finite fields with representation of the input in nontraditional notation systems (e.g., systems with an irrational base, Fibonacci codes, ``golden'' proportions, and their generalizations) whose basis is generated by a linear recurrent sequence.
