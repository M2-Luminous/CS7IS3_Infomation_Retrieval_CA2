FR940617-0-00134 FR940617-0-00026 The recall regulations adopted today provide procedures and requirements for manufacturers of engines for which a determination of nonconformity has been made. Such requirements include notification to be sent to engine owners, the manufacturer's remedial plan and EPA approval of the plan, and procedures to be followed in the event that the manufacturer requests a public hearing to contest the Administrator's finding of nonconformity. N. Useful Life EPA is adopting the definition of useful life as proposed with additional conditions. The useful life of engines covered by this rule is ten years or 8,000 hours, whichever comes first. Further, the useful life ends when the engine is scrapped or rebuilt. EPA is adding a provision allowing the manufacturer to apply to the Administrator for a shorter useful life period for engines that are subject to severe service in seasonal equipment or that are designed specifically for lower useful life hours to match equipment life. Engine useful life defines the period of time a manufacturer is liable for the emissions that the engine emits. In-use surveillance emission testing may be conducted at any time by EPA to determine if an engine family, after some time in use, is still meeting emission standards. EPA is adopting an in-use testing and recall program based on testing for a period of seven years or 6,000 hours, representing 70 to 75 percent of the average expected useful life for nonroad engines. Therefore, while the manufacturer's liability for its engines covers the full useful life, evaluation of an engine family's in-use compliance will be based on those engines within the engine family that have attained 70 to 75 percent or less of their expected useful life. This not only allows EPA to find more properly maintained and used engines, but also allows for variation in the durability of different engine configurations within the same engine family without selecting engines that are at the end of their useful life. While generally agreeing with the ten year/8,000 hour useful life for most engines, manufacturers expressed their concern that some engine families are expected to have a useful life less than 8,000 hours. These engines are designed to be used in severe conditions, often in seasonal equipment, or equipment with a short useful life. Manufacturers are concerned that, should all engines be assumed to last for 8,000 hours, in-use testing of these severe application engines at 6,000 hours (that is, 75 percent of the useful life) would unfairly penalize severe application engines that could in fact be outside of their designed shorter useful life. EPA understands that such a situation could exist, and thus is providing means for the manufacturer to petition the Administrator for an alternative useful life as stated previously. Solid engineering data should accompany the request so that a reliable engineering judgment can be made. Two commenters requested that EPA adopt a shorter useful life period for engine families with individual cylinder displacement below a specified volume. It appears that this suggestion was intended to provide a straightforward method to administer useful life at the time of certification. However, EPA is not aware of a supportable technical rationale that would suggest there is correlation between cylinder volume and useful life, or that engines with smaller cylinder volumes wear out faster than engines with larger cylinder volumes. Smaller engines are also installed in smaller equipment and the relative work expectation is no greater than larger engines in larger equipment. Most engines covered by this rule are built to operate at full load/rated speed most of the time. Therefore, in relative terms, engines are generally equally stressed during their lifetime regardless of their size or power. For these reasons, EPA does not believe it is appropriate to define a shorter useful life for all engines under a specified cylinder volume. EPA has provided a means for a manufacturer to provide evidence that would allow severe service engines to be held to a shorter useful life. O. Locomotive Engines EPA proposed to exclude engines used to propel locomotives from this rulemaking, as regulation of such engines is being undertaken separately. EPA did not, however, exclude other engines operated on locomotives from this rulemaking. EPA requested comment as to whether such other engines (``auxiliary engines'') should be regulated in this or the later locomotives action. EPA received several comments on this issue. The commenters all noted that auxiliary engines are appropriately regulated under section 213(a)(5) as ``engines used in locomotives.'' EPA agrees with this determination and is promulgating a definition of ``engines used in locomotives'' that corresponds to this determination. While there was general agreement with the regulatory authority under which auxiliary engines used on locomotives can be regulated, comments were received both agreeing and disagreeing with EPA's proposal that the auxiliary engines should be regulated in today's rulemaking action. EPA believes that the statutory mandate of section 213(a)(5) allows EPA to regulate auxiliary engines in this rulemaking. Moreover, the standard under which such engines are to be regulated is virtually identical to the standard under section 213(a)(3). EPA also received comments indicating that auxiliary engines are similar in design and performance to other nonroad engines regulated in this rulemaking, and that such engines should therefore be regulated in this rulemaking. Therefore, EPA is including auxiliary large CI engines operated on locomotives in this rulemaking. This issue is discussed further in the Response to Comments in the docket. P.
