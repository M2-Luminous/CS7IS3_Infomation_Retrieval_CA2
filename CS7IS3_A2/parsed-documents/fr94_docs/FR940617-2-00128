FR940617-2-00128 FR940617-2-00079 Funding to MAAs ORR has eliminated the set-aside for refugee mutual assistance associations as a separate component under the social service notice and instead has folded these funds into the social service formula allocation to States. Elimination of the MAA set-aside, however, is not intended to represent any reduction in ORR's commitment to MAAs as important participants in refugee resettlement. ORR believes that the continued and/or increased utilization of qualified refugee mutual assistance associations in the delivery of social services helps to ensure the provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate services as well as increasing the effectiveness of the overall service system. Therefore, at a minimum, ORR expects States to continue to use MAAs as service providers at a level comparable to previous years. ORR strongly encourages States when contracting for services, including employment services, to give consideration to the special strengths of MAAs, whenever contract bidders are otherwise equally qualified, provided that the MAA has the capability to deliver services in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with the background of the target population to be served. ORR also expects States to continue to assist MAAs in seeking other public and/or private funds for the provision of services to refugee clients. ORR defines MAAs as organizations with the following qualifications: a. The organization is legally incorporated as a nonprofit organization; and b. Not less than 51% of the composition of the Board of Directors or governing board of the mutual assistance association is comprised of refugees or former refugees, including both refugee men and women. State Administration States are reminded that under current regulations at 45 CFR 400.206 and 400.207, States have the flexibility to charge the following types of administrative costs against their refugee program social service grants, if they so choose: Direct and indirect administrative costs incurred for the overall management and operation of the State refugee program, including its coordination, planning, policy and program development, oversight and monitoring, data collection and reporting, and travel.

Discussion of Comments Received We received 17 letters of comment in response to the notice of proposed FY 1994 allocations to States for refugee social services. The comments are summarized below and are followed in each case by the Department's response. Comment: Fourteen commenters expressed their views regarding the proposed elimination of the MAA set-aside. Eleven commenters expressed concern over the proposed elimination of the MAA set-aside, while two commenters supported the elimination. One commenter was concerned that without the Federal requirement for a set-aside, the State would not be able to continue a State MAA set-aside in order to adhere to its general procurement requirements for contracting for social services. One commenter felt that the MAA set-aside represents the only structure through which ORR can recognize the role of MAAs in refugee resettlement. Another commenter felt that elimination of the set-aside reflected a distancing of ORR from the MAAs and did not create a level playing field for MAAs. Five commenters felt that elimination of the set-aside would represent a hardship on MAAs and would preclude MAAs from receiving any State social service funding. One commenter felt that there would be public pressure on States to award the exact amount of previous set-asides to MAAs and would create the need for a new tracking system to document the level of funding to MAAs to compare MAA funding with previous set-asides. One commenter asked for clarification on whether ORR will continue to require States to assist MAAs to seek other public and/or private funds as it has in the past. Response: The elimination of the MAA set-aside is not intended to convey a diminution of ORR's commitment to MAAs. We continue to believe in the importance of the role of MAAs in service provision and firmly believe that the involvement of MAAs is essential to effective refugee resettlement.
