They have come with very clear directions to take leadership of the militant outfits and to plan large scale subversive operations. The latest infiltration, it is learnt, has taken place through Kupwara and Uri sectors. According to sources, the increasing disillusionment of the people with the militants has upset the senior command officers of the ISI. There have been instances during the recent months when the people have openly defied militants' orders and refused to support their cause. Today's Id celebration was yet another pointer to the fact that the people no longer approved the cult of violence being indulged in by Pakistan-supported militant groups. It is learnt that the new group of mercenaries, including Pakistan trained Afghan guerillas, militant from POK [Pakistan-occupied Kashmir], Sudan and other West Asian Countries, have entered India through unmanned routes along the LoC [Line of Control]. They have also smuggled in sophisticated arms including, AK56 and AK-76 assault rifles, rockets and rocket launchers. It is learnt that ISI, which has been openly aiding and abetting militancy in J-K, has conveyed its disgust and annoyance to some of the leading militant groups here for their failure to organise subversive operations and to hit at soft targets. Instead of accomplishing the task given by ISI, the militant groups have of late been killing their own people as most of the outfits lacked motivation and fought among themselves. It is for this reason that Pakistan has decided to enlist the support of trained Afghan Mojahedin to infiltrate into the Valley and to take over the operational command of the militant groups. According to sources, the reason ISI decided to send Afghan Mojahedin was that they are trained in handling highly sophisticated weapons, and secondly, were motivated to accomplish the assigned field responsibilities. Sources indicate that in view of ISI's increasing desperation, the security agencies had anticipated that as soon as the ISl's field intelligence units succeeded in identifying a safe unmanned route along the international border, they would make a determined bid to `push in' about 2000 to 2500 trained Mojahedin. Other apprehension is that the militants, who had set up their bases in the Peerpanjal range would advance with the clearing of snow. This shift in the bases would pose a serious threat to the national highway and the troops and vehicular movement on it. This happened last year also when the militants attacked the army convoys and the security forces from the hilltops and inflicted casualties. Though the security forces effectively replied to these attacks yet the militants' vantage position aided them in attacking and then fleeing back to their hideouts in the range. The militants are planning to fortify the existing bases and to create new ones on the frontline of the Peerpanjal range. The target is the national highway for it serves as a vital link between the Valley and the rest of the country. It is important for the security forces also as most of their supplies arrive via this route. The movement of the troops also depends on this road which is surrounded by high mountains on both sides. That the militants are increasingly targeting the highway was evident from the fact when they even attacked the Border Roads Organisation men.
