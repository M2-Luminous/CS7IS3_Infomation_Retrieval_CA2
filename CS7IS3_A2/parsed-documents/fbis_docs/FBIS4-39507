As experts maintain, to comprehensively survey and prospect Ukraine's oil and gas promising regions (the Dnieper-Donetsk caldera, Transcarpathian arch, shelves of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov), at least three to four seismic stations, three specialized stations with 10 vibration generators and other sophisticated equipment will be necessary to lay out the fields and pinpoint their deposits of carbohydrates. These will help to increase the discovery coefficient from its present 0.3 to 0.5 value, which means that five in every 10 surveyed structures must be carbohydrate-bearing. As B. Gotski, superintendent of the agency for oil and gas resources of the State Committee for oil and gas, disclosed to UKRINFORM, the State Committee is considering application of comprehensive extraction technologies (including the cycling process) involving 10 newly developed fields and exploited fields in Ukraine. Besides additional expenditures, this will require application of the so-called 3D seismic equipment, which is not available in Ukraine. Hard currency shortages do not allow the State Committee for oil and gas and State Committee for geology to finance purchases of such equipment units, though prices for them are not too exorbitant and range from 25 to 35 million dollars apiece. According to B. Gotski, the Volyn-Podol lowland region is virtually unprospected, though it may contain carbohydrate deposits, too. Presently, about 127.8 million tons (or 83.5 per cent) of prospected liquid carbohydrate deposits are exploited, according to the State Committee for oil and gas. The remainder is either surveyed or has been conserved. About 87.8 million tons of liquid carbohydrate deposits (or 57 per cent of the total amount) belong to the category of hard to extract ones. In accordance with the National Program for oil and gas extraction in Ukraine, which extends to the year 2010, primary emphasis will be placed on development and exploitation of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov shelves, which have been surveyed by meager 3 per cent by now. So, domestic and foreign capital investments for survey, prospecting, offshore deep drilling will focus on precisely this promising shelf region.
