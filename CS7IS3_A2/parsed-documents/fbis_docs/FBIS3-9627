The reporter was Laszlo Rapcsanyi. From the topics of the one-hour interview, first we quote Peter Boross talking about the advance of the left wing. [Boross] "It is indisputable that the Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP] is going to achieve a more favorable result than at the elections four years ago. It is also doubtless, I note -- not so much, and not first and foremost on the level of leadership but in the ranks of the returning members -- there will be some shift to the left. Despite this, I am not afraid of a rollback. Essentally, the Hungarian parliament today consists of sane politicians. No such rollback can take place for this very reason." [Announcer] After this the prime minster talked about the role of the trade unions and the HSP, considering the chances for the near future. [Boross] "The trade unions have gained significant ground within the HSP. This threatens the HSP's functioning as a political party. I have to say that I can see a dual phenomenon here: If by any chance the HSP gets a government role then an excessive trade union force would make the program, hallmarked by the name of Laszlo Bekesi, simply inexecutable." [Announcer] Since there are only six weeks until the elections there was of course mention of the chances of the liberal parties. [Boross] "I consider it natural that the liberal parties are decreasing and slowly crumbling away. Some time later they will be represented in Hungarian political life in a proportion which is typical of most countries. I think this election contest is really between the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the HSP. The erosion of the two party formations in the range between them is unavoidable." [Announcer] What can be expected generally after the election results are known? Who can form a coalition with whom? According to Peter Boross: [Boross] "Every party has to decide what future a coalition relationship can have, from the viewpoint of its future, even if it seems to be somehow tactical or -- under various pressures -- expedient to form a coalition with certain parties. Are they not too distant from one another? If so, they can set up a coalition at a roundtable, but they cannot make the coalition work." [Announcer] Can a coalition which was set up under pressure be viable? [Boross] "There is the possibility that the next elections will not be held in four years' time, if the parliamentary power relations given by the election results make it impossible to create a sustainable majority. It is typical that there was a prediction which estimated the Hungarian political balance as 30 percent so-called Christian conservatives, 30 percent liberals, and 30 percent socialists. Well, those who are familiar with the participants of Hungarian politics know that if this were to come about, it would result in a state of ungovernability." [Announcer] The opposition accuses the government of pursuing a propaganda which only emphasises the successes. The prime minister's opinion about this: [Boross] "We have to show that we have achieved results in the difficult situation the country is facing and under the extremely testing circumstances of the transformation. The other side should come up with concrete proof about specific issues -- not criticize everything with general phrases. The leftist part of the parliament knows and the opposition press knows that the MDF or the government -- I always need to mention them together -- fails to mention the fact that it has preserved the value of savings with an appropriate interest policy, something which has not been done in any of the neighboring countries. It has indeed preserved this." [Announcer] At the end of the interview Prime Minister Peter Boross talked about his plans. [Boross] "I would like to work as prime minister for another four years. This half year was not enough. I believe I know what should be done in the next four years and I feel I have enough strength for the implementation of my ideas."
