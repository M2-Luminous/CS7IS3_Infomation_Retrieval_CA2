Kuwait reaffirmed its support and backing of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its readiness to receive more of the sick and wounded to offer them medical care. This was stated at a meeting of the council of ministers held tonight under the chairmanship of Shaykh Sa'd al-Abdallah al-Salim al-Sabah, the heir apparent and council of ministers chairman. In a press statement after the meeting, Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dakhil said that the Kuwaiti Council of Ministers had called on the UN Security Council's member countries, the Islamic Conference Organization, and all the international organizations and bodies to intervene immediately to stop the genocidal operations to which the people of Bosnia- Herzegovina were being subjected and to take the necessary measures to end that regrettable and tragic situation. The council of ministers expressed its confidence and satisfaction at the U.S. stance, expressed in a report submitted by U.S. President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Congress, regarding the strict conditions that the Iraqi regime must implement [tanfidhiha] for any easing of the sanctions. Topping the list of these conditions was the release of POW's and hostages, recognizing the demarcation of the Kuwait-Iraq border, and respecting Kuwait's independence and sovereignty. The council stressed that the U.S. stance was identical to that of the international community in its insistence on making the Iraqi regime yield to UN resolutions, forcing it to respect international law, and aborting all its attempts to have the siege lifted until all the Security Council's resolutions accepted after the cease-fire in the Kuwait liberation war were implemented. Minister al-Dakhil said that the council of ministers approved a draft law on adding a new paragraph to Article 7 of Emiri Decree 15 of 1959 regarding the Kuwaiti nationality law. The article stipulates that children born to a naturalized Kuwaiti after he obtained Kuwaiti nationality are to be considered native Kuwaitis. The provision of the paragraph added to the aforesaid article applies to those born before the introduction of this law. He added that the council decided to approve the draft law and referred it to the National Assembly. Furthermore, the council examined a number of other topics on its agenda and made appropriate decisions regarding them.
