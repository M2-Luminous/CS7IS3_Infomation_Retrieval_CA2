At a time when there is little security, mainly due to the massacres being carried out by certain government forces, with the assistance of the Interahamwe, [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development militia] able survivors are fleeing. There are also around 6,000 others who are threatened by the Interahamwe and government forces in [word indistinct] and churches in Kigali. It is the same in foreign countries. A large number of Rwandan refugees are fleeing. Among them are those attempting to flee to Tanzania. Since 27 April, around 500,000 refugees have arrived in Tanzania's Ngara region. Reports say that some of the refugees are faced with disease, while others have wounds caused by the Interahamwe and government forces. The refugees arriving in Tanzania are made up of various groups. The first group is made up of Rwandans who fled their homes because of the killings and insecurity caused by the Interahamwe in Kibungo. Another group is made up of the Interahamwe, including the Murambi burgomaster, [words indistinct] who carried out the plan for the massacres which failed later on. When the RPF troops arrived in the area, the Interahamwe and other killers, including government forces, due to the wicked things they had done to the innocent, decided to flee. They realized they could not fight RPF troops who were prepared to rescue innocent people in the area. The third group of refugees in Tanzania is made up of those who fled the fighting between the RPF troops and the government forces elsewhere in the country, before fleeing the area around Kibungo. The fourth category is that of Rwandans who were staying in Kibungo, who felt insecure following the deterioration of security caused by the divisionistic propaganda of RTLM [Radio-Television Libre des Mille Collines] and Radio Kigali [words indistinct]. The RPF, once again, informs the international community and Rwandans that it is the fundamental right of those refugees currently in Tanzania to return to their country. There is no problem at all between the RPF and the refugees. The best indication of this is that there are people who are still in their homes and who are living in harmony with the RPF troops in Kibungo. Those who are sick following injuries caused by the Interahamwe are being treated and are improving. Foreign journalists are in the area to witness it. The RPF denies unfounded reports to the effect that it might be stopping people from fleeing and has closed the border with Tanzania. The UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] itself earlier announced that about 500,000 refugees from Rwanda had fled to Tanzania since 27 April. Then, how can those who claim the RPF is closing borders justify that? As you heard, people are still crossing the border to Tanzania. Currently, instead of being a real facilitator, Tanzania has started to (?assist) the enemy of Rwanda. After Habyarimana's death, Tanzania closed its border to stop people from fleeing from the Interahamwe. Among the people that country allowed in are many of the killers who fled. When they fled, Tanzania opened the border. The other sad thing for Rwandans and the international community who were involved in the Arusha talks is that Tanzania [words indistinct] Mwanza, Tanzania, seriously mistreated Rwandan refugees in the area, claiming that they had celebrated Habyarimana's death. Every person has the right to show happiness or sorrow. There is always a reason for that. Tanzania, which acted against the Rwandan refugees in Mwanza, did not say anything when, in October 1990, the late Habyarimana's government declared a 30-day celebration over the death of the late RPF leader Rwigyema. One should ask the Tanzanian officials whether those who celebrated in Mwanza acted against any of the country's laws. This is yet another injustice against Rwandans. Tanzania should be a truly neutral facilitator and should openly declare that it supports Rwandans and the international community to [word indistinct] the killers, instead of protecting them and turning a blind eye to the wrongdoings of the clique. The RPF committed itself to joining hands with Rwandans [words indistinct] those outside Rwanda, such as those in Tanzania and other countries, to return home soon so as to act together for the liberation of Rwanda.
