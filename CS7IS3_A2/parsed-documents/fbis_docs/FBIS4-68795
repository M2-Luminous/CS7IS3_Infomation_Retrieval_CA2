The Right calls upon the Left to adopt it, the Left calls upon the Right, the Centre--upon the flanks, and further on all along the front. But already the first approaches to negotiations have shown: "civil accord" is a notion replete with many interpretations. With this publication MN offers its own negotiating process. A very timely idea Boris YELTSIN: "The need for an Agreement on reaching civil accord in Russia has been brought forth and prepared by the entire course of political life in the country, however contradictory it may seem, and by the requirement to ensure society's political stability and to support the seeds of civil peace." Ella PAMFILOVA (Russia's Choice faction): Agreement among all the opposing sides is possible in principle. It will be a big achievement if the opponents come to terms with the civilized methods of political struggle, and give up violence. But it is difficult to reach even this kind of agreement. There is no certainty that those who signed will not harbor cunning thoughts and will not use the agreement to lull the vigilance of opponents. It is even more difficult to reach accord on the fundamental questions of policy and the economy, most importantly, on the methods and aims of the reform. There is a risk that the document will be limited to demagogic formulations which can bring about unprincipled compromises. As a result, we shall continue rotting in the quagmire. Gennady ZYUGANOV (Communist Party of the Russian Federation): I will speak not about the idea of accord, but about the idea of national reconciliation. It really hangs in the air. And we have this kind of historical experience. In December 1941, when the Nazis were at the walls of Moscow, victimized Cossacks, dispossessed peasants and exiled intellectuals participated together in a nationwide front. Now we also have a common adversary--it is the anti-people, anti-policy which has been called radical reforms. Sergei SHAKHRAI (Party of Russian Unity and Accord): Agreement is possible in principle. I am not surprised that preparations are proceeding with difficulties. There are many reasons for this. First and foremost, we lack political culture: everyone is impatient, everyone is settling accounts with everyone else. Moreover, there is no full-fledged multiparty system in the country. Social groups are not associated with a party of their own. And, lastly, the country is at a turning point, in conditions of the deepest political and economic crisis. The most important thing now is not to permit a war over how to create peace. Vladimir LYSENKO (Republican Party of Russia, "Yabloko" faction): The idea is very timely. But we already signed several agreements (true, not such wide-ranging ones) with the President. (For instance, in December 1991 between the President and the political parties.) Yet none of them was fulfilled. The President forgot all about these documents right after their signing. What was important for him was the process, not the result. To adopt as the basis? Boris YELTSIN: "The first stage of work on the text of the Agreement is over... The possibility of joint constructive work by representatives from different branches of authority, parties and trade unions became clear already in the process of drafting it." Ella PANFILOVA: In the draft presented by the President, there is something to work with. But the document needs to be examined very thoroughly--among other things, the social aspects. Gennady ZYUGANOV: The document contains reasonable proposals. But, if we are to speak about it as a whole, it is written very simple: don't touch the "sacred cow" known as the Constitution, don't re-elect ahead of time those who have reduced the country to its present-day condition. And forget what happened on October 3-4. In exchange? We promise not to abuse you... Sergei SHAKHRAI: The draft presented by the President is almost in finished form. And though we have made our proposals for improving it, in principle we are ready to sign it even now. Vladimir LYSENKO: When the document was ready in its rough form, it had to be discussed with the various factions, parties and the President. But for some reasons the President instructed his aides to expand it. Regrettably, he met only with Russia's Choice though it would not be bad at all to exchange views with the others, too... Our faction--"Yabloko"--has not yet made the final decision. In the Republican Party, however, the draft was discussed, and we are preparing a package of proposals. But the overwhelming majority believes: the draft can be signed, things will not be any worse. Ground for accord? Boris YELTSIN: "One hears sceptical voices claiming that an Agreement is impossible given the present-day state of society. This point of view leads us into an impasse. The population, the majority of political parties and a considerable part of the deputy corps are interested in accord and political stability..." Vladimir LYSENKO: "I believe that the whole Agreement should consist of two points. The opposition guarantees that in the course of two years it will not press for the dismissal of the President and will quietly wait till the next elections. In reply, Yeltsin guarantees that he will not dissolve the Federal Assembly and let it live until the next President is elected. Besides, the Agreement must necessarily be signed by all the factions of the State Duma. If it has been signed solely by the trade unions, businessmen, directors, the government, the republics and the President and has not been signed by representatives from the opposition, this document will be meaningless. Gennady ZYUGANOV: Our faction has very thoroughly discussed the presidential draft and formulated the conditions on the basis of which, we believe, accord can be reached. They include: a change of the present-day course, the formation of a government of national confidence, urgent measures aimed to combat corruption and theft, steps for the social protection of the population (indexation of pensions, an increase and timely pay of stipends to students, timely pay of wages, paying the debts to the peasantry). As far as the signing procedure is concerned, this is a question of fundamental importance. The Agreement must primarily be signed by political forces. And for this there is a need for decisions by elective bodies--at plenums, conferences and congresses. Sergei SHAKHRAI: The point is not so much in the content of the document as in the procedure of its signing. It is important that representatives from polar forces should take their seats at the negotiating table. Each politician and each political force must pass this document through themselves, to consider this text to be their own and not submitted from above. Ella PAMFILOVA: Today everyone agrees on a similar selection of populist catchwords--for a great Russia, against the impoverishment of the masses. But even catchwords must be treated very carefully. Is it possible to unite Russia on the principles of rigid nationalism? Is it possible to vanquish poverty by giving up economic reforms? There is still a need to unite on a clearly formulated foundation. Guarantee coupon Boris YELTSIN: "The Conciliatory Commission controls the observance of the provisions formalized by this Agreement... Upon ascertaining the facts of the Agreement being violated the Conciliatory Commission: --makes a pertinent statement in the mass media; --poses a question about excluding the participant from the number of those who signed the Agreement; --tables a proposal on measures bearing on the political responsibility of persons...all the way to relieving them from the leading positions they hold and laying down deputy powers." Sergei SHAKHRAI: I would name three main guarantees for the fulfilment of the Agreement. First, the honor and dignity of the people from different political forces. Second, control over the mass media. And third, we have suggested that this Agreement be adopted as a law. And here the sequence of steps is important. The law must be adopted after all have signed it. But even if someone disagrees, once the law has been adopted, it affects everyone. Gennady ZYUGANOV: Accord can be reached if the document is created from below. This is the best guarantee. All the more so since no legal norms must be built into it. Only moral and political commitments. Vladimir LYSENKO: The question about guarantees is the most difficult one. The President suggests setting up a Conciliatory Commission which will censure and penalize someone. I think that this is naive. If someone violates the Agreement, it will mean that it is not in force. At best there will be a need to appeal to public opinion. Any attempts to formulate some political or legal mechanism are unfeasible. Weather for tomorrow Boris YELTSIN: "I believe that adoption and implementation of the Agreement are feasible." Gennady ZYUGANOV: The chances of signing the document on accord are high enough. We don't have any special choices. There are only three variants for the development of the political situation in Russia: first--a criminal-mafiosi state; second--a large-scale conflict and mass social eruptions, and third--the evolutionary path of changes. The first two roads will hardly suit the President. But if the evolutionary process proceeds in a democratic way, at least on the surface, then the Left-centre forces will come to power in a legitimate way... Vladimir LYSENKO: The Agreement has a chance for success. Relations between the opposition and the regime have become more positive. The pendulum has continued moving leftward. Therfore the opposition has quieted down. Earlier they wanted to topple the President immediately. Now the opposition, at any rate the parliamentary one, has come to the conclusion that it is better to wait two years than provoke clashes. MN policy desk The draft Agreement prepared by the President has been made public. This event is, in effect, a starting point of the official negotiating process. Judging by comments, the way to civil reconciliation will not be easy. Making the first statements, the sides have so far designated their extreme claims. A process of long political bargaining lies ahead which must result in mutual concessions. But will there be any? And if there will, will it be possible to keep the course towards democracy and the market alive? For the time being, at any rate, accord has been reached on only one thing--on the sides' readiness to renounce unconstitutional action. This, as politicians believe, is the minimum program. It is not ruled out, however, that this minimum is the maximum for today's Russia.
