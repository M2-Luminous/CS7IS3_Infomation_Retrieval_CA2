Even Honda Motor Co., considered typical of one of the more successful operations, has been losing steam these days. While U.S. carmakers are enjoying a comeback, Honda hopes to regain its footing with its new model Accord. But even with the high yen, if Honda hopes to maintain its present work force at home, it will have to continue exporting some of its cars from Japan, thus putting restraints on its competitiveness and the "localization" of its products. Along with the Civic, the new Accord, which came out yesterday (2 September [1993]), is one of the company's leading models and is important for the company, especially in the United States. There, of the 770,000 Honda cars sold in 1992, Accords accounted for 390,000 units, or one-half of all sales. Honda's goal is to sell 375,000 of the new model Accords in the United States on an annual basis, compared to 48,000 on the domestic market. However, to beat the Big Three--General Motors Corp. (GM), Ford Motor Co., and Chrysler Corp.--will not be easy. U.S. cars are improving in quality and Japanese cars have lost their almost religious following. U.S. carmakers are also now on top in terms of having cut costs through restructuring, including wide personnel cutbacks. At Honda, "costs have been cut at the source," according President Nobuhiko Kawamoto, and the company is now clearly taking a course that will give precedence to profits over market shares. The first step in that strategy is to further localize its operations. Thus, there were some 61 U.S. parts makers directly involved with the new model Accord this time from the development stage on. Two years ago, when the Civic was brought out, there were only 20 such companies. Honda has also raised its local sourcing from 75 percent to 82 percent. Compared to its 1993 models, 64 additional local companies are supplying parts, raising the total number of such supplies to 320 companies. New locally supplied parts include suspension [frames], airbags, and sunroofs, for a total of 395 locally supplied parts. Moreover, designers were sent out from as early as the planning stage to tour the facilities of Japanese-U.S. parts makers and recommend the use of existing plants to manufacture parts. When new cars are made, a large capital investment is required. But in the Accord's case, Honda was able to get by with "half the usual investment in plants and equipment," according to Kawamoto. Ninety engineers from Honda of U.S. Manufacturing, Inc. (Ohio) were sent for three years to Honda's Saitama plant (in Sayama city). The idea behind this experiment, the first of its kind for Honda, was to have them learn how to reduce production costs from the company's central manufacturing base in Japan. Armed with the knowledge it has gained about localization this time, Honda plans to expand local production even further. It is even studying the feasibility of shifting production to the United States of the Integra and Legend, which are now only exported from Japan. As localization moves forward, an important question it brings with it is how to cope with the "hollowing out" of domestic industry. Last year, about 60,000 Accords were exported from Japan to the United States. Though less than 20 percent of all Accords sold in the United States, if these 60,000 cars were no longer produced in Japan, some 1,000 workers would become domestic dead weight. But the policy at Honda, says Kawamoto, is "to maintain its personnel." If cuts continue to be made in the production of its four-wheeled vehicles, Honda will have to do something about workers at its Suzuka plant. In lieu of personnel cuts, Honda has begun looking into the possibility of putting the Suzuka plant in charge of parts that are currently produced at both its Hamamatsu and Kumamoto facilities. Revising its rate from 115 yen to 105 yen to the dollar, Kawamoto made it clear yesterday that the company is working on a new management plan. The age of the high yen is making it necessary for companies to consider fundamental changes in the way their domestic and overseas production and sales systems are being organized.
