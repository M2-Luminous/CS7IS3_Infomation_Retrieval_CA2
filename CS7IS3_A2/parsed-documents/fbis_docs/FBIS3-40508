Completes Repair on Arc Heater Wind Tunnel for NASDA 94FE0104A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 30 Sep 93 p 11 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0104A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) has completed a repair on the arc-heater wind tunnel (at the National Aerospace Laboratory in Chofu, Tokyo) which is to be used for testing various materials at the ultrahigh temperature of 1700�C in the development of the Japanese version of the space shuttle, among other things. Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd., installed the arc heater, one of the main features of the wind tunnel, and announced its official delivery on 29 September. The total amount of the order to Sumitomo Heavy Industries was ¥420 million. The purpose of the arc-heater wind tunnel is to simulate the surface temperature of an object when it re-enters the earth's atmosphere and to test the durability of the object under the exotic thermal environment. Since the construction of the arc-heater wind tunnel by NASDA at the National Aerospace Laboratory in 1982, the wind tunnel had used a U.S.-made arc heater in performing various tests. However, the U.S.-made arc heater had some limitations in terms of the shape and size of the objects being tested, and it was plagued with the problems associated with wear and tear in recent years, which prompted the present renovation. The renovated wind tunnel can be used to test various materials for the unmanned winged space vehicle, ``HOPE (H-II Orbital Plane),'' among other things, at a surface temperature of 1700�C. The maximum input power of the arc-heater Sumitomo Heavy Industries delivered is 750 kW (as compared with the previous equipment's maximum input power of 450 kW). The main body is divided into 39 segments in order to achieve an appropriate heating and cooling balance. Thanks to the segmented structure, the heating efficiency is improved by more than 50 percent.
