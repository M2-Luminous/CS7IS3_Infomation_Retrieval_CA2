Those who think the development of secondary and tertiary industries will eventually affect agricultural development are wrong. He added: As long as cadres at all levels earnestly take the overall interests into consideration, they will be able to promote and develop primary, secondary, and tertiary industries simultaneously. If they develop secondary and tertiary industries at the expense of agriculture, the consequences will be perilous. The State Council held a joint conference on comprehensive agricultural development in Beijing on 31 May. Leaders from departments concerned of the CPC Central Committee exchanged views on the arrangements for such comprehensive agricultural development projects as the Liao He Small Delta development project. Chen Junsheng pointed out at the meeting: We are faced with a very important task -- under the situation in which the population continues to grow and farmland shrinks with each passing year, how can we take effective measures to utilize and develop farmland resources to the maximum, ensure a long-term and stable supply of agricultural produce, and pay attention to family planning and control of illegal use of farmland at the same time? Chen Junsheng urged localities to do a good job in the following aspects while developing and utilizing land resources: First, we need to further transform medium- and low-yield farmland and quicken the pace of rationally cultivating wasteland. He said: From 1988 to 1993, 145 million mu of medium- and low-yield farmland has been transformed, and 17.25 million mu of wasteland has been cultivated across the country. These two projects helped increase 1.915 billion kg of grains, a increase of 105 kg per mu. It is a great achievement. At present, 855 million mu of medium- and low-yield farmland nationwide has not yet been transformed, indicating great potential in the increase of grain production. The key to achieving the task lies in irrigation construction, popularization of improved varieties of grains, and development of new cultivation techniques. From now on, we should further arouse the enthusiasm of all sides and intensify efforts in cultivating wasteland. In this field, we must persist in paying equal attention to economic, social, and ecological efficiency. Second, we must turn the desert into an oasis. China now has 1 billion mu of usable sandy wasteland. If we spend 10 years developing 100 million mu of sandy wasteland, we will get incalculable social and ecological benefits. He said: China has accumulated plenty of successful experiences in desert control and we should popularize these experiences in various localities in line with local conditions. Third, we should develop coastal shoals and reclaim land from marshes. Chen Junsheng said: There is nearly 20 million mu of shoals along China's coastal provinces that are suitable for cultivation. If we can turn 10 million mu of these shoals into farmland in 10 years, we will gain huge profits. Chen Junsheng spoke highly of Liaoning's measures to promote comprehensive agricultural development in recent years and its achievement of being more than sufficient in agricultural produce. Liaoning, China's base of heavy industries and raw materials, had been short of grain and major nonstaple food for a long time. Since 1988, Liaoning has made efforts in comprehensive agricultural development and has significantly increased grain production. Since 1990, total grain production in Liaoning has reached 1.5 billion kg, enough for the entire province. Since then, Liaoning has not needed to import grain from other regions. Currently, Liaoning has a sufficient supply of nonstaple food like poultry, eggs, milk, pork, and vegetables. Chen Junsheng pointed out: Liaoning offers a good example to other coastal provinces in coordinately developing primary, secondary, and tertiary industries.
