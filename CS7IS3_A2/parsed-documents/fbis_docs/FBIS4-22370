It is known that Vezirov and Mutalibov, at one time the top officials of the country, presently reside somewhere in Russia and are not advertising their specific location. A. Mutalibov, first secretary during the waning days of perestroyka, is accused of effecting a state coup. By state coup is meant the unsuccessful attempt to return to power following his unlawful overthrow by the People's Front. Accusations directed towards his predecessor, A. Vezirov, are more serious. Vezirov was caught participating in the events of the end of January 1990, when hundreds of people perished as Soviet troops were brought into Baku.
