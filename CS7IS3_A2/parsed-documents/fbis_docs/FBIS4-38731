No one seriously objects to it in principle. Both the president and the prime minister have repeatedly stated that the main aim of economic reform as a whole is to improve people's lives, but without scrupulous calculations and long-term forecasting of the social consequences of the government's actions, no serious decisions can be made. That is why I propose that we should look at the problem of indexation more closely. An increase in the minimum wage in the country to 19,000 rubles [R] will immediately be reflected in a corresponding growth in all social payments. And this means subsidies, pensions, and compensation. The main point is that the payment of the first category under the Single Tariff Scheme in budget-funded sectors of the economy will definitely change. In this case I am not so much worried about a possible spurt in inflation as by the practical problems of budgets at various levels. We know that today workers in budget-funded sectors are 80-percent funded out of local treasuries. Will regional budgets be able to provide another wage increase to their teachers and doctors if the government adopts this decision? I think it unlikely. Indeed, my latest trips around the country have convinced me that, with an inflation rate that has slowed down, people are demanding not so much the indexation of wages as their payment on time. To my mind, it would be more reasonable to elaborate a system of clear-cut recommendations on which local authorities could base independent decisions on increasing wages to their budget-funded workers. In that case, their decisions would be based on real financial possibilities and therefore would be of a practical nature rather than being on paper only.
