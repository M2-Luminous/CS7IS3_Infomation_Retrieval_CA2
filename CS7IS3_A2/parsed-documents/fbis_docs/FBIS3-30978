[Granic] After my talks with [Bosnian] Prime Minister [Haris] Silajdzic, we made an evaluation and, with the agreement of the president of the republic of course, I sent a letter to Mr. Butrus-Ghali, the UN secretary general, in which I explained that Croatia is proposing the control [by the UN] of all the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including those between Croatia and Herzegovina, and also that we would -- from the border areas, that means south of Buna, south of Mostar -- withdraw our units and some elements of the Croatian Army from the left bank [of the Neretva River]; these we have been calling volunteers because they have been and are now -- although the international comunity calls them elements of the Croatian Army. [I explained] that we would withdraw them from the right [as heard] bank -- but in the spirit of the fact that General [Ante] Roso and General [Rasim] Delic [Croat and Muslim army commanders, respectively] would meet -- and this was confirmed today -- on 18 February in Split in order to reach agreement on a comprehensive cease-fire between Croatian and Muslim forces. On the other hand, we sought from the United Nations the complete protection of Croatian enclaves in central Bosnia. [Announcer] So that sentence in the REUTERS news item, in which it says -- and I quote -- volunteers as elements of the regular Croatian Army would be withdrawn [fails to complete sentence]. Who exactly? [Granic] As regards the border areas, that is the Croatian Army. And as regards the elements of the Croatian Army -- these are volunteers [as heard]. [Announcer] Thank you very much, Mr. Granic, for responding to our call and being the guest on "Slikom na Slku" [Picture Versus Picture] program.
