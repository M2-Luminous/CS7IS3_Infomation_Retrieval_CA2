They discussed relations between the two friendly countries and ways to bolster them in all fields. They also exchanged views on recent developments in the peace process. Dr. al-Majali explained Jordan's firm stand and commitment to both the bilateral and multilateral levels of the peace process -- a commitment based on the resolutions of international legitimacy until just, comprehensive, and lasting peace is achieved in the region. He also praised the United Kingdom's efforts in this regard. For his part, Hurd praised His Majesty King Husayn's efforts to achieve peace, stressing the importance of the role played by Jordan in its capacity as a factor of security and stability in the region. The meeting was attended by Talal al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs; the Jordanian ambassador in London; the British ambassador in Amman; and the delegation accompanying the guest secretary. Moreover, the Jordanian and British sides today held talks at the Ministry of Water and Irrigation dealing with the water situation in Jordan. The Jordanian side was attended by Dr. Hisham al-Khatib, minister of water and irrigation, while the British side was headed by Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary. Dr. al-Khatib said the talks focused on Jordan's water situation and the talks on water issues which Jordan held within the peace process, whether on the bilateral or multilateral levels. He added that talks also covered relations between the two friendly countries in all fields, especially British technical aid to Jordan in order to exploit the waters of Qa' Disah in southern Jordan and to transfer these waters for use in northern Jordan. The minister noted that EC countries, especially Britain, are aware that Jordan is suffering an acute shortage of water due to natural factors and because it is not receiving its fair share of the waters from the al-Yarmuk and Jordan Rivers. This was confirmed by all international studies in this field.
