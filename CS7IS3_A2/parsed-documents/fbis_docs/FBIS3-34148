FBIS3-34148 "drnes024_r_94003" FBIS-NES-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 India Commentary Notes Remarks BK0402113294 Delhi All India Radio General Overseas Service in English 1010 GMT 4 Feb 94 BK0402113294 Delhi All India Radio General Overseas Service in English 1010 GMT 4 Feb 94 Language: English Article Type:BFN [Commentary by Ashok Sharma] [Text] For over four years now, Pakistan has been turning all international meetings into a battleground to embarrass India, particularly on human rights issue. Constrained somewhat by the accepted of not raising bilateral issues at such gatherings, Pakistan has taken to raising the Kashmir issue under the garb of the alleged human rights violations in the valley. In this attempt Pakistan has been encouraged to a great extent by the Clinton administration making the human rights issue its major policy plank. A view seems to prevail in Islamabad that Washington can intercede on its behalf and force India to agree to a solution on terms favorable to Pakistan. Excelling her predecessor Mr. Nawaz Sharif in anti-India tirade, Ms. Benazir Bhutto's private attitude toward India has vitiated whatever atmosphere had been generated for good-neighborly ties in recent years. Recently, the dispute drowned all hopes at the Human Rights Commission meeting at the Geneva with Ms. Bhutto stopping just short of calling for an all out war against India. Her aim seems to build pressure on the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations to pass a resolution against India. She said that success of any future talks between Islamabad and New Delhi had to be linked to the human rights situation in the Kashmir valley. Pakistan's insistence on the implementation of UN resolutions on Kashmir belied its intentions. Indian finance minister and leader of Indian delegation to the 50th session of the UN Human Rights Commission at Geneva, Dr. Manmohan Singh, exposed the game plan of Pakistan and said to this date 45 years later, Pakistan continues to remain in illegal occupation of one-third of Jammu and Kashmir in violation of the UN resolution and, therefore, there is no possibility for a plebiscite as a precondition of this said UN resolution demands that Pakistan will have to withdraw all its forces and tribal population from the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India not only enjoys perfect legal validity, but had also been sanctified by a popular will. Seeking the support of the world community in its struggle against Pakistan's sponsored terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Manmohan Singh said that this externally inspired terrorism challenged India's territorial integrity and sought to divert its intentions from the basic task of nation-building. Lambasting Pakistan for misusing the UN forum to launch an uncalled- for tirade against India on human rights, he said that an index of India's commitment to human rights and the rule of law was the restraint shown during the Hazratbal crisis generated by the seizure of the holy shrine by Pakistan-supported terrorists. Earlier, replying to Pakistani Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto's harp on human rights in Kashmir, former chief minister of jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, termed the propaganda as false and malicious and said that it was a well-planned attempt on her part to promote terrorism in the state with a view to grab it. He also reminded Pakistan of the tragic plight of the Ahmediyas, the Sindhis, Shi'ites, Christians and other minority communities in that country which is a telling commentary on Islamabad's concern for human rights. Human rights in India are well protected. A national commission for human rights has been established which is quite powerful. Indian legal system also provided sufficient remedial framework of punishing human rights violations. Permanent under secretary of British Foreign Office, David Gillmore, who is on a visit to India has lauded the sensitivity of Indian Government toward human rights. He has praised India's continuing and ever greater transparency in Kashmir on human rights issue and called for strong action by international community against states who are guilty of cross border terrorism.
