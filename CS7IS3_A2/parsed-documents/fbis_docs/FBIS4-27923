The approach is outlined in an Australian Government response to a parliamentary report on relations with Indonesia. The document said Australia's Defense Force did not provide training to Indonesian troops for internal security or counter-insurgency. The statement said cooperation with Indonesian Special Forces focussed on low-level military and welfare skills, as well as communications operation, small arms practice, and medical training. Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said the government shared the parliamentary committee's view that human rights was the most sensitive area of Australia's relations with Indonesia.
