We are presenting the chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of state, Eduard Shevardnadze's radio interview. Batoni Eduard, Russian Defense Minister Grachev's visit to Tbilisi was apparently the past week's major event. Yet another concrete step was taken in the handling of the Abkhazian conflict. Considering recent developments could you please give yet another answer to a question you have been asked before. How interested is Russia in the settlement of the Abkhazian conflict, I mean the Russia that celebrated the day of the declaration of its sovereignty yesterday and has just begun to apprehend its sovereignty and independence? You have also answered the next question before but it is more interesting to hear an answer today: Could this kind of settlement of the Abkhazian issue cause irritation in the West and especially in the United States? [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. With regard to Russian Defense Minister [Pavel] Grachev's visit to Georgia, you know that I highly appreciated it especially because apart from this visit there were two rather significant telephone conversations with the Russian president, one at the beginning of the visit and the other after it. As you know, Mr. Yeltsin has already issued a edict on the deployment of peace-keeping forces in Abkhazia. In our second telephone conversation he confirmed that by signing the document he showed his understanding of the seriousness of the obligations Russia and the CIS are taking in providing assistance pertaining to this mission. The UN Security Council is to meet soon. Provided the Security Council passes a resolution on expanding the mandate of its observers to which Russia's consent already exists, we shall be seeing quite interesting developments. The very deployment of troops will be related to preliminary measures on mine-clearing on roads, crossroads, bridges, and simply in a certain area and this is rather a laborious and risky job. This work, I mean the deployment of the troops, will apparently begin on the 15th or 16th [month not stated]. I have said that we are dealing with a very interesting case. Why? One on hand, we have the CIS and Russia's peace-keeping mission as a regular organization, and on the other hand, a powerful institute of UN observers and the [UN] Refugee Commissioner's office whose activities will constitute a significant factor. Thus, the CIS, the Russian troops with a peacekeeping mission, the international control, and a very important team from the Refugee Commissioner's office which will provide refugees returning to their homes with as much material and financial assistance as possible. For a country in our situation, this is an optimum variant. I would say an optimum and, taking into consideration this factor, an interesting variant. I had three substantial and rather lengthy talks with Grachev. We considered almost all aspects of our relations including the situation in Caucasia through the spectrum of Russia and Georgia. We considered the present situation in the Georgian armed forces and the situation in the Russian troops stationed in Georgia. I have to say that they are grateful to the population of Georgia and the authorities who created normal living and service conditions. We have also considered important issues of mutual relations, especially Russia's participation in the building of Georgian armed forces. You may be well aware that without that we will not be able to create our national army. We have often emphasized that Russian-Georgian cooperation and mutual agreement by no means contradicts the interests of other countries. On the contrary, it is directed toward peace and stability in Caucasia and even a broader region. In my opinion, stability meets the interest of Georgia as well as Russia and other countries. This was the topic of my telephone conversations with Mr. Boris Yeltsin. These conversations were a logical continuation of positive moves in Russian-Georgian relations which started after the Russian president's visit to Tbilisi. As for the final part of your question, I have already said that a unique pattern of the settlement of a conflict is being created. [passage omitted] We can see the cooperation, mutual understanding, and mutual respect of Russia, the CIS, the Western countries, Georgia's friends [words indistinct] including the United States. In the event the plan is implemented, I think this experience will acquire great significance for the future, for the settlement of other conflicts. Speaking of irritation, I consider this unfounded. I was gravely concerned by symptoms of confrontation between the United States and Russia which were seen recently. Fortunately, the leaders of the two states demonstrated sufficient wisdom and prudence to prevent these symptoms from transforming into real confrontation. The situation is quite normal at the moment and these two great states act in an atmosphere of mutual understanding. The settlement of the Abkhazian conflict may become a model for the implementation of new international relations. To speak of changes in a post-cold-war period, this may become a concrete and very characteristic example of the cooperation of the international community in handling a conflict. I also pin great hopes on UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali [words indistinct] [Oniani] Batoni Eduard, last Sunday could be described as a day of elections. Despite the fact that certain circles expected something extraordinary from the elections, they were held in a calm and normal atmosphere in Zugdidi, Chkhorotsku, and Tsalenjikha. On the other hand, there were certain excesses in Rustavi. Grave violations were observed. Unsealed boxes containing papers were brought to some polling stations. Armed units appeared in the city and they exerted pressure on voters and even on members of the electoral commission. The chairman and some members of the commission were forced to flee from Rustavi and arrived in Tbilisi. This abnormal situation was observed in Rustavi at about 1800. [Shevardnadze] The elections in Samegrelo, with such an active participation of voters -- according to official reports over 60 percent of voters came to the polling stations [words indistinct] -- were a great success. I would like to thank the citizens, the authorities, the electoral commissions of Zugdidi, Chkhorotsku, and Tsalenjikha as well as the Committee for Emergency Situations in western Georgia. [passage omitted] I congratulate all the elected candidates. [passage omitted] As for what happened in Rustavi, this is very regrettable. However, I am not pessimistic. This event could be considered as a lesson for the citizens of Rustavi as well as for all of Georgia. [passage omitted] Unfortunately, the day of elections turned out to be very difficult. I want to draw one conclusion from this case. I am saying this for everyone to hear and everyone should consider it for the future. When money and force govern elections, elections have nothing to do with democracy [words indistinct]. This must be taken into consideration by all parties, all political forces, and all who intend to participate in elections in the future. This must be remembered by all. [passage omitted] The citizens of Rustavi and the electoral commission will be able to look into the case and make the appropriate decisions. [passage omitted] [Oniani] In your previous interview you said that materials about the illegal activities of political parties and officials would again be published in the press. Certain facts were made public last week, too. Now, if we draw certain conclusions from those and previous publications and assemble the links into a chain, the question of who will be next arises. This question arises also because the scale of corruption indicates that it is not only one or two people who are involved in this criminal activity. There are indications that the topic of a struggle against organized crime and corruption will be given priority at tomorrow's parliament session. Last week, your address to the parliament was made public. The address called for drafting laws and adopting measures to fight this kind of crime. [Shevardnadze] I do not know what the parliament will discuss tomorrow but I would say that the publication of individual facts should be welcomed. [passage omitted] The main point is to create a system of fighting against corruption. It is essential to ensure state control and coordination of the system, to create a legislature taking into account all the changes that have occurred in recent years. [passage omitted] I appealed to parliament to expedite the drafting of laws and make decisions on the fight against crime, and I hope they will do it as they did with drafting economic laws whose effects and signs of implementation we can already see. [passage omitted] [Oniani] Processes that have been under way in our republic lately are a cause for optimism. Several important documents have been issued. An idea has been initiated in Kutaisi in connection with strengthening the coupon. They have created their own methods. The edict regarding the savings bank is also of a great importance. You have already talked about this but I think there may be some news about that because the process has started. [Shevardnadze] I am grateful that you brought this issue forward. I would like to express my ardent support for everything done in Kutaisi. This is an autonomous way of managing a city, its economic and financial spheres. [passage omitted] I issued a special edict which gives the Kutaisi leadership more rights and possibilities to make large-scale decisions on certain issues. I have to say that the Kutaisi authorities have interesting plans about how to make the coupon stronger, although some people might say that it seems very difficult to imagine how this can be done in an individual city. [passage omitted] I also issued an edict granting the Tbilisi mayoralty expanded rights and I can already see how the city has changed. We can speak of the city's artistic and creative life and many other things and all these result from conferring the right to take an initiative to the local authorities. Taking into account the slight easing of the situation, I can say that the time has come for bold experiments. In this connection I would like to thank you for reminding me of the issue of the savings bank. It is a great thing as an experiment. This was initiated by the president of the bank together with his colleagues. [passage omitted] What is the point [of the savings bank experiment]? The point is that banking is being transferred to a market economy. Depositors are becoming shareholders, or rather owners of the bank. When the bank's president suggested that the state should reduce its share to the minimum in favor of depositors, I agreed to the idea. In this case a depositor becomes not a simple shareholder but a serious owner. [passage omitted]
