Picketing is organized of the Crimean and Sevastopol television and radio broadcasting companies and demands are advanced to dismiss television and radio journalists Tatyana Korobova, Lilya Budzhurova, Leonid Pilunskyy, and Halyna Khmelyovska, who occupy the position of common sense. Clouds are gathering over president of the "Crimea" Television and Radio Broadcasting company Valeriy Astakhov, who is accused of pro-Ukrainian sentiments. In reality, Astakhov occupies a balanced centrist position. Some people even assert that a competition has been announced for the presently occupied post of president of the "Crimea" Television and Radio Broadcasting company. Those who claim this post include former head of the company Anatoliy Sivachenko, one of the leaders of the "Republican Movement of the Crimea" Boris Kizilov, and leader of the "Russian Party of the Crimea" Sergey Shuvaynikov.
