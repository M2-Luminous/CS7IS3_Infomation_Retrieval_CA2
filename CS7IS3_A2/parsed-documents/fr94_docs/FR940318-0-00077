FR940318-0-00077 FR940318-0-00014 26 CFR Parts 1, 301 and 602 [TD 8530] RIN 1545&hyph;AQ60 Limitation on Net Operating Loss Carryforwards and Certain Built-In Losses Following Ownership Change; Special Rule for Value of a Loss Corporation Under the Jurisdiction of a Court in a Title 11 Case AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service, Treasury. ACTION: Final and temporary regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations that provide guidance on determining the value of a loss corporation following an ownership change to which section 382(l)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies. Under sections 382 and 383, the value of the loss corporation, together with certain other factors, determines the rate at which certain pre-change tax attributes may be used to offset post-change income and tax liability. These rules are needed to provide guidance to taxpayers concerning compliance with sections 382 and 383. DATES: These regulations are effective as of March 17, 1994. For date of applicability of §1.382&hyph;9, see §1.382&hyph;9(p). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Liquerman of the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate), Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20224 (Attention CC:DOM:CORP:T:R) or telephone (202) 622&hyph;7750 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collections of information contained in these final regulations have been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 1545&hyph;1324. The estimated annual burden per respondent with respect to the §1.382&hyph;9(i) election varies from 5 to 30 minutes, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 15 minutes. The estimated annual burden per respondent with respect to the §1.382&hyph;9(p)(2) election varies from 5 to 30 minutes, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 15 minutes. These estimates are approximations of the average time expected to be necessary for a collection of information. They are based on such information as is available to the Internal Revenue Service. Individual respondents or recordkeepers may require more or less time, depending on their particular circumstances. Comments concerning the accuracy of these burden estimates and suggestions for reducing these burdens should be directed to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, T:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. The collections of information in this regulation are in §§1.382&hyph;9(i) and 1.382&hyph;9(p)(2). This information serves as evidence of an election to apply section 382(l)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) in lieu of section 382(l)(5) and an election to apply retroactively the provisions of the final regulations. The information is required by the Internal Revenue Service to assure that a loss corporation uses the proper amount of carryover attributes following specified types of ownership changes. Background This document contains final regulations to be added to 26 CFR part 1 under section 382 of the Code. The Service published proposed amendments to the regulations under section 382 in the Federal Register on August 6, 1992 (57 FR 34736). See also 1992&hyph; 2 C.B. 616. The rules are effective with respect to any ownership change occurring on or after March 17, 1994. However, a loss corporation may elect to apply the rules in the final regulations in their entirety to any ownership change occurring before March 17, 1994, including ownership changes to which section 382(l)(5) applied. Written comments were received, but no public hearing was held as none was requested. Explanation of Provisions Section 382(l)(6) of the Code provides a special valuation rule for certain ownership changes that result from a title 11 or similar case to which section 382(l)(5) does not apply. Under this special valuation rule, the value of the loss corporation reflects any increase in value resulting from any surrender or cancellation of creditors' claims in the bankruptcy transaction. The proposed regulations provide rules regarding the application of this special valuation rule and the coordination of that rule with other statutory rules related to the value of a loss corporation.
