Located at the junction of the Chang Jiang River and the Beijing-Kowloon railway, both of which are under development, Jiangxi has successfully absorbed overseas capital to fund its economic take-off. The province has used foreign funds to the tune of 838 million U.S. dollars since 1984. Of the sum, direct business investment has exceeded the loans from governments of foreign countries. Before 1991, however, foreign investment in most joint ventures was less than 300,000 U.S. dollars each. Most jobs were labor-intensive at that time. By last year, there were 59 such firms each with an investment exceeding five million U.S. dollars. More firms were in technology-intensive and export-oriented industries. The investment structure has also become diversified to embrace transportation, energy, raw materials and other areas of infrastructure. The joint ventures have also created jobs. More than 30,000 people were employed in newly-opened factories last year. The introduction of new technology and management skills have upgraded local industries. This year the province is determined to reform its financial, monetary, and foreign trade enterprises and offer more desirable terms to foreign businessmen. It is also trying to obtain loans from governments of foreign countries and international financial organizations.
