How did the factions surmount their differences? Or are there still many differences among them? [Al-Shiqaqi] Since the beginning of September 1993, when news of the Oslo agreement began to leak, the 10 factions have held meetings to discuss the possibility of upgrading their year-old coalition. There was talk of establishing a national Islamic front with a political program that would be more advanced than the earlier points of minimum agreement among them and more developed organizationally. It took some time to agree on the front's name and its program. The disagreement at this stage was with the brothers in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine because of certain political differences over the interim program and UN resolutions. Eventually, faced with pressure to be responsible, all the conferees found common ground for building a political program and outlining political tasks within the context of a front called "The Alliance of Palestinian Forces." Ideological differences were avoided. After this, the meeting was adjourned for a week pending a new proposal that was being prepared by the brothers in Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. On the evening of Wednesday, 15 January 1993, the last meeting was held. Hamas made a new proposal that appeared to call for a formula that was stronger than the existing 10 factions framework but still weaker than a front. It became apparent that the proposed political program, or rather the proposed political tasks, differed in more than one aspect than what had been agreed upon earlier. The organizational formula, however, treated all the factions as equals. The 5 January [date as published] meeting was tense and anxiety-ridden at first and it appeared headed toward a deadlock. Personally, however, I was optimistic and worked hard to bridge the gap between the position of the Hamas brothers and the positions of the other factions. I made several specific proposals to end the differences and when it became clear that my proposals would be received positively, we recessed the meeting for half an hour for private consultations within each faction and for bilateral consultations. During the recess I discussed the issue with the brothers in Hamas after holding quick meetings with the other factions. We returned to the conference room to announce that we had reached a full agreement that would satisfy everyone. An atmosphere of optimism and satisfaction replaced the tension and anxiety. We began to review the documents in a sincere and easy manner and decided to hold a press conference the next day to proclaim the happy news to our people about the establishment of "The Alliance of Palestinian Forces." I can say that we have overcome the basic obstacles to such an alliance. However, there are pending issues of less importance. We will discuss them at a meeting of the central leadership in less than two weeks. [AL-'AHD] Did you leave the meeting with a clearly defined program, or will you continue with the former methods? [Al-Shiqaqi] We have agreed on clear and specific political tasks. Some are strategic and had to be spelled out in the agreement. Other tasks are interim and include the need to confront the Oslo agreement and its dangers. The basic tasks on which we agreed will guide our future activities. As for detailed plans, we will discuss them at future meetings. I will not hide from our people or the masses represented by our alliance that we are facing very difficult and complex circumstances. In the absence of any international or regional backing, what is being done on the real battleground inside Palestine will play the decisive role. The strength of the new alliance will be measured by its actual impact on the battle inside the homeland. We have taken an important step forward. Although we have no magical solutions, we are determined to do everything in our power to carry out the tasks on which we have agreed. [passage omitted] Just as we rejected the agreement, we will reject the elections. Our resolve cannot be shaken by any incentives. The future of Palestine is a million times more important than a lowly, worthless council. I advise all hesitant people and advocates of realism among those who once chose struggle and jihad not to come close to this pyre. I am convinced, however, that a certain party to the agreement will delete the election clause from the declaration of principles. Concerning municipal elections or other ones, we determine our position based on their political significance and function. We will boycott any institution or organization stemming from the self-rule authority and entailing recognition of the Zionist enemy and its occupation of our land. But we will deal positively, as we did in the past, with the other institutions and with society's infrastructure. [AL-'AHD] You strongly reject what is taking place. What alternative are you proposing, taking into account that the people continue to suffer in the occupied territories? [Al-Shiqaqi] What is the cause of the people's suffering? The occupation, of course. According to the Oslo agreement, will the occupation end? No, the opposite is true. The enemy wants to rid itself of the occupation's burdens and costs but wants to maintain the occupation's essence and role. We will then have to bear an occupation with double the burden. When the occupation continues, in disguise or without one, it will cast the burdens that it used to carry onto our shoulders. Saying that the above agreement will end our people's suffering is a major illusion that they are trying to sell us. What is really serious is that we are buying this illusion at a price greater than any nation ever paid, namely by acknowledging the enemy's continued presence on the entire territory of our sacred homeland. When our people have arisen in this century it certainly was not for the purpose of filling their bellies. They rose up because they yearned for liberty, independence, identity, and the preservation of their faith and sanctities. If all this is lost, is it important if one fills one's belly? Even the illusions of prosperity are belied by the conditions suffered by all peoples who accept humiliation. This homeland is ours, the sea and the river are ours, and the olives and oranges are ours. The logic of the Koran and history underline these simple facts. Let us move according to this logic and struggle according to it. No matter how many battles the nation has lost, it still has not lost the war. It possesses aspects of power which, if properly organized, are capable of terrifying the invaders. Palestine is the focus and pivot of polarization and renewal. The pain of jihad is a thousand times better than the pain of humiliation. Our alternative is steadfastness, endurance, and continued jihad until the balance of power changes. If we cannot defeat the enemy today, then at least let us not turn into a bridge over which the enemy can cross into the region to reshape it in the way he wants and in line with his goals, ambitions, and interests. We must not turn into allies and guides who show him the way as he presses ahead to control all the region's capitals. Let us continue to confront him and reduce his danger until the nation rises again and God permits change to come. The alternative to this is not peace and an end to suffering, but a Zionist, cancerous, destructive deluge. [AL-'AHD] Why do you refuse to meet with Yasir 'Arafat? [Al-Shiqaqi] We do not believe there is room for a meeting after the Oslo agreement; there is no point. As for why no meeting was held before the agreement, the political issue was again the basic reason. We saw constant gratuitous retreat in 'Arafat's political position. Add to this the war of containment, absorption, and blackmail that the PLO chairman waged against the Islamic Jihad movement. He traded in the movement's name through some distorted figures he created on the Palestinian scene. Claiming to speak for the Islamic Jihad, for instance, someone once came up with an announcement supporting the Gaza-Jericho agreement at a time when six Fatah members rejected it. We cannot be blackmailed, and we are not the ones who stand at the door of the Sultan [i.e. we are not supplicants]. However, this did not prevent our meetings and dialogues over the years with Fatah leaders and cadres; they contacted us from time to time. They rejected the PLO chairman's practices against the Islamic Jihad and opposed his political line, even though he was the one who sent them. [passage omitted on Jordan] [AL-'AHD] If Hamas contests the self-rule elections, what will your position be? You will be standing alone against the plan. [Al-Shiqaqi] The brothers in Hamas have repeatedly stressed to us that they are against the elections and that they will boycott them. They assert that their position is final and decisive. The program of the basic tasks of the Palestinian forces' alliance is clear in this respect. At any rate, our position proceeds from our principled commitment to our people, homeland, and nation; from our understanding and analysis of the conspiracy against Palestine, and from our understanding and interpretation of the reality and the fact that the infamous agreement means an alliance with the enemy against the entire nation and region. We will remain witnesses before God and history, unharmed by those who oppose us. We will remain the conscience of the nation, even if we are reduced to only one person. However, we believe that a large sector of our people and their other leading forces stand with us in the same trench.
