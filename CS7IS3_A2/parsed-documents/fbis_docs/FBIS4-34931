FBIS4-34931 "drlat123_t_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-123 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 Venezuela President: Army Prepared To Repress Violence President: Army Prepared To Repress Violence PA2406173694 Caracas Radio and Television Networks in Spanish 1526 GMT 24 Jun 94 PA2406173694 Caracas Radio and Television Networks Spanish BFN [Speech by President Rafael Caldera on the occasion of Army Day from Paseo Carabobo in Caracas -- live] [Text] The country's present situation dictates that I add a few words to the congratulatory message I sent today, on occasion of the anniversary of the immortal battle of Carabobo, to the Army commander, officers, junior officers, military academy cadets, enlisted troops, and civilian personnel working for the glorious Venezuelan Armed Forces, which today commemorates its special day. Under these circumstances, I must say that I am determined to halt all morbid and criminal attempts to ruin our national currency, which bears the magnificent name of Bolivar, as well as all attempts to deplete our operational reserves. The national government is determined to adopt all necessary measures and quite clearly states that whatever situation the country may face, we have the resources required to meet our international obligations and to satisfy the country's most basic needs. The current situation has circumstantial causes, among which we can mention the distrust that has arisen as a result of despicable rumors that have been intentionally disseminated and the speculators who have no qualms about resorting to any measure for personal gain. We are facing difficult times, but the country understands this and knows that we will overcome it with the support of all Venezuelans. The fall of our currency has reactivated inflationary pressure that we had practically controlled by limiting the fiscal deficit. If it is true that inflationary pressure is reflected over the price of goods, it is also true that speculation has lead consumers to purchase more goods over and above any inflationary pressure. The national government is determined to utilize any means possible to alleviate the situation of lower income groups my making basic goods accessible and by improving the wages of all public and private sector workers. In that respect, we call for everyone's understanding and support. I warn those who are determined to foment disturbances that the people repudiate the violence they are promoting. A majority of the population knows that violence solves nothing and only leads to more violence. Those inciters of violence must keep in mind that even if they can obtain the temporary support of some small groups, they will never ensure the total support of a majority of the population. The national government, with the absolute and determined backing of the National Armed Forces, is prepared to repress violence with all the moderation it can muster, but also with the necessary energy. It is our duty to solve the country's predicament under these circumstances, and we are going to do it. Today, at this time and at this place, which reminds us of the battle of Carabobo, I would like to reaffirm my solemn duty to the Venezuelan people. The Republic will not be lost in my hands. [applause]
