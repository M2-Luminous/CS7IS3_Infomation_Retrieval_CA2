FR940713-2-00025 FR940713-2-00020 [Docket No. PR94&hyph;17&hyph;000] Mississippi Valley Gas Co.; Notice of Petition for Rate Approval July 7, 1994. Take notice that on June 13, 1994, Mississippi Valley Gas Company (Mississippi Valley) filed pursuant to section 284.123(b)(2) of the Commission's regulations, a petition for rate approval requesting that the Commission approve as fair and equitable a maximum rate of $0.2907 per MMBtu for transportation of natural gas on Mississippi Valley's system under section 311(a)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). Mississippi Valley's entire company service area is within the State of Mississippi. Mississippi Valley states that it does not choose to make an election under Section 284.123(b)(1) and instead applies for Commission approval of the $0.2907 general system rate proposed herein. Mississippi Valley's current maximum interruptible transportation rate is also $0.2907 per MMBtu and was approved by letter order dated December 26, 1991 in Docket No. PR91&hyph;21&hyph;000 for a three-year period ending June 16, 1994. For competitive reasons, Mississippi Valley seeks to justify continuation of the current rate even though a higher $.506 rate is supported by this filing. Pursuant to section 284.123(b)(2)(ii), if the Commission does not act within 150 days of the filing date, the rate will be deemed to be fair and equitable and not in excess of an amount which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for similar transportation service. The Commission may, prior to the expiration of the 150-day period, extend the time for action or institute a proceeding to afford parties an opportunity for written comments and for the oral presentation of views, data, and arguments. Any person desiring to participate in this rate proceeding must file a motion to intervene in accordance with sections 385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures. All motions must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission on or before July 22, 1994. The petition for rate approval is on file with the Commission and is available for public inspection.
