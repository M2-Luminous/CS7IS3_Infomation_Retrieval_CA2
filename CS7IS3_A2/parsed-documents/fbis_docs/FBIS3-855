This was disclosed by Finance Minister Dr. Eneias Comiche at a meeting with Maputo businessmen and senior Ministry of Finance officials on 11 March. Comiche said: "There are initial high costs, and that does not apply only" to the formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, adding that "such costs have not yet been estimated" -- salaries, restoration of barracks, demobilization, and so on. Yet another expenditure that has come as a surprise: elections -- $79 million. The international community will only contribute 60 percent. The remainder will have to come from the State General Budget. Initially the government had put Mozambique's costs for the elections at between $3 and $4 million. Comiche's meeting, which ended up being unusually informative, began with the minister outlining the legal fiscal framework of investment and complaining that "it is with a certain regret that so far we have seen no Mozambican entrepreneur with investment plans" for duty free industrial areas already approved by the government (decree 18/93). As expected, the minister dealt with taxes. Ibrahimo Ibrahimo, for many years a senior Ministry of Finance official and currently with an auditors firm, dotted the i's by recalling that on average, the fiscal evasion for the complementary tax in 1978/79 was 80 percent. He added: "I do not believe it has gone down." Ibrahimo described December's fiscal review as an "important step," but added: "As for indirect taxation, those were insufficient measures. " The entrepreneurs were not as generous in their comments, but were far from calling things by their own names. Mozambique Commercial Association President Mario Ussene said the meeting seems to have consolidated the entrepreneurs' standing. In private, they say the changes introduced in the fiscal system were meaningless, but to the minister they said they were a "timid step" in the "right direction." On the question of investment, Ibrahimo stressed that now it takes less time to get projects approved, adding that it continues to take a long time to implement them. Ibrahimo also raised the delicate question of fines. "There is a general perception that there is no strict controlling policy. There are businessmen who are visited two, three, or four times by tax inspectors, while others are not checked at all." At this stage, Comiche said that in Beira recently, businessmen had complained to him about "persecution" by the revenue department. "I tried to point out that it is not a question of persecution. What happens is that they are not used to tax inspectors whom they cannot bribe." He added that he would "reward" the tax inspectors in question. He said categorically: "I will not give in to any pressure." George Tsilakhis, proprietor of the Agricultural Tobacco Company, SAT, also attended the meeting. SAT is one of the two companies that still manufactures cigarettes, but which could close down their operations if their products continue to cost as much as imported cigarettes in view of heavy taxation. Imported cigarettes are exempted from tax. Tsilakhis once again reiterated the tobacco companies' call to the government: to either substantially lower the taxes applicable to Mozambican cigarettes or to scrupulously apply the relevant customs duties on cigarettes imported from South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Malawi. Comiche acknowledged that there is "a great deal of tobacco that enters the country, but does not pay tax." He added: "Unfortunately, it is not only tobacco. It is everything." He pointed out: "We ought to protect the Mozambican industry by controlling borders more effectively." He promised: "We must charge a levy on cigarettes that enter the country without paying duties. We are studying ways of doing it." Is that a vain promise? Commenting on the minister's promise, a reliable source told MEDIAFAX that Comiche has succeeded in controlling imported tobacco, but has done nothing to protect the local industry from sliding down. MEDIAFAX attended the meeting and took the opportunity to ask a few questions of the minister: Businessmen throughout the country say government should cut the budget deficit by reducing public expenditure instead of imposing more taxes. What ministries does he think should be shut down for being irrelevant? Comiche said the government is "looking into" the matter to see which state agencies should be shut down. "It is only a question of opportunity before a decision can be made." The minister said the assets and services account is "extremely tight," but acknowledged that the state is not "being as austere as one would like it to be." He also agreed that the informal sector should also pay taxes. Comiche reiterated the government's position that the collection of taxes from the informal sector should be done by the town councils' police force. MEDIAFAX: To a certain extent the legal business sector evades taxes, but they are not compensated for what they pay. The state is also at fault. For many parents, government schools are now more expensive than private ones, hospitals charge two different fees, and the same applies to passports. As for security, enterprises and citizens need to hire the services of private companies, paying thousands of contos per month. Comiche acknowledged that the question of different prices is widespread, but noted that the situation cannot be corrected through tax evasion. Turning to the question of private security companies, the minister said he did not know whether in a way they encouraged crime to secure contracts. MEDIAFAX: Who are the informal businessmen supplying the black market and ending up not paying taxes? Comiche "passed the buck" to Trade Minister Daniel Gabriel who was also present. Gabriel elaborated on informal trade, but did not give names or clues. MEDIAFAX: Mozambican and foreign investors see the investment code as an improvement on the previous legislation. But would it be legitimate to put Mozambican entrepreneurs in dire straits on an equal footing with foreign entrepreneurs who have capital readily available? Comiche said he was surprised with the question because "Mozambican entrepreneurs had asked for equal treatment" when the issue was raised at the 1992 seminar. The minister said "local savings is negative. We need to look for foreign savings." He stressed that "the law forces foreigners to establish partnerships with Mozambicans." Regardless, Comiche noted that 95 percent of small and medium state enterprises have been privatized by Mozambican businessmen. The meeting also discussed customs and excise. Manuel Alaje, deputy national customs and excise director, told the meeting that "we have been accused of doing nothing, but when we want to adhere to the law, the importers threaten us." He added that the state cannot control "a 6,000-km border." As an example of the most common form of tax evasion, he said "yesterday we detected an underinvoicing case involving 600,000 contos." In its "futile attempt" to adhere to the law, he said customs and excise established in December 1993 an office for the verification of imported merchandise. He said by 9 March customs and excise had managed to recover 5 million contos that would have been otherwise lost. Based on what Mozambican tobacco companies estimate, that figure is only 5 percent of what the state revenue should collect in customs duties on imported tobacco. Alaje said customs departments have been "replacing personnel" in an attempt to reduce the amount of money being pocketed by their functionaries, and to increase state revenue. "Even yesterday all the staff members at Namaacha were replaced without anyone noticing it." "We are doing what is humanely possible." He added that things ought to be done very carefully due to "death threats." The minister told the meeting that fiscal revenue amounts to 26 percent of the gross domestic product, a ratio [preceding word in English] that Comiche regards as "higher" that in underdeveloped countries like Mozambique. At the start of the meeting Comiche said something that is worth keeping on the record: "A reduction in taxes means less revenue for the state." Over the past few years, entrepreneurs and economists have stated otherwise: substantially lower taxes and a wider collecting system covering the informal sector would end up increasing state revenue. Would it be possible for the government to try this option? By the way, when will the government reveal the budget so that everyone knows how each metical is spent? P.S. Once again, an IMF team was in Maputo in a visit shrouded in utmost secrecy. It did not meet with the World Bank or the donors. MEDIAFAX learned that the visit had something to do with the question of counterpart funds. We have also learned that the IMF already completed or is about to complete a study on taxation.
