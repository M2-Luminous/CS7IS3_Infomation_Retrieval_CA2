The Economic Research Institute for North-East Asia, partially financed by the Niigata prefectural and municipal governments, argued that many of the 23 million North Koreans will not be able to keep themselves alive if serious sanctions take effect. Tension over the country's suspected nuclear arms development program heightened further Monday when North Korea declared it would immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations' nuclear safeguard watchdog. The move drastically raised the prospect of early UN sanctions against Pyongyang, or U.S.-coordinated sanctions along with such countries as Japan and South Korea if there is no agreement within the UN Security Council. The institute, headed by economist Hisao Kanamori, said many North Koreans are already living on the verge of hunger due to an extreme dearth of food supplies. Based on released statistics, the institute said food supplies in the country, although on a steady decline, should still be enough to provide a daily average of 2,000 kilocalories per person, an amount sufficient for North Koreans to do everyday work. But the figure is deplorable for the ordinary citizen because of the priority given in food supplies to government bureaucrats and military officials. Also distorting the statistics is the fact that feed for animals is included. The institute has estimated that an average citizen receives a meager 1,400 kilocalories of food every day, an amount that makes active labor quite hard. "We have made an estimation on the living conditions of North Koreans for which little information is available. We hope it will serve as material for discussions on sanctions," said Makoto Nobukuni, chief economist at the institute.
