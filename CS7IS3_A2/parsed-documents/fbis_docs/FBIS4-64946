Aliyev had been in Brussels to sign the so-called Partnership for Peace, a half way accommodation for former Warsaw Pact countries wanting to join NATO. Addressing reporters on his arrival in Ankara Aliyev said he believed this arrangement with NATO would contribute to a solution of his country's dispute with Armenia over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. He added that he had wanted to meet with President Suleyman Demirel on his return from NATO and had decided on a brief stopover in Ankara for this purpose. The two presidents held talks over a working lunch at the Presidential Palace in Ankara. Aliyev left for baku after the lunch. Talking to reporters at a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday Aliyev said his country was considering seeking observer status, or even full membership, of OPEC. Aliyev added that Azerbaijan's future relations with the 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may be decided by talks that started in Istanbul on Monday, between the Azeri state oil company and Western petroleum companies. He said Azerbaijan could "in the very near future" sign contracts with Western companies to develop his country's oil reserves. Azerbaijan was a major source of oil for the former Soviet Union. Although the main oil facilities lie outside the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, Aliyev added that Azerbaijan's oil industry had been hurt by the impact of the country's bloody six-year conflict with Armenia.
