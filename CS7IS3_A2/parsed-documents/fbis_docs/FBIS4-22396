Speaking at the party's founding assembly, Karlan Torosyan, an initiative group representative and chairman of the Ararat-73 society, said: "We have been told for many years that sports is outside politics; life, however, proves otherwise. Physical culture and sports are represented not only by the healthy and the tough, but also by people who possess intellectual potential, who can and should actively participate in formation of policy and resolution of problems of socioeconomic significance, and contribute to raising the athletic authority of Armenia." According to a NOYAN TAPAN report, the first congress of the party will be convened in a month; it will approve the party's charter and program and elect the governing bodies.
