This is what Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmoegnerova said at a news conference in Bratislava today. She said, however, that the one to blame for this situation is not the Czech partner, which is naturally asserting its own interests, but the former Slovak Government, which was not properly prepared to conclude these agreements. Schmoegnerova added that the Slovak Cabinet will deal with this issue in the near future.
