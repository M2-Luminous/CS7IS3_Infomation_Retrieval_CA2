In a press conference to announce the sell-off plan, Cassaro said that Autostrade would become a public company, Aeroporti di Roma would seek a partner and form a controlling core shareholding while selling off remaining stocks, and construction and engineering concerns would be sold off in various different ways. For Italimpianti, with orders on its books worth around one trillion lire (600 million dollars), Cassaro foresaw privatisation moves in six months to a year, with a partner being sought for a joint venture, and Fintecna retaining a shareholding for the next three years. In the building area, some mergers will be needed in a reorganisation plan which is being financed by IRI to the tune of 1.349 trillion lire (803 million dollars), with permission to gather a further 150 billion lire (89 million dollars) on the market. In a related development, the anti-trust committee Wednesday gave the go-ahead for the transfer of holdings from IRI's Iritecna, now in liquidation, to Fintecna. Fintecna receives 43 percent of Aeroporti di Roma stock, 66.2 percent of Autostrade, 90 percent of Autostrade International, 91.16 percent of Condotte, 52.4 percent of Pavimental, 98 percent of Spea-Ingegneria Europea, 100 percent of Servizi Tecnici, 56.99 percent of Sovis, 100 percent of Italimpianti, and 99.99 percent of Italstat International.
