At a press conference hosted by the current session of the National People's Congress (NPC), Qian said that such contacts will contribute to the development of relations between the two sides of the straits. He said that it is a consensus of people on both sides of the straits that "there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of China." This is also a fact recognized by the international community, he said. Asked about China's stand on Taiwan's move to "develop diplomatic space," he said that if the move aims to develop economic relations, "we can understand." "But, if (Taiwan) developing `diplomatic space' aims to create `two Chinas,' that will harm the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and it will be detrimental to the cause of the reunification of China," he said. "We, therefore, are firmly opposed to moves toward that end." On the question of Taiwan's "holiday-making diplomacy," he denounced its avowed purpose of "expanding economic relations" as "false." "There are political intentions in it," he said. Some countries seek to develop non-governmental relations with Taiwan mainly out of economic considerations, he said. But the Taiwan authorities take advantage of this to develop what it calls "diplomatic space" in an attempt to create "one China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas," he said. "It is a move that is not in keeping with the trend of the times and goes against the aspirations of people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits," he said.
