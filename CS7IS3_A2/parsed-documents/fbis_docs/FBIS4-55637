The SNS leadership will recommend to the June congress to return to the the original statutes which prefer the national to the civic principle, Slota said. The April poll showed that the SNS (9 deputies in the 150-member Slovak Parliament) is favoured by some four per cent of voters, while the HZDS by 32 per cent. The observers have suggested that the decision is connected with alleged internal feuds regarding Slota. He enjoys the reputation of a radical politician, not acceptable for Meciar's HZDS. The press has speculated that the June SNS congress could lead to a split into three factions. One could be headed by Slota, the second by deputy chairmen of former Meciar's government Jan Prokes and Marian Andel, and the third by Juraj Molnar who has recently espoused the Pan-Slavic idea of the Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
