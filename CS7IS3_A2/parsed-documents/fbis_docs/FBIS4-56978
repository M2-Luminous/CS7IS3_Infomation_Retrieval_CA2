Gen. de Bari Hermoza, Army commander and president of the Armed Forces Joint Command, made this comment after holding a one and a half hour meeting with George Conmino, head of the International Red Cross in Peru. The meeting was held from 1030 to 1155 in General Hermoza's office in the Army General Headquarters in San Borja. After the meeting, Hermoza answered questions from reporters: [Reporter] General, what issues did you discuss with the head of the International Red Cross in Peru? [Hermoza] The head of the International Red Cross just came to visit. The visit was of the kind frequently made by this organization to the Army. The conversation was very cordial, and we recognize the important humanitarian work done by this organization. [Reporter] Did the president of the Red Cross ask you to facilitate a visit to the zone in conflict? [Hermoza] We always do everything we can to help the Red Cross fulfill its mission. In the last two years, we have granted 55 authorizations to its members to help them fulfill their tasks in the country in visiting garrisons, police posts, and in meeting with people under arrest. We have facilitated all manner of things. The government even authorized them to enter a number of prisons where terrorists are serving their sentences. [Reporter] Will the Armed Forces Joint Command be able to guarantee their visit to the theater of countersubversive operations in the Leoncio Prado Province, Huanuco? [Hermoza] They have no restrictions. What worries me is their security in the areas where the Army is clashing with subversives. At any other time, there would not have been any restrictions. But as the operations develop, they will be able to enter the zone. [Reporter] But they want to visit the site where the clashes are taking place to verify if human right violations are occurring. [Hermoza] They did not state the need to enter the conflict zone, for obvious reasons. Also, for security reasons they cannot enter, for the time being. [Reporter] The chief of the Huallaga Front, Antonio Rodriguez Riveros, questioned the work of the Red Cross and said they leak "information" to the terrorist "commands." [Hermoza] There is no evidence of infiltration or leaks. The interviews are granted according to the situation in the area of conflict. [Reporter] What is the current situation in the Cuchara "pocket" in Huanuco? [Hermoza] An evaluation was made and the Huallaga Front chief reported it. Some policemen were wounded. Some of them were evacuated to Lima yesterday. [Reporter] What do you think of the proposal made by Congressman Chirinos Soto that you remain as Army general commander? [Hermoza] I am thankful to Chirinos for his proposal. I would like to tell the people, the media, that the soldiers and policemen, beginning with their commanders, are the ones who should receive permanent recognition. It is worth noting the greatness with which they risk their lives and continue to fight for the pacification of the country every day. A commander needs only to fight by the side of his soldiers to carry out the strategy ordered by the president of the Republic, who is really the person leading us toward victory. [Reporter] What is the human rights situation in the zones where the clashes between the Army and the terrorists are taking place? [Hermoza] There are no violations. The Congressional Human Rights Commission and the attorney general have gone to Huanuco. The attorney general even appointed a special prosecutor. Any investigation falls in the legal field. We have direct and smooth communications with the International Red Cross. I would like to say that human rights are a strategic need contained in all the guidelines of the president of the Republic and of national pacification.
