On February 22, the U.S. Government instituted judicial proceedings against Aldrich Hazen Ames, the former chief of the CIA's Soviet counter-intelligence branch, and his wife Maria, charging them with spying for the former Soviet Union and Russia. Three days later, the U.S. Government expelled a Russian diplomat from the Russian Embassy in Washington. It's widely believed that the incident will have a major impact on Russian-U.S. relations. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher personally handed an statement of protest to the Russian Embassy in Washington, declaring that the U.S. could not tolerate Russia installing spies in its country and describing the incident as a very serious matter. Commenting on the case, U.S. President Bill Clinton suggested that as a result the U.S. will completely re-evaluate its foreign policy toward Russia. Many senators in the U.S. Congress insisted that amendments should be attached to policies on aid to Russia. In the last two years, the United States and Russia have been seeking a strategic partnership in their relations. In January their presidents met in Moscow and signed a declaration announcing that the two countries had entered a stage of "strategic partnership". However, there are still contradictions and differences between the two countries on matters of vital interests. Russia has always claimed that it has "special interests and responsibilities" in the new republics which have emerged in the territories of the former Soviet Union. Russia has taken it for granted that it has the right to send its peace keeping troops into these republics and has taken economic measures to safeguard its interests in them. Meanwhile, the United States has been using the carrot of economic aid to various republics and countries in the area as a means of containing Russia's influence. The United States, for example, has supported the three Baltic republics in their request for the withdrawal of Russian troops and has offered more economic aid for the Ukraine. It also signed an accord of "democratic partnership" with Kazakhstan. Observers here consider that the proposed U.S. plan for expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which it has described as a "partnership for peace", poses a threat to Russian interests in East European countries where it previously had traditional influence. So far, the Russian Government has kept a tight rein on its response to the U.S. spy allegations. The Russian intelligence agency has also kept silent, despite Russia's known displeasure about the U.S. decision to publicly announce the allegations and the charges without consulting it in advance. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in a statement last Thursday [24 February] that the Ames issue should not be placed at the top of the Russian-U.S. relations agenda. Kozyrev said he believed that the issue won't set back the hopes for a partnership for peace between Russia and the United States. The Foreign Ministry also expressed its hope that the issue could be settled before the political and diplomatic interests of both countries were put in jeopardy. Sources from Russian intelligence agencies here said they were bewildered by the dramatizing of the spy issue on the part of their American colleagues and the U.S. Government. An official with the Russian intelligence agency said in an informal talk that spies from the U.S. are also active on Russian territory and hence the Ames issue should be tackled within a framework drawn up between the intelligence agencies of the two countries. However, press commentators in Moscow are convinced that the uproar in the U.S. about the issue will have an adverse effect on the future development of the relations between the two countries. They believe that the approach now used by the two sides to calm down the row will, to some degree, dictate where their bilateral relations will head for.
