"I do not think he will be replaced," Arce added. Arce said the expansion of the FSLN National Directorate to 15 members and the ratification of most members of the traditional National Directorate were outstanding decisions made at the Sandinist Special Congress. The vote by the congress delegates left out only two previous members of the top Sandinist executive body, namely, Dr. Sergio Ramirez and Commander Jaime Wheelock, who did not run because he is studying abroad. The removal of Dr. Ramirez "is in keeping with the need and the will voiced by the congress to renew the leadership and to endorse the traditional directorate," Arce said. He said this action should not be interpreted as "punishment of an individual" who had supported the theory that Sandinism should respond to the majority, as certain people had claimed in the halls of the Olof Palme Convention Center. "Although, we could talk about a political defeat," Arce said, "I actually think the congress had to simply choose 15 people. It is like a baseball game in which someone has to win and someone has to lose." Nevertheless, Arce believes Dr. Ramirez will not be left out of the decisionmaking process. He added that among the National Directorate's first tasks will be the creation of new mechanisms, a task that will benefit from his knowledge and experience. Arce, who supported the candidacy of Daniel Ortega on the opening day of the congress, downplayed Dr. Ramirez's absence at the closing ceremony. He said the same was true for Commander Victor Tirado, who was brought from his residence after being approved as a National Directorate member. "I do not give any political significance to Sergio's absence," Arce pointed out. "I want you to know that if Daniel had extended his speech, I would have fallen asleep," the high-ranking leader joked. During an informal news conference after the closing of the congress, Arce refused to say whether Sandinism achieved a consensus during the three days of discussions, but he did say, "we achieved substantial progress," and he suggested heeding Commander Ortega's invitation to continue fine-tuning the discussions. Arce thinks the mixture of traditional and new figures poses a challenge to the National Directorate: "We need to learn from the incoming youths and climb to the level set by our heroes and martyrs, whom we replaced in the struggle against the dictatorship."
