FBIS4-66742 "jpnea026___94027" JPRS-NEA-94-026 JPRS Near East & South Asia 10 April 1994 SOUTH ASIA PAKISTAN Government Talks With U.S. Government Talks With U.S. Viewed 94AS0265C Karachi AMN in Urdu 10 Apr 94 p 4 94AS0265C Karachi AMN Urdu CSO [Editorial: "Pak-U.S. Talks"] [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has said that the United States is the only superpower in the world and it has to have a role in resolving the Kashmir issue. It can also play a role in ending the dissension between India and Pakistan. Therefore, she wishes to improve relations with the United States. She was addressing a news conference on Thursday in the chamber of the National Assembly, and said that she had promised the people that there will be no roll back [of the nuclear program]. She said that bilateral talks with the United States have started and the government was trying to resolve the difference without any roll back. She said that pushing Pakistan in the corner will not benefit anyone since Pakistan has already presented a proposal for stopping proliferation of nuclear weapons. However, India wants to reject this proposal unilaterally. The prime minister said that the Pressler amendment gave India a kind of veto power which is being using unfairly against Pakistan. She said that the United States must adopt an impartial stand if it wants to resolve the Kashmir issue and end the nuclear weapons race in this sub-continent. She said that we needed F-16 fighter planes badly in the past, and still do, however, we are also investigating other fighter planes that are more appropriate for Pakistan's defense. She said that we will neither roll back [the nuclear program] nor will we allow them to inspect our installations just for getting F-16 fighter planes. She said that we are old allies of the United States and understand why Pakistan is always pressured. The prime minister said that Pakistan wants a regional agreement to control nuclear weapons. She said that there was a nation-wide agreement that we should not open our nuclear installations for inspection, however, we will reconsider this stand if India takes the initiative. The talks with Pakistan and the United States over regional problems and weapons are being held at a time when India has openly disagreed with the United States, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State could not even meet with the Indian prime minister, and the BBC has declared these talks a failure. Meanwhile, the United States has threatened military action against North Korea and has expressed its intentions to put pressure on North Korea with the help of China and Japan. North Korea has refused to accept U.S. conditions. India has also adopted a similar attitude and has not shown any interest in the proposals for stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. The coolness towards the U.S. proposals expressed in New Delhi is heralding a new fearful situation in this region. Pakistan has a well-known stand on nuclear non-proliferation and regional problems. Still, there are fears that Pakistan might become a prey of U.S. pressure. The situation demands that the United States should have the same attitude towards India as it has adopted about [North] Korea. This kind of arrogance and defiance can endanger the safety of the whole region. It is true that the United States can play an important role in establishing peace and resolving issues in South Asia, however, U.S. interests and preferences are also clearly written on the wall. Although the government has shown a realistic attitude, we feel that there are some sensitive issues involved in the present U.S.-Pakistan talks. Political observers have special interest in seeing the confrontation between India and Pakistan end, and the safety of this region now depends on Pakistan-United States talks. This will test our government's judgment, shrewdness, diplomatic skills so that it is successful in explaining its side to the United States. It is generally believed that the U.S. deputy secretary of state has come here from Washington with a definite plan which includes some undesirable proposals for Pakistan. The prime minister has adopted a strong stand on closing the chapter on Pakistan's concerns regarding F-16 planes and has respected the nation's desires by refusing to compromise over the nuclear program. The government's stand is appropriate that any agreement in South Asia must be bilateral, and there is no use of binding one country with restrictions imposed by the other side.
