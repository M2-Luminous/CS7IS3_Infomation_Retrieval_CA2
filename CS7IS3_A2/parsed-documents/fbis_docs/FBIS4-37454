At its maximum, this gesture will provide a married state employee with five children an income increase of 750 dinars if he works in Baghdad or the provincial capitals, and 850 dinars if he works outside Baghdad and the provincial capitals.

Naturally, he added, in view of their absolute confidence in the leader president's command of the march of jihad and reconstruction under the blockade and in his generous gestures which aim at improving the general living standards of the entire population, those covered by the gesture should rise to national responsibility and improve their performance in all fields of work. They should double their efforts to increase production and provide the best services for citizens to ease the burdens of the unfair blockade.
