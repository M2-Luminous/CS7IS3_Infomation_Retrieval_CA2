So far, nine bid winners have been authorized to supervise the whole preparatory construction of the Three Gorges Project, taking the lead in China's supervision practice in the major water conservancy project construction. According to the supervision contract, the supervisors will take up the overall administration of the quality and progress of the preparatory construction and control its cost. They will be empowered to endorse payment checks, start and terminate project programs or have constructors do the work over again if it is not done properly. The construction of many preparatory projects, including the building of the Xiling Chang Jiang River Bridge, are proceeding smoothly under the supervision. The supervision system will help guarantee the quality of the project with proper speed and controlled cost, said a member of the Three Gorges Project Construction Committee.
