Xu Qing, deputy secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and director of the State Council Office for Checking Unhealthy Tendencies in Business Activities, emphatically pointed out at the meeting: The work of checking unhealthy tendencies this year is a continuation and deepening of last year's work. Our tasks are heavier and even more difficult. If we fail to exert efforts to do solid work, we will make the mistake of only going through the motions. Leading cadres at all levels must clearly understand the situation of the work of checking unhealthy tendencies this year, resolutely overcome slack and tired dispositions, concentrate on major objectives, seriously "rectify three irregularities and stop some unhealthy tendencies," and make more interim achievements in this year's work of checking unhealthy tendencies. Xu Qing emphatically pointed out: To sum up, the major tasks of this year's work of checking unhealthy tendencies are to "rectify three irregularities and stop some unhealthy tendencies." Namely, we should rectify any wanton collection of fees, any overseas sightseeing travel in disguised form at government expense, and the abuse of power by party and government organizations and their personnel to obtain money and goods from enterprises, and we should vehemently stop conspicuous unhealthy tendencies in various departments and trades. He elaborated more specifically: In rectifying wanton collection of fees this year, we should see to it that all officially abolished fees are no longer collected, especially at the grass-roots units. We should particularly pay attention to preventing people from collecting abolished fees under new names. In rectifying overseas sightseeing travel in disguised form at government expense, we should apply more effort to stopping irregularities and strictly enforcing discipline. At the same time, we should get at the root of the problem and strictly examine travel applications. If the problem happens in a department due to failure in strictly examining travel applications, the department head shall be to blame. In rectifying the abuse of power by party and government organizations and their personnel to obtain money and goods from enterprises, the leading cadres of party and government organizations should attach importance to the work, know the situation of their organizations, adopt a clear and definite policy, and be determined to deal with the problem. They must sternly deal with any problems discovered and seriously prevent problems from recurring in the future. To vehemently stop conspicuous unhealthy tendencies in various departments and trades is an important part of the work of checking unhealthy tendencies this year. All localities should set concrete goals in correcting major unhealthy tendencies in various departments, and organize more personnel to deal with the problem so as to achieve breakthroughs. Xu Qing said: In order to accomplish this year's work of checking unhealthy tendencies, ordinary measures and methods are hardly effective. We must adopt new, tough measures. We must do solid and more effective work to attain our objectives so that we have desired results to report to the Central Committee and to the people. He said: While applying our main efforts to checking unhealthy tendencies and enforcing discipline, we should pay attention to exploring ways for bringing about both stopgap results and permanent results. We should deal with any loopholes and weak links discovered during the course of "rectifying three irregularities and stopping some unhealthy tendencies." We should rectify wrong attitudes and work styles, and improve the administrative work and relevant systems, laws, and regulations through the reform measures of our locality and department. In conclusion, Xu Qing said: The promotion of work ethics meets our objective needs, and is the fundamental way to deepen the work of checking unhealthy tendencies. We should continue to promote work ethics on an experimental basis at selected units. The experiment should be conducted in conjunction with the work of checking unhealthy tendencies. More attention should be paid to education, standards of conduct, and motivating mechanisms. Coordinated efforts should be made to explore effective ways, boldly reform and blaze new trails, and popularize the successful experience of selected units in large areas. Delegates from 15 provinces and municipalities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu and Shandong, exchanged information and experience on "hot topics" and "difficulties" of the work of checking unhealthy tendencies during the meeting. They put forward many good ideas and suggestions.
