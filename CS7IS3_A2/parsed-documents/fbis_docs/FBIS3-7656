Colleges in the Pusan area, including Pusan and Tong-a Universities, will conduct a student referendum beginning today [29 March] on the adoption of the 12 April Morocco Treaty in connection with the UR negotiations and on the National Assembly approval of UR implementation. The students will continue a petition drive on the streets and distribute printed material following an assessment meeting at Puyong Theater at 5 PM on 30 March. The Korea Federation of University Student Councils [Hanchongnyon] will hold a deputy election from 1 to 3 April at Pusan University, which will be attended by 15,000 students from throughout the country. They will adopt a policy to go on strike on 8 and 9 April in opposition to the National Assembly's approval of the UR. A considerable controversy is expected concerning the National Assembly's approval of the UR implementation plan because Hanchongnyon and colleges in the Pusan area are planning a struggle against the opening of the rice market in May in alliance with labor unions after obtaining support from farmers to oppose the rice market opening during their rural activities, which begin in April.
