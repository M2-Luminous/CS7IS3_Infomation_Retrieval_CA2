Meshkov said to reporters on Sunday that the situation in Crimea might be destabilized before the convocation of the republic's legislature, elections to which are underway on Sunday along with those to the Ukrainian parliament. "Such attempts are being made by the Kiev leadership but have fortunately been unsuccessful so far," he said. Meshkov took no part in either round of the Ukrainian parliamentary elections (at the first round, he took his ballot paper away with him and urged all other Crimean electors to do the same). On April 10, he only participated in the Crimean elections. Asked about the "war of laws" between Ukraine and Crimea, he said, "It isn't a war of laws but Kiev's attempts to make it impossible for us to solve our economic problems." "It is my strong hope that those who take power in Ukraine will simply be reasonable people. That's enough for Crimea," he said.
