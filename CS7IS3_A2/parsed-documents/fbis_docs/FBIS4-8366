The following is the letter in its entirety: It was with a great deal of surprise that I received the news that 225 Bosniak-Muslim prisoners were on a hunger strike in Mostar's Heliodrom prison because of a delay in the agreement between the Bosniak-Muslim and the Croat side on their release and the simultaneous release of imprisoned Croats and members of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] from prisons in Zenica and Travnik. As far as the latter are concerned, your authorities have not given permission for them to be released because they have been put on trial for participating in the enemy army--namely, the HVO--and for not heeding their call-up notices. I maintain that such actions on the part of both sides are at odds with the Washington agreement. It is explicitly at odds with Article 3 of the joint statement signed in Geneva on 10 February 1994 by Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of the Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mate Granic, vice president of the government and minister for foreign affairs of the Republic of Croatia, and General Ante Roso in his capacity as a cosignatory. This is why I have instructed Mate Granic, vice president of the government and minister for foreign affairs, to discuss this issue with Silajdzic immediately as a matter of urgency. I hereby ask you to do your best so that the prisoners from both sides can be simultaneously released prior to my visit to the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This should be done regardless of whether there are persons under investigation among the prisoners or whether they have already been sentenced, in which case we suggest they be pardoned or granted amnesty. Meanwhile, both sides should take on an obligation to carry out adequate procedures in line with jointly adopted legislation and international conventions, once peace has been restored and the new federal order established. Mr. President, I appeal to you so we can together do everything that is needed in order to resolve as soon as possible this situation, which can only damage our efforts to implement the Washington agreement. Let this be a concrete contribution to the restoration of mutual trust in every area of our coexistence. Please receive my personal regards.
