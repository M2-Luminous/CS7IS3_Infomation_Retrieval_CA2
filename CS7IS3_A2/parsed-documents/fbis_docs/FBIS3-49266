The same sources claim that armed clashes are taking place along the entire demarcation line and, in particular, near Trsce and Trzacki Rasteli, but they do not mention losses. According to the western Bosnia news agency ZBIA, the 503d and 517th Cazin brigades [loyal to Izetbegovic] are in disarray after a large number of their officers and command personnel joined the army of the autonomous province of western Bosnia. This was confirmed by Nevzad Djeric, commander of the 503d Cazin brigade, who has also joined the ranks of Abdic's army. According to the same source, about 1,000 people from Pecigrad, the largest residential area of Cazin, have moved to Velika Kladusa to join Fikret Abdic and flee the terror committed by the extremists in the 5th Corps of the so-called Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its commander, Atif Dudakovic. Muslim-controlled Bihac radio has named Bozdar Sicel, deputy chairman of the assembly of the autonomous province of Western Bosnia, as being most responsible for recruiting the 503d and 517th Brigades for Abdic's army and for persuading the large section of Pecigrad population to change sides. Bihac radio also reported that clashes continue in Bihac between Muslims and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] under the command of Major General Vlado Santic, as do clashes between the HVO and the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] headed by Dr. Ante Santic, Vlado's brother. According to Bihac radio, there are dead and wounded on both sides, but neither side has so far reported any casualties.
