Entitlement charges (a) Overview. VA will make charges against entitlement as stated in this section. Except for those pursuing flight training, correspondence training or apprenticeship or other on-job training, charges are based upon the principle that a reservist who trains full time for one day should be charged one day of entitlement. (Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2131(c); Pub. L. 98&hyph;525, Pub. L. 101&hyph;189, Pub. L. 101&hyph;237) (Sept. 30, 1990, Oct. 1, 1990). (b) Determining entitlement charge. *␣*␣* (1) Except for those pursuing flight training, correspondence training, cooperative training, apprenticeship or other on-job training, VA will make a charge against entitlement_ (i) On the basis of total elapsed time (one day for each day of pursuit for which the reservist is paid educational assistance) if the reservist is pursuing the program of education on a full-time basis, (ii) On the basis of a proportionate rate of elapsed time, if the reservist is pursuing the program of education on a three-quarter, one-half or less than one-half time basis. (2) VA will compute elapsed time from the commencing date of the award of educational assistance to date of discontinuance. If the reservist changes his or her training time after the commencing date of the award, VA will_ (i) Divide the enrollment period into separate periods of time during which the reservist's training time remains constant, and (ii) Compute the elapsed time separately for each time period. (3) For each month that a reservist is paid a monthly educational assistance allowance while undergoing apprenticeship or other on-job training VA will make a charge against entitlement of_ (i) .75 of a month in the case of payments made during the first six months of the reservist's pursuit of the program of apprenticeship or other on-job training, (ii) .55 of a month in the case of payments made during the second six months of the reservist's pursuit of the program of apprenticeship or other on-job training, and (iii) .35 of a month in the case of payments made following the first twelve months of the reservist's pursuit of the program of apprenticeship or other on-job training. (4) When a reservist is pursuing a program of education by correspondence, VA will make a charge against entitlement for each payment made to him or her. The charge will be made in months and decimal fractions of a month, as determined by dividing the amount of the payment by $140.
