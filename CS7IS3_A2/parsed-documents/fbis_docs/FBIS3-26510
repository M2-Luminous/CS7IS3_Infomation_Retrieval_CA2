The full text of the questions and answers are as follows: [Tseng Tak-sing] Secretary Wu Bangguo, Shanghai has developed rapidly in the past few years and has attracted much attention from China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and the world as a whole. Please tell us something about how Shanghai's leap forward has been brought about. What is the significance of such a leap in the reform and opening up of China? [Wu Bangguo] There are two aspects in the background of Shanghai's development. Shanghai was the center of China in the thirties and was called the "Paris of the Orient." At that time, Shanghai's economy was much more prosperous than that in Hong Kong. Since liberation in 1949, Shanghai has made relatively rapid development and relatively big contributions to the country. Two most outstanding aspects of contribution are given below. One is its monetary contribution to the state. When Hu Yaobang was the General Secretary and visited Shanghai in 1986, Jiang Zemin was the Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee. Hu Yaobang made a calculation together with Jiang Zemin and found that Shanghai had handed over 440 billion yuan to the state from liberation to 1986. The second major contribution is that it provided the whole country with large quantities of commodities. In those days, we practiced the planned economy, and Shanghai's commodities accounted for 40 percent of the volume allocated according to the national plan. Commodities made in Shanghai were found everywhere across the country. Of course, Shanghai also made contributions in other aspects. Two Aspects of the Background for Development In addition, Shanghai is a large central city. Because of historical reasons, Shanghai's functions as a central city have decreased. This is mainly expressed in two aspects. One is that Shanghai's industrial structure is not rational and the outstanding issue is that its tertiary industry is relatively weak. I came to work in the municipality in the beginning of 1983 and at that time, the tertiary industry accounted for about 20 percent of the economy of the municipality. The second outstanding issue is that the urban infrastructure is very backward. These issues have restricted Shanghai's economic development and have restricted its role as a central city. Another aspect of the background is that by the nineties we have gained 10 years' experience in reform and opening up to the outside world. In 1990 Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward that Shanghai was a trump card of ours and should be regarded as our shortcut. Comrade Deng Xiaoping explicitly put forward in 1991 that Shanghai should develop Pudong. He said that opening up Pudong was required for Shanghai's own development, and was also required for the development of the Chang Jiang valley. In April 1991 Li Peng came to Shanghai and announced to the whole world on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council that the central authorities had decided to carry out reform in Pudong and to open it to the outside world. The 14th CPC National Congress held in 1992 clearly put forward that the meaning of "a dragon head, and three centers." This meant that we regarded Shanghai as the dragon head of the Chang Jiang valley and the Chang Jiang delta which gave impetus to the development of the Chang Jiang valley and that we should gradually build Shanghai into an international economic, financial, and trade center. The Chang Jiang valley includes seven provinces and one municipality, and it spreads over 1.8 million square kilometers. It has a population of 300 million people and the GNP of its entire national economy amounts to 1 trillion yuan. It is a relatively more developed region in China in terms of economy. The development of the economy of this region means the growth of China's economy. The success of reform in this region and the establishment of the operational mechanism of its socialist market economy means the success of China's reform. The opening of this region to the outside world means the opening of all of China to the outside world. The Establishment of a Collection and Distribution Center of Five "Flows" [Tseng] Shanghai is to be "the dragon head and three centers" (economic, financial, and trade centers) of the Chang Jiang valley and even of the world. This is a grand ideal. How can this be concretely realized? [Wu] What is the meaning of "one dragon head and three centers?" This is a question being discussed. I think Mayor Huang Ju's view in his speech is more accurate. He put forward the five "flows," that is, to build Shanghai into the collecting and distributing center of five "flows": The commodity flow, the capital flow, the technology flow, the personnel flow, and the information flow. In this way Shanghai's position as a center can be established. To make it simpler, it means to turn Shanghai into a collection and distribution center of commodities and a collection and distribution center of production essentials, and at the same time to build Shanghai into a converging point between the Chang Jiang valley and delta on the one hand and the world economy on the other. In accordance with the needs of such development, we have put forward three points to be stressed in the development. First is to make great efforts to develop urban infrastructure. Many friends from Hong Kong find that Shanghai has changed, mainly in urban infrastructure. Others find it inconvenient to live here because of the poor urban infrastructure. Therefore, we have spent a lot of money on the construction of infrastructure, including two large bridges, the Yanggao road, power facilities, wharves, and the airport. The second point to be stressed in the development is to make great efforts to develop tertiary industry. Tertiary industry has developed rapidly in Shanghai. In 1993 it accounted for 38 percent of the whole economy of the municipality. Our target is to develop it to 45 percent by the end of this century. At present, it appears that this can be accomplished earlier, and by the end of this century it can reach 50 percent. The outstanding focus of tertiary industry is the market for production essentials, including the stock exchange, the futures market, the metals exchange, and the foreign exchange market, which is to open in January, and also including the technology market and the personnel market. The third point to be stressed in the development is to develop high technology and new technology. Shanghai has the foundation for this. Its industry can be upgraded and some capital-intensive and technology-intensive industries can be developed. This can give better play to Shanghai's strong points. Technology and capable personnel are Shanghai's strong points. We should use high technology and new technology to transform our traditional industries. What shall we do then? As a matter of fact, we have been carrying out such an operation for several years. We have paid more attention to four questions. The first is to push enterprises toward the market. In the planned economy, economic enterprises are a department of the government and the government undertakes unlimited responsibility for enterprises. This will not do and enterprises must move into the market. Once enterprises are enlivened, the entire economy will become enlivened. We have done a lot of work in this respect. The most important thing is to "provide water for breeding fish." In the past, the burden of enterprises was too heavy. The state took care of everything for enterprises and enterprises took care of everything for the society. This will not do and the government must be separated from enterprises. The second is to give enterprises the decisionmaking power, such as the power to make decisions on wages, the use of personnel, and planning. However, there should also be restrictions. For example, on the wage issue, the growth in wages of enterprises should be less than the growth in taxes collected from enterprises, and the per capita growth in wages should be less than the growth of labor productivity. We are also considering linking value adding with value maintaining of the assets of enterprises. Under such circumstances, distribution within enterprises is enterprises' own business. They can establish their wage system. At present we are making further efforts in this respect. As for what was put forward at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, in the past we did more work on production operation and management, and in the future we should gradually shift our work to the management of assets. In this way it will be possible to form an environment for market competition and the fittest will survive. At present, large and medium-sized enterprises are more flexible, but small enterprises are not good. A few large and medium-sized enterprises are not good either, but on the whole they are good. Why do small enterprises have so many difficulties? There are historical reasons for this. In the past, every bit of space was used and factories were set up in the city where residents were in great number. Those factories do not have the required conditions and the land prices of those factories are high. The number of small enterprises is great, but in terms of money, the volume of their losses are not big because they are small enterprises after all. Losses of large enterprises would be difficult to deal with. The 13th CPC National Congress put forward that the reform of enterprises was the starting point and foothold of our entire economic reform. The World's Third Biggest Metal Trading Market The third question is to energetically nurture and develop the market in combination with the development of tertiary industry. A very big change in Shanghai in the past few years has been the nurturing and development of the market of Shanghai. In 1993 the volume of stock exchanges reached 500 billion yuan, the volume had increased at a speed of five to six times a year, and the volume increased by six times last year, which was much faster than we had expected. In addition, our metals exchange has been set up for slightly more one year now. Last year the volume of exchange reached more than 350 billion yuan and the metals exchange became the world's third biggest. Moreover, the volume of exchange was close to the world's second biggest. The grain and edible oil exchange is operating on a trial basis and its daily exchange volume has reached 400, 500, or 600 million yuan. In addition, there are also other commodity markets. We have set up many shops, for example: Taiwan's Pacific Department Store, which has recently opened at Xujiahui, the Isetan Company at Huaihai Road, and the Shui Hing Department Store. The annual volume of retail sales of commodities in Shanghai last year was 35 percent over the previous year. The fourth question is to change government functions. What should be administered by the government should be administered by the government and what should not be administered by the government should be managed by the society, for example: The establishment of the social security system, insurance funds for unemployment, and medical insurance. Of course, there is also the question of changing concepts in medical insurance. Such insurance is not unlimited, but is only basic insurance because our country is still a developing country. In the past one drawback of our planned economy was a high-degree of concentration of power. In addition, its exclusiveness was very strong. A very clear characteristic at present is that Shanghai's role as an industrial base is developing to a higher level. The development of technology-intensive industries is faster than that of the labor-intensive industries, and the labor-intensive industries are moving toward the hinterland. Shanghai has put forward the establishment of the socialist market economy operational mechanism before others. This has attracted the attention of some localities. This is because we hold that the establishment of the socialist market economy structure cannot be determined by Shanghai alone. The whole country is a big market and only when the socialist market economy structure is established across the country can there be a socialist market economy structure in Shanghai. [Tseng] Shanghai has made outstanding achievements in economic construction. Is there any plan for the building of spiritual civilization? [Wu] We are quite conscious of the building of spiritual civilization. As the economy develops, common practices should not become worse. With the development of the economy, the quality of human culture should also be raised. This is also the demand of common people. We should find carriers for the building of spiritual civilization. Last year, all residents of the municipality were concerned with the East Asian Games. Originally, we were ready to carry out the games on a small scale. Later, as the games were linked with the application for hosting the Olympic Games, we were prepared to carry out the games on a large scale. The opening ceremony, in particular, should manifest our capacity for hosting the Olympic Games. I remember that the period from making the decision to opening the games was only 100 days. Everything was ready in 100 days. What was the reason for that? This was because everybody participated in the work and everybody became the host. Everybody worked to improve the cultural and sanitary environment of the municipality. This was precisely the building of spiritual civilization. According to our experience, we have found that one of the important things in the building of spiritual civilization is the participation of the masses and the integration with the desires of the masses. However, many problems exist. For example, JIEFANG RIBAO carried on the front page the day before yesterday a letter to me from the vice president of a U.S. corporation which mentioned unpleasant things he met with in Shanghai. For example, a decently dressed page boy at the door of a big restaurant used foul language. Another example was that some personnel of a hospital smoked despite signs forbidding people not to do so. He said that foreign enterprises paid much attention to their images and had integrated education with management. I have passed on this letter to people in charge of departments concerned and have urged propaganda departments to start work in this respect at the lowest level and proceeding from improving the images of enterprises. No Horse Racing Course or Casinos [Tseng] Public places of entertainment have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain in the past few years. How are they managed? Some people are worried that while these public places of entertainment are enriching the cultural recreation of the residents, tourists, and foreign businessmen, they will do harm to the common practices of society. What do you think of this? Will the ban on gambling and betting on horse racing be lifted? [Wu] At present, there are over 3,700 public places of entertainment in Shanghai. Shops on Nanjing Road and Huaihai Road are open up to 10 o'clock in the evening. Some restaurants and public places of entertainment are open up to 12 o'clock and others are open throughout the night. There are more than 600 ballrooms and 500 karaoke bars. Besides, there are music teahouses and public places of sports. These public places of entertainment developed very fast last year and this is a kind of necessity for improving the people's life. We cannot just keep the people at home. It will not do to have television alone and the people, young people in particular, need other activities. Without such a demand, the market cannot develop either. Foreigners also find life in Shanghai more comfortable. This is also a necessity. Some things are banned in Shanghai because we hold ourselves responsible to foreigners and to the 13 million people in Shanghai and we do not permit damage done to common social practices in Shanghai. In the past, Shanghai was the paradise of adventurers and a metropolis infested with foreign adventurers. Everything, good or bad, could be found here. Many teleplays and films of Hong Kong reflect these problems, including the underworld, kidnapping, and prostitution. We do not permit dying embers to glow again. We energetically develop healthy and positive things and at present, we still cannot have things like a horse racing courses, casinos, or betting companies. Some friends in Hong Kong and Macao have written with a good intention to me telling me the merits of those things. However, we have, after consideration, decided not to have such things. We cannot have girls accompanying customers in drinking and other activities. We cannot have pornography in any disguise. We cannot have beauty pageants either. I understand that many cities of foreign countries also have similar rules. Some countries, including capitalist countries, do not allow to beauty pageants. Because Shanghai was infested with foreign adventurers in the past, we will find it difficult to deal with them if they develop as a result of inappropriate management. For example, those who maintain order in casinos are actually hired ruffians. They would form an underworld, then corrupt our judicial departments turning policemen and bandits into one family, and it would be impossible to stop them. Foreign businessmen have also agreed to our acting in this way. Many Hong Kong friends, including wives of people in Hong Kong, have told me that this rule is good. The general principle is positive and progressive. The cultural market should not be turned into a pornography market under disguise, or a place for illegal activities. Shanghai has sternly cracked down on such things. The common people have given us great support. We have adhered to two directions. One is to make the cultural market prosperous and the other is to sternly crack down on illegal activities. [Tseng] In the past, Shanghai was also the cultural center of China. Many first-rate artists of China began their careers here. However, in recent years the refined arts in Shanghai have met with much difficulty in their development. Please tell us how you will promote the development of refined arts in the new year. [Wu] Regarding the question of refined arts, my understanding is that it is necessary to have both popular arts and refined arts. Our life is rich and colorful and we cannot have just one color. For example, during the Cultural Revolution, there were only eight model plays on modern themes. Some people said that the mainland would lower the intensity of performances given by singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan and they opposed allowing singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan to perform in Shanghai. Our attitude is that we welcome them. Wherever there is an audience, there is a market. However, we do not favor using public funds to raise the temperature of such performances. We have attached great importance to popular literature and art. We welcome performances given in Shanghai by singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan. We shall also give enthusiastic support to refined arts. While watching an opera, I thought that Shanghai should have ballet. Shanghai regards economy as the center, but it should also have culture. We should not turn two legs into one. An outstanding question is the question of funds. More than 9,000 performances were given in Shanghai last year. The government spent 2.5 million yuan on giving support to seven opera troupes. In addition to spending 40 million yuan on giving support to cultural undertakings each year, 2.5 million was specially allocated for the same purpose. Besides the question of funds, there is also the question of cultural facilities. A first-rate large opera house is being built at the People's Square. There is also the question of mechanism of the opera troupes themselves. We cannot eat "out of the same pot," nor can we practice egalitarianism. There is a question of the reform of the mechanism and there is great potential. The third aspect is the support of enterprises. The Baoshan Iron and Steel Company has donated 10 million yuan as funds for refined arts. The ballet troupe wants to adapt Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai for ballet and to perform Swan Lake, Don Quixote, the Nutcracker, and Romeo and Juliet. Ten performances of the Kun opera Peony Pavilion were given and the tickets sold very well. University students are also interested in opera. It is matter of fostering an interest. The orchestra went to Taiwan to give a performance. Many people watched its performance and it was well-received. [Tseng] When Zhu Rongji was the mayor of Shanghai he visited Hong Kong and stressed Shanghai and Hong Kong should cooperate with and supplement each other. At present, the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's constitutional system have broken down. How does Shanghai look at its relations with Hong Kong? [Wu] The economy of Hong Kong and that of the mainland are getting closer and closer and they are on the same boat. On the part of Shanghai, it earnestly hopes to see a prosperous Hong Kong and Hong Kong's prosperity is beneficial to Shanghai. A lot of our funds have come via Hong Kong and much of our trade uses Hong Kong as an entrepot. We keep contact with the outside world through Hong Kong in terms of information and channels. Therefore, we hope very much to have a prosperous Hong Kong. At present, China, including Shanghai, has the ability of maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity. The development of Shanghai's economy is conducive to Hong Kong's prosperity and Hong Kong's prosperity can also promote Shanghai's development. There may be some competition, but competition is not something bad and competition can promote development. The drawback of the past economic structure is that it has no competition. No matter whether China and Britain will cooperate, Shanghai and Hong Kong must cooperate. A lot of Shanghai's interests are in Hong Kong. We believe the residents of Hong Kong are able to make development. Sooner or later, Shanghai will become a world economic center. We are confident that it will become one of the world's economic centers. Energetically Support the Tax Sharing System [Tseng] The tax sharing system implemented by the state involves the readjustment of interests. The relationship between the center and the localities is a question which overseas people are much concerned about. What is Shanghai's attitude toward this question? [Wu] We are all concerned about this question. For some time many overseas people were also concerned about it. This is mainly a matter of the distribution system. Zhu Rongji brought more than 60 people to Shanghai. We gave enthusiastic support to the tax sharing system. Mayor Huang Ju was studying in Beijing and we, on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government, expressed our attitude. Shanghai had nothing different to say about the tax sharing system. Besides, we hope that the central authorities can strengthen macroregulation and control. If the central authorities lack the ability to carry out macroregulation and control, there will be an adverse impact on Shanghai. We, for example, have received many foreigners. They said they were not afraid of a high foreign exchange rate or a devaluation of the renminbi, but they were afraid of changes on our part. The highest exchange rate at one time was $1 to 11 yuan in Shanghai and the rate was going up. The foreigners were worried: You and I have run a joint venture. I have injected U.S. dollars into it, while you have injected renminbi. How should the percentage of funds for the joint venture be calculated. This is not a kind of cooperation. Therefore, we hope there can be macroregulation and control, which is the need of comprehensive development and also the need of Shanghai's development. State taxation rates, foreign exchange rates, and tariff rates should be highly unified. Shanghai has resolutely implemented policies formulated by the central authorities and has persisted in making greater contribution to the state each year. We had harmonious talks with the central authorities last time. In his concluding remarks, Comrade Zhu Rongji said both sides were satisfied and could make clear explanation. The central authorities were satisfied and Shanghai was satisfied; clear explanation could be given to the people of the whole country and to the people of Shanghai. At the central work meeting, Comrade Huang Ju, on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and Government, pledged three things. The first was to guarantee the establishment of a socialist market. The second was to guarantee the fulfillment of the task of handing over money to the state. Last year Shanghai handed over to the central authorities 30 billion yuan. The third was to guarantee the fulfillment of all the tasks assigned by the state to Shanghai and its subordination to the state's macroregulation and control. Shanghai is the Shanghai of the whole country. It has no raw materials. Nor has it energy sources. Shanghai's market is only confined to 13 million people. Shanghai's development cannot be separated from the whole country. If the whole country is good, Shanghai is good. If the whole country is not good, Shanghai cannot be good. We wholeheartedly support state policies. Comrade Jiang Zemin also praised Shanghai for always taking the interests of the whole into account. As a matter of fact, the interests of the whole also conform with the needs of Shanghai's development. Recently, we held a plenary meeting of the municipal committee at which the question of the sense of the situation of the whole was put forward. Some articles published abroad have exaggerated things. I think the relationship between Shanghai and the central authorities is normal. We have never found that the central authorities do not give support to Shanghai or that Shanghai does not subordinate itself to central leadership. [Tseng] Is there a concrete timetable for Shanghai to develop to a financial center? [Wu] In recent years, the progress of Shanghai's formation as a financial center has been faster than expected. Several major financial markets in Shanghai, the currency market, the bills and security discount market, and the foreign exchange market, have developed rapidly. Foreign banks have set up offices in Shanghai and the U.S. Citibank has moved its Asian Headquarters from Hong Kong to Shanghai. In addition, we have adopted a major measure this year. In the past, banks and financial companies were located in a concentrated manner in areas around the Shanghai Bund. The Shanghai Municipal Government has put forward a plan on the establishment of a real estate exchange center and on building a Chinese Wall Street around the Shanghai Bund. I do not have much contact with foreign banks in Shanghai and I feel that they still seem to be able to make profits. Although they still cannot manage the renminbi business at present, they can do business with the foreign-invested enterprises. At present, 3,000 new foreign-invested enterprises are opened in Shanghai each year. With such a speed in construction, the volume of the flow of funds is very great. Last year, Shanghai introduced over $7 billion of foreign capital. Besides, Shanghai is actively exploring financial reform. For example, Shanghai has most favorable conditions for running commercial banks first. At present, the development is faster than what was expected. Shanghai has more than 20 foreign banks, including financial companies. The site of the municipal government was formerly the Shanghai and Hong Kong Banking Corporation Building. The municipal government will take the lead in moving out of the building. At present, several foreign banks or offices of foreign banks have shown great interest in the building. At present, most foreign banks or offices of foreign banks are located in hotels or other office buildings and they are not easy to find. We are going to move government organs out of areas around the Shanghai Bund and to let banks and financial undertakings develop their business there. [Tseng] The real estate business, after a period of heated development, has cooled down and many people have taken a wait and see attitude. Is there any problem in this respect? Rapid Sales of Villas in Close Suburban Areas [Wu] The real estate business should develop along a correct line. Because of this, we have made some rules and regulations. For example, we have fixed a limit for the lowest price of real estate; we have stipulated that land is given in accordance with relevant projects and this can prevent profiteering; and we have stipulated that funds for land development should be available as scheduled or the land will be taken back. At present, there are relatively heated sales of real estate in Shanghai. After tax reform, the collection of real estate profit taxes has met with some problems. Some people are frightened and want to sell their houses. We think that the taxation system should not restrict the development of the real estate business. In Shanghai, land prices are high and the rate of return from investment is low. We should properly study how to fix local taxes. At present, sales of garden villas in Shanghai's close suburbs, such as those in the Hongqiao Development Zone, remain heated. Because Shanghai approves the establishment of over 3,000 new foreign-invested enterprises each year, the number of offices of foreign enterprises will become even more. They are located in hotels and the rents there are very expensive. They all want to buy villas in close suburbs. Of course, the market for inexpensive houses is the biggest. Residents whose houses have to be pulled down have a great demand for inexpensive houses and the municipal government has also encouraged to build more such houses. Shanghai's land prices were high even in the past. We should make use of the strong point of the price difference in downtown areas. On the other hand, the development of Pudong should make use of the strong point of low land prices. At present, quite a few large enterprises abroad are optimistic about the real estate business in Shanghai. A major Hong Kong real estate businessman told me: "The true real estate business is in Shanghai. Shanghai is a big city. To make money, we must come to Shanghai." [Tseng] What has Shanghai done in opposing corruption and encouraging honesty? [Wu] We have grasped anticorruption not because corruption is very serious. We cannot wait until corruption is very serious. The social order is stable in Shanghai. For example, there has been no problem in the control over guns in the past 10 years. We also have to be realistic in grasping the building of clean administration. For example, regarding the issue of not allowing party or government organs to run tertiary industry, we have stipulated that party, government, or judicial organs shall not run special businesses, such as karaoke bars; that party or government organs shall not speculate in stocks or futures, because if they were allowed to do so, they could use inside information; and that party or government organs shall not practice monopolistic management and shall not contract tertiary businesses out to private businessmen so as to avoid damaging the image of party or government organs. At the same time, we have also asked cadres to exercise self-discipline and to consciously do a good job in the building of clean administration. We were able to implement these few things last year.
