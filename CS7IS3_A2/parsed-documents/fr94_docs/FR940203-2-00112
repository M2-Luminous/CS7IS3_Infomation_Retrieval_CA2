FR940203-2-00112 FR940203-2-00068 (7) Service to areas with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth (paragraph (b)(13)). The priority has been revised to require States to describe: (1) How their systems will be expanded over time to cover all geographic areas and (2) how proposed School-to-Work Opportunities systems will address the needs of students from all communities, including areas with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth. (A parallel change has been made to the ``Comprehensive Statewide System'' selection criterion.) (c) General Program Requirements (1) Basic Program Components. The ``General Program Requirements'' section, containing the basic components of the School-to-Work Opportunities program, has been revised to indicate that the high school diploma requirement may be satisfied when a student is awarded the ``equivalent'' of a high school diploma, as determined under standards developed by the State. (Parallel changes have been made to the definition of the term ``career major'' and to paragraph (e) of the ``Local Programs'' criterion.) In addition, paragraph (a)(1) of the ``General Program Requirements'' section of the priority has been revised to provide that one of the bases of a School-to-Work Opportunities system is the integration of work-based learning and school-based learning ``that provides participating students, to the extent practicable, with broad instruction in all aspects of the industry the students are preparing to enter.'' (As previously noted, a definition of the term ``all aspects of the industry'' has been provided in the ``Definitions'' section of this notice.) (2) Work-based Learning. The reference to ``Broad instruction in a variety of elements of an industry'' has been deleted from the work-based learning component of the ``General Program Requirements'' section, since reference to broad instruction in all aspects of the industry that students are preparing to enter is now made in paragraph (a)(1) of the basic components section of the priority. (See discussion above in paragraph (c)(1) of this summary). (3) School-based Learning. The school-based learning component has been revised to require, among other stated elements, ``career awareness and career exploration and counseling (beginning at the earliest possible age)'' in order to help interested students to identify, select, or reconsider, their interests, goals, and career majors, ``including those options that may not be traditional for their gender, race, or ethnicity.'' This change makes clear that promotion of career awareness and exploration of all career options, at an early age, is desirable. The determination of the age at which career awareness, career exploration, and counseling should appropriately begin, is left to the States. And, the section of the school-based learning component containing the requirement for regularly scheduled evaluations has been revised to require those evaluations to identify students' academic strengths, weaknesses, and ``academic progress, workplace knowledge, and goals *␣*␣*.'' (4) Connecting Activities. The connecting activities component has been revised to include, among other required elements, ``Providing assistance to schools and employers to integrate school-based and work-based learning and integrate academic and occupational learning.'' In addition, the Secretaries have revised this component to provide an illustrative list of post program outcome information that grantees may include among the types of information they collect. The list includes information on gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic background, limited-English proficiency, and disability.
