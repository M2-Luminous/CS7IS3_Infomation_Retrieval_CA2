Do you have any proof or material evidence to support your claim? [Jibril] First of all I admit that we do not have any material evidence that would expose to the world the responsibility of the regime's agents for the abduction, but let me ask: As al-Kikhya is one of the most prominent people opposed to the current regime in Libya, who would have an interest in his disappearance? As al-Qadhdhafi has publicly said that he intends to liquidate the opposition, how is he going to achieve that without pursuit? There is another important point which must be mentioned. It is the Libyan regime's black record of pursuing and liquidating opponents. Its agents have committed 23 attacks on Libyan opposition members living in European capitals, resulting in the martyrdom of most of them. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Have you received any direct threats from the Libyan authorities? [Jibril] I have personally received dozens of threats from the regime's agents. They have told my family that their arm will reach me soon. Not to mention the official threats to all the Libyan opposition at home and abroad. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you feel that there was any Egyptian failure in connection with the disappearance of al-Kikhya? [Jibril] I strongly deny even the slightest direct or indirect Egyptian role in the puzzle of al-Kikhya's disappearance, but I do believe that, in the event an agreement is signed with Egypt for the extradition of criminals, the Libyan regime would not hesitate to claim (falsely) that Egypt extradited al-Kikhya. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] How are you currently handling developments related to the al-Kikhya incident? [Jibril] We are in continual daily contact with the relevant Egyptian authorities, and they are doing their best to solve the disappearance riddle. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Would the Libyan regime return al-Kikhya if, as you believe, he was kidnapped? [Jibril] I rule that out completely, of course. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Libya has officially denied any connection with the al-Kikhya incident. [Jibril] We expected that, after 10 days of official silence. We are used to such lies and games. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you have any information about a request by the Libyan regime asking Arab and European states to hand over opposition members? [Jibril] Yes, al-Qadhdhafi has asked that of Egypt and other states. He even made the improvement of relations with any state conditional on their handing over the opposition members. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you believe that the measures for guarding Libyan opposition members in Egypt are good? [Jibril] Before the normalization of Egyptian-Libyan relations there was a strict guard for those opposed to al-Qadhdhafi but that was relaxed after al-Qadhdhafi promised the Egyptian authorities not to harm the opposition members living in Egypt. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] But could one say that Egypt has frozen the activities of the Libyan opposition in Egypt or that it has imposed restrictions on the movement of opposition members? [Jibril] The restrictions on the Libyan opposition's activities were confined to the closure of their information offices and discontinuation of their coordination meetings, after the normalization of relations. But Egypt has not asked or forced any opposition member to leave the country. We hope that the Libyan political opposition will move from Europe and the United States to Egypt and the Arab states adjacent to Libya. [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] What about the Libyan opposition at home? [Jibril] Those opposed to the regime at home face the severest kinds of torture and pursuit. Suffice it to say that there are about 3,000 political detainees in Libyan prisons.
