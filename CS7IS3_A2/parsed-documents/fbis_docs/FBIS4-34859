The exercise sought to prepare general staff and command members to handle troops, as well as to organize the cooperation of regular forces and municipal defense councils in the region defended by the Western Army. Moncada II 94-1 was based on a series of complex tactical exercises, which included ambushes, airborne landings by the enemy, and joint actions by the regular troops and other types of forces. Today's activities included a naval maneuver at the western base of Cabanas, preceded by maneuvers at the Jejenes shooting range with the participation of land and antiaircraft artillery and support troops. The exercise proved commanders' expertise in the deployment of small units which operate independently, their maneuverability, their accuracy, and efficient fulfillment of missions. Supported by initiatives, troop instruction programs were qualitatively carried out, which helped save materials and improve combat techniques.
