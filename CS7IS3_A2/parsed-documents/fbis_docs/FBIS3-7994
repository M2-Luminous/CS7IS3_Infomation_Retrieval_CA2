"We are seeing some movement" from the various parties involved in the conflict, Stoltenberg said, referring to an agreement by the Serbs to reopen the airport in the besieged northeastern Bosnian town of Tuzla and to a Moslem-Croat accord to form a federation. He said these "developments could be important for further negotiations" and "prove it is absolutely necessary that the European Union, the United States and Russia cooperate on this difficult issue." Stoltenberg said he would soon be heading back to Geneva to monitor developments in Bosnia. His counterpart for the European Union, Lord Owen, meanwhile said in Geneva that it would be unreasonable for Europe to feel sidelined because of the U.S.-brokered Moslem-Croat pact. "I do not think it is sensible in Europe to feel any sense of anxiety, frustration or a feeling of being set aside. This is something that the European Union has been urging the United States to do as long as I remember," he told journalists. Owen said: "In the first instance it seems that the most important thing to do is for the Americans to carry forward their initiative in the meetings that are planned to start on Friday in Vienna and are hoped to end on the 15th which is to tie down all the details of the Croat-Moslem federation and the wider confederation between Croatia and the federation." The European negotiator said he felt it would be a "great mistake" to see this development as one "against the interest of the Bosnian Serbs."
