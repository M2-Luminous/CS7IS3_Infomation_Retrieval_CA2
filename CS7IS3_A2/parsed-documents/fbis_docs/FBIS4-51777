FBIS4-51777 "dreas085_d_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 South Korea U.S. Forces Return Use of Pusan Port U.S. Forces Return Use of Pusan Port SK2804022894 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES in English 28 Apr 94 p 3 SK2804022894 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES English BFN [Text] A pier in Pusan exclusively used free of charge by the United States forces here since 13 years ago will be returned to the government to be used for export-import cargos. A tentative agreement for the return of the sixth quay was reached between the Korea Maritime & Port Administration [KMPA] and the Eighth U.S. Army authorities recently, a KMPA official said yesterday. Consultations for a final decision are underway with the U.S. State Department and the two sides will begin taking necessary procedures after the consultations end. But another pier also being used by the U.S. and the Korean naval forces for purely military purposes will remain as it is now, he said. U.S. military officials revealed they would return the wharf to the Korean government from a positive perspective on condition that ships carrying U.S. military materials are allowed to use the pier with preferential treatment, he said. The pier, 233-meters long and 25-meters wide, is located beside the Pusan Container Terminal Company and has the capability of accommodating one 3,000-ton container ship. It was offered to the USFK [U.S. Forces in Korea] in July 1981 on the basis of the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Agreement concluded in 1954. The KMPA plans to develop the pier for the exclusive use of ships transporting trade freight by investing some 8 billion won (10 million U.S. dollars). The KMPA official said the restoration of the wharf is expected to inject fresh momentum in attracting cargo going to and coming from Russia and China. The KMPA asked the USFK to return the pier via the Defense Ministry last September.
