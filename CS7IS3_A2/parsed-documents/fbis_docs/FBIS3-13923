The hunt continues for Marzel. Last night, police detectives searched the home in Petah Tiqva of Kakh activist Natan Levi. Levi told a Qol Yisra'el reporter that he has no idea where Marzel is and that he doesn't think Marzel would hide out at the home of someone identified with Kakh. Marzel, who has been in hiding for several weeks, has said he would turn himself in with the mediation of several Knesset members, including Avraham Ravitz of the United Torah Party, but Shahal said the law forbids him to respond to such conditions.
