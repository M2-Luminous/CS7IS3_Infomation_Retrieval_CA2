Or, an introverted little island, buffeted amidst its North Sea setting by the chill waves of economlc isolatlon. Two very different visions of Britain's future outside the EC. Which would prove more accurate? Before the question can be answered, a further one poses itself: How possible would it be for Britain to leave the EC? Slipping anchor and sailing away from standardised condoms, bans on British bangers and Jacques Delors is not easy as it sounds. Never mind Maastricht, the real problem is the 1972 European Communities Act. It was this that confirmed Britain as a member of what is now the EC. To this day, academics tear each other's beards out over what it implies. It set out the terms under which Britain joined the Community, however, it said nothing about how Britain could leave. Simple, say some. No Parliament can bind its successor. So a future Parliament could simply repeal the 1972 Act. Not so, answer others. As the terms under which Britain joined the EC acknowleged the supremacy of Community law -- it supersedes that of member states -- we cannot leave, since there is no lawful means. Greenland, of course, got out in 1984. But Greenland, a former Danish colony, is rather an unusual case. Antony Bradley, a former professor of constitutional law, sees a potential goldmine for m'learned friends. "Unless withdrawal could be by agreement, Central European institutions and member states might have claims for compensation under international law," he said. However, he adds that, were terms for withdrawal to be agreed with the rest of the EC, Parliament could probably get away with it. What then? Doom, disaster, and everything short of a plague of locusts, according to Europhiles. "Disastrous...suicide," said Sir David Knox, the Europhile Tory MP. "Those who want to leave are living in a fantasy world; 60 percent of our exports now go to the EC. If we left, we'd have no say in setting the rules." Figures, as vague as they are alarming, support this view: 2.5 million jobs are at risk, employers have warned. Last week, Howard Davies, the Director General of the CBI [Confederation of British Industry], reiterated that the organisation is "committed to making a success of Britain's membership." Farmers seem to agree. "The single market provides important opportunities for British farmers," said Paul Reiderman of the National Farmers' Union. Bunkum, say Euro-sceptics. "The outcome would be astonishingly positive," said Teddy Taylor, the outspoken Euro-sceptic. "Exports to the EC have risen less fast than imports: the deficit since 1973 has been 1 billion pounds. Then there is the saving from quitting the Common Agricultural Policy -- 32 pounds a week per family. And what about the costs to Britain of EC decisions, like the 350 pounds million payment to former local and health authority workers?" He also questions the assumption that leaving the EC would ignite a trade war. "You don't have to be an EC member to be part of the single market -- look at the EFTA states like Sweden." The benefits of withdrawal roll on. VAT [value-added tax] would be slashed were our 2.3 billion pound EC contribution to cease. The City, as an offshore financial centre, would be largely unaffected -- and could even prosper. Since we trade more outside the EC than any other member state save Denmark, Euro-sceptics foresee Britain's tranformation into a vibrant independent nation -- "Europe's Singapore." It is all, perhaps, a bit too good to be true. Britain could survive outside the EC, but it would not be plain sailing. "The City would hardly suffer at all," said Tim Congdon, of Lombard Street Associates, "but it is possible that trade barriers could rise in the event of Britain departing." Back to Paul Reiderman: "The voice of British agriculture is stronger as a result of being part of a European trading block than it would be otherwise. How much weight would we carry on our own in GATT?" Here is the rub. National prosperity drives the debate about EC membership, but the reasons for preserving or junking it touch upon even more than hard cash. They concern political fundamentals: power, seats round the table, our place in the world. More importantly, they ask what Britain is, and what sort of people we are. If Britain remains an EC member, it is not hard to forecast the consequences. Europe's economic fortunes will continue to decline, leading to more EC-led intervention and protectionism here; the role of our institutions -- the Monarchy, Parliament, the Church of England -- will increasingly be called into question. The alternative is shrouded in mist. Some transitional unemployment, certainly, the transfer of civil servants from Brussels to China, Taiwan, and South Korea, the untwinning of British towns with their continental counterparts maybe; perhaps a revival of national morale, at least for a while. Whatever the outcome, it seems certain that the economic cart will carry on driving the political horse. And, significantly, disillusion with the EC is spreading throughout British business. Dr Anne Robinson, of the Institute of Directors, emphasises that it has no view on EC withdrawal. Nonetheless, "the overwhelming view of our members is that the single market hasn't delivered." And if it can't deliver? "Then people are going to get very fed-up with Europe, aren't they?"
