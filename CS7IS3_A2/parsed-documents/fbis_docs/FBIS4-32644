The FRY Government expects that the UN Security Council [UNSC] will without delay take appropriate measures to prevent consequences that further negative developments could have on the peace process in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. ``At this crucial time it is a prime responsibility and obligation of the UNSC to ensure that a realistic chance to reach a peaceful solution of the conflict in former Bosnia-Herzegovina is not missed. If, however, this opportunity is missed, this would bring about an inevitable escalation of the conflict with all unforseeable consequences,'' a statement by the FRY Government, made available to TANJUG, says. It adds: ``The FRY Government finds the current stage of the negotiations, which should lead to a solution of the crisis caused by the civil war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, crucial. Active participation of the most important international powers -- the United Nations, EU, United States, and Russia -- in the search for a lasting political solution, acceptable to all three sides in the conflict, gives rise to hope that this tragic civil war will soon be stopped, which would in turn create conditions for the resolution of some other important questions in the former Yugoslavia. ``The FRY Government expects that full advantage will be taken of the current favorable period and is making efforts towards contributing in a concrete manner to this effect. Motivated by the desire to have a lasting peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina reached as soon as possible, the FRY Government has welcomed the recent agreement on ending military operations between the belligerent parties in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, an agreement on overall and lasting cease-fire would be a real proof that all parties in the conflict are indeed committed to a lasting, just peace and a political solution to the crisis. ``All the developments that ensued following the signing of the agreement on 10 June 1994 indicate that not all sides in former Bosnia-Herzegovina wish to accept a peaceful solution. The setting- up of the Muslim-Croat federation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina flared up ambitions of the radical Muslim leadership in former Bosnia-Herzegovina to persist in its orientation for a military settlement. Relying on the unprecedented media support based on untruths, and also on a strong support lent by certain international circles, the Muslim-Croat side has been abusing the agreement on the cessation of military operations and has openly been preparing a large-scale military offensive, which is confirmed in UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] reports. These reports show, among other things, that the Muslim-Croat forces, despite the current embargo, have been allowed an unhindered supply of a large quantity of the most up-to- date weapons. All the activities of the Muslim-Croat side involving regrouping forces and other offensive actions, by which the signed agreement is violated, are hereby most vehemently condemned by the FRY Government. ``The regrouping of their forces, with the continuous intensification of armed activities aimed at provoking the continuation of the war, represent a flagrant violation of the concluded agreement and can seriously threaten all efforts hitherto made to restore peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Muslim- Croat forces recently began carrying out heavy offensive actions against the Bosnian Serb positions, their towns, along almost all frontlines, which has caused numerous civilian casualties and huge material damage. ``Despite all the aforementioned, it is encouraging that the Bosnian Serb forces have so far retaliated in a restrained manner to the Muslim-Croat offensive actions, thus preventing the current military operations in former Bosnia-Herzegovina from turning into a conflict of widest proportions. "The FRY Government this time again wishes to stress that a permanent peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina can be achieved through negotiations alone, and is calling on the international community to exert pressure and demand from those violating the agreed cease-fire to halt their military activities immediately and accept peace as the only option without delay," the Yugoslav Government's statement says in conclusion.
