Whoever believes that this summit is an uncalculated adventure that was not prepared for is equally wrong. I think that this summit will involve basic principles and main courses that will be agreed upon. It will also involve certain limits to be negotiated. [Correspondent] In your view, what are the main topics that will be discussed? [Buwayz] I believe that this summit will discuss different topics, including the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and ways to guarantee Israel's withdrawal from this region, the peace process, Gaza-Jericho, and regional stability -- or rather the strategic vision of the future situation in the region. [Correspondent] Do you believe that the U.S. side has shifted from its role as an impartial mediator to that of the full partner, as al-Asad wants, and that it is trying to convey a specific Israeli proposal to Syria to move negotiations ahead? [Buwyaz] This summit undoubtedly comes after an obstruction to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, as well as a stalemate on the Jordanian- Israeli and Syrian- and Lebanese-Israeli tracks. I believe that the United States is fully aware of the need to abandon the theory of seeking independent, unilateral agreements and to work toward a comprehensive peace involving all. Judging by that principle, which governs the Geneva meeting, I think that the United States has a new dynamism and that a new daring approach might characterize the U.S. role in this summit, and maybe after it. This new approach is based on a U.S. belief that the stalemate that characterized negotiations for more than two years must be handled by a different approach. [Correspondent] President Ilyas al-Hirawi yesterday said that President al-Asad is negotiating on behalf of all Arabs, particularly Lebanon, and that he will not relinquish Arab rights. However, U.S. Ambassador in Beirut Mark Hambley said a few days ago that Lebanon might not be a separate topic on the summit agenda. Can you comment? [Buwayz] In fact, these two views do not conflict. I believe that President al-Asad this time and at this particular moment embodies a basic regional power that has influence at the Palestinian level and accordingly influences what happens in Gaza and Jericho, on a moral level in Jordan and in Lebanon, in addition to the Syrian level, of course. Accordingly, President al-Asad is, of course, a regional negotiator in this summit, because what he will talk about will go beyond the occupied Syrian Golan. Moreover, President Clinton represents an international power. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the eastern bloc, the United States has become the sole superpower, holding many political, economic, and technological cards. Hence, I believe that the Lebanese issue--that is Lebanon's rights--might not be discussed in this summit. The issue is not under discussion. The issue is very clear: Either there is a real and comprehensive peace and Israel will accordingly undertake to withdraw fully from south Lebanon to the internationally-recognized borders [sentence as heard]. However, the Israeli occupation involves some points related to the regional situation. So long as there are regional solutions, solutions to these points could also be found.
