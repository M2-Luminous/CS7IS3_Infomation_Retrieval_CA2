Director of the State Council's Development Research Centre Professor Sun Shangqing said the annual rate of economic growth this year might go beyond 10 percent following double-digit growth in the past two years. Last year's economic growth was 13.4 percent but Premier Li set a target of a nine percent growth rate for 1994. Professor Sun, seen as a close adviser to Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, stressed that the growth rate of nine to 10 percent was appropriate, adding that this was already a "very fast" pace. "If we fail to control the growth of fixed-assets in vestment the economy will over heat again, causing inflation," he said. "This is detrimental to the investment environment and the livelihood of the people." In addition to capital investment the head of the top think tank indicated that price reforms this year would further push up prices. But he stressed that inflation was inevitable in the transitional period from a planned economy to a market economy. "Inflation is acceptable as long as it is within the limits that the public can bear. I'm always against inflation. But inflation at a transitional period is inevitable. That does not mean I support it," said the professor. Professor Sun said the central Government's huge deficit would also make an impact on inflation. "That's why our major task this year is to strictly control expenditure while boosting revenue. "Of course, there will be dissenting views. But [everybody] has to put the general good above his own interests," he said. Although some regions wanted a faster pace of growth, Professor Sun said any moves to pursue an unrealistically fast growth rate that was not suited to the regions' capabilities would be prohibited under the macro- control and adjustment drive. "We hope that delegates can come to a consensus and make collective efforts to keep total fixed-assets investment this year to 1,300 billion yuan (HK$1,154.4 billion)," said the director. Professor Sun also defended the need to stress the vital significance of maintaining stability this year, saying that this was the "pre condition" for development. "We did not talk a lot about stability last year because the situation was different. We already had a 13.4 percent rate of growth last year. Maintaining social stability is in the interest of all the people," he said. Professor Sun denied suggestions that the country was already in danger of stagnation despite a surge of prices in the first two months of this year. "The most important thing is that people from all walks of life are aware of the fact that our pace of growth has already been too high. We should now pay greater attention to improving efficiency," he said.
