Orta report: "People's Party Wishes To Standardize Powers in All Autonomous Communities"] [Text] Barcelona -- The People's Party is proposing a standardization of the powers of all the autonomous communities which will respect singularities in the cultural or linguistic fields through a program to be implemented within the maximum period of two legislative terms, with the aim of completing the state of the autonomous communities, according to what People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar explained yesterday when presenting in Barcelona a document entitled "Basic Principles for a National Agreement To Complete the Implementation of Autonomy." In this document, the People's Party proposes to the government and all the political and social forces that they make their contributions in order to "give final shape" to Title VIII of the Constitution and prevent "going so far as to change the state's structure under the euphemism of new interpretations of the statutes." Aznar emphatically denied that the document could be a reformulation of the LOAPA [Organic Law on the Harmonization of the Autonomy Process]. He explained that a major agreement is necessary "in order to give final shape to the state of the autonomous communities," and emphasized that this can only be done with everybody's contributions, in order to shape a stable system, irrespective of who holds power. "I am trying to make the most rigorous effort possible. If there is anything that this document does not resemble at all, it is the LOAPA. The comparison is risible." Next, he stated that the document speaks of single administration, state transfers, and fiscal joint responsibility. "Which of these things is in the LOAPA, which was a law of downward harmonization?" With constant references to the framework of the Constitution, Aznar warned that, in his opinion, "no government holds sufficient legitimacy to transfer powers without taking the constitutional pact into account," and added -- with respect to possible agreements between the Spanish Socialist Workers Party and Convergence and Union -- that "mere application of the parliamentary majority to transfer state powers to the autonomous communities respects the formal requirements of democracy but makes any decision of this kind reversible, and could call the constitutional pact into question." On these premises, Aznar explained that outside the "framework laid down by the national agreement there can be no bilateral relations which, directly or indirectly, could go so far as to change the configuration of the state of the autonomous communities by transferring state powers," and the document even says that yielding to the constant autonomy demands could cause a "process of comparative grievances," which would lead to the "weakening of the state's power," entailing a "a crisis difficult to resolve in the constitutional model of the state of the autonomous communities." The document contains nine points: 1. To define the powers of the state which are nontransferable and cannot be delegated because they pertain to the principle of national sovereignty. 2. To determine the powers which, since they can be autonomous or state powers, are capable of transfer or delegation. 3. Applying the single administration principle, to reduce the state's peripheral administration and organize inspection services in the matters which are thus laid down in the Constitution. 4. To define the functions and services which, while still coming under the state, correspond to transferred powers. 5. To lay down a program with a maximum period of two legislative terms to carry out a process of basic standardization of powers among all the communities, excepting the singularities resulting from distinctive features. 6. To shape a funding model based on the principle of fiscal joint responsibility. 7. To establish a program of transfers to local authorities. 8. To set up a permanent body for the autonomous communities' participation in defining the government's stance in the European Union on matters for which they are responsible. 9. Constitutional reform to establish the Senate as a house of territorial representation.
