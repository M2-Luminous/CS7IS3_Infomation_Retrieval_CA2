The document signed the other day is quite constructive and can lay down a good basis for further negotiations on the whole set of problems facing the confronting sides, Russia's envoy stressed. "Both sides have come to understand that the situation developing in Moldova and its Dniester region calls for a pragmatic approach. As a result, the sides managed to find mutually acceptable variants of conflict settlement", he noted. Vasev laid a special emphasis on the fact that the signed document stressed the need for defining the state and legal status of the Dniester region. "This is to considerably facilitate further efforts aiming to draw the conflicting sides closer together", he pointed out. The sides also reached a compromise on a transition period and a gradual acquirement by the Dniester region of its state and legal status, the Russian diplomat reported. There has recently been certain progress in relations between Moldova and its separatist province, which agreed upon approaches to solution of the most pressing problems. "However, I would warn against excessive optimism at the moment, since a lot of differences remain to be settled yet, including through Russia's mediation", Vasev stressed.
