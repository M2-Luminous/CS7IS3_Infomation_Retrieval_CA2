The think tank will analyze such subjects as market development for next-generation technology, and increases in investment costs, and advocate governmental support and cooperation with academic circles. Japanese semiconductor industries have been refraining from such joint projects. This was because the Japan-U.S. friction over semiconductor trade once focused on the Japanese Government's excessive support for the industrial circles. However, major chip makers have decided to jointly solve their common problems to cope with revival of U.S. makers and rapid growth of ROK makers. Japanese chip makers intend to stop any further decline of their world market share. In addition to NEC, Toshiba, and Hitachi, the think tank will be participated in by Fujitsu, Mitsubishi Electric, Oki Electric Industry, Sony, Matsushita Electronics, Sanyo, and Sharp. NEC Managing Director Hajime Sasaki is expected to chair the 10-party organization, and its operations will be started by about five full-time staff supported by member companies. The primary duty of the think tank is to prepare advisory reports on the following subjects: 1) development of markets for next-generation technology, such as multimedia; 2) technological and industrial problems, such as increasing investment costs; and 3) the desirable position of the Japanese semiconductor industry in the world market. Semiconductor manufacturers have been refraining from multiparty projects since the 1980's, when "Super LSI [large-scale integration] Technology Research Cooperative," founded in 1976, was criticized by the United States as a cause of trade friction. However, "individual companies cannot adequately deal with their problems since cooperation among material makers, machine tool makers, academic circles, and the government is not needed in many fields" (as noted by a top official of a leading chip maker). Therefore, they have decided to tie up in order to jointly cope with difficult problems.
