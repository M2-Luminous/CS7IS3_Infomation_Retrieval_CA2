Not satisfied with bossing the Executive Branch as it pleased regarding the peace agreements, this time the embassy attempts to override the Legislative Assembly -- a highly vulnerable branch, as has been demonstrated over and over with the constitutional reform -- by trying to impose a Supreme Court of Justice [CSJ] willing to bend at the slightest hint from State Department officials. A list with the names of candidates of various political inclinations -- is the list the result of a consensus? -- which did not even meet the requirements demanded by law. [sentence as published] In addition, international news agency reports announced to the world that Dr. Armando Calderon Sol had agreed to negotiate the CSJ in exchange for the certainty that he would win the presidency of the Republic in the March elections. This nefarious meddling has been confirmed by the president of one of the lawyers' associations that present lists of candidates for the new CSJ. This person held the position of minister of justice in the first Revolutionary Junta of the Government, which came into being by the grace of the indescribable embassy, after General Romero's overthrow. This same minister was the originator, or at least the leading drafter, of the Junta's historic decree that declared the 1962 Constitution in force "in everything not running contrary to the Armed Forces' 15 October proclamation...." This legal monstrosity of a decree can only be compared to another, which said "for this once only," issued by the infamous Generals Martinez and Castaneda Castro. We are extremely concerned that this lawyer, who is also the proxy of the multinational oil enterprise recently found to be involved in a scandal because its president was arrested, is the patron of the "No to Continuism" campaign, contrary to the principle accepted by American law saying that magistrates should be "left in their positions permanently" and even be left therein for life for the sake of a healthy administration of justice. Finally, we wish to say that these impossible-to-understand positions can only be explained by the obstinate and determined position of the U.S. Government, which dared finance a Truth Commission, whose exclusive role was to discredit and lash out at the Judicial Branch for the sole reason that this branch remained independent and resisted the pressure to make our country more vulnerable to foreign interests. We reject foreign interests and their well-paid lawyers! We want magistrates to be appointed for their capabilities, not for their interests or ideologies! Out with the foreign political handling of the Judicial Branch! [Signed] Citizens of the East, Center, and West.
