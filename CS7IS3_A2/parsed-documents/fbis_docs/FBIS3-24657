FBIS3-24657 "cr00000008294001" 11 February 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-020--RUSSIA RUSSIA: 'WAR' ERUPTS OVER SCIENCE BUDGET The long-standing conflict between the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) and the Ministries of Science and Technology Policy and of Finance took a turn for the worse as a result of several recent presidential edicts and decisions on the budgets for the fourth quarter of 1993 and for 1994. Other prominent S&T organizations are now joining in the feud, some taking sides with the Academy, others supporting the science ministry. Academy of Sciences leaders lashed out against the government ministries when they learned that, contrary to past practice, the Academy had been dropped as a separate line item in both the budget for the fourth quarter of 1993 and the new 1994 state budget. Fuel was added to the fire when the budget announcements were followed by a Council of Ministers decree ensuring funds for the state science centers, but completely ignoring the Academy (Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 10 Jan 94). In what several newspapers described as a "declaration of war," the Academy's leadership fired off letters to President Yeltsin and "bombarded the Ministry of Science with angry calls" (Moscow SEGODNYA 11 Jan 94). They threatened to close eight or nine institutes and to take the "extreme step" of publicly expressing no confidence in the Russian ministers of science and finance (Moscow IZVESTIYA 23 Dec 93). RAS President Yuriy Osipov described the Academy's situation as "catastrophic." Other RAS leaders interpreted the budget decisions as steps in the Ministry of Science's "strategic plan" to bring about the "liquidation" of the Academy by diverting all science-designated financial resources to a system of ministry-controlled state science centers (Moscow SEGODNYA 30 Dec 93). There is evidence to support the Academy leadership's interpreta- tion of the government's actions. Minister of Science and Technology Policy Boris Saltykov has often said that the Russian Academy of Sciences, in its present form, is one of Russia's most conservative organizations and can only be reformed through the creation of a system of parallel, alternative structures. Saltykov proposed creating a system of federal or state science centers funded by the Ministry of Science, which were to compete for funds to fulfill priority state S&T programs. The centers would be drawn from RAS-owned institutes, thus effectively removing them from RAS control. The Russian Academy of Sciences and conservative government bureaucrats lobbied intensely against the proposal, but President Yeltsin approved it on 22 June. Efforts to derail implementation of the proposal continued despite Yeltsin's approval. (See FB PN 93-451, 7 Dec 93: "Russian Science: Improved Prospects for Reforms" and FB PN 93-307, 16 Jul 93: "Russian Academy of Sciences: Enemies Within, Enemies Without.") The budget decisions appear to be a setback for RAS efforts to obstruct the state science center proposal. Furthermore, the RAS may have lost credibility with President Yeltsin and his cabinet. Press accounts indicate that RAS President Yuriy Osipov, who has complained often and personally to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and President Yeltsin about Saltykov and his policies, suddenly found in December that his access to the prime minister had been blocked. According to IZVESTIYA, Osipov said that he was unable to contact the prime minister for three weeks, even by phone. "On various pretexts, the clerks manning the government telephones refused to put the Academy of Sciences president through to their boss" (Moscow IZVESTIYA 23 Dec 93; Moscow SEGODNYA 30 Dec 93). Another media reports indicated that Osipov did finally meet with Chernomyrdin, who promised him that the Academy would be paid its arrears for the fourth quarter, amounting to 24 billion rubles (Moscow Television Network 1700 GMT 21 Dec 93). Afterwards, Osipov publicly expressed doubts that the Academy would actually receive the money, and his doubts may be justified. A 21 December presidential edict ordered the Ministry of Finance to "ensure that the amended expenditures of the republic budget of the Russian Federation for the fourth quarter be financed as budget revenues are received." The edict reaffirmed the very policy which has been the major point of contention between the Academy and the Ministry of Finance. In order to control inflation, the Ministry of Finance releases funds as it receives them. Often there is not enough money in the treasury to go around, and many organizations, including the RAS, do not receive the amount of funds allocated by the Supreme Soviet or promised by the Council of Ministers (Moscow INTERFAX 29 Dec 93). Other major science institutions experiencing similar budget problems, especially in the medical and biological sciences sector, are now becoming more vocal in their complaints against the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance owes the Ministry of Health nearly 14 million rubles, the Russian Academy of Military Sciences 15 million rubles, and the State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision 931 million rubles. The Russian Academy of Medical Sciences received only two thirds of the funds it was supposed to get in 1993 and is complaining that this shortfall has disrupted many of its programs. The president of the Academy of Medical Sciences warned of a "brain drain" and complained that "a crisis has come about in the medical and biological industry, which if left unresolved, will force us to buy large quantities of medicine abroad" (Moscow Russian Television Network 1700 GMT 21 Dec 93; Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 23 Dec 93). Not everyone is complaining, however. Directors of nine leading R&D institutes addressed a letter to President Yeltsin in support of Saltykov and the Ministry of Science, urging the government to continue its competitive financing policy and to bring an end to "departmental financing. " Among the letter's authors were directors of the Kurchatov Institute of Nuclear Physics, the RAS Institute of Physics, the Institute of Physical Chemistry, Russian Research Center for Applied Chemistry, and the All Russian Institute of Electrical Machinery (Moscow ITAR-TASS 1220 GMT, 9 Jan 93). Likewise, at a routine session of the Governmental Commission for Operational Questions, First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets, a doctor of sciences and a professor, warned that, while it is impossible to "live" on 60-70 percent of what the state promised, it is also "an impermissible luxury to have several institutions studying one and the same problem." Soskovets said that scientists must reorganize themselves, because the days are gone when scientists do not have to account for the funds that they receive or for the work that they do (Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 23 Dec 93).
