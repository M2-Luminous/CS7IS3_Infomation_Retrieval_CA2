In a written statement tonight, Mikhailidhis added that with the Corfu Summit, Cyprus is now entering the course for joining United Europe. He added that the decision is not merely a step forward, but a decisive step because, as he stressed, the only thing that remains is setting a date for the beginning of accession negotiations. The foreign minister said it is significant that, for the first time, Cyprus is referred to by linking it to EU expansion, and not by mentioning the existing political problem. Mikhailidhis stressed that this is a great success for Cyprus, and reinforces the Cypriot people's hopes and expectations for a better and safer future within the EU. The foreign minister expressed Cyprus' gratitude toward the European Council for making the decision and toward the Greek Government, particularly the Greek delegation that successfully waged the great battle.
