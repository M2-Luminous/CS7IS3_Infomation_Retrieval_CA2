Gautier: Is France the FIS' backline base? Pellegrini: It obviously is. All Western countries close to Algeria, especially Spain, France, and Italy, may be considered as FIS backline bases. Gautier: How has the FIS established itself in France? Pellegrini: The FIS relies on various organizations, usually mosques and associations. Today, the FIS enjoys strong support networks made up of first-generation immigrants, but also second- or third-generation ones. The FIS has three funding sources. First of all, black market that is going on on both sides of the Mediterranean. Second, we have drug dealing. Whole families peddle drugs in suburban housing developments. Part of the considerable amounts of money involved flows to the FIS. Last, fundamentalists fund their activities through a "revolutionary tax," a well organized racket scheme. Gautier: Has the FIS a formal structure in France? Pellegrini: No, it has no such structure, it has no such thing as a clandestine leader who would control all its actions. The way the FIS tends to operate is through zones of influence. We are faced with small and independent groups which support small groups in Algeria. Gautier: What can happen with the FIS established in France? Pellegrini: I am very pessimistic about it. Affairs such as that of the arms smuggler arrested on Friday, or that of Lille, where 1,000 forged administrative documents were found, indicate that there may actually be logistical bases on the national territory. This is not a good sign. I think two kinds of violent acts may start spreading: to begin with, attacks against French interests, and then, of course, a real guerilla war between FIS supporters and opponents. Gautier: Is there a danger for France? Pellegrini: The Interior Ministry has correctly evaluated the problem. However, I remain convinced that we need to step up measures against the FIS in France. The FIS is very dangerous for us because these people are fanatics, they are very close to us geographically, and they are quite numerous.
