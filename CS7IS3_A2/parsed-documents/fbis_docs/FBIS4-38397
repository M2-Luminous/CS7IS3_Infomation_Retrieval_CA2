While understanding the motives guiding the people's deputies, the Republic Committee of the Communist Party of Crimea nonetheless considers it its duty to declare that this step contradicts the Constitution of Ukraine and generally recognized principles of international law, providing dishonorable politicians an opportunity to stir up conflict. This is exactly what has prompted the sense of alert with which the world is following the development of events around the peninsula. However, something else is also drawing attention. Why is it precisely right now that Crimea is surrounded with such attention? The president of Ukraine has long been attempting to postpone the elections of the president and local councils. Rumors persistently abound regarding the incapacity of the new Supreme Council of Ukraine, on the possible introduction of presidential rule, and then--on elimination of the very system of councils as organs of true sovereignty of the people. Those who would like to see this have placed their hopes in a breakdown of the elections of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. Not only did the elections take place, however--they also constituted in essence a universal referendum which the president has always avoided (contrary to the demands of the miners) and which in fact condemned the course of the Ukrainian leadership to one of self-isolation and severed ties with Russia and other CIS countries, though in words there is no shortage of oaths testifying to the benefit of such ties. Is this not why the presidents of Russia and Ukraine urgently needed (just as was the case during the "conflict" in Odessa prior to the second round of voting in the elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine) to tie into a single knot the boycott by national-democrats of the functioning of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, the tension surrounding Crimea, the resolute declarations of ministers of defense and politicians, and the no less haughty and disdainful utterances of B. Yeltsin "warning" the Ukrainian president? Here they were counting on providing the president of Ukraine a "pretext" for the introduction of presidential rule and for postponing the elections of the president and local councils. And on the president being able to "save face" in this regard, "basing" this step on the highest interests--the preservation of peace and tranquility in Ukraine and in the world. A dishonest game, a hypocritical position that can lead to bloodshed--this is the price of that "anxiety" over the situation in Crimea we hear resounding in speeches in Kiev and Moscow, in the calls to "stand up for Crimea" that are ringing out in response on the peninsula itself. We turn to the deputies of the Supreme Councils of Crimea and Ukraine, and to political parties and movements, with the following appeal: Realize in whose hands you may turn out to be a tool, though guided by the finest motives. We call upon you not to provide any pretext for canceling the elections of the president and local councils in Ukraine. For if these elections are not held, it will be a victory for reactionary forces. A victory the consequences of which will be tragic for the fate of social justice, democracy, and the striving to unite the peoples of all fraternal republics! People, be vigilant!
