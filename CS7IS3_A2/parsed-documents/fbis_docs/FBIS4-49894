It no longer advocates, as it did in the past, that the United Nations send peacekeeping forces to act as a global policeman in any region experiencing conflict. This move by the United States is the result of protracted research and extensive negotiations with Congress. Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said: This decree "is not intended to expand UN peacekeeping operations, but to help it get oriented." This policy readjustment conveys a message, which is that the United States cannot resolve all conflicts in the world and does not believe the United Nations is capable of creating and maintaining peace, especially in regions where wars have been continuing and enmity still exists. The second message is that the readjustment of the U.S. peacekeeping policy is based on the consideration of U.S. interests. Albright gave footnotes to the decree, saying: The objective of this decree is that "we are not going to ask the United Nations to take up missions that are beyond its capability, but to help it complete the missions we hope it can complete and succeed in." The conditions provided for by this policy are that it is necessary to consider promoting U.S. interests, consider the ability to supply personnel and capital, win support from the U.S. Congress, have clear objectives, and not get bogged down for a long time in peacekeeping operations that have no hope of success. The third message is that the United States is striving to reduce its budget for peacekeeping operations. At present, the United States shoulders 31.7 percent of the peacekeeping operations budget. The decree provides for reducing this expenditure, as the United States hopes, to 25 percent. The U.S. Congress obviously is indifferent to and hesitant about increasing appropriations for this. In a report in May, the U.S. Government pointed out that the United Nations is launching or plans to launch 36 peacekeeping operations, whereas the American people have long complained about missions that entail huge amounts of funds and that do not involve the safeguarding of national interests, yet require the sending of young Americans. The fourth message is that the United States does not support the United Nations in building up a permanent force, nor is it sending troops to prepare for or support this force, and that moreover, U.S. combat forces will not be placed under the direct command of foreign servicemen. This obviously differs greatly from the idea -- as put forward by Clinton in 1992 -- of building up an international force and stationing it on the borders of countries threatened by aggression. Observers maintain that the readjustment of U.S. peacekeeping policy shows the decline of the U.S. status, that it takes the strategy of retreating before advancing under the pressure of Congress and public opinion, and that it is reducing the burdens of capital and manpower so that the selective U.S. participation in UN peacekeeping operations can be more effective. Moreover, they maintain, the United States is doing its best to act as leader in world affairs, influencing or swaying the missions of the United Nations. It is foreseeable that this U.S. move inevitably will have a huge influence in the scramble for spheres of influence among the major Western powers.
