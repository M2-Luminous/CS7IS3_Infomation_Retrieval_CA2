Russia regards relations between the two countries as those of constructive good-neighborliness. Russian President Boris Yeltsin said this at a joint news conference today with ROK President Kim Yong-sam. President Yeltsin said that at the talks with the ROK president, which ended in Moscow today, Russia's task is "not so much to take stock of what has been done, as to ensure that there is a good future for cooperation, that the leap forward which we made in 1992 should continue, that our relations should become stronger, and that our fundamental accords should be filled with new specific deeds." Boris Yeltsin said that a new Moscow declaration has been signed with the president of Korea. In his opinion, it is "a major political document looking solely to the future." The Russian president believes that following the treaty on the fundamentals of bilateral relations, signed in Seoul in November 1992, this declaration is "a new step forward in mutually beneficial cooperation." In the opinion of Boris Yeltsin, an agreement to start next year on a regular exchange of young people will enable the peoples of Russia and Korea to learn more about one another, and also looks to the future. "We have said many times", the Russian president stressed, "that we are interested in full-scale economic relations, that we would like to see a growth of investments by South Korean firms in our economy, especially in the Far East." Boris Yeltsin believes that active participation by the companies of the Republic of Korea in the conversion of Russian military industry could also become mutually beneficial. The Russian president said that some considerable mutual understanding has been reached on these issues. At the talks with the Korean president, considerable attention was paid to examining the situation on the Korean Peninsula in the context of nuclear non-proliferation. Russia, as Boris Yeltsin stressed, "is extremely worried at the unsettled nature of the nuclear question in this region, and Russia bases itself on the premise that the DPRK should remain a fully fledged member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and should fully implement its commitments under the verification agreement with the IAEA." "This is our fundamental line," the Russian president stated. "At the same time," he pointed out, "we consider that it is necessary to tackle the North Korean nuclear problem by political methods, without damaging the legitimate interests of all the sides involved therein." One way of resolving this problem, Boris Yeltsin stressed, lies in implementing a Russian proposal on an international conference on security and the nuclear-free status of the Korean Peninsula, with the participation of Russia, both Korean states, the United States, China, Japan, and also representatives of the United Nations and the IAEA. At the talks with Kim Yong-sam, the question of the 100,000 ethnic Koreans of Russian citizenship living in Russia was also touched on. "On our part," Boris Yeltsin noted, "it was stressed that Russian Koreans, like all Russians in our multi-ethnic country, have the right to state support, to the maintenance of their culture, language, and customs, and development of links with their historical motherland."
