FR940930-0-00168 FR940930-0-00028 This cutpoint is very similar to the 0.5 percent CO standard promulgated for the certification short test (CST) two-speed idle procedure for gasoline-fueled vehicles (58 FR 58382&hyph;58440, November 1, 1993). The choice of the CST standard was based on a review of data collected from inspection and maintenance facilities that employ a two-speed idle test which indicate that production line gasoline powered vehicles from non-pattern failure engine families could easily meet a 0.5 percent CO standard. 43 Since the CO emissions of CFVs can be expected to be no greater than, and in many cases are expected to be less than, those from vehicles meeting Tier 1 and Tier 2 standards, EPA believes that properly manufactured CFVs can also easily meet a 0.5 percent CO standard and will therefore not have difficulty in meeting a standard of 0.4 percent plus the certification reference value (the sum of which will likely total more than 0.5 percent in most instances). Based on the above discussion, EPA agrees that a cut point of the CO certification reference value plus 0.4 percent CO by volume provides reasonable assurance that gross installation errors will be discovered while sufficiently limiting the probability of false test failures, and therefore will adopt this pass/fail criteria for the two-speed idle post-installation test. 43 Sierra Research Inc., ``Analytical Support for Selection of Certification Short Test Standards'', Report No. SR93&hyph;03&hyph;0, EPA Air Docket # A&hyph;91&hyph;21, item IV&hyph;A&hyph;01, March 4, 1993. C. The California Pilot Test Program The Pilot program will be federally administered in the State of California and will require vehicle manufacturers to sell a minimum number of clean-fuel LDVs and LDTs in California starting in MY 1996. Unlike the CFF program, the Pilot program's requirements do not include HDVs. The CAA gives EPA several responsibilities with regard to the Pilot program. EPA has already implemented a credit program for vehicle manufacturers (57 FR 60038, December 17, 1992; 40 CFR 88.304&hyph;94) and today's action covers vehicle sales requirements and state opt-in provisions. The light-duty vehicle and truck CFV emission standards applicable to vehicles under both the Pilot and CFF program are discussed above under section A.1.a. 1. Sales Requirements a. CAA Requirements. Section 249(c) of the CAA requires EPA to promulgate regulations requiring that ``[c]lean fuel vehicles shall be produced, sold, and distributed (in accordance with normal business practices and applicable franchise agreements) to ultimate purchasers in California (including owners of covered fleets .␣.␣.) in numbers that meet or exceed'' 150,000 in MYs 1996 through 1998 and 300,000 in MYs 1999 and later. However, the CAA does not direct EPA on how to distribute these sales requirements among vehicle manufacturers. Section 249(d) allows EPA to make available credits for use in the ``fulfillment of [a] manufacturer's share of the requirements'' of the Pilot program. As mentioned earlier, EPA has established a credit program that allows manufacturers to use credits to meet the sales requirements of the Pilot program. b. CARB requirements . CARB's Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Program will require the sale of vehicles meeting more stringent exhaust emission levels by establishment of (1) a decreasing fleet average NMOG emission requirement (for manufacturers of vehicles up to 6,000 lbs GVWR) and (2) through direct sales percentage requirements (for manufacturers of vehicles from 6,000 to 14,000 lbs GVWR). (Note: The Pilot program and the California LEV program will overlap only for those vehicles up to 8,500 lbs GVWR, as the Pilot program does not cover vehicles beyond this GVWR.) The CARB program will require each manufacturer of vehicles up to 6,000 lbs GVWR to sell LEVs in each of two LVW subclasses (>3750 and 3750&hyph;5750 lbs LVW) . Each manufacturer will need to sell a sufficient number of LEVs such that the manufacturer's California fleet average NMOG exhaust emission value is less than or equal to a fleet average NMOG exhaust emission requirement for the corresponding model year, vehicle type, and LVW subclass. In addition to meeting the fleet average NMOG requirement, each manufacturer must also sell a required minimum percentage of ZEVs starting in the 1998 MY. Also beginning with MY 1998, CARB requires that manufacturers of medium-duty vehicles (i.e., trucks from 6,001 to 14,000 lbs GVWR) certify enough such vehicles to CARB's emission standards such that the manufacturer's fleet consists of a minimum percentage of ULEVs. The projected sales of vehicles in California resulting from the CARB LEV program are likely to far exceed the sales of CFVs under the Pilot program. Based on the projected sales of only LDVs and LDTs under 3,750 LVW in 1996 and 1999, sales under the CARB LEV program are expected to reach about 200 and 400 percent of the Pilot program CFV sales requirements, respectively. Unless and until EPA adopts California standards for CFVs, CARB LEVs which do not meet federal CFV requirements could not be counted in the Pilot program (although vehicles meeting CFV requirements will likely meet the exhaust emission requirements of the CARB LEV program). c. California Pilot Program sales requirements _i. ``Sales'' definition. CAA Section 249(c)(1) requires that ``[c]lean fuel vehicles be produced, sold, and distributed to ultimate purchasers in California''. EPA is today establishing this requirement as applying at the first point of sale from the manufacturer to the dealer or ultimate owner. Until such time as EPA formally changes its interpretation of section 249(c), manufacturers covered by the Pilot program may not use sales of converted vehicles to meet the sales requirements of the Pilot program. Similarly, manufacturers of conversions are not subject to the sales requirements. As was stated in the NPRM for this rule, nothing in section 249(c)(1) requires that conversions be part of the CFV sales requirements. Furthermore, section 247 sets forth requirements applicable to conversions and states that conversions to CFVs that meet those requirements may be used to satisfy the purchase requirements of the federal CFF program; however, there is no mention of the Pilot program.
