"Hong Kong Dragon" had been operating for several years at a loss. During this period, Kuo T'ai Airlines had contacted Pao Yu-kang, asking him to consider an exchange of shares, which would have actually made Kuo T'ai a holding company for "Hong Kong Dragon." When Pao Yu-kang solicited my advice, I found it hard to oppose this publicly, but suggested that he consider CAAC's response, whereupon Pao Yu-kang immediately stated that he would abandon his plans for an exchange of shares with Kuo T'ai. Later, Jung Chih-chien [2837 2535 0256] of the Hong Kong Central Trust Company bought shares in Kuo T'ai, becoming its board chairman. While Jung Chih-chien had not notified the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA of this action in advance, I guessed that he had at least obtained Li Peng's approval and Wang Zhen's [then PRC Vice President] endorsement. This incident upset Pao Yu-kang considerably, with it being learned only after the event that Pao had at first considered an exchange of shares with Kuo T'ai, in which Kuo T'ai would have allowed Pao a seat on its board of directors as deputy chairman. By 1990, "Hong Kong Dragon's" business had improved, with already some slight surpluses, so Pao Yu-kang turned over his post as board chairman to his son-in-law. But just as he was preparing to buy new aircraft and add new lines with great prospects, Pao Yu-kang suddenly sought me out, telling me that he was going to "offer" "Hong Kong Dragon" shares to Ts'ao Kuang-piao, who would in turn transfer them to Central Trust's Jung Chih-chien. As I had had absolutely no news of this in advance, I was surprised and asked why, only to learn that Jung Chih-chien had proposed the share offering on his own initiative. I could see that while Pao said that he did not mind, he was showing a very helpless manner, so that I asked him to wait until I had clarified the matter before discussing it further, to which Pao agreed. By this time, Ts'ao Kuang-piao had also sought out Hong Kong and Macao International's board chairman, Chang Chien-hua [1728 1696 5478], proposing that Hong Kong and Macao International "offer" all of its shares held in "Hong Kong Dragon" airlines to Central Trust's Jung Chih-chien, telling Chang that Pao Yu-kang had already agreed to "offer" Jung Chih-chien his shares. Then Chang Chien-hua asked Ts'ao Kuang-piao: "What is your plan all about? Does the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA know about it? And has anyone in Beijing approved it?" Afterwards, Chang Chien-hua told me that the purchasing plan had been endorsed by Yang Shangkun and approved by Li Peng. After the purchase, Jung would combine and transfer to Kuo T'ai the shares owned by Pao Yu-kang and the ones sold by Ts'ao Kuang-piao. And Central Trust would keep the shares sold by Hong Kong and Macao International, with Kuo T'ai becoming the majority shareholder. Business operations would also be "entrusted" to Kuo T'ai management, with the additional aircraft being leased by Kuo T'ai, which would stop flying and "offer" to "Hong Kong Dragon" its mainland routes to Beijing and Shanghai. Such a complete plan would actually turn Hong Kong Dragon into a "subsidiary" company of Kuo T'ai, not only violating its original establishment intention, but also resolving the problem that Kuo T'ai was having trouble overcoming at the time: its almost failed dispute with CAAC over mainland and Hong Kong routes. At the least, Kuo T'ai would temporarily retain its navigation privileges. So I notified Pao Yu-kang, asking him to temporarily not sell his shares to Jung Chih-chien. And I immediately flew to Beijing, asking for meetings with Yang Shangkun and Li Peng. When Yang Shangkun met with me, he said that he had only heard Jung Chih-chien's report, but "certainly did not understand the actual situation." Li Peng would not see me, asking [State Councilor] Zou Jiahua [6760 1367 5478] to meet with me on his behalf. While Zou listened to my report and expressed understanding, he did not take a stand, saying that he would go to Yang and Li for instructions. The next day, Zou told me that Yang Shangkun had stuck to his statement that he had heard Jung Chih-chien's report but did not understand the actual situation, while Li Peng had said that he would not consider a change. So I asked them to reconsider, suggesting that Zou Jiahua look up certain figures familiar with Hong Kong's situation in this respect for a better understanding of the matter, to see if they had any objections to the State Council's decision. By this time, Jung Chih-chien had also arrived in Beijing, which I guessed was related to my involvement in this matter. I again asked for a direct hearing of my report by Li Peng, who still would not see me. On Zou Jiahua's third meeting with me, he stuck to his position unchanged, while I repeatedly explained the pros and cons. We had a heated arguement, with him pounding the table first, and then me pounding it back, calling him to account with the questions: "Are not party principles still important? And are we not going to show consideration for united front targets?" But we finally parted on bad terms. On my return to Hong Kong, Pao Yu-kang, who probably already knew the situation (as to how he knew, I was unclear), invited me to dinner, which was our last meeting, where we discussed many emotional matters. When we met, he advised me that: "I have already sold the shares to Jung Chih-chien (which were sold in name to Ts'ao Kuang-piao, who then sold them to Jung). Thank you for your concern, but the matter is settled." After chatting a bit, he then told me that: "I have had only two failures in my whole life, one being my investment in the Standard Chartered Bank, and the other being Hong Kong Dragon!" What could I say? His investment in Hong Kong Dragon had been at my request, so that all I could say that I was truly sorry and offered my apologies to him. When Chang Chien-hua went to request instructions, Ts'ao Kuang-piao told him that Pao Yu-kang had already sold his shares, and that Chang should also quickly sell his shares in Hong Kong and Macao International. When Chang asked me "whether he should also sell to him," I indignantly said that: "Ts'ao Kuang-piao does not have the say, so that in order to sell, they will have to get State Council documents." The next day, Jung Chih-chien asked to see me. While I knew that he would not come to see me without business, and that he was coming in reference to this matter, I saw him anyhow. But when he greeted me as uncle and told me his mission, I told him also that in order to get Hong Kong and Macao International's shares in Hong Kong Dragon, he would need State Council notification, which I would comply with. Sure enough, before long, State Council notification arrived, making it obvious how much Li Peng supported and "cherished" him.
