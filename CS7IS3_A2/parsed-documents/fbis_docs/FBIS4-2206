Rifadah, however, said that Malaysia doesn't have a set policy on whether Taiwan or Mainland China should join the world organization first. Beijing has reiterated that it should be admitted into GATT ahead of Taipei. Rifadah's visit here is part of her global efforts to woo investments in the Southeast Asian nation. She presided over a symposium on Malaysia's investment climate in the morning. She also said that it's "logical" for Taiwan to become a founding member of the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC), a regional economic cooperation grouping proposed by Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Sri Mahathir Mohamed. She said that to be an EAEC member, a candidate must be Asian country that is a member of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum and Taiwan meets all these conditions. In meeting Premier Lien Chan, Rafidah said that she is optimistic about the development of cooperative ties between Taiwan and Malaysia, Lien in return expressed the hope that more ranking Malaysian officials would visit Taiwan to enhance mutual understanding and exchanges. He also asked Rafidah to forward his invitation for Prime Minister Mahathir to visit Taiwan.
