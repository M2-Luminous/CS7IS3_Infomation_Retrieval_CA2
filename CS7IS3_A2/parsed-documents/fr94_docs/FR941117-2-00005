ACTION: Revised notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: The Angeles National Forest published a Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement for a non-significant amendment to the Angeles National Forest Land and Resources Management Plan in Volume 55, No. 173 / Thursday, September 6, 1990. The amendment would add 1640 acres to the Land Adjustment Plan, which is part of the Land and Resources Management Plan. This is in response to a proposal to exchange land for the purpose of development of a solid waste management facility in the Elsmere Canyon area of the Tujunga Ranger District, Angeles National Forest, Los Angeles County, California. The Forest wishes to revise and update the Notice of Intent with the following information: DECISION: The Forest Service must decide whether or not to exchange 1643 acres of National Forest land currently within the boundaries of the Angeles National Forest for private lands within the boundaries of Angeles National Forest. Other private lands within the boundaries of other National Forests within Southern California, may also be considered. As part of that decision, an amendment to the existing Angeles National Forest Land Adjustment Plan would be made, adding the 1643 acres to the Adjustment Plan. Further, the Angeles Land and Resources Management Plan would be amended to reflect the changes in the Plan as a result of the decision. This decision will be subject to appeal under 36 CFR 215. DATES: A revised date for the DEIS to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public review is on or about December 31, 1994. The Final EIS is scheduled to be completed by December, 1995. RESPONSIBLE OFFICIAL: The responsible official will be the Regional Forester, Pacific Southwest Region, 630 Sansome St., San Francisco, Ca. 94111. OTHER PROVISIONS: All other provisions of the original notice remain accurate.
