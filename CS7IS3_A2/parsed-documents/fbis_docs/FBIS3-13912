To quote His Majesty King Husayn, it is vital that Washington be bound by previously U.S.-endorsed UN resolutions granting the Arab identity of [east] Jerusalem. We will not beat around the bush. With all honesty we will tell all Arab and Muslim nations they have to back the Jordanian moves and join His Majesty King Husayn's drive to uphold the Arab-Islamic complexion and sanctity of Jerusalem. The absence of Arab solidarity and a less-than-firm Islamic position has tempted Israel to pursue its expansionist ambitions in the occupied Arab territories, most of all in Jerusalem. It has also prompted the United States to backtrack on previous positions and so abstain on the Jerusalem part of UN Security Council Resolution 904. Should this kind of Arab and Islamic position persist, the Arab-Islamic complexion of Jerusalem will be commandeered in broad daylight with U.S., and maybe international, support. Arab and Muslim leaders cannot afford to remain mere spectators as the Arab-Islamic complexion of Jerusalem, the al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Dome of the Rock is hijacked. It is the duty of every Arab and Muslim to strive to maintain the identity of this holy city. Under no circumstances should we remain passive toward the plot to confiscate Jerusalem's identity and Judaize it and its Islamic shrines. Hence our argument that all Arab and Muslim leaders must heed His Majesty King Husayn's call and join forces with him to preempt the confiscation of Jerusalem's identity and bring sufficient pressure to bear in the interest of a renewed commitment by the U.S. Administration to the UN Security Council resolutions according to which Jerusalem is occupied territory not subject to annexation by Israel under any circumstances. If the U.S. Administration really cares about a viable peace process, it will have to rethink its positions and obligate itself to UN resolutions and the terms of reference of the Madrid conference that the United States itself initiated. Otherwise, the peace process is doomed.
