This interesting news was announced at an economic conference held in Manama, Bahrain earlier this month by the governor of the Central Bank of Iran, Mohammed Hoseyn 'Adeli. However, no sooner had the typewriter begun to record this news when more informed sources in Tehran denied the report and described it as "completely devoid of veracity." One source said, "The governor does not follow foreign policy." Perhaps he imagines that Iran actually signed a peace treaty with Iraq. The matter was quickly forgotten. Undoubtedly, 'Adeli, a technocrat with little experience in political matters, had committed an innocent stupidity. The issue of the future of Iranian-Iraqi relations is always present on the rare occasions when Iranian foreign policy options are discussed in a balanced mood, far from provocative slogans. Iranian political experts agree that the establishment of a firm foundation for relations with Iraq is still one of Iran's most important priorities, inasmuch as the two neighboring states have been holding talks for more than five years since agreeing to a UN-sponsored cease-fire. They have also achieved a better understanding of each other's positions through a number of high-level contacts. Moreover, if the news coming from Tehran is correct, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati will soon head an official delegation to Baghdad, the "first" of its kind since the mullahs took power in Iran in 1979. The idea of an attempt to improve relations with Iraq has been gaining force in Tehran for a number of reasons: The main reason is that the pragmatic wing in President Rafsanjani's leadership has lost much of its influence over formulating foreign policy. Rafsanjani wanted to bring revolutionary Iran closer to moderate forces in the region by establishing strong relations with Western Europe and Japan. A normalization with the United States is still his medium-term goal. However, this strategy has failed because potential foreign partners of Iran have refused to do anything to help strengthen Rafsanjani's position in Tehran. The general idea abroad is that if the mullahs are conciliatory, it is because they are weak and they should therefore not be helped to gain new power. There is also a strong conviction that the mullahs have not abandoned their long-range dream of exporting the revolution and establishing an empire in the name of the Khomeyniist ideology. Thus, Iran has failed to convince the outside world that it no longer wants to behave on the basis of an aggressive, expansionist ideology. Hence, the general hesitation to develop more than a certain modicum of relations with Iran. The star of the radical elements in the rightwing leadership of 'Ali Khamene'i, the supreme leader in Tehran, has risen again. These elements are advocating a new foreign policy course. They maintain that the failure of the normalization policy requires Iran to seek new friends and partners to break its current isolation. Velayati's recent tour of black Africa and several formerly communist states in Europe was a part of this new effort. Political circles in Tehran have also begun to renew the idea of transforming the dormant Nonaligned Movement into a "pole" in global politics. Accordingly, Iran's behind-the-scenes relations with Serbia, the special relations that have developed between Iran and Ion Iliescu's new communist government in Romania, and Iran's increasingly close relations with North Korea are all part of a new strategy. Regarding the region itself, the weakening of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] continues to be a priority for Tehran, which has always considered the GCC a part of the effort to weaken Iran. Such weakening is effected in part by encouraging "disturbances" in the politics of several GCC countries--e.g., Oman and Qatar--and by strongly wooing Kuwait, especially by constantly pointing to the inevitable Iraqi danger. Outside of the Gulf region, Iran has escalated its efforts to expand its influence in Yemen and to build new bridges with Jordan. The desire to woo the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has been so strong that the Iranian Embassy in Jordan actually heaped praise on King Husayn after Jordan expelled 22 [Iranian] diplomats from Amman. Relations with Sudan, on the other hand, have become relatively tepid. This is attributed in part to Tehran's abhorrence of Hasan al-Turabi's desire to promote himself as the leader of the fundamentalist movement instead of Khamene'i. Iran's relations with Syria have also become tepid, because Tehran believes that Syria has now certainly joined the "American camp." Thus, the dream of Baghdad-Tehran axis now appears more attractive than at any time in the past. However, the establishment of such an axis is more easily said than done, because both countries must first settle their bilateral conflicts. Moreover, many in Tehran are convinced that President Saddam Husayn's regime may not last beyond the end of this year, and Baghdad, for its part, knows that any axis with Tehran would dash all of its hopes for the lifting of the sanctions imposed on it and for its return to international society. In other words, the mullahs cannot achieve any strategic objective by establishing a firm alliance with Iraq as long as Saddam is in power. At the same time, Iraq cannot look to Iran as a strong partner that can fill the vacuum created by the loss of its relations with the moderate Arab countries and the [West]. Thus, Iranian-Iraqi relations are likely to continue to be uneven for a period that is certain to continue until the two countries adopt new policies, perhaps under the auspices of new leaders. Therefore, it is certain that 'Adeli's announcement of a peace treaty was premature.
