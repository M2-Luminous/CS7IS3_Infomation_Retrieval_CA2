In his statement for the conference, sponsored by the dominant party of the left, Occhetto said his party's platform for the March 27 general elections includes a commitment to "guarantee the independence" of the nation's judiciary and individual magistrates and "the speedy and efficient working of the justice administration." Against the backdrop of the sweeping business and political corruption investigations which toppled the old political order, discussion here ranged over the latest developments in these probes and the prospect of applying "a political solution" to heal the myriad wounds opened by investigators and the courts and on to the issue of magistrates as candidates for election. Opening the assembly, Senator Massimo Brutti took up the sensitive "political solution" issue and called for speeding up procedures to bring these cases to trial. On the prospect of extending the use of plea bargaining, the senator said a limit would have to be set on the enlargement of this practice and that plea bargaining should not lead to preferential treatment for crimes committed against the public administration. Taking a broader view of the justice administration, Brutti, who heads the Democratic Party of the Left justice office, proposed "innovative measures" to apply to the criminal justice system in the near future: the establishment of "district courts" to handle Mafia trials; allowing appeals court justices to sit on the bench at lower court hearings; reducing the number of judges hearing criminal cases from three to one, expect for "district court" trials. This latter step, said the senator, would immediately free from 600 to 700 judges to begin attacking colossal backlogs. Among the recent developments in Milan's Clean Hands investigations under scrutiny here were the arrest yesterday of businessman Paolo Berlusconi, the brother of entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi who is now a political powerhouse at the helm of his Forza Italia (Go Italy) center-right movement, and the naming of Massimo D'Alema, Occhetto's deputy at the Democratic Party of the Left, as the alleged recipient of a kickback. Senator Cesare Salvi, a member of the party leadership, said on the Berlusconi case, "It would not be correct to comment if one doesn't know the briefs." He went on to urge the political parties, coalitions, movements and groupings heading into the March vote to refrain from using the findings of investigators in their campaigns and called on the magistrates "to be very careful and cautious." In comment on Tiziana Parenti, a Milan assistant public prosecutor who broke with the Clean Hands team last year and is now a Forza Italia candidate for parliament, Salvi noted that she, "like all other citizens, has a right to run" but added the caveat, "It is not right to use notoriety gained in investigations and trials." On the advisory warrant issued yesterday to inform Giovanni De Piccoli, a member of the European Parliament for the Democratic Party of the Left, that he is under investigation, Brutti told reporters on the sidelines that he could not comment because he had not been informed of the "text of the measure." The senator also said he was skeptical about the allegation levelled against D'Alema. He said he had "serious doubts" about the entire affair because D'Alema is a front-rank political figure who has never been close to the procedures cited. He also dismissed the notion of "a faction led by Massimo D'Alema" as pure fantasy. This faction, according to the jailed former deputy chairman of a Fiat group construction company, Cogefar Impresit's Antonio Mosconi, received an illegal political party contribution.
