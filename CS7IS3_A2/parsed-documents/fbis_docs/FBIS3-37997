In the opinion of the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, "the president's speech signifies, to some extent, a new stage in the development of intra- state relations: the Russian parliament received for the first time a presidential message called upon to give guidelines in political, economic and social construction for 1994". "Legislators," the TRUD newspaper notes, "were waiting for the president's response to a decision taken by the lower house to pardon members of the state emergency committee (eds: they attempted an abortive coup in august 1991) as well as people involved in riots on May 1, 1993 and ringleaders of the coup in September-October 1993. "But Yeltsin refrained from a direct appraisal. However, his speech contained the following idea: you can display mercy only if it does not contradict rules of law and morality." "After reading the presidential message," the PRAVDA newspaper writes, "one is apt to ask the following question: is the country really changing the political, social and economic course in the interests of the majority of Russians or has Boris Yeltsin launched an election campaign for a new term of the presidency with his speech?" The message, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper notes, "had to contain specific strategic plans of the president. However, the tradition of former reports on guidelines" which general secretaries of the former Communist Party of the Soviet Union liked to deliver, remained. "Mr. Yeltsin limited himself to the enumeration of existing problems and general phrases on what direction should be taken to resolve them." The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper examines reasons for the arrest of CIA agent Aldrich Hazen Ames and his wife Maria del Rosario by FBI officers, to which American television was invited. "Russia acted more confidently in the international arena in the recent past," the newspaper stresses. "Our diplomatic success in Bosnia and Herzegovina evidently exhausted the U.S. Administration's patience: Americans were snubbed there. "Therefore, Ames's scandal broke out exactly at this time. It is precisely at this time that Washington wants to stop Moscow and to remind it who is master in the world. "In good old times when a Western power fell into fits of hysteria about Soviet spies, Moscow replied with the principle of 'tit for tat': arrest for arrest, expulsion for expulsion. "Even Mikhail Gorbachev acted the same way at the beginning of his rule. Later, political will weakened. Then, the Soviet Union collapsed. If Russia wants to display firmness, spies can be found in Moscow too." TRUD runs its own material on the state's delays with payment of wages. The newspaper notes that "the Russian Statistics Committee reported: wage arrears more than doubled in january, totalling a sky-high sum of 1,681.3 billion roubles. Over 30,000 enterprises in industry and agriculture did not pay wages and salaries to their employees." The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper forecasts the dollar's exchange rate to the rouble in 1994. The newspaper believes that the dollar's rate will reach 2,650-3,190 roubles by the end of the year. The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper prints a sensation that a Russian scholar designed an instrument for liaison with... Ghosts. "It would seem that talk about miracles is out of question in our era of pragmatism and scientific discoveries. "But actualities of life beat our imagination. In any case, Gennadiy Markov of Novosibirsk invented an instrument for liaison with a supreme outer space intellect and carriers of its information -- ghosts." St. Petersburg mayor Anatoliy Sobchak sent a proposal to Finnish Housing Minister Pirjo Rusanen: To complete the establishment of a joint stock society in the shortest possible time in order to implement a joint housing project in St. Petersburg -- "Northern Valley-Pargolovo". The project is worth 15 billion Finnish marks and will be financed with credits from international banks and personal savings of future condominium owners, reports the VECHERNYY PETERBURG newspaper.
