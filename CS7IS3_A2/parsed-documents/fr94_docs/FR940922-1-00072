FR940922-1-00072 FR940922-1-00009 Under the 1976 amendments, devices are divided into preamendments devices, i.e., those devices in commercial distribution prior to May 28, 1976, the date of the enactment of the 1976 amendments, and postamendments devices, i.e., those devices first in commercial distribution on or after the enactment of the 1976 amendments. All devices are then further classified into class I, II, or III, depending on the degree of regulatory control necessary to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class III devices are the most highly regulated category of devices and, unless exempted, are subject to premarket approval by FDA. A device may be classified into class III: (1) By operation of law if the device is a ``new'' device, i.e., it was not on the market before the date of the enactment of the 1976 amendments; (2) if FDA classifies or reclassifies the device into class III; or (3) by operation of law under 21 U.S.C. 360j(l) because it is a transitional device that was previously regarded as a new drug. An unapproved class III device may be investigated for purposes of obtaining FDA approval under an investigational device exemption (IDE) (21 U.S.C. 360j(g)). Under three IDE regulatory provisions, FDA can require any information ``relevant'' to the review of the application (21 CFR 812.20(b)(12), 812.20(c), and 813.20(b)(18)). Clinical data generated under an IDE and other data and information are used by FDA as a basis to grant marketing approval for class III devices and as a basis to reclassify a device. The law requires that a premarket approval application (PMA) contain ``full reports of all information,'' known to, or which should reasonably be known to, the applicant concerning investigations concerning the safety and effectiveness of the device (21 U.S.C. 360e(c)(1)(A)). In approving a PMA, FDA must make the determination, inter alia, that there is a showing of reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, and that based on a fair evaluation of all material facts the proposed labeling is not false or misleading (21 U.S.C. 360e(b)). In deciding whether to grant or deny approval of a PMA, FDA relies upon ``valid scientific evidence'' which includes evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device *␣*␣*.'' (21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)). FDA evaluates the data submitted and determines whether it constitutes ``valid scientific evidence'' for the purpose of determining the safety and effectiveness of a particular device ``and whether the available evidence, when taken as a whole is adequate to support a determination that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its conditions of use.'' (21 CFR 860.7(c)(1)). In determining whether a device should be reclassified, FDA relies upon the same regulatory definition of ``valid scientific evidence.'' Section 515(e)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C 360(e)(1)) authorizes the agency to withdraw approval of an application if, on the basis of ``new information,'' there is a lack of a showing of reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective under the conditions of use, or the labeling of the device is false or misleading in any particular. FDA may also use clinical data to determine whether a ``new device,'' i.e. a device marketed after the date of the enactment of the 1976 amendments, may be removed from its automatic statutory class III status and thereby be exempt from premarket approval requirements (21 U.S.C. 360c(f)(1)). Such devices may be marketed without premarket approval if FDA issues an order finding them ``substantially equivalent'' to a predicate device that does not require premarket approval (21 U.S.C. 360c(i)(1)). In determining whether a device is ``substantially equivalent'' to a predicate device, FDA must determine, on the basis of a premarket application submission (510(k) submission)(21 U.S.C. 360(k)), that the device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and that the device ``has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or *␣*␣* has different technological characteristics and the [submission] *␣*␣* contains information, including clinical data if deemed necessary by the Secretary, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective'' as the predicate device and does not raise different questions of safety and efficacy than the predicate device. (Id.) Pursuant to sections 519 and 701 of the act, (21 U.S.C. 360i and 371) FDA has broad authority to promulgate regulations governing the approval of devices. Section 519(a) of the act requires manufacturers of devices to ``establish and maintain such records, make such reports, and provide such information, as the Secretary may, by regulation, reasonably require to assure that such device is not adulterated or misbranded and to otherwise assure its safety and effectiveness.'' Thus, a critical part of the agency's function is examining clinical data to determine if the safety and effectiveness requirements of the act and the Public Health Service Act have been met. FDA is authorized by sections 505(i) and 701(a) of the act to promulgate regulations governing the conduct of studies of investigational drugs, including unlicensed biological products. There is similar authority relating to studies of devices under sections 510(k), 513, 515, 520(g), and 522 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360(k), 360c, 360e, 360j(g), and 360l). Pursuant to this authority, FDA has previously promulgated regulations whose purpose is to ensure the reliability of data submitted to FDA in support of marketing applications. FDA's investigational new drug application regulations (21 CFR part 312), promulgated under section 505(i) of the act, and its investigational device exemptions regulations (21 CFR parts 812 and 813), promulgated under section 520(g) of the act, are intended, among other things, to help ensure the validity and reliability of clinical study results submitted to FDA in support of new drug applications (NDA's) and supplements; premarket approval applications, and premarket notification submissions (510(k) submissions) for devices; and license applications and supplements for biological products. The Supreme Court has upheld the authority of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to issue regulations to ensure the reliability of clinical study results, including requirements to minimize bias.
