He did this to assume responsibility for a Diet deadlock caused by suspicions surrounding his receipt of political funds which has prevented the discussion of the fiscal year 1994 budget for one month. However, nothing was clarified at a news conference regarding the suspicions themselves, which are a vital point and the direct cause of his resignation. Prime Minister Hosokawa, who called for politics that were fresh and easy to understand and who pledged to promote political reform, entered the political arena by obtaining overwhelming support from the Japanese people. It is ironic that he had to resign only eight months after he became prime minister due to suspicions concerning his political funds. It is true that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] launched a strong campaign designed to undermine the Hosokawa administration. However, the prime minister became a target of suspicions concerning his political funds, and he was unable to give adequate explanations. Because of this, it turned out that his credibility was damaged. This was a fatal blow to the administration, whose primary goal was to realize political reform. We have pointed out repeatedly the fact that deliberations on and the subsequent approval of the fiscal year 1994 budget were of vital importance to the current economic situation. We have been urging the prime minister to break the deadlock by allowing his former secretary to testify before the Diet as a witness and by actively disclosing documents to clarify suspicions over such issues as the 100 million yen loan from the Sagawa Kyubin group. We did this because we felt that the aforementioned countermeasures were the first step that the prime minister, who sought to realize politics that is open and easy to understand, should have taken. Resignation Announcement Was Sudden, Lacked Explanations However, the prime minister maintained a firm stand. The fact that Hosokawa suddenly announced, without adequate explanations regarding the suspicions, his resignation was an action by a prime minister who likes doing unexpected things. However, we have to say that the announcement was too abrupt. Logically speaking, the prime minister could have decided to resign after paving the way for deliberations on the budget, which is closely linked to the people's livelihood, or in exchange for normalizing the Diet situation. Because of its hastiness, however, the recent abrupt announcement gives us the impression that suspicions still exist. In a way, by giving up deliberations on the budget, the prime minister's sudden announcement appears to the people to be an irresponsible act. The prime minister should have explained in clear terms what created the circumstances under which he was forced to resign. Now the people's distrust of politics will increase. Also, it leaves a bad precedent in which a prime minister of a nation was replaced without clarifying the truth. We just cannot understand why the prime minister maintained his cold stand from start to finish, in refusing to shed light on the suspicions. We expected that Japanese politics would be refreshed and become capable of settling problems by regaining the people's trust. In this sense, we welcomed the birth of the Hosokawa administration, which put an end to the LDP's one-party domination. The vices of the Hosokawa administration -- including discord within the coalition government, a lack of leadership, and reliance on bureaucrats -- stood out. However, it is regrettable that the curtain descended on the Hosokawa administration all too soon. It is regrettable because we believe that one of preconditions for getting rid of the ill effects of the money-mad politics -- which is known for the collusive ties between politicians, bureaucrats, and businessmen and zoku Diet members [influential Diet members concerned with specific issues] -- is to have a non-LDP administration for a while. The birth of the Hosokawa administration changed in one stroke the postwar political system--in which the LDP, which benefited from the 1955 regime of Japanese politics, and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] played central roles. It drove both parties into a de facto dissolution and started the realignment of the political world. The eight-month rule of the Hosokawa administration was of great significance in that the politics of the LDP collapsed and that the realignment of the political world actually began. The realization of political reform, which was the Hosokawa administration's greatest task, and the liberalization of the rice market are the coalition government's achievements which symbolize the end of postwar politics. Conversely, however, the fact is that the political reform measures were approved after twists and turns weakened the centripetal force that had united the Hosokawa administration. This brought the divided opinions--which existed within the coalition government over fundamental policies such as tax reform and other important tasks, including the realignment of the political world and the adoption of measures concerning general elections--to the attention of the public. Disputes over the concept of a national welfare tax, the formation of a new new party, and other issues weakened the foundation of the Hosokawa administration and became the causes of Hosokawa's resignation. The Possibility of Reorganizing the Coalition by Attaching Importance to Policies Because of the unexpected announcement of the prime minister's resignation, the government has to settle two issues in a hurry. First, the government has to start Diet deliberations on the 1994 budget and approve it as soon as possible. Although a tentative budget which is good for 50 days was approved, the approval of the 1994 budget, which contains economic measures, is a matter of urgency. Needless to say, Prime Minister Hosokawa should clarify the truth about the 100 billion yen loan and other matters that hampered Diet deliberations on the 1994 budget. But the LDP no longer needs to insist on linking these issues to budget discussions. The LDP bears the responsibility of immediately starting budget deliberations. Second, following Prime Minister Hosokawa's decision to step down, the coalition is faced with the task of selecting the next prime minister and his cabinet members. During the LDP's domination, which continued for many years, a prime minister (or LDP president) was selected in rotation from different LDP factions because that party had the majority of seats in the Diet. However, the next prime minister will be chosen from the coalition parties. Will the coalition parties be able to maintain the coalition government? Will they return power to the LDP? Will a new coalition group form the next administration by inviting the LDP to join it? Forming the framework of the next administration is a precondition which needs to be clarified prior to answering these questions. The Hosokawa administration was not necessarily able to meet the people's expectations when it was formed because the coalition parties did not share common views on important policies except for political reform. In this sense, the parties that will form the next cabinet need to have similar policies, characteristics, and political lines. It is wrong for the coalition parties to attempt to maintain the coalition government or for the LDP to aim to recapture political power merely for the sake of taking power. If they did that, the realignment of the political world will be nothing but an attempt to gain enough numbers or enough seats in the Diet. The formation of the next administration will have a major impact on the future of Japan. The situation should be settled by attaching importance to policies and the opinions of the people. Who will become the next prime minister is a secondary issue. The task of political parties and political leaders is to clearly explain to the people what kind of policies they will promote. They also need to come up with an ideal combination of political parties to promote their policies as a coalition group. It is a good opportunity for political parties to get rid of the framework of the coalition versus the LDP and thereby to form a coalition government by attaching importance to policy issues.
