The (black and white) images are still being used only to fine-tune the programs, but the regions photographed are already recognizable. As far as the scientists responsible for PoSat-1 are concerned, the photographs illustrating this page are not even worth publishing. They are images obtained during the process of fine-tuning the two video cameras carried on the Portuguese satellite, and they are still a long way from providing the quality that it will be possible to achieve within a few weeks. But they do provide at least a sample of the capabilities of the instruments carried by the Portuguese satellite--even though it has not been possible so far to obtain the images of Portuguese territory that everyone is waiting for. "We have not yet managed to obtain any image of Portugal because of the poor weather conditions," we were told by Miguel Leitmann of the National Institute of Engineering and Industrial Technology (INETI). "Every time we have used the cameras over Portugal, the only thing we have picked up is clouds." But the difficulties inherent in obtaining images by satellite are far from being just a matter of atmospheric conditions. In fact, to obtain a good image with the two video cameras on PoSat--they are used not to film pictures but to obtain photographs--it is necessary above all to calibrate them to adapt them to the features of the desired image and thus obtain the maximum amount of information. Like commercial video cameras, the two on-board cameras--a wide-angle camera and one with a narrow angle--have electronic sensors to capture light. And it is the signals picked up by those sensors which, after being processed by the on-board computers, give rise to the images shown above. But just as a photographer has to first choose which film speed he will use, so it is also necessary in this case to adjust the kind of processing that is being used in order to obtain the best possible contrast. That is one of the jobs to which the PoSat team has been devoting itself. That calibration process is, however, relatively slow because it depends on the type of image captured: The way the camera is adjusted to obtain an image of the green Amazon Region is completely different from that used to photograph the white Antarctic or that used to photograph the sea. And again, the process can be compared point by point to what a photographer does to take a photograph (choice of film and choice of filters, shutter speed, and lens aperture), the only difference being that in the case of satellites, it is all done after the fact by a computer program that manipulates the data captured by the cameras. To be sure that the image processing programs they are using are the most appropriate, the members of the PoSat team have been trying at the moment to obtain images whose optical characteristics are well known (sea, ice, forest, and desert) so that they can use those images to calibrate the cameras--like natural "sighting instruments." And only when all that is done do they expect to obtain images of good enough quality for use in managing natural resources or studying the dispersion of pollutants. Another difficulty still being posed by PoSat is its movement. At the present time, the satellite is still swinging like a pendulum and covering an angle of about 9 degrees, and it is moving in a rotating motion. This means that it is still impossible--for the time being--to know exactly where the satellite is pointing, with the result that arduous searching in atlases is required to locate precisely the areas that were photographed. The fact is that because of the way PoSat-1 currently moves, the center of the images it captures may be anywhere within a circle having a 120-km diameter. If we add to that the fact that the camera with the narrowest angle covers an area measuring 160 km square (the wide angle covers almost an entire continent), it is easy to see the difficulty of determining location. In the images we show here, the difficulty of determining location is increased by the fact that the regions photographed are distorted in relation to the image we are accustomed to seeing on maps. The reason is that many of the images were captured while the satellite was "looking to the side." But all those difficulties are expected to diminish when the satellite starts using two of its position-finding and attitude-indicating systems: the GPS [Global Positioning System] receiver (which makes it possible to determine PoSat-1's position relative to a system of satellites going by the name of Global Positioning System) and the star sensor (which will make it possible to determine the direction the satellite is facing). When that happens, it will be possible to order the satellite to take a picture while pointing at a given site instead of doing so, as now, by determining which region of the sky the satellite is in.
