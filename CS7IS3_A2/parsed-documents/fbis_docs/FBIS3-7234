Depending on how North Korea behaves, the UNSC may discuss how to deal with the DPRK, with the imposition of economic sanctions being a possibility. It will not do the DPRK and the international community any good if this problem deteriorates any further. We repeat our call on North Korea to contemplate the situation coolheadedly and realistically. During the recent IAEA inspection tour, North Korea obstructed the inspection of a number of its nuclear facilities which are suspected of being involved in developing nuclear weapons. The IAEA objected to this and demanded that the DPRK accept inspections immediately. North Korea refused, and thus, IAEA decided to bring the issue to the UNSC. The UNSC is expected to adopt a resolution demanding the acceptance of nuclear inspections, and there is a strong possibility that economic sanctions may also be considered. In response, North Korea objected strongly to these moves, and it has threatened to withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This is the second time that it has made such a threat, and this is the second time that the UNSC has taken up this question. The international community has been at the mercy of North Korea. As Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told Premier Li Peng during his visit to the PRC, "the international community" has reached the limit of "its patience." The international community is still forced to treat the DPRK with discretion because it is concerned about the military action that the Kim Il-song regime might take. At the stalled working-level meeting on the exchange of envoys between North and South Korea, the North even made remarks about the possibility of war. On the other hand, there is also a sense of urgency because the issue has to do with nuclear "deadly weapons," and it might be too late if something is not done right away. However, it is not advisable for the international community to be twisted around the DPRK's finger and to panic every time it does something. If this happens again and again, there is the danger that the DPRK will always lead the international community by the nose. It might be necessary to take a more detached attitude. The United States has decided to deploy Patriot antimissile missiles in South Korea. It is also considering resuming joint military exercises with the ROK. These are obviously deterrent measures to stop the North from making a wrong move. We also hope that the channels for a solution through negotiations will be kept open. If a UNSC resolution and economic sanctions come to pass, North Korea's reaction will be even more defiant. However, the DPRK is already very isolated, and its economy is in very serious trouble. There is no need to rush even if economic sanctions are to be imposed. China's leaders are not eager to take tough measures against North Korea. They seem to believe that progress through negotiations is still possible. If so, we hope that China will exercise its influence to bring about tangible results.
