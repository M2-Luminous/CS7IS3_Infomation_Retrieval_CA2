This is because many think it is difficult for the Japanese Government to realize its plan, launched at a meeting of economic ministers over the weekend, to reduce Japan's current accounts surplus as a measure to bring down the value of the yen. Behind this speculation also lies the fact that dollar-selling pressure continues in foreign exchange markets due to apprehensions about a possible drop in U.S. bonds, stock prices, and the value of the dollar (a triple drop). Although Japanese and U.S. monetary authorities are prepared to cooperate in halting any further appreciation of the yen and depreciation of the dollar, some people point out that the United States is reluctant to reduce the yen's value. Thus, there is growing speculation that the yen will continue to strengthen. On 2 May, the Bank of Japan [BOJ] intervened off and on in the Tokyo foreign exchange market through dollar-buying and yen-selling, but the exchange rate remained on the level of 101 yen to the dollar. The fact that the yen dipped only to the 101-yen level (closing rate) despite last week's dollar-buying and yen-selling intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve indicates the strength of the markets' yen-buying pressure. Behind the recent surge of the yen lies Japan's huge current account surplus totaling about $130 billion. While some Japanese companies are boosting their exports to the United States, a drastic increase in Japan's imports is unlikely due to the flagging economy. To reduce the current account surplus, it is imperative for Japan to promote deregulation and increase imports by implementing economy-boosting measures. However, many dealers think "it is difficult for the minority Hata government to launch a full-scale pump-priming package, including tax reduction measures," (according to the Long-Term Credit Bank). The BOJ notes: "Since the government has said it will take steps to cut the current accounts surplus, we expect it to work out effective measures." But at the same time, it admits that if Japan fails to meet U.S. expectations, "this will disappoint Washington and incur the risk of further appreciation of the yen." Another cause of the recent surge in the yen is that many investors are moving their funds from the dollar. Because of persistent speculation that Washington will tighten its monetary policy, government bonds and stock prices have shown a falling tendency in the United States. Investors who hate this tendency are moving to shift their funds from the dollar to the yen and the mark. In actuality, the mark closed at 1.6549 against the dollar on the Tokyo foreign exchange market on 2 May, marking the first rise in its value in six and a half months. The dollar is depreciating against the yen and European currencies and this caused the recent sharp surge in the yen. For the time being, monetary authorities' intervention in foreign exchange markets will be the only measure to deal with the markets' yen-buying pressure. However, many people point out that this measure has only a limited effect. The value of the yen rose last year due to pressure from the U.S. Government in foreign exchange markets. This year, Japan's current accounts surplus and investors' distrust of the dollar are behind the recent surge in the yen, and Washington is now refraining from applying direct pressure for the yen's appreciation. Intervention in foreign exchange markets may help prevent the yen from further appreciating, but it will not be able to remove the causes of the yen's surge. Although the BOJ intervened in the market on 2 May, it did not indicate a determined attitude toward efforts to depreciate the yen. Thus, some people have doubts about Japan's efforts to prevent the yen from further appreciating in cooperation with the United States. Nonetheless, the government and the BOJ are worried that, if the exchange rate breaches the 100-yen-to-the-dollar level, private companies will immediately lose their business confidence. The BOJ will ask central banks in the United States and Europe to cooperate in preventing the yen from further appreciating.
