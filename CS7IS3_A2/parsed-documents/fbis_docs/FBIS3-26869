The dictionary, recently completed by the Shanghai Publishing House, includes technical terms, essays, theories and documents on subjects ranging from philosophy to education, politics to culture, economics to diplomacy, military affairs to technology, the Beijing Evening News said. It did not say whether the dictionary would include a definition of the "socialist market economy." Officials have as yet failed to come up with a meaningful explanation of the term, coined by Deng to describe his vision for China's future and enshrined last year in the constitution. The news of the dictionary comes as concern grows over Deng's failing health after he looked frail, emaciated and dazed last week in his first television appearance in a year. The newspaper gave no date for the publication of the dictionary.
