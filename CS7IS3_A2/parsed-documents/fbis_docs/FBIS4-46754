Kvyatkovskaya's article "Should We Appraise the Parliament in Tenge Value?" (ASIYA No. 17, 1994). It said the following: "There is no question that Mekhlis Suleymenov, an agrarian scientist of international renown, would have been elected to the chairmanship of the agrarian committee. His candidacy was proposed by the speaker, and he had support among both the `right' and the `left.' The most likely explanation for this decision is that the scientist found it impossible to give up completely his scientific plans and goals." This implies that I was offered the post of agrarian committee chairman but refused. I would not want the public to see my actions in this light. Therefore, I will discuss it in more detail. I arrived in Almaty on the evening of 18 April, that is, the night before the first session. In the morning I was told that agrarian deputies had already held a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister S.V. Kulagin. Among other things, the question of a candidate for the post of committee chairman was discussed. Only one name was mentioned--that of the former chairman, Yu.M. Ilyashenko, who had been elected by the president's list in Akmolinsk Oblast. Nobody mentioned my name. On the first day of the Supreme Council's work the agrarian deputies held their own meeting and discussed the candidacies of possible contenders for the post of committee chairman. Among the nominated were Yu.M. Ilyashenko; A.K. Yengaliyev, deputy head of the West Kazakhstan administration; and K.A. Aubakirov, deputy head of Zhambylsk administration. Nobody mentioned my name. Therefore, I suggested myself through self-nomination. When various deputy groups began to discuss candidates for committee chairmen, I was approached several times. Deputy N. offered the following: "We would like to ask you not to compete for the agrarian committee. We cannot `take' all the committees--we have to give three or four to Russians. We have looked it over several times and decided that the agrarian committee should go to a Russian--Yu.M. Ilyashenko. You, on the other hand, we see as chairman of the science and education committee." Then I was approached by Deputy Sh., who advised me: "Why do you need the agrarian committee? Your place is at the helm of the international relations committee. They will not find a better candidate!" Then the agrarians came into the room and said: "Do not go to other committees under any circumstances; your place is at the helm of the agrarian committee!" I also learned that the speaker also was inclined to see me in precisely this committee. Therefore, when I was nominated for the chairmanship of the international relations committee, I declined the nomination on the grounds that I would run for the agrarian committee. It was a surprise to me that I was nominated for this post by Supreme Soviet Chairman A. Kekilbayev himself. Yu.M. Ilyashenko and K.A. Aubakirov were immediately nominated as alternative candidates. In the course of the discussion neither the "right" nor the "left" supported me. At the same time, support for my rivals was as thick as the wall. I was especially upset by two remarks. Deputy F. Kozlov, who before this actively supported the candidacy of K. Nagmanov for chairmanship of the industrial committee by saying: "I am a Russian, but I urge you to vote for a Kazakh!" this time said: "We have already elected the chairmen of seven committees, and they are not Russians! Let us finally heed the appeal of the president, who asked us to take into account, among other things, the ethnic balance in electing the Supreme Council leadership!" Deputy Sh. Murtaza expressed the opinion of a considerable number of deputies by saying that he sees at the head of this committee not a scientist but rather a person who grew up in a Kazakh village and knows all its troubles. Naturally I, with my "international renown," good English, and so-so Kazakh, did not fit the description. After these comments I withdrew my nomination, saying that given such a heavy discussion I did not consider it possible to continue to compete. Later I was also nominated to the leadership of the science and education committee, where U.A. Dzholdasbekov was a clear favorite. So I had to give up my claim there as well. As a result I found myself without a portfolio, which I do not regret. I was told that I could still be elected because some deputies say one thing but vote differently. But I decided not to test fate. Now, though, I sit in an office that is four times smaller than my director's office. On the other hand, there are three of us in it. So I do not get bored.
