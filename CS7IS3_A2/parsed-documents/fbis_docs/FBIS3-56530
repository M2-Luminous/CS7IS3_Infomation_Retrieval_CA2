Petkevicius was supported by all seven committee members present at the meeting. Five other committee members, all representatives of the rightist opposition, were not present. The new chairman said he will resign immediately if work does not go smooth in the new post. Petkevicius said his primary aim is to deal with the critical situation in the armed forces. 82 deaths were reported in the Voluntary State Defense Service over the past two years. Legal action in the state defense system was taken 162 times for the loss of weapons, assaults and other criminal offenses. Petkevicius was elected in accordance with the parliament's resolution saying that the post would belong to the ruling LDDP faction. But neither Petkevicius, not three other members of the committee, have registered themselves on the LDDP faction after the new faction registration rules came into effect. Petkevicius was the acting chairman of the committee for several months after the resignation of MP Gediminas Kirkilas. [passage omitted]
