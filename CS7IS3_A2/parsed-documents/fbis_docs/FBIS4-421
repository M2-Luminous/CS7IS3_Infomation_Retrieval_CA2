Many people have died and continue to die after this small group decided to liquidate the Tutsis and everyone else who does not agree with the ideas of the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development and the Coalition for the Defense of the Republic. The small group of killers, as usual, believed that they would go on killing innocent people while citizens just stood by. The killers then came to realize that the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], some government troops, and other Rwandans who do not want their country [word indistinct] had decided to resist. Some members of the small group among the Presidential Guard, Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi [pro-Habyarimana militias] have started fleeing after realizing that Rwandans were going to [words indistinct]. They are fleeing through Butare and Cyangugu. Citizens, especially in Butare and Cyangugu areas and elsewhere [word indistinct], must unite to protect yourselves and fight the killers. The RPF combatants are on the outskirts of Kigali town and are determined to rout the small group. That should be the aim of all citizens. We again thank government troops who have dissociated themselves from the Presidential Guards, thereby (?making it easier) to fight the latter. We also thank all Rwandans who have now identified their country's enemy and are joining hands with the RPF in Rwanda. We call on you to persevere on this course and hope that those who have not yet joined will do so soon. The RPF is with you. Continue to help one another to protect our country.
