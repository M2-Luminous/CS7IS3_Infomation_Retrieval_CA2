There is a complicity, we have seen this. We feel frustrated, but we are not for this reason going to commit suicide." Faustin Twagiramungu (a Hutu by race), the prime minister-designate as stipulated in the Arusha accords (footnote) (peace agreement signed in August 1993 at Arusha in Tanzania which provided for a transition period until general elections) and seen as a moderate, lacked his full verve as he waited yesterday morning in his New York hotel room for the Security Council decision on France's plans to send a humanitarian intervention force to Rwanda. "UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali told me on Monday [20 June] that, even if it were the devil, he would send him to Rwanda to save people from the situation prevailing right now. As France is presenting itself while no other Western capital seems ready to get involved, it appears that France will go to Rwanda." Just like the supporters of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), Faustin Twagiramungu and his party, the Democratic Republic Movement, are against the sending of a French force to Rwanda, without however approving the use of force against French Blue Helmets sent to his country. He has been repeating this position since his visit to Montreal on Sunday. The fact is that he suspects Paris of having a hidden plan which seeks to support the Rwandan military. "These soldiers and the presidential guard have been trained by France," he said. "They have made life difficult for us since the beginning of April and are massacring us. Personally, I cannot forget that I only just escaped death. The presidential guard came knocking at my door to assassinate me, but I had been warned. All my colleagues have been killed. I must fight everything which could put these soldiers in a position of force." The prime minister-designate's idea was to convince Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, whom he was due to meet this week, to take the initiative instead of France. Convinced that he had lost his battle against the Security Council, however, he dropped the idea. "Why is France suddenly interested in Rwanda, after three months of fighting? It would be much better if countries like Canada, the Netherlands, or Italy, which have not been caught up in these neocolonialist stories, were to become involved. France does not inspire confidence. It could have intervened, with international consent, from the start. It could have saved lives. But, now, its image is tarnished and it wants to show the rest of the world that it is not the bad guy." In addition to these reasons, which he advances to justify his opposition to the deployment of French soldiers in Rwanda, Faustin Twagiramungu complains that France did not consult him: "Of course, we would have liked to have been consulted. We would have asked for explanations. But we learned that the French soldiers are going to leave, and that they are already stationed somewhere in Zaire. This is a little abnormal. We should have been informed... But if the French go there to halt the massacres as they say, by attempting to bring to heel the soldiers who are doing the killing and trying to gain control of the presidential guard which they themselves trained, that would finally be a positive step. Obviously, this is a high-risk operation. But for us, the important thing is that UNAMIR-2 [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] be put into place, as well as the democratic institutions provided for in the Arusha accords.
