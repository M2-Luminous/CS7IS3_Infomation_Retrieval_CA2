[passage omitted] "The leadership has supported in a way the ethical aspect of the call," said Baudys, adding that the dismissal of a minister should be preceded by the talks of the coalition parties about this move. The ethical aspect of his appeal should not be suppressed by formal shortcomings, he said. The KDU-CSL meeting was not attended by Josef Lux, the party chairman. On Monday [21 February] the Executive Council of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS, the largest coalition party), recommended to Premier Vaclav Klaus that he take strict measures, perhaps even Baudys's dismissal.
