FR941128-2-00176 FR941128-2-00092 Federal Highway Administration Environmental Impact Statement; Berkeley and Jefferson Counties, West Virginia AGENCY: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. ACTION: Revised notice of intent. SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement being prepared for the proposed highway project in Berkeley and Jefferson Counties, West Virginia, has revised project limits. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bobby W. Blackmon, Acting Division Administrator, Federal Highway Administration, 550 Eagan Street, Suite 300, Charleston, West Virginia 25301, Telephone: (304) 347&hyph;5929, or Ben L. Hark, Environmental Section Chief, Roadway Design Division, West Virginia Department of Transportation, 1900 Kanawha Boulevard East, Building 5, room A&hyph;830, Capitol Complex, Charleston, West Virginia 25305&hyph;0430, Telephone: (304) 558&hyph;3236. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the West Virginia Department of Highways (WVDOH), will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve West Virginia Route 9 (WV 9) between Charles Town and Martinsburg. The improvement as previously proposed would provide a four-lane controlled access roadway for WV 9 from the existing Charles Town Bypass to just east of South Queen Street in Martinsburg. The improvement as currently proposed reduces the project limit by 0.92 mile on the eastern terminus so that a four-lane controlled access roadway would be provided from the existing Charles Town Bypass to Berkeley County Route 9/36 (Grapevine Road). This 0.92 mile section between South Queen Street and Grapevine Road will be considered as a separate project in order to address current unacceptable access and safety problems associated with that section. Improvements to the WV 9 corridor between Charles Town and Martinsburg are considered to adequately provide for a safe and efficient transportation system to serve the existing and future transportation needs of the area and to sustain and encourage local and regional economic development. Alternatives under consideration for the environmental impact statement include (1) No Build; (2) widening portions of the existing two-lane highway to four lanes; and (3) constructing a four-lane, controlled access highway along new alignment. Informational public meetings were held February 18, 1992 in Charles Town and February 19, 1992 in Martinsburg to present preliminary information and solicit questions, comments and concerns. The previous Notice of Intent appeared in the Federal Register June 1, 1992. The scoping meeting was held October 21, 1992 with participants from federal, state, and local agencies in attendance. A public workshop was held November 3, 1993 and a public meeting on December 21, 1993, both in Kearneysville to present updated information and continue the public involvement process. The pre-draft EIS was circulated to federal, state, and county agencies January 1994. The draft EIS is not yet available for public circulation. A section 106/public meeting was held June 29, 1994 in Martinsburg to present current information and solicit additional information regarding history and archaeology in the area. Additional meetings and hearings will be scheduled when a draft EIS is available for circulation. Notice will be given of the time and place of the meetings and hearings. A public hearing for the 0.92 mile section as a separate project was held August 11, 1994. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided.
