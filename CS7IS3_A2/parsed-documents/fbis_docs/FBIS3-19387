The announcement eased concern of some NATO officials who had said Moscow was laying down conditions for joining the program for closer contacts between the armies of the former Warsaw Pact group and Western forces. Russia's decision was announced to ambassadors of the 16-country North Atlantic Treaty Organization at a regular meeting, the sources said, although no date for Moscow's entry was set. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will travel to Brussels to sign Moscow up, the sources said. But even as the sources spoke of military cooperation between NATO and its former arch-enemy, Russia's defense minister insisted in Moscow that Russia was still a power to be reckoned with and should not be treated just like any other partner in the plan. The U.S.-sponsored initiative offers former Warsaw Pact countries military cooperation in training, maneuvers and planning as a first step toward full membership at some unspecified point in the future. It was devised as a way to help provide the greater security sought by these countries and at the same time avoid antagonizing the Russian military at a time of growing nationalism and volatility in Russia. The program was launched in January. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told reporters Wednesday in Moscow that Russia welcomed cooperation but not integration with NATO and that it would join the Partnership "within its own parameters." In order to participate, he said, "other countries in East Europe will have to change their armament and the way they train their troops. Russia is a huge country with its own military technology and its own armament, and cannot be integrated into NATO. It can only cooperate." So far 12 former Soviet republics and other former East Bloc states have joined the Partnership. The latest is Moldova, which joined Wednesday. NATO officials have been concerned in recent weeks by what they said were conditions set by Moscow for taking part. The officials said Moscow had been told the plan could not be modified just to satisfy Russia, but that dialogue with the Russians was possible in recognition of the country's military importance. Under the plan, participants are entitled to political discussions with NATO only when they come under serious threat. Grachev has said NATO -- obliged by its charter to defend any member in danger -- should not decide on its own on military engagement in a hot-spot but rather consult with Russia first.
