Mallikarjun said here at a conference of the Indian naval officers. Supplies will be realized in accordance with contracts signed during the visits last month by the Indian military delegation to Russia and Ukraine. The minister emphasised that shortages of spare parts creates serious problems in maintaining high level combat readiness of all kinds of armed forces of India. They are crucial for the air force, which is equipped with "MiG-29" fighters, and tank troops, mainly armed with "T-72" tanks. At the same time, Mallikarjun recalled that the spare part problem for the armed forces might be eventually resolved only by increasing their production in Indian defence enterprises. The Indian Government has decided to earmark 230 billion rupees for its requirements this year. A considerable part of this money will be used to produce military equipment and spare parts for it at state enterprises of the country.
