The possibility that, in a few days, the bacteria may ``swim'' downstream to the area near Moscow has not been ruled out. Laboratory studies of water samples are now being conducted. The analysis results will be known today. For now, medical personnel are puzzling over the riddle of how the bacteria got into the Protva. If it came from the ``closed'' institutes that were long involved in developing biological and chemical weaponry on the river's shore, it is entirely possible that the study bacteria are causative agents of a disease even more frightening than mortally dangerous cholera.
