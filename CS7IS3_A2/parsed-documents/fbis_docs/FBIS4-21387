But It Is an Expensive Business"] [Text] The parliamentary hearings in the State Duma Thursday [24 March] showed how complex the situation is in connection with Russia's international commitments in the sphere of the destruction of chemical weapons (CW). Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Yuriy Tarasevich stressed that the military department expects the deputies to provide legislative support in such a difficult and expensive business as the destruction of chemical weapons. According to the military, the blueprint for CW destruction needs to be legislatively formalized. A draft blueprint will be presented to the State Duma in mid-April. We also need laws on CW destruction and on the social protection of the population in areas where these weapons are being destroyed. Funding for all measures connected with preparations for the actual recovery of toxic substances and munitions is extremely uneven and inadequate. Getting rid of Russian chemical weapons will cost two trillion rubles [R] in 1993 prices. Meanwhile, some R10.4 billion are supposed to be allocated for this purpose in the current year. But we all know full well how funds are being allocated this year. The CW disarmament program is no exception. There was a note of anxiety in what Maj. Gen. Yuriy Tarasevich said. A number of arsenals established back in the fifties in Udmurtia and Saratov Oblast are in need of a complete overhaul. In existing conditions such an overhaul is a very difficult and dangerous business. One would like this to be not an exlusively military headache. Let us hope the hearings go some way toward this. The military-political aspects of Russia's joining the Convention on the Destruction of Chemical Weapons were also examined during the hearings. The inevitable question arose: Might it not happen that our country will abandon this type of weapon, while other countries, including those bordering on Russia, will remain "chemically" armed and, moreover, will reach a new level as a result of scientific developments? In general terms the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry spokesmen assured those present that in this case there are reliable control mechanisms in place and the world community provides certain guarantees. But the detailed reply to this question obviously had to wait until the hearings resumed behind closed doors. We would point out that the Convention on Chemical Weapons was signed in Paris in 1993. So far it has been signed by 156 states. But it has been ratified by only four: Sweden, Mauritius, the Seychelles, and Fiji. Whether Russia is to become the fifth depends on how convincing the Foreign and Defense Ministries' pro-ratification arguments are in the eyes of the parliamentarians. All I would say is that, in the event of ratification, we will be able to count on financial assistance from Western countries and the United States.
