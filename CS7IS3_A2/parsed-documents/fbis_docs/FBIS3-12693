In a statement issued by Bashir al-Rabiti, head of the Libyan National Organization, the opposition held the Revolutionary Committees responsible for blowing up the plane with a view to killing three people who had important information about the Lockerbie explosion. The statement quoted "eyewitnesses" as saying that elements from the Revolutionary Committees "arrived one hour before the plane took off from Baninah airport and issued stern orders to airport security officials not to search the elements that had entered the plane with three suitcases [haqa'ib] containing explosives." The statement added that "the information available indicates that the three targeted people tried first to travel via the seaport of Benghazi but were prevented from doing so, and their movements were put under observation for fear of their releasing information about Lockerbie. Then it was decided to liquidate them." The statement pointed out that Interior Minister Ibrahim al-Bakkar, who ordered the formation of a committee to investigate the explosion of the plane and begin its work after the Arab interior ministers' conference, met his death [laqiya hatfuh] while on his way back from the conference in Tunis.
