Salinas will fly to Havana and then continue on to Cartagena de Indias to attend the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. In his request to the National Congress, the Mexican president says Mexico and Cuba maintain respectful diplomatic relations. He highlights the fact that the island is part of Mexico's border in the Caribbean. Salinas also states that the ties between Mexico and Cuba have, throughout history and within the context of their respectful bilateral relationship, been marked by warm ties between the two peoples and offered a gateway for international cooperation. This has come to symbolize the importance of such contacts. In his request, Salinas also points out that the profound and fruitful political dialogue between Cuba and Mexico, at the highest levels, has opened the way for all of Mexico's presidents since 1975 to visit the island during their presidential term. He recalls that Cuban President Fidel Castro has also visited Mexico on three occasions during the current administration (for the Salinas de Gortari inauguration in 1988, then to attend the meeting of the Group of Three [G-3] held on Cozumel Island in 1993, and to participate in the First Ibero-American Summit in Guadalajara, also in 1993). The request concludes that the presence of the Mexican head of state in Cuba will serve to promote an even closer bilateral relationship, examine the countries' joint agenda, and explore new ways of diversifying and strengthening their ties. This visit to Cuba was previously scheduled for last January, but was postponed due to the armed conflict that broke out in the southern State of Chiapas. Regarding the Ibero-American Summit, Salinas states in his request that this type of meeting has proven its value as a political forum at the highest level and as an instrument to promote agreement in fields such as education, science, culture, Indian development, international law, and social and economic development. He stated that among the Mexican president's reasons for going to Cartagena de Indias is that the G-3 nations (Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela) planned to sign the Economic Complementary Agreement during their stay. The first meeting of the presidents of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal took place in the Mexican city of Guadalajara in 1991. It was followed by similar meetings in Madrid, Spain in 1992, and Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, in 1993. Salinas will end his six-year term in office in December of this year after the federal election on August 21.
