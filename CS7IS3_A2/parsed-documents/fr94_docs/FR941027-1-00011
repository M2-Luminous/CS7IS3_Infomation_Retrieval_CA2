This rule exempts EOIR from the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986's general prohibition of discrimination based on citizenship status and supplements Executive Order 11935 which requires United States citizenship for almost all Federal employees in the competitive service. dates: Written comments must be received on or before November 28, 1994. addresses: Please submit written comments in triplicate to Gerald S. Hurwitz, Counsel to the Director, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Suite 2400, 5107 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, Virginia 22041. for further information contact: Gerald S. Hurwitz, Counsel to the Director, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Suite 2400, 5107 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, Virginia 22041, Telephone: (703) 305&hyph;0470. supplementary information: This proposed rule authorizes EOIR to require its employees and volunteers to be citizens of the United States of America. Because the central task of this Agency is adjudicating immigration-related cases, Agency employees and volunteers often have access to sensitive information and handle complex and sensitive immigration issues. It is imperative that individuals who work at EOIR, either as employees or volunteers, demonstrate their allegiance to the United States by being able to document that they are United States citizens. Pursuant to E.O. 11935, 41 FR 37301 (1976), the Executive Branch requires United States citizenship for employees hired in the competitive service. This proposed rule extends the citizenship requirement to all EOIR employees and volunteers. The rule exempts EOIR from the prohibition of discrimination based on citizenship status, pursuant to the procedures established by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(2)(C). Additionally, this proposed rule allows the Agency to exercise its discretion to hire non-citizens when necessary to accomplish the Agency's mission. For example, this rule would permit the Director of the Agency to authorize hiring an interpreter skilled in the English language and an unusual foreign language when a United States citizen interpreter is not available. Insertion of this rule requires a slight reorganization of 8 CFR part 3. This rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b). This rule has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with E.O. 12866 section 1(b), Principles of Regulation. The Attorney General has determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under E.O. 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and accordingly this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with E.O. 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implication to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
