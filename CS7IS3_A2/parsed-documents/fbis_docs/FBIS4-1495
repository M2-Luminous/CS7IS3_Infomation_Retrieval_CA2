[Mandela] There is a view that there has been massive sabotage, not by the independent election commission, but in the process of distribution. Because the striking feature is that in all white, (?Indian), and colored areas there has been no problems. But the failure to deliver the ballot papers only took place in the [word indistinct) to African areas. Some of the ballot papers were found locked up in certain townships, in warehouses in certain townships. And the briefing I'm getting is that there has been some massive sabotage. Nevertheless we are now dealing with that question. Our command center, acting in collaboration with the independent elections commission, is addressing this matter. I am confident that we are going to resolve them. I have been in touch with President De Klerk yesterday and by telephone, and at half past two we met and discussed this matter. I'm convinced that we are going to resolve this matter. [Snow] He has apparently been putting planes and helicopters at your disposal, or at the disposal of the election commission to try and get the ballots out, and they've printed another 10 million, but you called it massive sabotage. By whom? [Mandela] No, he is responding to what we have discovered. At the present moment the matter is under investigation, and it would be improper for us to attach blame to any particular individual organization without a proper investigation. What is clear is that ballot papers have reached the areas where whites, coloreds, and Indians are to vote. And the problem has happened almost exclusively at the African areas. [Snow] Are we in time then to have a free and fair election in which everybody in the country has equal chance to vote? [Mandela] Well, the way in which these problems have been addressed will ensure that the end of the day, free and fair elections have been conducted. I am not alarmed by the problems which have arisen. And the point is that when these problems arise, there are men and women from both sides of the color line, who are prepared to address them honestly, frankly, and effectively. And that is the machinery that we've now put into operation. [Snow] Could I then look beyond the electoral process, to the building of a government of national unity, which is after all what all this is about. Can you have a full government of national unity which does not include Chief Buthelezi and Inkatha -- whether they get five percent or not? [Mandela] We are not thinking in terms of individuals. We think in terms of the process. We would like an inclusive process where all parties, political parties are involved. But whether we are going to have a government of national unity or not, depends on whether a political party gets five percent or more of the total votes cast in an election. If it does he [as heard] will be in the government of national unity. If he does not, he does not, he will not be. What is important is that we have made astounding progress in his absence already, we have had the political organizations [word indistinct], the state of emergency which had lasted for several years -- lifted, an environment of free political activity introduced, hundreds of political prisoners, some of whom were serving long sentences, were released, and more than 15,000 political exiles have returned to the country. But on top of that, we have had a breakthrough which have been sensational: We have established the Transitional Executive Council, which has assumed certain powers of government. We have adopted a constitution, which although it is fraught, because it is a compromise constitution, meeting the demands and expectations of no less than 26 different political parties, and pulling in different directions, we have been able nevertheless, to agree on a constitution which does mirror the hopes and aspirations of the majority of the people of South Africa. And what is more, we have now this day, yesterday, and the day before yesterday. [sentence as heard] That's a terrific achievement. And as many of these achievements have been made in spite of the obstructionist attitude of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. And therefore I have not the slightest hesitation that the government of national unity will be established. It will work very effectively and the plans to better the life of our people that were developed will be put into practice. [Snow] Now a lot of this achievement has been dependent upon the relationship between you and Mr. De Klerk. When we spoke to him the other day he said: Well, I have a very good formal relationship with Mr. Mandela. I call him Mr. Mandela, and he calls me Mr. State President. If you're going to go forward from that point, will that relationship have to sustain -- and if anything, even get closer -- or do you see the work already done? [Mandela] Well, my relations firstly. I don't think it is correct to think of the future in terms of the contribution of just two individuals. Although individuals are important, the changes in this country have not been brought by a single individual. It is the men and women of South Africa, from all population groups, who have exerted tremendous pressure, who came out into the streets, held strikes, boycotts, who were harassed and persecuted by the racist police of the apartheid regime, who were thrown into jail, who were shot and killed -- with the support of the international community, which has been absolutely massive, and tremendous. It is that pressure that has made the apostles of apartheid to collapse, to go down on their knees, and to bring about changes. But within that background, individuals have played a role. You must put, therefore, the contribution of any individual against that background. [Snow] That's what I wanted to pick you up on, this question of the pressure that everybody has exerted, but also the fact that apartheid committed so many crimes, or so many crimes were committed in the name of apartheid. What should happen to people who committed those crimes? [Mandela] I have been saying throughout: Let bygones by bygones. Let what has happened pass as something unfortunate but which we must forget. Insofar as people who committed political and related offenses before the 8th of October 1990, we are saying that each and everyone of them should make a full disclosure of the crime that he committed -- not because we want to put them on trial, but because an indemnity should be an individual act. We wanted to indemnify a particular individual for a specific offense that he has committed. This is what was done to the opponents of apartheid. We now feel this should be done to those people who committed those offenses in defense of apartheid. Where there will certainly be no indemnity is in regard to people who are committing offenses now. Those will not be covered by indemnity. We are taking this line because these offenses were committed mainly by the security forces. We depend on the loyalty of the security forces in this transformation, and in the government of national unity. It is therefore necessary that we move to this new dispensation. The South African Defense Force, and the South African police, the civil service must be free to serve the new government. They cannot do so if there is a spirit of insecurity, if their morale is low, and it is for this reason that I have repeatedly said let bygones be bygones. And if, during this election, I have warned both my own members of the organization, as well as other political organizations, I've said: You must remember that your opponents now are going to be your partners in future. We are going to work together, let us not open now wounds which will be difficult to heal, when we now try to work together in the government of national unity. [Snow] Now, when you were young, you led the ANC Youth League. And you were to some extent frustrated by the lack of punch at the top -- you didn't feel that the leadership of the ANC was radical enough. Do you think there's a danger that the young generation now is more impatient for more radical change than you can deliver. Do you feel almost, perhaps, things are being repeated? [Mandela] No. I have great confidence in our youth. If you consider that they are living at a stage, at an age, in an (?era) where they see their white counterparts enjoying rights, opportunities, privileges, which are denied to them, and when they see their counterparts, black counterparts in the neighboring states enjoying the same rights that are enjoyed by whites here, their impatience is perfectly understandable. But when we feel that they're too radical as to frighten the minorities in this country, we speak to them. And in every case they have been loyal, they have followed orders. That is the most encouraging issue. This is the striking characteristics of the loyalty of our youth. [Snow] One last question: When you were in prison, did you know you would become president? Did you believe you would become president? And did you, in a way, plot out within your mind many of the thoughts you would want to express given that chance? [Mandela] No. I never thought so. Not that I excluded the possibility, but I never thought in terms of the role of an individual. We had a very capable leadership and [word indistinct] Oliver Tambo, who was my colleague at the university, when we formed the youth league together. We then formed a league of partnership together and then when we were forced to dissolve our league of partnership he went abroad. He brought the organization into a level which it had never occupied before, and he earned the respect of the entire world. Now I thought of a leadership like that, not from the point of view of an individual, and least of all of myself. I thought that we would fight, would continue the struggle for liberation under his leadership and acting as part of a collective, as part of a team, and that is what we focus upon. The team is more important than the individual. Therefore, there was little room for thinking of the role that an individual could play. And I had complete confidence in Oliver Tambo that he would be able to lead the country and the organization to liberation.
