Gerd Haller, German secretary of state for finance, said at the World Economic Forum here that the Bundesbank's action depends on the evolution of Germany's monetary supply and wage negotiations. "The Bundesbank is prepared to bring down short-term interest rates, but it depends on other factors," Haller said. He said that although long-term rates are at an historic low, "there is still some room for long-term interest rates to go down." Germany is under pressure from its European partners to lower its interest rates, seen as a source of currency instability in and a damper on efforts to stimulate economic growth on the continent. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, whose country jumped from the European Community currency grid in September of 1992, said the European Community needs monetary stability to make its single market work. "What we need in the European Community is exchange-rate stability if we are to get the best out of the single market," he said. Clarke said the best means of assuring this is making efforts to bring the various economies closer, adding, "We need to make sure we coordinate what we are doing." "The challenge will be to keep, as we come out of the recession, the stability of exchange rates that we have at the moment," he said.
