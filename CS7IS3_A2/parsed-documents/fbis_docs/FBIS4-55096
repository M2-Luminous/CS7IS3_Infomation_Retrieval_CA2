He was speaking after today's meeting of cabinet ministers rejected a draft bill on national security presented by Defense Minister Antonin Baudys. The draft was drawn up in the radical post-revolutionary spirit and it aimed to completely overhaul the existing legislation, Klaus said. The ministers retained the existing law except for a few minor changes in the wording, concerning the threat to people's security and the extension of the powers of authorities. They agreed that no new bodies should be set up in the security sector. The bill concerned the deployment of the army for life-saving operations necessitated by natural disasters or nuclear power plant emergencies. Rules governing the deployment of emergency services including the army and fire and security services in the event of large-scale disasters, and rules governing the duties of individuals in case of national emergencies are at present scattered among several laws. The draft bill aimed to bring the matter under a single heading.
