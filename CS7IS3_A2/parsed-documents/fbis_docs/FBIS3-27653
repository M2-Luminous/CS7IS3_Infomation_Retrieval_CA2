He said: The door to negotiation has been closed by the British. Responsibility for the disruption of cooperation between China and Britain on Hong Kong's political system rests entirely on the British. A reporter asked: On 24 February, Legco passed the first-phase draft legislation on the 1994-95 election arrangements. The Hong Kong Government will next submit the second-phase draft legislation to Legco for discussion. What are your comments? Shen Guofang said: Last December, before the Chinese and the British had reached any agreement on district board election arrangements, the British side submitted the first-phase draft of legislation to the Hong Kong Legislative Council, thus directly causing the termination of the talks between China and Britain. Now, disregarding repeated dissuasion by China, and the aspirations of every social level in Hong Kong for a settlement of the question of the 1994-1995 election arrangements through negotiation, the British side has had the first-phase draft legislation on the 1994- 95 election arrangements passed by the Hong Kong Legco and has decided to submit the second-phase draft legislation to Legco for discussion. This fully shows that the British do not have the sincerity to solve the question through cooperation with the Chinese, and are bent on moving further on this erroneous path. Shen Guofang said: "The door to negotiation has been closed by the British. Responsibility for the disruption of cooperation between China and Britain on Hong Kong's political system rests entirely with the British. The Chinese side reiterates that, without an agreement between China and Britain, the framework of the three-tiered political system established through British Hong Kong authorities, legislation cannot last beyond 30 June 1997." Another reporter asked: The British side today published a white paper which discloses the detailed contents of last year's Sino- British talks. What are your comments on this? Shen Guofang said: An understanding not to disclose to the public the contents of the negotiations was reached between China and Britain before the talks began last year. Britain's unilateral publication of the contents constitutes a violation of the understanding reached between the two sides. The Chinese cannot but react in due course. Asked about the comments of Australian Foreign Minister Evans who, in a recent television interview in Australia, expressed strong support for Chris Patten's political package, Shen Guofang said the current issue between China and Britain on Hong Kong was not whether the territory should have democracy, but whether a commitment was to be honored. There had been a series of agreements and understandings between the two countries on the evolution of Hong Kong's political system. But the British were now trying to repudiate them and have their own way. This was absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese. He said: In the more than one hundred years of British rule there has been no democracy at all in Hong Kong. It is with ulterior motives that Britain is pushing Chris Patten's package in Hong Kong before it leaves. It is futile to defend the package. Shen Guofang emphasized: The maintenance of Hong Kong's social stability and economic prosperity is not only in the interests of China and Britain, but also of those countries that have economic interests in Hong Kong. The question of Hong Kong is a matter between China and Britain before 30 June 1997, and from 1 July 1997, it will be purely an internal affair of China. It is inappropriate to make irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong political affairs.
