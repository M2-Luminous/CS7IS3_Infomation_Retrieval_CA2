Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, delivered a report at the conference. He summarized last year's work and put forth this year's tasks. In 1993, in carrying out the municipal organizational work, we persisted in emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, conscientiously implementing all tasks set forth by the 14th party congress and the seventh municipal party congress, realized the municipal party committee's demand of comprehensively overpassing the work of last year, and achieved a series of breakthroughs. Leading cadres enhanced awareness in the study of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieved noticeable results in this aspect; the selection of young cadres was strengthened and the structure of leading bodies greatly improved; the contingent of reserve cadres was expanded and their management strengthened; and the exchange of cadres increased, the channels rose in number, and the scope expanded. We summarized a number of typical examples in building the grass-roots party organizations and consolidated a batch of backward party branches; selected "10 outstanding" communist party members and cultivated an image of communist party members of the new period; and began to conduct organizational reform in party and government organs, and achieved progress in experimenting with the public service system. The ideas for the municipal organizational work in 1994 are to take Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guidance, further emancipate the mind, act in connection with the party's central task, strengthen and improve party building, strive to make new breakthroughs in strengthening the building of leading bodies and grass-roots party organizations and expanding strength in reform of the cadre personnel system, and provide an organizational guarantee for acccelerating the development of the socialist market economy, fulfilling all reform and construction tasks of this year, and realizing the objective of becoming well-off three years ahead of schedule.
