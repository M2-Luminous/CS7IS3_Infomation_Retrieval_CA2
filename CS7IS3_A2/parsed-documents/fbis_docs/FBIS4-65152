Let's go to Francesco Pionati. [Pionati] Yes, the old guard has changed. The Ciampi executive has left office and has been replaced by the Berlusconi executive, which arrived here to hold the first meeting of the Council of Ministers. The meeting will be a short one and is needed to approve the choices of the new prime minister. These choices have already been made public; in other words, the appointments of the new deputy prime ministers -- Giuseppe Tatarella from the National Alliance and Roberto Maroni from the Northern League -- and the appointment of Gianni Letta to the post of under secretary to the Council of Ministers. Letta is already Berlusconi's right-hand man at Fininvest. A second Council of Ministers meeting may be held tomorrow. This will serve to approve the appointments of the new under secretaries, or the deputy ministers as they are now called. In the meantime, there have been further reactions to the Berlusconi government. Obviously the Freedom Alliance is extremely pleased, but the reaction of the opposition has been very scathing. This morning the Greens and La Rete [The Network] criticized the methods that led to the formation of the new government. They said the methods were the same as those used under the old political system. Now let's listen to the views of Gianfranco Fini, on behalf of the Freedom Alliance, and Luigi Berlinguer and Rosa Russo Jervolino from the opposition -- from the left and the center respectively. [Begin recording] [Fini] We are convinced that the formation of the Berlusconi government and the entry of five ministers from the National Alliance is an important landmark for Italy because it is the end of a democracy based on exclusion -- in other words a democracy based upon the ostracism of the parties with regard to the Right. The entry of the National Alliance in the government is the demonstration of the fact that today in Italy, as is the case throughout the rest of Europe and the West, the legitimization of the government is established by the free vote of the electorate. [Berlinguer] Poor Berlusconi, my heart bleeds for him because he had to find an agreement for the impossible. He had to accommodate the Cossiga and Craxi factions, the followers of Andreotti and De Lorenzo, the men from his company, and finally the Italian Social Movement, the so-called postfascists, who are not very post and instead very tarred with the brush of fascism. What we have is a sort of mishmash that could have been better formulated by a chemist. Some of the ministers do not have much experience. We will see what happens, but the government has not gotten off to a good start. [Jervolino] We from the Italian Popular Party are very concerned. We are worried at the way in which the government has been formed -- it has been a long drawn out carving up of ministries between the members of the Freedom Alliance. We are also concerned at the composition of the government and by the fact that sensitive posts have been given to people who do not have the necessary experience. We are also concerned by the presence of neofascists. We will wait to see what the government's program is, but already we believe that the composition of the government confirms our choice of going into opposition. [end recording]
