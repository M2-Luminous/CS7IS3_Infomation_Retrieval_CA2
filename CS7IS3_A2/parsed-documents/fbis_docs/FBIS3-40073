[Question] Director Yu, what kind of taxes are included in the so-called agricultural taxes? [Answer] Agricultural taxes generally refer to farming tax, special product tax, contract tax and farmland user tax which finance departments at every level of government are responsible for collecting. [passage omitted] [Question] Since it is a legitimate responsibility of peasants to pay agricultural taxes, is the burden of agricultural taxes in Liaoning considered to be heavy? [Answer] In taxation, China adheres to the principle of "collecting taxes based on set rates, and reducing or waiving taxes according to law." On this basis, the government has carried out a taxation policy of "collecting only taxes which constitute reasonable and stable burdens." For many years, the agricultural tax burden in Liaoning has been very light; take the farming tax and special product tax as examples, at present the Liaoning's agricultural tax is still calculated on the basis of production quantity set in 1961, and the average tax for the whole province is only 82 kilo per mu which is far below the actual production level; in 1992, the Liaoning's average taxes per mu are: 3.85 yuan for dry field, 11.3 yuan for paddy field, 20.64 yuan for vegetables field, and the actual tax burden is 3.3 percent, far below the nominal tax rate of 12.5 percent. This level of taxes is not only the lightest in historic terms, but also very much lower than the 12.2 percent actual tax level in the 1950-60s. The actual rate of special product tax in Liaoning is not even 4 percent, far below the 11 percent prescribed by government regulations as being a reasonable tax burden. [Question] Since the actual burden of the special product tax is very low, why has the State Council decided this year to lower the tax rates on some of the products subject to the special product tax? [Answer] The reason the State Council has decided to lower the tax rates on some special products represents a major policy decision to strengthen the work in rural areas and to provide overall stability to agricultural production. The policy has two major objectives: First, to close the gap between the nominal tax rate and the actual tax burden. Because the collection of special product taxes has run into rather serious problems of avoidance, cheating, under-reporting and falsifying or concealing the products, there are great discrepancies between the nominal tax rates and the actual taxes collected on some of the special products. For example, on apples, the government-set tax rate is 15 percent, but the actual tax paid nationally is only 7 percent; on prawns, the government-set rate is 10 percent, while the actual tax rate does not amount to 3 percent, and so on. Therefore, the government's main objective in lowering the tax rates on apples, aquatic products from rivers and lakes, logs, fruits and melons, etc., is to lower their nominal tax rates so they match more closely with the actual taxes collected. Second, to correct the imbalance of tax burdens and to mobilize enthusiasm for production not only among the large agricultural and special products production enterprises but also among the state-owned collective production organizations. [Question] In addition to what you have described above, what are some other policies based on agricultural taxes that benefit the peasants? [Answer] Our party and government have always looked after the benefits of the broad masses, and in agricultural taxes we have prescribed a series of beneficial policies; for example, rural households that owe more than 50 percent of taxes as a consequence of some disaster can apply for tax relief; households in dire poverty, households of military martyrs, and five-guarantee households can apply for tax waiver; households which use the area in front and back of their houses to grow various miscellaneous crops not for commercial sales can be exempted from the special product taxes; and peasants who build their homes on contract farmland can pay one-half of the farmland user tax, and so on. [Question] According to current laws and regulations, what punishments are prescribed for evading, owing or delaying payment of taxes and actively resisting paying any taxes? [Answer] According to the "Law on Management of Tax Collections in the People's Republic of China" and "Supplementary Regulations by the PRC National People's Congress Standing Committee on Punishments for Evading and Resisting Tax Collections," in addition to imposing a penalty of 2 percent per day on the amounts of taxes evaded, delayed, owed, or refused, the following punishments may be handed down. 1. Any taxpayer who evades taxes through fraud, fabrication and concealment, and the evaded amount exceeds 10 percent of the amount due or more than 10,000 yuan, or who still evaded taxes after given two administrative warnings by the revenue collecting unit, will be required to pay the evaded amount and in addition be punished by a prison sentence of three years or less and fined an amount not exceeding five times the amount of tax evaded. In the case of a taxpayer who evaded less than 10,000 yuan or the evaded amount evaded is less than 10 percent of the tax due, the revenue collection unit will be responsible for collecting the evaded amount and levying a fine not exceeding five times the amount of tax evaded. 2. The revenue collection unit will be responsible for collecting from any taxpayer who owes 10,000 yuan or more; for those owing less than 100,000 yuan, also levying a prison sentence not exceeding three years and a fine not exceeding five times the amount of tax owed; for those owing more than 100,000 yuan, also levying a prison terms of at least three but not exceeding seven years, and a fine equal to or less than five times the amount of tax owed; revenue collection unit will be responsible for collecting any amount owed under 10,000 yuan, and levying a fine not exceeding five times the amount of taxes owed. 3. Resisting collection of taxes is defined as refusal to pay tax by force or threat of force. In such cases, the revenue collection unit will be responsible for tracking down the delinquent taxpayer to collect the amount of tax due, levying a prison term of three years or less, and a fine equal to five times the amount of tax due; for the more serious cases, levying a prison term of more than three and under seven years, and a fine equal to five times the amount of tax due; for taxpayers who owe rather small amounts and who have not engaged in any criminal behaviors, the revenue collection unit will be responsible for collecting the amounts owed and imposing a fine equal to less than five times the amount of taxes owed.
