On electoral reform, the compromise would allow 300 seats in the House of Representatives to be elected from single-seat constituencies and the remaining 200 seats through the proportional representation system, according to the sources. A political reform package submitted by the LDP and killed in the House of Representatives last November called for the lower house to have 300 seats from single-seat constituencies and 171 elected through proportional representation. The government-sponsored reform bills rejected by the House of Councillors last week called for 274 seats from single-seat constituencies and 226 through proportional representation. Also, under the coalition's compromise plan, the proportional representation system will be based on 11 electoral divisions covering the whole country, the sources said. The proportional representation system in the LDP package was based on the existing 47 prefectures and that proposed in the government-sponsored bills was based on a single national electoral district. Concerning political fund-raising, the ruling parties' compromise plan allows some donations from companies and organizations to individual politicians, which was banned in the government package, the sources said. The Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest party in the ruling coalition, was reluctant to agree to the loosening of the restriction on donations, they said. The ruling parties proposed to the LDP to hold the joint council of both houses in a last-ditch effort to enact the bills by Saturday [29 January], when the Diet closes. If two-thirds of the 20-member joint panel agree on a compromise plan, the amended version would then be sent to plenary sessions of both houses of the Diet for a vote. The bills would become law if passed by a majority vote of both the houses.
