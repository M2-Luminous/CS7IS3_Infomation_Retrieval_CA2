Martic said the RSK delegation in Zagreb has informed him that the Croats are insisting on the disarming of the Serb forces, which the Serb side "certainly cannot accept." He added that the Serb delegation will stay at the talks despite this and will use all possibilities to establish peace. The Serbs went to the talks with the objective of bringing the hostilities to an end and reaching an agreement on the RSK territories which are occupied by Croatia. "Whatever the developments, we cannot go below our our minimum principle, the principle of self-determination. We have our parliament, our government, the president. They were legitimately elected in the latest elections. Our people certainly cannot and will not allow our territory to be returned to Croatia," Martic said.
