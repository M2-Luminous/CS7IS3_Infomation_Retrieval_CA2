As it has been reported, the UN Security Council adopted a president's statement on 30 May. The president's statement, which is written according to a premeditated plot by some member states of the UN Security Council, consists of absurdities, finding fault with us by stating that the fuel rods should be replaced only in compliance with the practical demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], and that the opportunity of selected separation and preservation of fuel rods might be lost. This is written based on the IAEA's unjustifiable and unfair evaluation and we cannot accept this. In concurrence with the announcement of the president's statement, there have been voices emerging from the United Nations and the United States in succession raving about UN sanctions and multinational sanctions. On the other hand, backed by such a situation, U.S. Defense Department spokesman Dennis Boxx declared on 2 June that the ultralarge carrier Independence, which is participating in the Rimpac military exercise, could change its route and be mobilized somewhere else if necessary. In the meantime, an announcement was made in concurrence with the president's statement that the Ulchi Focus Lens joint military exercise to be conducted by the U.S. forces and South Korean puppet Army will begin in August. It is clear that such political and military moves stem from the maneuver to make us yield to the unfair demands of the United States and the IAEA. However, this will not work. As shown in earlier DPRK-U.S. relations and the process of the negotiations and dialogue between us and the IAEA, pressure and force just do not work with us and cannot solve the problem. In any case, it is truly a regretful deed staining the UN history that the UN Security Council, which has a weighty responsibility for the world's peace and security, is finding fault with us following the IAEA's groundless scheme and conspiracy. It proves that the UN Security Council is seriously violating the principle of fairness, which is the basis for its existence. Therefore, we regard the president's statement against us as utterly unjust and we thoroughly reject it. For things to proceed on the right track, the UN Security Council should have first taken up the issue of the IAEA Secretariat's unfair conduct. Before the refueling began, our Republic had asked the IAEA many times to take the necessary steps, including the observation and replacement of the seals, but it never sent an inspection team until the refueling began. It is none other than some quarters of the IAEA Secretariat that intentionally disregarded the UN Security Council president's statement dated 31 March by refusing the additional inspection [chuga sachal] even though we had allowed it. Next, picking a quarrel by writing in the presidential statement that the opportunity to select, separate, and store the fuel rods may be lost is also a stubborn insistence that is not feasible. At the recent negotiations between the agency's negotiating team and our side in Pyongyang, discussions were basically carried out on the technical possibility of preserving for later measurement the replaced fuel rods, and in particular, sufficient discussions were held on the feasibility of such a method, which we are currently applying. If there is a package settlement between the DPRK and the United States regarding the nuclear issue in the future, this method makes it possible to sufficiently verify our past nuclear activities. Therefore, the agency said that it would seriously examine this method and decided to continue the discussion later. Nevertheless, even before arriving at the Vienna headquarters, the agency's negotiating team distorted the situation as if the negotiations were broken without giving a clear explanation and presented our issue to the UN Security Council. It goes without saying that such an action by the agency stems from the dirty intention of driving us into the nuclear dock in accordance with the scenario it drew up in advance. Our work of replacing the fuel rods at this time is being carried out under the presence of the agency's inspection team and strict control of the surveillance equipment. Regardless of these facts, picking a quarrel by saying that the opportunity to select, separate, and store the fuel rods may be lost shows that the UN Security Council is intentionally joining forces with the IAEA's unreasonable claim. As we are currently under a special status in which we have temporarily suspended the effectuation of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we have no legal duty whatsoever to receive regular and irregular inspections [chonggi mit pichonggi sachal] in accordance with the nuclear safeguards accord. We can by no means respond to the agency's demands that we accept such inspections. This can be realized only at a period when our special status is dissolved. Nevertheless, the true intention of carrying out tactics of political oppression against us regarding the issue of replacing the fuel rods, is to make an excuse to crush [apsalhal] us militarily. If the UN Security Council attempts to unreasonably carry out sanctions against us regarding our nuclear issue, we will justly exercise our sovereign rights, and it will be inevitable to take decisive corresponding measures. This is our people's firm will. The United States and its insidious following forces must not misjudge the situation. We treasure peace but we will not beg for it if the nation's dignity is infringed upon. We are prepared for both war and dialogue. The international reactionary forces under the initiative of the United States must by no means see our tolerance and patience as weakness.
