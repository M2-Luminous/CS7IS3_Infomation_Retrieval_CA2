At first, the presidential structure rose up to dizzy heights, whereas the government's position was one of subordination. These were the relations of vassal and sovereign, which, however, even then were not the relations of slave and slaveholder. A vassal had the right to fight for his independence and autonomy, as well as for their subsequent expansion. Which is what Viktor Chernomyrdin became involved in when he started forming "his own" government. As a result, the government structure became more firmly established. Admittedly, certain observers still give it a subservient role, pointing out that the president controls the activity of the "power" ministries and also has the right to intervene in financial and economic policy if the threat of hyperinflation arises. However, others are inclined to believe that in terms of its power and strength of influence, the government is not at all inferior to the president's administration. And in terms of organization and effectiveness, is even ahead of it. By and large, according to certain observers, the place and role of the Russian Government in the country's political life are today predetermined by the future battles for the post of president. And also by the fact that the leader of the government is the No. 1 candidate for the post of head of state. In short, this is a government whose main function is to help the premier to become president. Meanwhile, it is advantageous for the current president to play along with future contender for the presidency. So Yeltsin has moved aside, handed the economy to Chernomyrdin, and is now observing what will happen next. If, contrary to expectation, Viktor Stepanovich manages to hold the country on the brink of hyperinflation, Boris Nikolayevich will be interested in having him as his successor. As a man who maintained personal loyalty. And it is also in the premier's interests to play along with with Yeltsin: Chernomyrdin needs Yeltsin even more than Yeltsin needs him. If it proves possible to rescue the economy, the premier will simply prove to be "doomed" to become president. So that Chernomyrdin's task in the present conditions is utterly clear: to sit out Yeltsin's tenure, trying not to make any sharp movements, and to support Yeltsin without doing a deal with him. Government-Parliament As for relations between the government and the parliament, these are still at the formative stage. However, confrontation between the two bodies is already fairly discernible. The government is trying to do all it can to deprive the Federal Assembly of even a hint of autonomy in the question of material wealth. Meanwhile, virtually all the parliament's material backup is under the control of the president's administration. And in many respects this fact determines the relations between the legislature and the executive. For the time being, the parliamentary opposition has been behaving very carefully -- with the government too. The discussion of the budget proposed by Chernomyrdin has begun surprisingly peacefully. The lessons of October have evidently not been forgotten. Furthermore, in the present situation it is advantageous for the legislators to distance themselves from the government's economy policy. And to act on the basis of the principle: Let things happen as they happen, and we will criticize quietly. At the same time, a number of potential candidates for the presidency, making use of the Duma platform, are waiting impatiently for this government to ruin the economy and bring itself down. However, the majority of Duma factions have a fairly loyal attitude toward the government. Thanks to Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Chernomyrdin has found a common language with the communists, the agrarians and the "Women of Russia" -- he is close to them in spirit. Boris Fedorov was profoundly wrong when he sought Zaveryukha's dismissal: In any other circumstances the premier would not have parted for anything with a man who allowed him to control a significant part of the parliamentary opposition. "Russia's Choice" and the "12 December" group will be forced to support Chernomyrdin on the basis of gloomy considerations: "Or else things will get even worse." And as for the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, it -- following the elevation of both its leaders to the rank of vice premier -- is quite simply a government party. However, observers note: It is only the unifiers and the compromisers who consider themselves to be Chernomyrdin's party. He just allows them to support him, but prefers not to pay them back for this. Unless with posts of vice premier. Chernomyrdin's Team: Characters and Performers Viktor Stepanovich likes to repeat at every convenient opportunity that the current Russian Government is a coalition government. In actual fact there can be no question of a coalition government. In practical terms only one team -- Chernomyrdin's team -- is on the field of play. Chernomyrdin inherited an extremely mixed cabinet at the end of 1992. It included Yeltsin's men: Lobov, Shumeyko, Shakhray. And the fragments of Gaydar's team: Chubays, Pamfilova, and also Shokhin at that time. Then Gaydar himself appeared too. Fedorov -- a team in himself -- was also here. At that time, Yeltsin protege Oleg Lobov presented the greatest danger for the new premier -- he was urgently trying to reform the Ministry of the Economy a la Gosplan and to lay his hands on economic policy. Chernomyrdin dealt with him first. Another first vice premier, Oleg Soskovets, who had previously vegetated in the post of vice premier of an almost foreign country -- Kazakhstan -- was brought in to counterbalance First Vice Premier Lobov. Chernomyrdin almost begged Yeltsin for permission to bring just one of his own men into the government. The request looked entirely proper. After all, the new premier did not bring in with him any potentially dangerous representatives of the extremely powerful oil and gas lobby, which would doubtless have been assessed as outright protectionism. At the same time, it should not be forgotten that Soskovets's candidacy emerged on Chubays' initiative. And at first the new vice premier was fairly close to the representatives of those who were called reformers in the government, and he supported their policy. Suffice it to say that thanks primarily to Soskovets the price of coal was deregulated. All this fully suited Yeltsin. It was said that the president gave the new vice premier certain signs of attention and even made certain overtures toward him. The premier tolerated this for a while. For him enemy No. 1 was Lobov. In the end, Yeltsin's overzealous protege in terms of Gosplan-style reformism was nevertheless finished off. Not without the help of the government promarket lobby and the democratic press. Thereupon he was removed from the economy, but entirely decorously and honorably: He was unloaded into the Security Council. At a different time, but also entirely decorously, Yeltsin's remaining men were removed from the government. Shumeyko found himself in the Federation Council, not least thanks to the efforts of Chernomyrdin and Soskovets, who had done some good work with the deputies. But they did not remove Shakhray, or Shokhin either. These men simply left the teams in which they had started their political game and became full members of Chernomyrdin's team. Incidentally, one story is that Shokhin was elevated so as to counterbalance Soskovets, who was casting glances here and there and who was thus told: Man proposes, God disposes. That is, the premier disposes. And by and large, the elevation of Shokhin is a highly successful acquisition for Chernomyrdin and Kvasov. Appointed to "Gaydar's post," that is, the post of the person responsible for economic policy and reforms -- the professor and doctor of economic sciences is very good for diluting the strictly technological company of typical sector workers. And furthermore, he symbolizes a representative of the first draft of reformers, which is very convenient for the premier. And as for the so-called radical promarket lobby, Chernomyrdin dealt with them after October 1993, once he had perceived his own strength. Strictly speaking, no one chased Gaydar, Fedorov, and Pamfilova out of the government. All were offered posts. But, being young and ambitious, -- and that is precisely the reason for what happened -- they went too far; the posts no longer suited them, you see, and they wanted to dictate terms. Meanwhile, analysis of Chernomyrdin's cabinet's subsequent economic policy brings to mind the fact that the reason for Fedorov and Gaydar's departure was by no means fundamental differences of opinion with the premier in terms of views of the course of economic reforms. Judging by the Chernomyrdin-approved expenditure in the 1994 budget, Viktor Stepanovich turned out to be no less tough a "monetarist" than those from whom he had distanced himself. It is just that the premier evidently prefers to have one center in the government from which all decisions are initiated. As a result, the government formed by Chernomyrdin assumed a completely organic character. It is headed by a single leader, respected and recognized by all his subordinates. He is not without charisma either: He knows how to say things in such a way that people listen to him and receive things at a psychological and emotional level. Following the memorable speech uttered at the enlarged government session which mentioned heads of laboratories and the racing car, Chernomyrdin will even be forgiven for the tough budget. For the time being, of course. All decisions in the government are adopted exclusively by the premier. Or more precisely, by the Chernomyrdin-Kvasov duo. The leader of the apparatus -- the second man in the government -- has enormous power. Not one piece of paper is placed on Viktor Stepanovich's desk without his knowledge. Vladimir Kvasov has worked with Chernomyrdin for many years. He has always been a retinue figure: chief of office, assistant, leader of the apparatus.... In short, an eminence grise. The premier trusts Kvasov completely. And the latter knows all the ins and outs of apparatus reshuffles and skillfully conducts a cadre policy that is advantageous to the premier. Whoever Kvasov recommends, that person is taken on. The only exception has been Anatoliy Chubays. Foreign Body Today Chubays is the only man in Chernomyrdin's government who is not on Chernomyrdin's team. Appointed directly by the president over and above the approved vice premier TO, Chubays is in this government only until check privatization is completed. What then? Chernomyrdin will most likely try to get rid of him. It is said that he has already attempted to remove two deputy chairman of the State Committee for the Management of State Property [Goskomimushchestvo] -- Vasilyev and Mostovoy -- and put his own people in the posts in order to thus "neutralize" the head of the department. This did not work out, however. Chubays proved to be a tough nut, and Chernomyrdin and Kvasov broke their teeth on him. But they will scarcely tolerate him for long. The chairman of Goskomimushchestvo is too bright a figure, he is too promising and ambitious a politician. You need an iron grip to hold on for two years to the process of the division of property in the vast Russian state and to bring this division to a logical conclusion (and it is all going that way). And so (particularly in Chernomyrdin's eyes) Chubays is the only person in the government after the premier who has a certain amount of influence on the president. Obviously, the future of the Goskomimushchestvo chairman depends on the president's political fate. However, Chubays is capable of standing up for himself. Today his department is fighting with all its might to strengthen its positions in the postprivatization process. If Goskomimushchestvo succeeds in taking enterprise bankruptcies and economic revival under its control, then Chubays' influential position in the government will be secure. However, even today the Ministry of the Economy is disputing these functions with Goskomimushchestvo. No doubt the full might of the government apparatus will stand behind Shokhin in this conflict. Lobbyists in the Government: Who Wins? One of the most powerful lobbies -- the oil and gas lobby -- is represented in the government by the premier himself. To a significant extent the oil and gas workers form the budget. And what is also important is that they have their own finances which they can use. That is probably why Chernomyrdin is seeking to prevent his potentially influential old friends from Gazprom getting too close. But it is the agrarians who are the most active today in obtaining money for themselves, because they are able to apply pressure at all levels: in the government, in the Duma, and through the mass media. This lobby is also strong in that it has easy access to the premier through its protege Aleksandr Zaveryukha. Oleg Soskovets, who in his time has worked both at the Karaganda Metallurgical Combine and in the post of USSR minister of nonferrous metallurgy, represents the interests of the "coal-metal" bloc lobbyists. The defense industry workers have also recently slipped under the Soskovets wing, inasmuch as they do not have a single serious figure in the government by way of their own direct spokesman. The military-industrial complex lobby is generally one of the weakest. The attitude toward defense industry workers is one of sympathy, but without the due respect. This is yet again confirmed by the fact that during the formation of the 1994 budget the spokesmen for the military-industrial complex failed to obtain an additional morsel at the expense of other sectors. Obviously, all the aforesaid lobbies, as well as their spokesmen, are doomed to constant confrontation with each other amid the struggle for survival. This situation suits Chernomyrdin as a politician and as supreme arbiter. The state of confrontation will neither allow one specific leader to become stronger or several to cobble together a stable anti-premier coalition. For instance, in the fight against increased prices of fuel and energy complex output Soskovets and Zaveryukha could constitute a fairly powerful alliance. But this alliance would never stand the test of the division of the budget pie. In this context, Chernomyrdin's desire to keep Acting Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin in a state of suspension seems entirely sensible. After all, the person who hands out the money has considerable influence on the disposition of forces in the political arena. Last year Boris Fedorov was this man, and this could not have particularly pleased Chernomyrdin. Now this man is indubitably the premier himself; he is in complete control of the Ministry of Finance. As for the regional elites, these do not have any recognized lobbyists in Chernomyrdin's government at the moment. Maybe some of them are still inclined to back Shakhray. But, if they want to achieve something, the majority of local leaders resort to pooling their own efforts. Or they quite successfully go to the president in secret. But the premier himself possibly monitors the moods of the territories through his vice premier, Yuriy Yarov. Yarov has been involved in party and soviet work for years. In Chernomyrdin's government he is formally responsible for social policy, but at the same time he conducts all kinds of closed talks with the regions. Obviously, Chernomyrdin has reason to trust this taciturn and complaisant deputy more than Sergey Shakhray with his indefatigable political ambitions and pro-Yeltsin past. However, Yarov was probably appointed to the post of vice premier not least thanks to the curious fact that he ran for deputy from the "Russia's Choice" bloc. And thereby gave the premier who elevated him the possibility of maintaining the illusion of a coalition government.
