FR940314-0-00028 FR940314-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;09; Amendment 39&hyph;8853; AD 94&hyph;06&hyph;05] Airworthiness Directives; Hamilton Standard 14RF Series Propellers AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Hamilton Standard 14RF series propellers. This action adopts new torquing procedures for the propeller hub retaining nuts, requires initial and repetitive torque checks of propeller hub retaining nuts using those new procedures. In addition, this AD requires repetitive visual inspections for external propeller oil, investigation, and removal from service of propellers hubs found cracked or with undetermined leakage. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracks in propeller hubs that initiate in hub dowel pin holes at the connection of the hub to the engine flange. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent propeller hub cracking and loss of engine oil, and possible loss of a propeller blade or hub. DATES: Effective March 29, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of March 29, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before May 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;09, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Hamilton Standard, One Hamilton Road, Windsor Locks, CT 06096&hyph;1010. This information may be examined at the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Francis X. Walsh, Aerospace Engineer, Boston Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7158, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received reports of cracks found in some Hamilton Standard Model 14RF&hyph;9, 14RF&hyph;19, and 14RF&hyph;21 propeller hubs. Through testing and field investigation the FAA has determined that insufficient torque of the propeller hub retaining nuts has resulted in damage by fretting within the dowel holes and subsequent cracks initiating in the hub dowel pin holes at the connection of the hub to the engine flange. The FAA has also determined that the present torquing procedures for propeller hub retaining nuts on this model propeller are insufficient to control fretting during the conditions experienced in service. Therefore, through engineering analysis, the FAA has determined that new, more stringent torquing procedures must be applied to this propeller model to mitigate this fretting condition. Cracks that may be caused by this condition can be detected by oil leakage not explained by other conditions such as leaks in the blade seal, the pressure relief valve, or actuator assembly. Since undetermined oil leakage is a good indication of cracks in the propeller hub, the FAA has also determined that propellers hubs with unexplained oil leakage must be removed from service and inspected for cracks prior to return to service. This fretting condition, if not corrected, could result in propeller hub cracking and loss of engine oil, and possible loss of a propeller blade or hub.
