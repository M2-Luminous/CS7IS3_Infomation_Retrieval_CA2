He is John Kornblum, the U.S. delegate to the CSCE. We do not know the new coordinator, but we do hope that he will look at the Cyprus issue through a very different lens than his predecessor. Lamb repeatedly proved to be dishonest, unreliable, dishonorable, misleading, and deceitful. He has served in the position of coordinator for six months. During this period not only did he not help Cyprus, but on the contrary he harmed it. Very justifiably, the Cypriot Government is strongly dissatisfied with Lamb's role in the Cyprus issue. In Vienna recently, Lamb dishonestly and deceitfully tried to make changes to the 21 March UN document. Therefore, we hope that the new U.S. coordinator will carry out his mission honestly and really help Cyprus resolve its persistent problem in a just manner.
