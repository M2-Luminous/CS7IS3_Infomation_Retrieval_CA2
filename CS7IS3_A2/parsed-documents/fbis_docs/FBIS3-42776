Nevertheless, since August of last year all of Russia was doing precisely that, trying to figure out how many million dollars A. Rutskoy had in a Swiss bank--$3 million or $10 million. The commission especially set up by the president made public the vice president's alleged account number in the Swiss Indosuez Bank and a copy of a trust agreement. By this agreement A. Rutskoy entrusted to a certain Austrian citizen, Kerets, the management of his own firm abroad--Trade Links, to whose accounts money allegedly flowed from Russia. The Moscow City Procuracy was assigned the task of checking out these allegations. The Procuracy, in turn, quickly closed the case, just before the elections to the Federal Assembly and the referendum on the Constitution. The voters realized that an honest man, A. Rutskoy, simply had been set up by his political opponents. Two months have passed since that virtual exoneration of the former vice president. The case is currently in the Office of the Procurator General of the Russian Federation for review. There are reasons to believe that a decision will be issued that it had been closed improperly. At first glance it may look like there is an intent to "finish off" A. Rutskoy one way or the other. But this is not quite so. The conclusion that led to the decision to close the case was made mainly after a Moscow investigator had traveled to Switzerland and interviewed the owner of the Seabeco company, B. Birshteyn. The latter stated that Trade Links was his company and that A. Rutskoy had nothing to do with it. The Office of the Procurator General, however, believes that in order to make a decision on the case it was necessary to meet with a Canadian notary, Chapnik. He was the person who at the time notarized the original of the trust agreement and a true signature of A. Rutskoy, to which he recently testified in the presence of two witnesses--officers of the Canadian Mounted Police. And if the Office of the Procurator General does indeed close the case, Chapnik will face a criminal prosecution in Canada for perjury. The big question, of course, is who will turn out to be right--our Procuracy or the Canadian notary. So, we have, on the one hand, the testimony of B. Birshteyn, the owner of a company that is banned from operating on the territory of the Russian Federation. And on the other, a statement of a neutral Canadian notary. Some light on the Rutskoy case could be shed by the documents of the Renewal foundation, through which money and contracts--including those with Seabeco--had been handled. But all documents, not without the knowledge of R. Khasbulatov, had been transferred in good time to the White House and were burned during the October events. A number of witnesses met with a tragic death. It appears that the fund's documents in regional branches already have been destroyed. As to accounts in Western banks, many people probably remember that at the time of being an acting prime minister, Ye. Gaydar had contacts with the American company Kroll Associates. The latter was looking for the CPSU party money and, of course, personal accounts. Well, according to some information, it is quite easy for this company to find out account numbers even in Swiss banks--at a price, of course. There are rumors that they are in possession of many secrets regarding Russian citizens' foreign currency holdings abroad. There are also rumors that quite a few people in the West do not want such scandals. Imagine how solidly one can keep any person on the hook (especially if he is big brass) if one sits on such compromising materials. And what if such a person happens to be a minister; or a presidential candidate?
