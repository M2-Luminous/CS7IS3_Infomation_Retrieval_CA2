In an exclusive statement to MENA, the Burundian minister said that the incident was not provoked by any turmoil or unrest and that the target was the Rwandan president. He pointed out that the incident took place at Kigali airport in Rwanda at about 2030 last night and President Ntaryamira was expected to arrive in Burundi at about 2105. Minister Ngendahayo said that on board the small Falcon plane that crashed in Kigali last night were Bernard Ciza, Burundian minister of state for planning development and finance; Cyriaque Simbizi, Burundian minister of communications and government spokesman; and Captain Cizahayo, an escorting officer. Concerning the incident's possible repercussions for Burundi, Minister Ngendahayo said that there are two unconfirmed possibilities about the plane's crash or downing. If the plane has crashed, he said, it is a tragic accident for two presidents with good reputations in the continent and will have grave consequences for Rwanda, which is going through a phase of democratic transformation and whose government is conducting talks with the opposition. As for Burundi, Ngendahayo added, it is an extremely painful and sensitive situation, as President Ntaryamira has only been in power for two month and the country had already lost President Melchior Ndadaye last October. In the event the plane was downed, this may foment latent problems in Rwanda. As for Burundi, I believe that the incident is unfortunate but will have only a temporary effect. According to the information I received, the average Burundian took the news as a piece of "bad luck."
