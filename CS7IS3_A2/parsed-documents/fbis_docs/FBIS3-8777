One senses this especially well in the local organizations that are preparing or holding their accountability-election meetings. Spirits are gradually being stirred, and thousands of Socialists are attempting to look into the future. They feel simultaneously attracted and alarmed by the idea, because the times are complex and changeable. On the one hand, hopes are high, and on the other, black clouds are gathering. Many want a sea change within both the party and society, whereas others fear any change at all. This brings people into confrontation, whether they want it or not, and casts them into conflict. Of course, the conflicts should not be dramatized, whatever they may be. In times like these they are quite natural and mirror the essence of life. The BSP is still a party with traditions that have not outlived their time, a party of painful restructuring that fires it with different kinds of energy. It still wavers between recollections of the past and the present day, filled with glorious dreams and new political plans. There can be no doubt that this is what holds it in a state of inner tension, which, combined with crude antisocialist attacks from outside, makes it face major tests. However, despite everything, the party remains whole; despite the waves that rock the party's ship, it sails on toward the promised land. Those who expect the party to collapse will surely be disappointed, not because the ship is threatened by storms and leaks, but because its crew has a clear common goal, despite their sentiments and quarrels. This is the goal of social justice, of spiritual revival, of saving Bulgaria from blue [color of Union of Democratic Forces, SDS] ruin. This is more than certain, more than mere optimism. However, the mere awareness that the conflicts are inevitable, even if they are not disastrous, is not enough. This must not make us either slightly gullible or overcredulous. In addition to their natural inevitability, the conflicts have their own inner tectonics, with unpredictable forces that are difficult to control. These are the forces of sharp confrontation, of complete rejection of the road we have traveled, that are concealed in the hardest layers of the rich party soil. For almost four years these forces have existed unseen, confused and frightened by the cataclysm in society and apparently doomed to remain immobile for all time. However, now, the slightest slackening of the political pressure or the crude aggression brings them out of the latent state into which they have fallen. They are now shaking themselves out of this state and are entering into the precongress dialogue, speaking sometimes softly, sometimes with more strident tones. Many of those who slept through the hard years in which the fate of the socialist idea was being decided are now coming onto the stage, ready to rout the saviors of the socialist idea. This is no longer simply a duel between two sets of views, but a kind of attempt at resurrecting the old and forgotten ideas. Perhaps some of the more peace-loving among us will reject these alarming findings, but they should not be in too much of a hurry to do so. These findings are not invented. It is already well-known that there are some people here and there who propose to restore the party's old name, to declare once again its Leninist origins, to reestablish democratic centralism, and revive the party's revolutionary character. They not only doubt the advantages of democracy, but also reject its achievements so far, small though they may be. Some of them are even ready to deny the cause of DUMA and propose the reestablishment of the newspaper that for 45 years disseminated the so-called party truth -- the paper with its orders depicted on its masthead, carrying above its name the slogan that has lost its meaning with the passage of time. These people do not recognize party pluralism, they reject separate ideological trends, and accuse anyone who thinks more freely of treason. Having failed to understand the present and being alien to its complex nature, they daydream about "their own" time, as if history was able to bring it back for them. See how many old and rejected conceptions about the party and life are trying to varying extents to influence the precongress dialogue and deflect it in a wrong direction. There should be no doubt that certain retrograde circles that missed their chance need an earthquake and are trying to provoke one. They will certainly fail, because they form part of the rear baggage train of the BSP and social development, but this does not mean that we should underestimate them. They are in our midst, and this is good enough reason to put us on our guard. It is not only the sick imaginations of the right-wing forces in the SDS, but also these friends of ours who are nourishing the fiction of some kind of recommunization. Their threadbare thoughts and ideological visions not only scare the Socialist Party, but the general population as well. The awakening of these subterranean strata within the BSP is a major warning signal for the upcoming congress. It will be dangerous, as well as harmful, if they are able to influence the work of the congress. Then the congress will become an arena that will disturb not only the party, but society as well. In this context, the election of delegates to the congress is transformed from a formal procedure into an almost momentous act. The party organization should send to their supreme forum not merely "our own people" or "good comrades," but individuals who have proved their political maturity and wisdom, persons totally dedicated to the new spirit of the BSP and determined to make a final break with the past and transform the BSP into a truly modern party, which means a party with a deep awareness of parliamentary democracy, a party of broad social dialogue, a party with a pluralistic approach to the problems, and a lofty national awareness. It must be a party of people whom Bulgaria values and loves. If this does not come about, the congress will take a wrong turn, whether we want it or not. The times of pompous statements, empty speeches, pledges of loyalty, ideological sentiments, and even more sentimental concepts of the future are past and gone. Every elected delegate must enter the congress hall aware that he is a man of the new time, that he defends a socialist idea in an antisocial society, and that our goal today is not simply power, but the salvation and ennoblement of man. At the present moment, the BSP can have no higher goal than this. Anyone who does not understand this may speak eloquently, but he will not be of the least help. Therefore, those who disturb the people with their outmoded speeches and degraded ideas about life should not seek to be called to the speaker's platform. They can only blow up the party and change it from a means to achieve new changes into a bunker for unnecessary battles. I do not know whether everyone will agree with the content and deep feeling embodied in the thoughts I have expressed. However, this is not important. It is more important for them to instill these thoughts in their own consciousness and remember them when they have to assess one or another form of conduct. For the people from the party's rear baggage train, those who are launching reckless criticisms that do not in the least help the new spirit, do not deserve to be patronized. They are noisy disrupters of the calm and are seeking backdated recognition. One may understand them from a purely human viewpoint, but they must receive no support or encouragement. Their belated energy is no help to the BSP. Although in many cases it is sincere, it is not beneficial. The only thing that this energy can achieve is to exacerbate the inevitable conflicts that I mentioned in the beginning, and turn them into a crisis. Let no one forget that our party contains many new shoots. If we want to keep it whole, we should neither accuse them nor trample them in the mud, as certain rough "gardeners" seem to be doing just now. Therefore, let us listen to what they have to say, because they have the right to speak, but let us not follow their advice. Their way does not lead anywhere. It cannot be the way of the BSP, because the party of the Bulgarian Socialists wants to live despite the difficulties and bad omens. It is not a rock, as some like to think, but a spring, a spring for the thirsty to drink from, not for those who are looking for somewhere to wash their old clothes.
