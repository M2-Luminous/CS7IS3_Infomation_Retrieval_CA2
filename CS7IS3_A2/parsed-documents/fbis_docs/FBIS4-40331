The situation has become seriously aggravated in view of North Korea's decision to withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "Thus, another spiral has been added to the crisis which was brought on by that country's withdrawal from the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," the statement said. Actions taken by North Korea of late "do not give grounds to affirm that the country lacks a military nuclear programme," the statement stressed. "Emergence of nuclear weapons in the northern part of the peninsula would pose a serious threat to both regional and global stability and security. "This is why Kazakhstan, which has joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a non-nuclear state, and which comes out in favour of strict compliance with the NPT regime calls on North Korea to resume dialogue with the world community to avoid a further exacerbation of the situation concerning the nuclear problem on the peninsula", the statement said. The Kazakhstan Foreign Ministry, positively appraising Russia's proposals to convene an international conference on security and on nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, with the participation of North and South Korea, the United States, China, Japan, and Russia, as well as U.N. Security Council and IAEA representatives, urged all the sides concerned to show a constructive approach with a view to settling the situation.
