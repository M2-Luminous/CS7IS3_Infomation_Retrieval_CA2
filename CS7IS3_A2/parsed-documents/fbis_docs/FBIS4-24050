Speaking after a PWV Provincial Legislature sitting at Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] near Soweto he said people were expecting him to tackle issues such as housing, health and education for which he needed powers stipulated in terms of the constitution. He and his 10 MECs [members of the Executive Committee] have been given powers equivalent to that of the Transvaal Provincial Administration Executive Committee, but many other powers had yet to be conferred. Mr Sexwale said people would seek another government if no progress was made because he had no power to act. Mr Sexwale hoped an announcement on the remaining powers would be made soon.
