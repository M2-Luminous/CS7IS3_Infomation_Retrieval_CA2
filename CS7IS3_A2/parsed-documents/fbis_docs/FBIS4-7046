Present at the meeting were Premier Kang Song-san and Vice-President Yi Chong-ok, Politburo members of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. In a congratulatory message to the participants in the meeting, the WPK Central Committee said the efforts for a great upsurge in coal production were a very important and honorable undertaking to accelerate socialist construction as a whole by implementing the agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first policies of the party and a noble struggle for smashing the moves of the U.S. imperialists and other reactionaries to blockade and stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the fortress of socialism, and defending and further developing Korean socialism centred on the popular masses. It called upon all the officials and workers engaged in the coal industrial sector to defend the party and firmly safeguard Korean-style socialism and further develop it with increased coal production. Hong Song-nam, alternate Politburo member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the WPK and vice-premier of the Administration Council, delivered a report at the meeting. He dwelt on the achievements registered in the coal industrial sector in the past and future tasks. He said: Over the past three decades the production capacity of the coal mines has increased 3.5 times. More than 40 mines and 50 pits have been built in promising coal fields, with the result that Korea now produces in ten days as much coal as was produced in 1946. The main tasks facing the coal industrial sector are to concentrate investment in coal mines with large deposits and favorable excavating conditions, reconstruct the existing coal mines on a modern and expansion basis, actively develop new ones and, at the same time, vigorously promote the modernization and scientification in this sector to fully meet the growing demand of the national economy. Speeches were made at the meeting. A letter of pledge to the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted there.
