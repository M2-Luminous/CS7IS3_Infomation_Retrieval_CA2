A joint announcement by the leaders of both parties - Stanley John of the SVLP and Dr Ralph Gonsalves of the MNU - said Vincent Beache, a former trade minister and SVLP leader, was chosen to lead the alliance. The alliance will contest the 15 seats in the House of Assembly with the SVLP providing nine candidates and the MNU, six. In the just dissolved Parliament, neither party was represented. Despite formation of the alliance, the two parties will retain their identities "but will present a common manifesto and share a common campaign platform," the statement said. "This agreement was facilitated by the "Concerned Citizens Committee", a group of prominent Vincentian business persons, professionals and members of clergy who have recently come together to ensure good governance in the state," the statement added. John will continue to function as leader of the SVLP and Gonsalves as head of the MNU.
