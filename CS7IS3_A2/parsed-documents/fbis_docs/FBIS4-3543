Lin Yunfeng, general manager of the company based in the capital of Sichuan Province, said that these computers will be installed in MD-90 aircraft to be built by the McDonnell Douglas Company. He said the computers were designed jointly by the Chengdu company and the Honeywell Corporation, one of the largest aero electronics enterprises in the U.S., and built by the former. The Chinese partner has installed the first computer assembly line, which produced five samples in 1993. Over the past two years, the American partner has sent experts here to inspect product quality, he said. The MD-90 is one of McDonnell Douglas's newest types of aircraft, Lin Yunfeng said, adding that its use of Chinese-built parts shows that Sino-U.S. cooperation has paid off. He said that his company and the Honeywell Corporation have begun negotiation on other cooperative projects. A Japanese electronics corporation initially wanted to sell its products to the Chengdu company. But after visiting the MD-90 CADC assembly line, executives of the Japanese company decided to buy computers from the latter. "Negotiations for the deal are now under way," said Lin. He said that his company is rated as a key enterprise for producing China's aeronautics equipment, with engineers and technicians accounting for 30 percent of its workforce.
