The first cases of arsenic poisoning were discovered in 1991 in one of Guizhou's Prefectures inhabited by ethnic minority people, and so far 1,908 victims have been diagnosed in the province. During the past three years the Guizhou Provincial Government has allocated 288,000 yuan to treat 1,696 such patients free of charge. Most of them are recovering well. This year the government will set aside another 500,000 yuan for its treatment program. Relevant government departments have also made comprehensive surveys of the coal mines to close down those producing coal with too high an arsenic content, to prevent any further arsenic poisoning.
