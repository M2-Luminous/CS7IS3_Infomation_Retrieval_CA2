FR940428-0-00049 FR940428-0-00019 Thursday April 28, 1994 Part IV Department of Education 34 CFR Part 668 Student Assistance General Provisions; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 81␣/␣Thursday, April 28, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Part 668 RIN 1840&hyph;AC08 Student Assistance General Provisions Agency: Department of Education. Action: Final regulations. Summary: The Secretary amends subpart E of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, 34 CFR part 668, Verification of Student Aid Application Information, to implement technical revisions resulting from the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325) and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208) and to reduce the administrative burden associated with verification requirements on applicants and institutions. These regulations require institutions to have a system for verifying student aid application information reported by applicants for use in calculating expected family contributions (EFCs) for the Federal Pell Grant, campus-based (Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)), Federal Stafford Loan, Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL), and Presidential Access Scholarship (PAS) programs. Effective Date: These regulations take effect on July 1, 1994. When these regulations become effective, they will govern verification of student aid application information for any Title IV, Higher Education Amendments (HEA) program assistance that may be awarded to any student for award years beginning with 1994&hyph;95. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lorraine Kennedy, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Regional Office Building 3, room 4318, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5451. Telephone (202) 708&hyph;4601. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Subpart E of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations (34 CFR part 668) governs the verification of the information that is used to calculate an applicant's expected family contribution (EFC) as part of the determination of an applicant's need for student financial assistance. Based on the need analysis formula established in statute, the EFC is the amount that an applicant and the applicant's family can reasonably be expected to contribute towards the applicant's cost of attendance at an institution of higher education. The changes in these regulations result from a review of current policies and procedures and from recently enacted legislation that renders certain provisions in the current regulations obsolete. Summary of Changes Sections 668.51 through 668.61 are amended to delete all references to the Income Contingent Loan (ICL) Program and Quality Control Pilot Project. Program references throughout Subpart E have been changed to reflect the new names of the Title IV, HEA programs. Sections 668.52(b) and 668.54(a) are amended to delete the definition of Need Analysis Servicer, to delete references to the certification of need analysis servicers, and to delete references to the 30 percent verification limitation. Sections 668.54 through 668.56 are amended to include the use of an output document and institutional student information reports (ISIRs) in conjunction with the reference to the Student Aid Report (SAR). Output documents and ISIRs will also be used in conjunction with the reference to an SAR for applicants selected for verification under §668.54(a)(2). Sections 668.56(a)(5)(i) (A) and (B) and 668.57(d)(2)(i) are deleted since the Department no longer participates in a match with the Social Security Administration for these benefits. The Secretary also amends §668.57(a) (2) and (3) to remove the quotation marks before and after ``IRS Listing of Tax Account Information'' and to make the phrase lower case. This clarifies that the reference is to information that is being requested from IRS that would be used to verify specific data elements, not a specific IRS form. Also, this would accommodate new IRS forms that are continuously being developed through electronic technology to assist tax filers. Section 668.59 is amended to remove all references to the Pell Grant Index (PGI) and replace the reference with EFC, and to add the new terms output document or ISIRs as they apply. This section is also being amended to delete the Zero PGI Charts. The regulations also delete the use of the Zero PGI Charts as a tolerance option for applicants who have undergone verification. In the past, the charts have not been widely used and institutions can easily use another tolerance option such as the recalculation of an applicant's EFC. The Department of Education provides the Electronic Needs Analysis System (ENAS) to institutions at no cost. ENAS may be used for recalculating an applicant's EFC. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, the technical changes in these final regulations are a direct result of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, are purely technical, and do not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary has determined under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) that proposed rulemaking is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. Assessment of Educational Impact The Department has determined that the regulations in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.
