IRNA talked to a cross section of Muslim intelligentsia from different walks of life today to elicit their views. The reaction everywhere was one of shock and disblief. People were also highly critical of the agreement reached between Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) leader and the Israeli Government late October. Najma Heptullah, deputy chairman of the upper house of the Indian parliament called the incident tragic. She suggested that both the PLO and the Israeli Government must be cautious for there are people on both sides who are against a lasting peace in the occupied lands. Heptullah said while such a mishap was expected, it was up to the two sides to diffuse the tension and carry on with the action for peace. Syed Shahabuddin, member of parliament and a vocal advocate of Muslim issues was anguished to hear of the incident. He can now see the agreement between PLO and the Israeli Government resting on very shaky foundation. Unless Israel clearly agrees to vacate all occupied territories, no permanent solution can be found, Shahabuddin said adding that this was the main stumbling block to the possibility of a peace. He wanted all settlers to be disarmed so that such mishaps would not be repeated. Students' islamic Movement (SIM) holds that the issue of Palestine and that of 'Bait-al-Muqaddas' is that of all Muslims all over the world. Anwar Ali, secretary general of the organisation feels that the agreement between the two sides is baseless. It is an attempt to thwart the Palestine movement. Ali added that the entire Muslim world was alarmed at the way in which the Israeli police and army had turned a blind eye to the murder in cold blood of scores of worshipers. Mulana Mukarram Ahmad, chief imam of the Fatehpuri mosque in New Delhi, feels it is certain big powers who are creating all the trouble. Innocent Muslims are their choice targets every where. He expressed shock and said that all parties must work for peace. The people of Palestine have gone through very bad times. That phase must come to an end, he said. On whether the incidence will derail the peace process, he said while the possibilty was always there, it can be tided over in the interest of peace if the Israelis are sincere. Syed Hamid, former vice chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University felt the act was a most atrocious one likely to queer the pitch of the negotiations going on between PLO and Israel. He felt the ball was in the Israeli court now. They must provide the necessary security to the Palestinians since they were in command. S. Burney, former governor of the state of Haryana and a retired civil servant called the incident most painful. He said all violence must be avoided, for violence begets violence. The slaughter, he said, will have a lot of serious repercussions. He only hoped that peace be restored.
