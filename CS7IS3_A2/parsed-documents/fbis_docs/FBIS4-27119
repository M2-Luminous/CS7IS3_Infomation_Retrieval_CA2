I would like to bid a hearty welcome to you, our intimate friends, and also sincerely congratulate you on your success in the roundtable conference for peace and national reconciliation in Cambodia which has been held under the guidance of your majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. I believe the fact that the high-ranking leaders of Cambodia have held the roundtable conference in Pyongyang this time is an expression of your friendship towards us and your trust in us. The roundtable conference has been held by the direct proposal and effort of your majesty esteemed King Norodom Sihanouk, an outstanding patriot of Cambodia and father of the Khmer nation. Your majesty, with intense love for your country and a strong will, has devoted everything to the cause of the country's independence and national dignity with unshakable confidence in spite of the many tortuous events you have undergone from early years. Today you are working energetically for national reunification and unity and peace in your country. Celebrating your traditional new year with the Cambodian people since your return home from the visit to our country last April, your majesty esteemed king has inspired them with great confidence and courage and, in spite of ill health, has been making unremitting efforts to deal with complex political affairs. In particular, you have put forward a reasonable proposal for achieving national reconciliation and restoring peace in your country and have made various arrangements to put it into practice. We speak highly of your majesty's noble patriotism and outstanding statecraft. Realizing national reconciliation and restoring peace in Cambodia is an important matter which affects the country's destiny. Displaying a high degree of patriotism at the roundtable conference, the high-ranking leaders of Cambodia have brought about good results to meet the expectations of the Cambodian people and the progressive people of the world, and thus made a historic contribution to realizing national reconciliation and restoring peace in Cambodia. Cambodian people are a talented and diligent people who have a long history and have created a splendid culture. We believe that the high-ranking leaders of Cambodia and her people will successfully build an independent, peaceful and prosperous new Cambodia, in support of the noble will of your majesty esteemed King Norodom Sihanouk. Your Majesty esteemed King: The Korean and Cambodian peoples have established strong ties of friendship on the road of independence from early days and closely supported and cooperated with each other. Our people who value the relations of friendship and cooperation with the Cambodian people will, in the future, too, work hard to expand and develop the friendship with the Cambodian people and actively support your majesty's stand for peace and national reconciliation in Cambodia. Availing myself of this meaningful opportunity, I propose a toast to the friendship and unity between the Korean people and the Cambodian people; to the prosperity and thriving of the Kingdom of Cambodia; to the good health and long life of your majesty esteemed King Norodom Sihanouk; to the good health of your majesty Queen Norodom (Moniniet) Sihanouk; to the good health of your excellency esteemed Prince Chea Sim; to the good health of your royal highness esteemed Norodom Ranariddh and of your excellency esteemed Prince Hun Sen; to the good health of your excellency esteemed Khieu Samphan; to the good health of various friends and comrades of Cambodia present here.
