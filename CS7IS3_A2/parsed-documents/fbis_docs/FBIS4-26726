On the basis of summing up experiences, arrangements were made at the meeting for the anticorruption struggle in the future. In his speech, Song Zhaosu said: At present, the anticorruption struggle in our province is progressing healthily. However, there is still a gap between what we have done and the demand of the masses and the CPC Central Committee. We must increase the number of cases handled, and focus our main efforts on investigating and handling cases like corruption, bribery, financial defrauding, smuggling, severe violations of financial and economic disciplines, and others. We must continue to direct the spearhead of the attack at judicial, law enforcement, and economic administration departments. Investigating and handling cases involving economic crimes of leading cadres at and above the county level must be treated as our top priority task to create a good environment for economic construction in our province. Provincial party Secretary Li Changchun made an important speech. He said: In the new historical period, we must consider the anticorruption struggle from the high plane of the life and death of the ruling party. We must hold high the two banners of reform, enriching the people and opposing corruption, advocating cleanness and honesty. We must be firm and unshakable in taking economic construction as our center, so that our country will become strong and powerful and the masses rich as soon as possible. We must be firm and unshakable in strengthening the practice of cleanness and honesty and carrying out the anticorruption struggle. Li stressed: It is necessary to make an overall plan to completely fulfill the following three anticorruption tasks. 1) We must concentrate our efforts on and give prominence to major cases. We must increase investigation and handling of big and important cases to boost the confidence of the masses in our anticorruption struggle. 2) We must do well the work of dealing with special cases to severely punish cadres those who violate the regulations to buy private cars, are in arrears with public funds thus harming our finances, and so on. 3) Cadres must be clean and honest and exercise self-discipline. In this connection, CPC Committees at all levels must conscientiously convene well democratic life meetings for the first half of the year and formulate and improve rules and regulations to further standardize leading cadres' behavior. Li Changchun also urged making more efforts to educate cadres and strengthen leadership over anticorruption work, so that our anticorruption struggle can be carried out in a sustained and deep manner. He said: Making more efforts to educate cadres is a fundamental and important measures for forging closer party-masses and cadres-masses relations and preventing the occurrence of corrupt phenomenon. Education must be profoundly conducted among the broad masses of cadres to learn from the spirit of the people in Linxian County to work hard to do pioneering work, carry forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu by serving the people wholeheartedly, and make selfless devotion [words indistinct]. It is necessary to improve ideological and work styles of leading bodies at all levels. It is necessary to implement a responsibility system regarding party style and clean and honest government administration. Work at each level must be administered and supervised by its immediate higher authorities. Under the unified leadership of CPC Committees at all levels, the anticorruption struggle must be carried out in an organized and guided way. CPC Committees at all levels must put the anticorruption struggle in an important place on the work agenda. They must listen to the recent anticorruption work report and take new measure for promoting the struggle. The anticorruption struggle must be conducted closely around the central task of seizing the favorable opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and stabilizing the general situation. As far as specific links are concerned, the anticorruption struggle must be subjected to economic construction aimed at benefiting reform, opening up, and economic development.
