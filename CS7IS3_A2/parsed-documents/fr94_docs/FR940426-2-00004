FR940426-2-00004 FR940426-2-00002 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE International Trade Administration [A&hyph;570&hyph;832, A&hyph;570&hyph;833, A&hyph;821&hyph;805, A&hyph;821&hyph;806, A&hyph;823&hyph;806, A&hyph;823&hyph;807] Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigations: Pure and Alloy Magnesium From the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellen Grebasch or Erik Warga, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;3773 or 482&hyph;0922. Initiation of Investigations The Petitions On March 31, 1994, we received petitions filed in proper form by Magnesium Corporation of America (``Magcorp''), the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 564, and the United Steelworkers of America, Local 8319 (collectively, the ``petitioners''). The petitioners submitted additional information supporting their allegations on April 7 and 14, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, the petitioners allege that imports of pure and alloy magnesium from the People's Republic of China (``PRC''), the Russian Federation, and Ukraine are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that such imports are materially injuring, or threatening material injury to, a U.S. industry. The petitioners stated that they have standing to file the petition because they are interested parties, as defined under sections 771(9)(C) and 771(9)(D) of the Act, and the petition is filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. Scope of Investigations For purposes of these initiations we are considering the products covered by these petitions to be two classes or kinds of merchandise, i.e. , pure magnesium and alloy magnesium. See, Concurrence Memo which is on file in the Central Records Unit, room B&hyph;099 of the Main Commerce Building. Petitioners contend that primary magnesium constitutes a single class or kind of merchandise under the Act. Petitioners argue that although the Department divided magnesium products into two classes or kinds (pure and alloy) in the final determination of Pure and Alloy Magnesium from Canada (July 13, 1992, 57 FR 30939), the imported merchandise in these investigations is different from that in the Canadian investigation. We invite interested parties to comment on this issue by May 13, 1994.
