British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd reiterated London's caution over NATO air strikes against Serb positions around the Bosnian capital, stressing that the indications of UN commanders on the ground should be the prime consideration. Hurd said that a NATO meeting to answer UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's air strike preparation call would take place on Wednesday [9 February] -- while German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told German radio that the meeting could come "as early as tomorrow. Everyone agrees that the order to attack must come from Butrus-Ghali," Kinkel said, adding that even with air strikes "the situation cannot be improved overnight," and recalling that U.S. President Bill Clinton has "given priority to a peaceful response." A spokesperson for Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said he had been in close telephone contact with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, adding that air strikes against any of the three sides in Bosnia "would only make sense if there is a good chance of them forcing the sides to compromise." In the present situation, their likelier effect would be the opposite, she said. International mediators Lord David Owen (for the EU) and Thorvald Stoltenberg (for the UN) announced in Belgrade that Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had agreed to talks, beginning in Geneva Thursday (when the broader peace talks resume), on the demilitarisation of Sarajevo to place the city under UN control. Bosnian (Muslim) state radio accused the Bosnian Croats of "taking advantage of the attention focused on Sarajevo" to step up bombing of the Herzegovina capital Mostar, where it reported 80 mortars falling during the night (one dead, several wounded) and heavy Croat use of surface-to-surface missiles this morning. Fighting was also reported in central Bosnia (where a general alert was sounded at Zenica) and in the north, around the Muslim enclave at Maglaj, where Serb and Croat forces are reported to be operating jointly against the Muslims. After a night of calm, the Serb artillery barrage of Sarajevo resumed this morning, hitting the suburbs of Zuc and Dobrinja. NATO diplomatic sources said later that for the moment no meeting of NATO foreign ministers is planned to discuss a response to Saturday's atrocity. There will probably be meetings of NATO's 16 ambassadors ahead of their scheduled meeting on Wednesday in the Atlantic Council, they said, while not ruling out a foreign ministers' meeting being decided at the EU meeting today and tomorrow. "Not only the honour, but the very future of the European Union is at stake in ex-Yugoslavia," French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told his confreres at the start of today's session, calling for a "clear stance" in favour of ordering Serb artillery to stay out of a 30-km radius around Sarajevo on pain of being hit. "France is ready to take on this responsibility," he said. But Greece, the one Balkan country in the European Union and the holder of the EU's rotating presidency, expressed opposition to air strikes or other military options for fear of igniting a full-scale Balkans war. Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta expressed support for the French idea of creating a security perimeter around Sarajevo, saying that "we have to use all instruments, political and military, to ease the situation in Bosnia before the Spring offensives." (In London, British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said that the use of military force would "endanger" aid supplies. He called on the international community to show "strong political determination.") (In Ankara, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel appealed to the international community to decide military action against the Serbian "aggressors" and lift the arms embargo preventing the Bosnian Muslims from properly defending themselves.)
