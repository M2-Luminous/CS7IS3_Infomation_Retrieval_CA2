Radovan Karadzic on Sunday ordered legal proceedings against and severe punishment of persons who have been trying to create chaos and discredit the civilian authorities of the Serb state. Karadzic gave strict orders for the investigation in Prijedor, a town in the western R.S., to be stepped up and all persons responsible for the latest developments in that town to be arrested, a statement released by the presidential office said. Karadzic stressed that the enemies of the R.S. were intensifying attacks on the republic's independence and sovereignty in an effort to create chaos, discredit the civilian authorities of the R.S., and thwart the functioning of the Serb state, the statement, a copy of which has been sent to TANJUG, said. The R.S. president gave strict orders to all civilian and military authorities to offer all necessary assistance to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). All perpetrators of the crimes will be tried and most severely punished before the eyes of the international public, Karadzic said. R.S. Prime Minister Vladimir Lukic on Saturday sharply protested because of an UNHCR report on an alleged deterioration of the position of Muslims and Croats in the region of the Bosnian Serb town of Banja Luka. UNHCR officials uncritically drew up the report solely on the basis of statements by the local bishop and mufti and representatives of the Catholic humanitarian organization Caritas, and failed even to mention the criminal charges brought against individuals engaged in criminal activities of damaging the property of Muslims and Croats in the Banja Luka region, Lukic said in a letter sent to the Zagreb-based UNHCR representative. The UNHCR report, which accused the R.S. authorities of allegedly not respecting the rights of the minority Muslim and Croat populations, was aimed at discrediting the R.S. authorities and attracting the attention of the international community and media, the R.S. prime minister said in the letter.
