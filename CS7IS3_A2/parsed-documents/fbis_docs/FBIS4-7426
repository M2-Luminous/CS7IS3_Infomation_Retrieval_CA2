FBIS4-7426 "dreas083_l_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 Philippines Ramos Supports Death Penalty for Drug Dealers Ramos Supports Death Penalty for Drug Dealers BK2904004694 Quezon City MALAYA in English 26 Apr 94 p 2 BK2904004694 Quezon City MALAYA English BFN [Text] The Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur is asking the government to formally ask Malaysia to grant executive clemency for humanitarian reasons to three Filipinos who were meted death sentences for drug trafficking in Sabah two weeks ago. Officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs yesterday said the recommendation sent by Ambassador to Malaysia Alberto Encomienda will be submitted to President Ramos who will decide whether formal representations will be made regarding the issue. The plea hangs in the balance, this early though, as Ramos yesterday issued a statement that drug traffickers should not expect any pardon from him. At the fifth ASEAN workshop for nongovernment organizations for the prevention of drug and substance abuse held in Malacanang [presidential office], Ramos said, "Let me clearly indicate that I will interpose no objection if any person, so convicted, is sent to the electric chair or gas chamber." Last 14 April, the Malaysian Supreme Court ordered the hanging of Japlin Jimlok, Benny Saman, and Gan Muslimin, all based in Kota Kinabalu, after they were convicted of drug trafficking by the High Courts in Sabah. The three Filipinos are now awaiting their execution at the Kapaya State Prison in Sabah. On the same day, nine other Filipinos, including a woman, had their death sentences reduced to life imprisonment for the same offense. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo said Ramos has ordered Philippine officials in Kuala Lumpur to look into reports that a number of imprisoned Filipinos in Sandakan, Sabah were tortured by police and prison authorities. Last 21 April, 11 Filipinos who were deported and imprisoned in Sandakan complained that other Filipinos currently serving jail terms in Sabah are also subjected to various forms of torture like having their heads banged on walls and dunked in toilet bowls, and their skin carved off the soles of their feet.
