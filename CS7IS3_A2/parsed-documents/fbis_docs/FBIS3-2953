Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said that the planned new issuance of 5.5 billion yuan in shares for 1994 will be conducted in accordance with market situations. They will be floated in the latter part of this year or next year. This year, the state-owned and corporate-owned shares won't be listed on the exchange for trading due to the current limited conditions. And no stock revenue tax will be levied, Liu added in his address to over 1,000 delegates from all over the country. This SSE meeting will also discuss its working report and budget project, revise its regulations and elect its board of directors. In 1993, the Shanghai equity market developed into a national market, with brisk state bond transactions, its upgrading of trading facilities and steady rises in B stocks.
