[passage omitted] Asked whether Greece violates international law with the measures against Skopje, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the Greek Government calmly and carefully examined all aspects, both legal and political. On the goods that are allowed to move from Thessaloniki port to and from Skopje, Venizelos said the National Economy Ministry will issue a circular with instructions based on the decisions made by the government yesterday. The ministry will define the scope of the customs authorities' authority. He said, however, that there is a complete ban excluding only diplomatic, UN, and CSCE delegations. [passage omitted] Diplomatic correspondent Mirella Kalostipi reported a short time ago that with the adoption of measures against Skopje, the Greek Government aims to make this state realize its provocative stance toward Greece. According to reliable information, the measures may become even harsher if Skopje continues its intransigence. The Greek side is convinced that the specific measures do not violate either European or international law. Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou today said that Skopje should finally get reasonable. Asked whether the measures were adopted at the wrong time, Papandreou said the time was wrong for various countries to recognize Skopje. Mentioning that there is a crisis in Athens-Skopje relations, Papandreou said he hopes a solution is found through this crisis. He added that the Greek Government believes the measures will lead more directly and effectively to a solution of the problem. [passage omitted] Asked how much the measures against Skopje will affect the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the possible bombing, the government spokesman said the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina and NATO decisions have no connection with Skopje.
