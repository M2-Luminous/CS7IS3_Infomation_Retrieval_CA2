At a meeting with journalists today, he said that the preservation of the customs union was important, mainly in view of the expected integration into the European Union. The prime minister also called for a solution to yet-unresolved problems. At the same time, however, he expressed doubts as to whether this could be achieved during the six months of his government's term of office. Moravcik said it would be a great success if the division of assets of the former Federation was finally resolved. He would also like to improve Slovak-Hungarian relations, which were considerably tense during Meciar's rule, before the Paris conference (?of the Pact) on stability in Europe.
