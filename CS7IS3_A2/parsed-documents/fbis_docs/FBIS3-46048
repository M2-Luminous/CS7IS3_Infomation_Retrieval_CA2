Jia Qinglin, secretary of the provincial party committee, provincial governor, and first secretary of the provincial military district's party committee, attended the session and made an important speech. On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, Jia Qinglin expressed his kind regards to all officers and soldiers of the provincial military district and wished them a happy new year. He thanked all officers and men who have defended, supported, and contributed to Fujian's two civilizations. Subsequently, he briefed them on Fujian's achievements in establishing the socialist market economic structure and other aspects of social undertakings. Jia Qinglin said: All these achievements cannot be separated from the support of the People's Liberation Army or from the hard work of soldiers and civilians. Jia Qinglin pointed out: To scale a new height in economic development, Fujian needs a more stable and relaxed environment. Armed forces units in the provincial military district undertake the important responsibility of safeguarding the motherland's southeastern coast. They should have a strong sense of mission and responsibility, strengthen their training on combat readiness, improve their tactics and skills, and enhance their combat effectiveness. Jia Qinglin stressed: In this new situation when we are stepping up the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, we should make major efforts to carry forward the Fujian Army's and civilians' glorious tradition in two-support work, strengthen the unity between the Army and the government and between the Army and civilians, enhance the friendship between the Army and localities and between the Army and civilians, and jointly create a safe and stable social environment. The session summed up the provincial military district's work last year and arranged this year's work. At the session, the provincial military district commended a number of advanced units and individuals and conferred Merit Citation Class Two and Three on those who had performed extraordinarily well.
