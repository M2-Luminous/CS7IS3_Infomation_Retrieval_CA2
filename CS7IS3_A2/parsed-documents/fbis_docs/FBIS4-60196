The missile fell on a house in the Khormaksar district causing widespread damage and cutting electricity supplies to the area. All the casualties were from the same family, ambulance crews said. The attack was the first missile strike on Aden since the proclamation 24 hours ago of an independent state in the south in what used to be the Marxist republic of South Yemen. Two Scud missiles fell on the port city overnight Thursday as fighting raged between the northern troops of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and southern troops backing former vice-president 'Ali Salim al-Bid. The attack came two hours after a five-man presidential council was officially named to head the southern independent state proclaimed overnight Friday by al-Bid, the leader of the Yemeni Socialist Party, the reformed ex-ruling party in South Yemen. The north and south, which united four years ago Sunday, have been embroiled in a civil war since May 4.
