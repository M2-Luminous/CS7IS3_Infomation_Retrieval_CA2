And, Apparently, They Will Have None"] [Text] In the spring of 1994 the hopes and expectations, declarations and promises, disenchantments and lost illusions will be nine years old. The ideologists and the ideology of reform have changed. There is no longer any mention of the initial objective of restructuring the economic mechanism--the creation of a state system that stimulates a desire to work, which has no restrictions on wages and enables people to live better and better. The people are remembered when there is a real threat of social upheaval, when the government is taking spur-of-the-moment measures to quell the rising antagonisms. That is the way it was and still is in relations with miners, gas extraction workers, petroleum workers, peasants, metallurgists, etc. As a result, two levels of socioeconomic perception have taken form today: --first, the theorizing, governmental one which, in spite of and without accounting for the results of voting, sociological polls, and domestic social and economic prognoses, has relied on the questionable practice of listening to foreign advisers, using any means available to construct a model of a postsocialist society that is unfamiliar to the broad masses; --second, the nationwide level, oppressed by the nightmare of the collapse of the homeland, unbridled inflation, and the growing squall of poverty and unemployment. According to the estimate of Andres Ostlund from the Stockholm School of Economics, who until the middle of January 1994 was an economic adviser to the Russian Government, inflation in the country during 1993 alone amounted to 850 percent. The research division of the All-Russian State Company (TV4R) during October-November 1993 conducted a mass sociological poll of the population of the European part of Russia with a representative sampling involving 1,224 people. Among others, the respondents were asked questions about monetary savings. As a result of the poll it became clear that 57.0 percent of the citizens have no savings, 27.0 percent have money in the Savings Bank, and they are mainly elderly people, and one can confidently assume that whatever dealings the majority of them have with the bank are dealings involving pension accounts. Commercial banks are used by 3.2 percent of those questioned and savings are kept in stocks and bonds by about 3.0 percent of the citizens. About 4.0 percent use the services of savings and commercial banks at the same time. Thus 84.0 percent of the population of Russia have no guarantee of social stability. This is the large proportion of the population that is actively joining the constantly growing stratum of the so-called aggressive underclass. In the opinion of another former adviser to the Russian Government, Jeffrey Sachs from Harvard University, published by the newspaper THE NEW YORK TIMES, the failure of the reforms is explained by the West's slowness in rendering financial aid to Russia: "Of the 18 billion which the IMF and the World Bank were to have turned over to Russia, only 2 billion has been received." In Sachs' opinion this kind of "support" for the reformers will cost the West dearly. In the opinion of that same FINANCIAL TIMES, "By saving a kopek but losing a ruble, the leaders of the West have possibly made the biggest mistake since Versailles." On the crest of the so-called Russian nationalism, new meaning has been given to the idea of reinforcing the NATO bloc. The tone of statements in the Washington administration has changed. An administration expert on the former USSR, Strobe Talbott, stated that Russian leaders should worry more about unemployment and street crime--whatever is bothering the simple people most. The administration of the IMF and World Bank assert that they have always recommended that the Moscow government develop programs capable of satisfying the "real needs" of the population. Former USSR president M. Gorbachev in November 1993 was speaking in Richmond (the state of Virginia) at an international forum organized by FORTUNE magazine. Regarding questions of the crisis situation in the country and the role of the West, he said "The problem is that the method of conducting economic reforms was rejected at the level of society. "The market is needed...but the negative results from it turned out to be greater than the positive. Production dropped by 40 percent as compared to 1989. In terms of living conditions the country was thrown back 20 years, to the beginning of the seventies. "What happened to the Western capital? Why is Russia not suitable for investing capital? We have less risk for investors than other countries do. The October revolution will not be repeated and we can solve the other problems along with you. In terms of business prospects, our country cannot even be compared with any other. "You have not resolved the main problem: Are you going to cooperate with Russia or not? There is a desire to keep Russia in the role of an appendage for supplying raw material to the West. We have received from your investors absolutely no proposals for reorganizing the Russian machine-building industry. When it comes to petroleum and other raw material--sure. But not machine building. "Russia will never agree to play the role of a younger brother or a junior partner...in this respect it is closed, it will establish the conditions it needs and, relying on its own people, its own educated cadres, will prove itself. But the West will get a hostile armed regime." What Is Happening in the Military-Industrial Complex? Events are developing tragically in industry, and above all in the military-industrial complex. According to data from the Russian Federation State Statistical Administration, last year there was a maximum reduction of output in branches that produce defense products--by more than 30 percent. According to data of the intelligence administration of the U.S. Defense Department, the decline of arms production in the Russian Federation amounted to: for attack helicopters--1990--70 and 1992--five; for artillery systems--1,990 and 450, respectively; for missiles with laser warheads--190 and 45; for fighter-bombers--575 and 150; for combat infantry vehicles--3,600 and 1,100; for submarines--20 and eight; tanks--1,300 and 675; and bombers--35 and 20. (The figures for 1990 were for the USSR and for 1992--for Russia.) Since 1989 the volume of state allocations for the production of arms and military equipment has decreased in real terms by 78 percent, and financing for scientific research and experimental design work has decreased by almost as much. In 1993 the client (the state) owed the defense industry about 300 billion rubles [R] and it had not paid its bills for 1992 to many enterprises. By adopting a policy of state responsibility, the government is again discrediting itself, since it does not have a real economic basis for fulfilling the commitments it has made, and it even has an immense budget deficit. As a way out of the situation that has been created it would be possible to adopt a simplified version of the decision--to reduce the number of enterprises for whose financing the state bears responsibility. As a result, privatization could also affect those enterprises that must remain state enterprises, but the government will apparently have to "push" them into the market sphere. This is why the Ministry of Finance has the last word in the organization of the country's defense capability. Salvaging Weapons and the Capabilities of the Budget The deadline for storing certain kinds of weapons will expire in the near future--about 70 percent of the overall volume subject to being salvaged. Several thousand square kilometers of land have been set aside for warehouses for equipment that is ready for salvaging. Additionally, in keeping with international agreements, Russia must eliminate several classes of missiles and infantry weapons, which make up 30 percent of the volume. A federal program has been developed for salvaging arms and military equipment for the period up to the year 2000. The program is divided into two stages. The first stage (1993-1995)--the development of documents, the selection of a strategy and tactics, the introduction of new technologies--will require R2.4-3.4 trillion in the prices of the third quarter of 1993. This is to be financed from the state budget, foreign aid, and private investments from within Russia. As for foreign investments, during the next 1.5 to two years the United States is promising Russia aid with equipment and technology for a total of $800 million, and Japan is promising another $100 million. A number of Italian and German firms are expected to participate. So far, in the words of Nikolay Shumkov, chief of the main administration for guarantee of supervision and salvaging of arms of the Russian Committee on the Defense Industry, R2 billion of Russian origin can be considered real investments. Taking the budget deficit into account, this will be another problem in converting Russia's defense complex. Prices in Russia--Higher Than World Prices In 1993 (according to data from the Ministry of Economics), prices of certain kinds of foods that make up the basis of the subsistence minimum of the population of Russia were equal to world prices or higher. In particular, the price of one tonne of sugar in Russia reached $650, while its price on the world market was $350, vegetable oil--$1,300 and $660 respectively; beef--$1,900 and $480 respectively; butter--$1,900 and $1,700; pollack--$700 and $400; and flour--$280 and $215. In 1994 the prices of these and certain other products on the domestic market could rise significantly (up to 1.5-twofold). Who Will Buy the Land In the opinion of specialists of the Russian Agency for Investments and Real Estate, the land market in the Moscow area has already taken form and the current tendencies in supply and demand will continue in the future. Up to this point the buyers have been commercial banks, which have acquired the right to own plots of land and now intend to turn them into private property. The sellers are entrepreneurial structures, local administrations, and joint-stock sovkhozes that are experiencing a critical need for money. Recently there have been so-called pure firms which were created especially for buying and selling land. The object of the transactions of the present day are mainly sections of land of up to 10 hectares. Of the total demand, 90 percent is for sections for suburban homes. The buyers are not only the future homeowners but also firms that intend to build cottages for subsequent sale. Of the plots that are acquired, 2 percent are intended for entrepreneurial activity, mainly for construction of gas stations and campgrounds, and 8 percent of the applications are for garden plots. In a year and a half not a single plot has been acquired for organizing any kind of agricultural production.
