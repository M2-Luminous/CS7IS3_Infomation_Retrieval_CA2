FR941213-2-00011 FR941213-2-00005 Surrogate Country Section 773(c)(4) of the Act requires the Department to value the NME producers' factors of production, to the extent possible, in one or more market economies that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the NME country and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department has determined that Indonesia is the most suitable surrogate for purposes of this investigation. Based on available statistical information, Indonesia is at a level of economic development comparable to that of the PRC, and Indonesian export statistics indicate that the country is a significant producer of lighters. Based on available information, Indonesia is the only surrogate country, of those identified by our Office of Policy, that meet both of these criteria. (See, memorandum to the file from Todd Hansen to Carole Showers, dated December 5, 1994, Surrogate Country Selection and memorandum from David Mueller, Director, Office of Policy to Susan Kuhbach, Director, Office of Countervailing Investigations, dated September 8, 1994, Lighters from the People's Republic of China, Non-Market Economy Status and Surrogate Country Selection.) Fair Value Comparisons To determine whether sales of lighters from the PRC by COTCO, Gao Yao, GLIP, PolyCity and Cli-Claque were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of the notice.
