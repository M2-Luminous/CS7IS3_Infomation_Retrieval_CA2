To help various localities continue stepping up their drug control program, the Ministry of Culture and Information recently delivered an additional eight sets of television and video cassette players together with video films in the Mandarin and H'mong languages to various sensitive areas for the various propaganda teams to entertain the people in the mountain regions during the Tet new year festival. During the first quarter of this year, a series of publications including one on paintings and photographs for exhibition purposes, a pamphlet with questions and answers on the drug issue, a book of songs and poems, and a pictoral pamphlet on drug control will be widely published in mountain regions, especially in areas where poppy growing and opium smoking have become traditional activities. On this occasion, the participating comrades proposed that the government and relevant ministries and sectors make an appropriate investment in the information and propaganda task. In particular, an economic policy must be mapped out for those areas where the compatriots are shifting from poppy growing to substitute crops.
