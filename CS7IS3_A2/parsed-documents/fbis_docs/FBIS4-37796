He said that both Iran and Egypt are of major importance due to their unique positions on the world map. He invited the United Arab Emirates [UAE] to visit Teheran to continue the dialogue over the three islands. Velayati denied that his country has given support to any terrorist group in Egypt or Algeria. He noted that Egypt and Iran have to cooperate in the regional and international spheres. He also denied that there are Egyptian prisoners in Iran from the Iraqi-Iranian war, stressing that all Egyptian prisoners have been handed over to Egypt. On the obstacles impeding the restoration of relations between Egypt and Iran, Velayati said that Israel and cooperation with it are the main obstacles. [Amin] Does this apply to all the Arab countries with which you have good relations but which are seeking peace with Israel? [Velayati] The matter differs from one country to another according to the interest that countries show toward Israel. Our relations are based on this. [Amin] This means that you do not now support the Palestinian cause, especially after the Palestinian-Israeli agreement? [Velayati] Palestine does not have a united stand. We support justice and reject humiliation for the Palestinian people at the hands of Israel, which is looking to increase its hegemony over the other countries in the region. Therefore, we will not stand idle and see the whole region fall under Israeli hegemony. [Amin] But the international conditions have changed, the power struggle in the world is over, and the current move is toward peace. [Velayati] Do the international conditions allow one party alone to use force but not others? If this is the new world reality, then does this mean that we should all rush to hand over the region, which is the heart of the Islamic world, to the enemies, when our grandfathers fought for more than two centuries? Are we required to be beaten and to depend on Israel's mercy? [Amin] If the parties to the conflict have accepted a peaceful solution, why then this insistence on continuing the fighting and the armed confrontation? [Velayati] The struggle must continue. We have before us the example of South Africa, which we supported. Certainly, any step must have an effect. There is a difference between those who welcome and bless peace and those who are compelled to make peace. [Amin] Then, in your view, the Palestinians and Syrians are being compelled to reach an agreement and to go along with the peace process? [Velayati] They are certainly being compelled to do so. What is happening in Gaza now is ample proof of this. 'Arafat is merely the mayor of Gaza and Jericho and his entry there means that Israel has become the master of the situation in the region. Hence, the Palestinian-Israeli agreement is not a profitable deal. [Amin] This means Iran will not back the Palestinian self-rule authority. [Velayati] Of course we will not back Palestinian self-rule, because while Israel has given back one part, it has taken 100 parts in a strange and unequal deal. [Amin] What about Gulf security? [Velayati] The security of the region cannot be established except through the desire of the Gulf countries themselves. [Amin] Will this take place by establishing a strong joint military force or a united organization? [Velayati] These are the many and varied stages of the road to cooperation. It starts out with economic, political, and security cooperation. But we have not yet discussed the origins and bases of the idea. Unfortunately, we in the Gulf region have got the big arms-exporting powers used to making us various offers of arms deals. They create a whimsical danger to blackmail the region and stockpile arms there. The danger is constantly being moved around and the attrition continues. [Amin] If Iran realizes the effects of the arms race in the region, why does it participate as a major party? [Velayati] We are the country in the region that buys the least amount of weapons in relation to our population. Our expenditure on arms does not exceed 4 percent of the Iranian budget. [Amin] What about the Gulf countries with a low population density? [Velayati] If this criterion is applied, every small country would have the right to buy more weapons than it could absorb. This is a dangerous criterion to apply. [Amin] What about your stance regarding arms deals with the United States? [Velayati] The United States does not sell us weapons. It has frozen all deals made with it during the shah's rule. We are getting our weapons from other sources. [Amin] Your stance on the occupation of the three UAE islands, Tunb al-Sughra, Tunb al-Kubra, and Abu Musa, constitutes an obstacle to restoring confidence with the Arabian Gulf states. [Velayati] We are fully confident that if there is to be a solution to this problem, it must take place through peaceful dialogue. But if one party wants to corner the other party and internationalize the problem, this party will lose more than the other. We started peaceful dialogue with the UAE in Abu Dhabi a year ago and agreed to convene a second meeting for dialogue in Tehran. That meeting has not taken place. Velayati said that through AL-AHRAM he extends an invitation to the UAE foreign minister to visit Tehran to continue their peaceful dialogue regarding the islands anytime he likes. [Amin] There are some accusations indicating that Iran backs the terrorist organizations hiding behind the guise of religion in the region. [Velayati] We vehemently deny these accusations. Let anyone who has proof of this come forward. We have never supported any terrorist group in Egypt or Algeria. Unfortunately, some Western forces are playing a major role in escalating terrorist and extremist currents in the region. [Amin] What is your comment on events in Yemen? [Velayati] We support the continuation of unity in Yemen and a peaceful solution of all the problems that pose an obstacle to the march of unity. We support solving problems through dialogue, not fighting.
