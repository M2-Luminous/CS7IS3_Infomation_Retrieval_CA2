That is the mildest way the matter can be explained. The injustice that has been done to Turkey can be clearly observed if the developments on the matter are listed in chronological order as follows: 1. Turkey discussed the withdrawal of the oil in the pipeline and the prevention of corrosion in the installations with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Oxman when he visited Ankara some time ago. Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin also held talks on the matter when he visited the United States. Meanwhile, the officials of the two countries discussed the matter in their bilateral talks. In other words, Turkey indicated that it does not intend to take any secret action on the matter. 2. However, the Clinton Administration refrained from responding to Turkey's appeals each and every time they were made. 3. The last time the matter was discussed was when Prime Minister Ciller visited Washington. Considering Washington's reluctance to express its opinion, Turkey informed the U.S. Administration again that it will launch a limited operation to save the pipeline. Turkey was right because the United States has condoned Jordan's behavior, which conflicts with the requirements of the embargo on Iraq. King Husayn has been able to sell anything he wishes to that country. However, Turkey has been the country that has suffered most from the embargo. 4. It was at about that time that Ambassador Richard Barkley discussed the matter with Under Secretary of Defense Frank Wisner and Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles Freeman when he held talks with them after the downing of two helicopters over northern Iraq. 5. That was when the United States brought up the question of the oil pipeline, as if it were the first time the United States had become aware of that issue. The U.S. officials insisted that the embargo on Iraq must not be violated. Ambassador Barkley informed Wisner and Freeman that he would contact Ankara and brief them on the matter later. 6. In his first message to Washington, Ambassador Barkley said that Turkey did not plan to violate the embargo. He also explained that, although the U.S. side was informed, Washington has not conveyed the proposals it promised to Ankara. 7. However, we have ascertained that the messages Ambassador Barkley conveyed to Washington later claimed that Turkey had made an effort to unilaterally violate the embargo on Iraq. His messages made Washington feel very uneasy. 8. While Ambassador Nuzhet Kandemir prepared to convey Turkey's official reply to the U.S. Administration in Washington, Ambassador Barkley called on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to complain. 9. The Turkish and U.S. officials discussed the matter for the last time in New York. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin informed Ambassador Albright that Turkey will not use the funds that will be raised from the sale of the oil in the pipeline. He gave Jordan as an example. Ambassador Albright informed him that the U.S. Administration will reply to Turkey in seven days. 10. Meanwhile, the Turkish officials were aware that Ambassador Barkley conveyed unfavorable reports to Washington against Turkey. They were also aware of the exaggerated views he conveyed for the U.S. State Department's Human Rights Report. Meanwhile, it has been claimed that the way he expressed himself in reports he sent to Washington on the Kurds in Turkey prompted the Clinton Administration to place the concept of a political solution to the Kurdish problem on its agenda. Turkey made an effort to hold talks with the U.S. Administration, the White House, and other U.S. establishments on several problems during the past year. It brought up those problems even during luncheons. However, Ankara has been surprised by the way the Clinton Administration has insisted on not understanding Turkey's position. I wonder whether the situation would have been different if Ambassador Barkley had taken the time to consider the matter before he conveyed messages to Washington? In fact, I believe that things would have been different. It is a fact that Ambassador Barkley stands to gain nothing from the existing tension in relations between Turkey and the United States. As an ambassador who has disrupted relations between the two countries, he may find it difficult to secure a position in the U.S. State Department when he returns to Washington at the end of his tour in Ankara. Meanwhile, the tense relations may lead to an "economic threat" against Turkey. I would not like to be the person blamed for that state of affairs. That is a friendly warning while there is still time.
