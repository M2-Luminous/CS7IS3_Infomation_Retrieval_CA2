It improved from minus 0.8 percent in December 1993 to minus 0.5 percent in January 1994, and was thus 0.7 percentage points above last year's January value. Despite the recently differing developments of the individual values that make up the early indicator, it looks as if the turn of the tide has meanwhile been completed. Although the demand in the manufacturing industry in October only barely managed to maintain the value of the previous month, for the first time in a longer period the corresponding value of the previous year was not only attained but even exceeded by a narrow margin. It is now more than six months ago that the absolute low in the developments was recorded in March. Since then, demand has gradually picked up, all in all more than 5 percent. The demand in the main construction industry has been relatively steady again. After the slump of the second quarter of the year, which was mainly caused by public civil engineering, order books have meanwhile consolidated again at a higher level. In September another increase of almost 1 percent was achieved over August. Last year's level was thus exceeded by 2 percent. The retail trade remains a problem child of the economy. After sales in real terms managed to get out of the low of the middle of the year with great difficulty during recent months, October was anything but a golden month for retail trade revenues. On the contrary, the sales adjusted for price changes and seasonal variations were down 3.3 percent over the previous month. With 0.6 percent, the margin between short- and long-term interests slightly improved in November; temporarily prevalent expectations that the interest structure would normalize by the end of 1993 have, however, proved too optimistic. Nevertheless, one should not be dissatisfied with the developments in the capital markets; long-term interest rates, which are so important for long-term financing, fell by another two percentage points in November, while the three-month Fibor rate decreased even more strongly (0.3 percentage points). Altogether, the economic situation at the beginning of the year still appears to be in a precarious state, although it is certainly on the way to recovery. The main positive aspect is that the general mood has changed in favor of the optimists. The Economic Research Institute index for the business climate in the manufacturing industry managed to recover further in November; with minus 27.6 points after minus 30.3 points in the previous month, it is now clearly more favorable that one year ago (minus 40.3 percent in November 1992).
