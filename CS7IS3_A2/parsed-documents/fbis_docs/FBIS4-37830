The Cabinet discussed, within the course charted by his excellency for its actions and discussions, subjects related to improving production, efficient performance, flexibility and quick response in the administrative field, and fairness and balance between duties and rights. The Cabinet discussed a plan to produce and improve seeds, executed by al-Iba' Agricultural Research Center, which this year achieved self-sufficiency in the production of potato seeds and is seeking to achieve self-sufficiency in the production of seeds for some vegetables and legumes. The Cabinet decided to support al-Iba' Center with the necessary financial funds to maintain the link between the center and potato growers. The Cabinet also discussed the situation of the cooperative movement in the country, its structures, and the proposals made to develop it. In this regard, the leader president, may God protect him, stressed the need for discussing how the cooperative societies can develop their own resources and not turn to state support except in emergency cases. He said we must distinguish between incorrect implementations and the lack of correct or fair programs. The cooperative movement, he said, must play its role among the people within the concept of cooperation. His excellency urged the ministers, saying: When you propose a law or an amendment to a law, your main concern must be how this law or amendment will achieve justice and how will it take into consideration the interests of all people in a fair way. Any law that ignores this basic aspect or includes an accumulation of forbidden things, particularly the unnecessary ones, will help create a trend to violate it. The application of a fair law, in which obligations and rights are balanced and clear, will not only achieve justice, but will also ease the pressure on courts. His excellency said: We must also take note that certain policies and laws are right in certain circumstances. But when the circumstances change, we must set a new policy, a course, and legislation must correspond to our new circumstances instead of harming the citizen and the state and not achieving the justice required by the new circumstance. His excellency added: Each minister must review the laws within the context of this course, which will make one take pride in the state and belonging to it. Proposals to consider these laws must be made. We still have work to build upon and we can do this as quickly as we can.
