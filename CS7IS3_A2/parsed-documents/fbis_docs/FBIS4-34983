Father Aristide told U.S. public radio on 25 June that he would never return to power by way of intervention, which the United States does not rule out if the latest measures do not have the desired effect. Jacques Maurice reports: [Maurice] President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has finally spoken his mind about threats of U.S. military intervention in Haiti. The former Saint-Jean Bosco parish priest expressed opposition to military intervention in his country a few hours after the latest U.S. measures -- aimed at commercial flights and financial transactions -- took effect. He noted that the Haitian Constitution forbids him from making such a request. The president-in-exile said: I oppose military intervention and military occupation. Aristide called for a surgical strike to dislodge the military in power in a NEW YORK TIMES interview. I will never, never, never return to power by way of intervention, President Aristide added, explaining that he has always opposed the idea of U.S. military intervention. Aristide opposed establishing a Haitian army-in-exile aimed at overthrowing the military regime in power in Port-au-Prince. On 3 June, the ousted president insisted on quick and determined U.S. action to remove those responsible for the coup d'etat, but within the scope of the Governors Island agreement signed on 3 July. Aristide has clearly expressed his position on U.S. military intervening in Haiti to restore him to power. This is not the Clinton administration's opinion. The U.S. President still does not rule out military intervention in Haiti if international sanctions do not force the military in power to surrender. Both sides are prepared. The U.S. armada remains anchored in Haitian territorial waters. A plane is conducting reconnaissance flights in the southeast. U.S. crews are nearing the northern coast and are imposing their authority. (?Border guards) are ready to help in case of failure. Thousands of Dominican soldiers patrol the Haitian-Dominican border, soldiers who could not stop trafficking in gasoline, yet could kill a young Haitian trying to cross into the Dominican Republic. The Haitian military is also prepared. Troops are mobilizing, garrisons are being visited, demonstrators are protesting intervention, homage is being paid to ancestors, and 1,001 strategies are being prepared. A military official, who has asked to remain anonymous, said that more civilians than can be imagined are ready to fight alongside the military. Another official said that the Haitian Army has prepared many surprises for the invaders. The U.S. Government is considering two alternatives: to launch a campaign on the airwaves to promote discord within Army ranks and well-to-do Haitians to rise up against military officials or intervene militarily to restore democracy but not to return Aristide to power.
