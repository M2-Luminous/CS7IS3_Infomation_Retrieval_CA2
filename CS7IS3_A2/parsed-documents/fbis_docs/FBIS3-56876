[Shakhray] I am generally a cautious, prudent person. And if I act this way, it means there is a plan. Besides, I have my own principles. I do not think politics is a dirty business. It is just necessary that moves and actions should be public, intelligible. [passage omitted] [Koposova] Do you regret your openness? [Shakhray] Why should I? My answer was really honest. I said: "There is a time for everything." And I cited three conditions given which one can aspire to the presidential office. First, to be trusted by people. Second, to have political structures nominate you. Third, you must have initial funds for an election campaign. They singled out only one idea: he wants to be president. [Koposova] Some observers have gathered the impression that you are drifting away from the president. Some, on the contrary, continue to see you as the "president's permanent representative." What is the real position? [Shakhray] I do not think either are right. I set off on an "independent voyage" on 6 May 1992. [Koposova] But while on this "independent voyage" you remained a "president's representative" at the Congress, at the Constitutional Court's CPSU hearing.... [Shakhray] Nothing of the kind. I was no longer his representative at the Congress. The whole thing at the Constitutional Court was on a voluntary basis. I was not paid for it. I was a rank-and-file member on the Supreme Soviet Committee for legislation. The reason was that I cannot tell people no. [passage omitted] [Koposova] How do you visualize the further federative process given the fact that not all federation components have voted for the Constitution? [Shakhray] The Constitution was approved by citizens, not the components. Citizens approved it -- the Constitution is in force in all components of the Russian Federation. Having written in stone the principle of equality of components of the Russian Federation, the Constitution incorporated the first part of the Federation Treaty, namely, the sphere of delimitation of powers in the republics. I have said more than once that the Federation cannot arise overnight -- this is a complex process spread over many years.... [Koposova] Still, you expect the republics to agree with these arguments and sit back? [Shakhray] The year 1994 will be a year of interethnic and regional frictions, and conflicts -- this much is apparent to me. This process is unfortunately inevitable. [Koposova] It is apparently in order to ease the process that you had an idea for setting up a news corporation. I realize the need. A very short time ago, the former "Ostankino" chiefs prevented you from going on the air.... [Shakhray] I was hoping that this blocking, especially on television, would end as the election campaign got under way. But this was not to be. The hushing up continues. The news corporation will comprise a newspaper, a magazine, and radio and television devoted to the same regional and national subjects. It is shameful that for more than a year and a half I have been trying to arrange for premises for the State Committee for Nationalities Policy. This problem typifies the authorities' attitude to the nationalities and regions policy in our country. Moscow, Russia's capital, is unable to provide a normal building for personal contacts between representatives of 150 peoples and representatives of 89 regions. [Koposova] Is there any progress? [Shakhray] There is. Two stories in one building have already been won. [Koposova] How do you assess the resignations of your associates in the Party of Russian Unity and Accord? [Shakhray] This sort of an attitude to the leaders of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord will lead to a position where the party in the Duma will have to take a more wary stand toward drafts from the top. If one is to speak seriously about coalitions in parliament, we will not be subsumed in some sorts of associations, but we are ready to cooperate with the democratic groups. Despite the fact that our own people continue to slight us. Even PRAVDA writes that the votes garnered by the Party of Russian Unity and Accord are an appreciable gain for the democratic bloc, whereas our own people say that Shakhray diverted the votes. It is simply because we have a different program, and different voters. I do not rule out the chances of interaction with Civic Union, the Democratic Party of Russia, even with the Communist Party, on a range of questions: the preserving of the Russian Federation, the consolidation of the Commonwealth in the sense of further economic and political integration, the war on crime. [Koposova] The president has once again stated his intention to create his own party, from various democratic forces at that. What do you think about this idea? Will you take part? [Shakhray] The party cannot consist of Russia's Choice, the Democratic Party of Russia, Yabloko, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, etc. A party is a qualitatively different association. We support the president, but this does not indicate that we are going to be a component of his party. [Koposova] Many today are analyzing mistakes of the election campaign. Are you going to draw lessons too? [Shakhray] By all means. But this is not all. Who said the elections have been lost? Given today's economic situation, where wages are unpaid for months, the Constitution has been passed. And the democrats in the parliament have three times as many seats as in the previous one. As for our party, we cleared the 15-percent hurdle in 70 regions. In many republics we also left behind both Zhirinovskiy and Russia's Choice.
