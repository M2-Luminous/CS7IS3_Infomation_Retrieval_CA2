ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: This document prescribes final regulations under section 1374 relating to the tax imposed on an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain. The final regulations reflect changes to the law in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The final regulations generally affect only corporations that changed from C to S status. DATES: These regulations are effective December 27, 1994. These regulations apply to taxable years ending on or after December 27, 1994, but only in cases where the return for the taxable year is filed pursuant to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after December 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark S. Jennings or Lee D. Muchnikoff, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Corporate), Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20224 (Attention: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R), or telephone (202) 622&hyph;7530 (not a toll free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 1. Background Section 1374 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) generally imposes a corporate-level tax on an S corporation's recognition of income or gain to the extent the income or gain reflects unrealized appreciation (or its equivalent) in the corporation when it converted from C to S status. Section 1374 was amended to provide this treatment as part of the legislation repealing the General Utilities rule. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 841, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., Vol. II, 198&hyph;207 (1986), 1986&hyph;3 C.B., Vol. 4, 198&hyph;207. Section 1374 generally applies to an S corporation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, but only if the corporation elects S status after December 31, 1986. Sections 1374(e) and 337(d) provide specific authority to promulgate regulations under section 1374. Proposed regulations under section 1374 were published in the Federal Register on December 8, 1992 (57 FR 57971, or 1992&hyph;2 C.B. 594). This document adds new §§1.1374&hyph;0 through 1.1374&hyph;10 to 26 CFR Part 1. 2. Section 1374 and the Proposed Regulations Section 1374(a) imposes a tax on an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year beginning in the 10-year recognition period following the S corporation's conversion from a C corporation or acquisition of C corporation assets in a carryover basis transaction. The proposed regulations provide that an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year is the least of (1) its taxable income determined by using the rules applying to C corporations and considering only recognized built-in gain and recognized built-in loss (the pre-limitation amount), (2) its taxable income determined by using the rules applying to C corporations and considering all items except as provided under section 1375(b)(1)(B) (the taxable income limitation), or (3) the excess of its net unrealized built-in gain over net recognized built-in gain for all prior taxable years in the recognition period (the net unrealized built-in gain limitation). Section 1374(d)(3) provides that any gain recognized on the disposition of an asset during the recognition period is recognized built-in gain except to the extent the S corporation establishes that it did not hold the asset on the first day of the recognition period or the asset appreciated after that day. Section 1374(d)(4) provides that any loss recognized on a disposition of an asset during the recognition period is recognized built-in loss to the extent the S corporation establishes that it held the asset on the first day of the recognition period and the asset depreciated before that day. The proposed regulations provide that sections 1374(d) (3) and (4) apply only to transactions treated as sales or exchanges under the Code.
