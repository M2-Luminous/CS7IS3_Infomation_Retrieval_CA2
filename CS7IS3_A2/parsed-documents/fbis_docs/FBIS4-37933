FBIS4-37933 "drnes123_l_94007" FBIS-NES-94-123 Daily Report 26 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Chief of Staff, Opposition React Chief of Staff, Opposition React TA2606125794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1100 GMT 26 Jun 94 TA2606125794 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Excerpts] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq has expressed satisfaction with the Shamgar Commission's findings and said it is a comprehensive and in-depth report that relates to the roots of the incident and shows what must be done. The chief of staff expressed satisfaction with the fact that no steps need be taken against Army officers. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will study the findings carefully, and it is still unclear if disciplinary measures will be taken against anybody in the IDF. In an interview, Lieutenant General Baraq also said the IDF is already taking and will continue to take the measures necessary to sharply reduce the risk of such events, which have grave repercussions for Jews and Arabs, recurring. He stressed, however, that he cannot say at present that something like the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre could not happen again. Knesset Member [MK] Ori Or, chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, said his committee will make sure the report's findings are implemented. He said the true background to the incident is the ongoing war in Judaea and Samaria. The friction between Jews and Arabs in the Cave of the Patriarchs and other places must be reduced and supervision of radical Jewish and Arab groups must be tightened. MK Or also said the settlement leaders in Judaea and Samaria know that the extremists among them are a major affliction and that there are those who are under no control whatsoever; therefore, even after publication of the Shamgar report's findings, if somebody decides to use his weapon, nobody can prevent him from doing so. MK Dedi Zucker, chairman of the Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee, criticizes the fact that the commission dealt only with the massacre itself and not with law enforcement in the territories. I expected the commission to present a sharp indictment of the conditions existing for many years in the territories, Zucker said. On one hand, the commission says the massacre occurred like a bolt of lightning, and on the other, it points to the fact that the law was not enforced in the territories. There is no police force there to deal with both security and civilian matters. How does one reconcile between those two aspects? MK Zucker asked, adding that for the most part, the Shamgar Commission ignored that connection, which means it snowed us. [passage omitted] The Shamgar report was received in Qiryat Arba' with a sigh of relief. Local council heads welcomed the fact that the findings did not include recommendations to restrict prayer arrangements for Jews at the Cave of the Patriarchs. Rabbi Moshe Levinger said that if the defense establishment defends the Jews, it might be possible to enter the cave unarmed. Our settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman reports that according to the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, the settlers' stand has been strengthened. It has been shown that the action was perpetrated by one person, and an entire public should not be blamed. The test will be to maintain the Jews' right to worship, the council said. [passage omitted] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 26 June carries a roundup of opposition reactions to the Shamgar Commission report compiled by Hayim Hecht, who says that "the Likud Knesset faction calls for honoring the conclusions of the Shamgar Commission to the letter. A statement issued by the Likud says the report proves that the government did not prepare properly for preventing extremist acts. The National Religious Party [NRP] faction says the commission's conclusions pull the rug out from under the feet of those who organized the political campaign of incitement against the settlers. The NRP is demanding that any changes in prayer arrangements at the Cave of the Patriarchs be introduced only with the agreement of the chief rabbis. The Tzomet faction emphasizes that the report clears the Hebron settlers of any charges. Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan says the report suffers from the syndrome of putting all the blame on the lowest military levels. The Moledet faction is demanding that the Knesset hold a special debate on the Shamgar Commission conclusions this week."]
