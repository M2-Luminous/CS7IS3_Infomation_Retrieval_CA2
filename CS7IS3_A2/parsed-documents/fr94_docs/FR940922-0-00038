FR940922-0-00038 FR940922-0-00016 Thursday September 22, 1994 Part V Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs 25 CFR Part 11 Law and Order on Indian Reservations: Courts of Indian Offenses; Jurisdiction; Correction; Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 183␣/␣Thursday, September 22, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Indian Affairs 25 CFR Part 11 RIN 1076&hyph;AC78 Law and Order on Indian Reservations AGENCY: Bureau of Indian Affairs, Interior. ACTION: Final rule; correcting amendment. SUMMARY: This document corrects the list published on October 21, 1993, in the Federal Register , 58 FR 54412 to include those courts that were inadvertently omitted. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 21, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bettie Rushing, Chief, Branch of Judicial Services, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 1849 C St., NW., Mail Stop 2611&hyph;MIB, Washington, D.C. 20240&hyph;4001, telephone number (202) 208&hyph;4400. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The authority to issue this correction is vested in the Secretary of the Interior by 5 U.S.C. 301 and 25 U.S.C. 2 and 9, and 25 U.S.C. 13 which authorizes appropriations for ``Indian judges.'' The final rule amending the regulations contained in 25 CFR Part 11 to add the Muskogee Area Tribes (Eastern Oklahoma) to the list of tribes in Section 11.100(a) became effective January 28, 1992. Notice of a proposed rule amending the regulations contained in 25 CFR Part 11 to add the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe (Colorado), was published April 26, 1993. The Ute Mountain Ute Tribe should have been included on the list contained in the revision of 25 CFR Part 11, published October 21, 1993, at 25 CFR 11.100(a). The final rule, 25 CFR Part 11, listing tribes located in the former Oklahoma Territory, published October 21, 1993, did not contain the Ponca Tribe (Oklahoma). These additions to 25 CFR Part 11, §11.100, Listing of Courts of Indian Offenses , were inadvertently omitted from the list in the final rule, published October 21, 1993. Inclusion in §11.100, Listing of Courts of Indian Offenses, does not defeat the inherent sovereignty of a tribe to establish tribal courts and exercise jurisdiction under tribal law. Tillett v. Lujan, 931 F.2d 636, 640 (10th Cir. 1991) (C.F.R. courts ``retain some characteristics of an agency of the federal government'' but they ``also function as tribal courts''); Combrink v. Allen, 20 Indian L. Rep. 6029, 6030 (Ct. Ind. App., Tonkawa, Mar. 5, 1993) (C.F.R. court is a ``federally administered tribal court''); Ponca Tribal Election Board v. Snake, 17 Indian L. Rep. 6085, 6088 (Ct. Ind. App., Ponca, Nov. 10, 1988) (``The Courts of Indian Offenses act as tribal courts since they are exercising the sovereign authority of the tribe for which the court sits.''). Such exercise of inherent sovereignty and the establishment of tribal courts shall comply with the requirements set forth in 25 CFR Part 11, §11.100(c). The Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs is in receipt of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Law and Order Code which was adopted in accordance with the Tribes' constitution and by-laws and approved by the Area Director of the Phoenix Area Office on August 26, 1986. The Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs further recognizes that the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribal Court was established in 1986 in accordance with the Tribes' constitution and by-laws; however, the Tribe was inadvertently left on the list of Courts of Indian Offenses. This correction will delete Fallon Paiute-Shoshone from the list. Having reconsidered earlier Departmental opinions interpreting the constitution of the Minnesota Chippewa, the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs also recognizes the court of the Bois Forte Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe as established in accordance with the Tribes' constitution. This correction will delete Bois Forte Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe from the list. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these final regulations meet the applicable standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is not a significant rule under Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, will not require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget. This rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). In accordance with E.O. 12630, the Department has determined that this rule does not have significant takings implications. The Department has determined that this rule does not have significant federalism effects. The Department of the Interior has determined that this correction does not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. This correction does not contain information collection requirements which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The primary author of this document is Scott Keep, Office of the Solicitor, Division of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior.
