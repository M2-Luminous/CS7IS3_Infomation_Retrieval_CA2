In an exclusive statement given to a MENA correspondent in Kabul, Rabbani reiterated that foreign powers planned and financed the conspiracy to achieve special covetous designs, although Afghanistan does not interfere in their affairs. The Afghan president said that the coup attempt was a vicious plot perpetrated by Golboddin Hekmatyar, General Abdul Rashid Dostam, the communists, and other parties in a bid to overthrow the Islamic regime in Kabul by armed force. He pointed out that they planned to execute the plot on the anniversary of the foundation of the Communist Party in Afghanistan. The Afghan president described Gen. Dostam as a professional killer and a traitor. He said that Dostam is a remnant of the former communist regime. The Afghan president added that Golboddin Hekmatyar has distorted the image of jihad and mojahedin in Afghanistan. After the inception of the Islamic state in Afghanistan, we granted them amnesty with the hope that they would repent and contribute toward reconstructing a new Afghanistan, the Afghan president added. But, driven by their criminal nature, they decided to return to their conspiratorial course. President Borhanoddin Rabbani noted that all Muslim scholars, shayks, mojahedin leaders, and Islamic political powers had responded to the Islamic jihad call. The Afghan president revealed that many mojahedin leaders, who belong to Hekmatyar groups, refused to take part in the coup attempt and rejected his alliance with Dostam. Rabbani said that he will reject any contacts for a cease-fire with Dostam, but he added that it is possible to work out a kind of cease-fire formula with Hekmatyar provided there are guarantees that he would not violate it. The Afghan president stressed that the Afghan people are capable of crushing any domestic rebellion or foreign plot. The Afghan people will continue to support their Islamic state with all their strength, President Rabbani added.
