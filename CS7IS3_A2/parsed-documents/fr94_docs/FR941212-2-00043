FR941212-2-00043 FR941212-2-00037 [Docket No. 27649] Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement; Changes in Aircraft Flight Patterns Over the State of New Jersey; Reopening of the Comment Period and Public Hearings AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration [FAA], DOT. ACTION: Reopening of comment period and notice of public hearings. SUMMARY: On November 12, 1992, the FAA issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) to assess the impact of changes in aircraft flight patterns caused by implementation of the Expanded East Coast Plan over the State of New Jersey. The comment period on the DEIS closed on November 23, 1993. On September 30, 1994, the FAA issued a Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement (SDEIS) to afford the public an opportunity to review and comment on (1) a proposed mitigation measure, (2) analysis of the proposal by the New Jersey Coalition Against Aircraft Noise (NJCAAN) to route aircraft departing Newark International Airport over the ocean twenty four hours a day, and (3) other new and updated information developed in response to comments on the DEIS. The SDEIS was issued for public comment for 60 days, on September 30, 1994. In response to requests from several members of the New Jersey congressional delegation, the FAA is reopening the comment period on the SDEIS on December 12, for an additional 60 days. This will afford the New Jersey Citizens for Environmental Research additional time to review data and documentation concerning the SDEIS provided between early September and October 28 and provide comments on behalf of the NJCAAN. Because the comment period is being extended, the FAA will now be able to conduct additional hearings in Morris and Bergen Counties as requested by several members of Congress. Additional hearings will facilitate comments by citizens potentially affected by the Solberg mitigation proposal. DATES: Comment period: The comment period is reopened on December 12, 1994, to extend until February 9, 1995. The following is a listing of the dates, times, and locations of the additional hearings: Dates, Time/Location January 18, 1995_1&hyph;4 pm and 7&hyph;10 pm, Parsippany-Holiday Inn, Route 45 East, Parsippany, NJ January 19, 1995_1&hyph;4 pm and 7&hyph;10 pm, Rochelle Park-Ramada, 375 W. Passaic Street, Rochelle Park, NJ Registration of speakers will begin approximately 1/2 hour before the start of each session. The afternoon and evening sessions will begin at 1 pm and 4 pm, respectively, and will continue until all scheduled speakers have testified or until 4 pm and 10 pm, respectively. All persons wishing to make oral presentations are strongly encouraged to provide a written copy of their statement at the hearing or at the FAA address provided in the paragraph below. ADDRESSES: Written comments, in triplicate, should be addressed to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel: Docket Number 27649, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The most useful comments are those which are as specific as possible and provide facts and analysis to support the reviewer's recommendations or conclusions. Reviewers should structure their participation so that it is meaningful and alerts the FAA to the reviewer's position and contentions. This ensures that substantive comments are made available to the FAA in a timely manner so that the FAA can respond to them. Objections not raised at this stage may be waived. The FAA will consider comments received after the close of the comment period to the extent practicable. The FAA will issue a Final EIS that includes corrections, clarifications, and responses to comments on the SDEIS. Issued in Washington, DC on December 6, 1994. John D. Canoles, Acting Deputy Associate Administrator for Air Traffic. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30455 Filed 12&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
