Other forms of diseases that had fallen into oblivion have grown in frequency as well--tuberculosis of bones, joints and lymph nodes, while the overall infection rate of the population by Koch's tubercular bacillus is reaching a once unprecedented value--70-80 percent. The disease is selective: It strikes mainly the poor. Its widespread occurrence in the North is explained by the fact that the overwhelming part of the local population has begun eating much more poorly. Weakened by low-calorie food and avitaminosis, the body is unable to resist infection.
