FR940831-2-00120 FR940831-2-00089 The Sanford letter emphasizes that clients retain investment advisers with the expectation that financial management includes the expertise to vote proxies and that voting responsibility should be placed wherever the client chooses. Finally, Sanford points out that the proposed changes to the NYSE Rules will not require a beneficial owner to grant authority to vote his proxies but they will merely permit such owners to delegate such authority if they so desire. Likewise, non-discretionary clients may still vote proxies themselves. In its comment letter, Davenport & Co. of Virginia, Inc. (``Davenport'') strongly supports the proposed changes. 9 Davenports states that it acts as an investment adviser to over five hundred clients and a significant number of its clients have expressed dismay over existing proxy mailing and voting regulations. Davenport believes that its clients will be best served by permitting investment advisers who have custody of and exercise discretion over client accounts the opportunity to render the additional service of voting proxies. 9 See letter from Coleman Worthman III, President, Davenport & Co. of Virginia, Inc., to Secretary, Commission, dated January 28, 1994. In its comment letter, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith (``Merrill Lynch'') supports the proposed changes to the NYSE Rules and encourages their approval. 10 Merrill Lynch states that it believes that the proposed amendments appropriately recognize the increased utilization of registered investment advisers by its clients and appropriately permits its clients to designate the investment adviser to vote proxies and receive proxy related issuer materials with respect to securities in clients' managed accounts. 10 See letter from Kenneth S. Spirer, General Counsel, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission, dated January 27, 1994. In its comment letter, Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (``Dean Witter'') supports the proposed changes because they benefit its clients as well as other NYSE member firms. 11 Dean Witter also states that when a client instructs an investment adviser to act with discretion to implement an investment strategy, the client expects that such management power includes the expertise to vote proxies. Dean Witter states that it has an increased number of managed accounts and it has received many requests from clients who wish to be relieved of the responsibility of proxy voting and the receipt of voluminous numbers of reports by corporate issuers. 11 See letter from Burton M. Fendelman, First Vice President, Senior Attorney, Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, Commission, dated January 27, 1994. In its comment letter, the Investment Adviser Committee of the Securities Industry Association (``SIA Committee'') strongly supports the proposed amendments to certain rules governing the voting of proxies as well as the transmission of proxy and issuer related materials. The SIA Committee comment letter states that the proposed changes to NYSE Rules 450, 451, 452 and 465 resulted from clients of member firms expressing their desire to have such firms act on their behalf whenever they are designated investment advisers. The SIA Committee states that the proposed changes coincide with the growing regulatory perspective that an investment adviser's fiduciary obligations include the voting of proxies unless otherwise directed by the clients. The SIA Committee letter concludes that overall, the requested relief would enhance the effectiveness of discretionary account management and provide a service frequently requested by clients. While principles of corporate governance mandate that beneficial owners of securities should have relevant information about issuers of those securities, this is not necessarily the case when a beneficial owner has set up an investment advisory account wherein discretion is given to the investment adviser to implement a suitable investment strategy. In this instance, virtually all clients give discretion to their investment adviser to implement an investment strategy that is suitable for, and best reflects, client objectives. The SIA Committee goes on to state that when an investment advisory account is set up it is almost always the case that the client does not want the burden of receiving issuer mailings. Such clients have generally determined that they do not have the time, expertise or desire to handle their own investments. Similarly, such clients frequently do not want to be recipients of voluminous issuer reports that, for a fully diversified account, can be described as ``mountainous.'' The SIA Committee states that clients with investment advisory accounts generally do not need to receive issuer mailings or proxy materials since it is the adviser that has the authority and obligation to decide upon purchases and sales in the account. Clients frequently have little or no role in the selection of specific securities in a discretionary account and thus, they often have little or no familiarity with or knowledge of issuers and will be ill equipped to vote provide from such issuers. The SIA Committee comment letter also states that NYSE member organizations are at a competitive disadvantage with advisers not subject to NYSE regulation. The SIA states that investment advisers that are not registered as NYSE or National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') members are able to enter into agreements with discretionary clients to vote the client's securities. According to the SIA Committee, clients are seeking to delegate proxy voting with increasing frequency and rather than receive voluminous issuer material, some potential clients have chosen not to open advisory accounts and some existing clients have actually closed investment accounts. The SIA Committee concludes that compelling NYSE member firms to continue to send such materials to a segment of clients who do not need or want them serves no purpose and can only alienate a potential client base. The SIA Committee concludes by emphasizing that the proposed changes would not reduce a client's right either to vote proxies or receive issuer materials, but rather would enhance a NYSE member's ability to comply with client instructions under specific circumstances. IV. Discussion and Conclusion The Commission finds the proposed rule change to be consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Sections 6(b)(5) of the Act. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act provides, inter alias , that the rules of an exchange be designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market.
