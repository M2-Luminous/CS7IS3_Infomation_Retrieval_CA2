The pressure dropped by five atmospheres on Tuesday afternoon in transit gas pipelines near Ukrainian border with European countries and experts are sure that there is only one reason for that -- Ukraine is pumping out fuel after Russia began cutting down supplies to it demanding that debts for previous deliveries be paid. If the pressure falls by other five atmospheres, West European consumers may remain without the Russian fuel, "Gazprom" experts warned and added that in this case they would have to decrease gas supplies for purely technological reasons. The experts are sure that gas supplies will be further decreased already today also because no debt payments had been yet received from Ukraine. Today Russia continued natural gas supplies to Ukraine and Belarus in reduced volumes, but refrained from further cuts so far, according to chief engineer of the main dispatcher department of "Gazprom" Vladimir Podmarkov.
