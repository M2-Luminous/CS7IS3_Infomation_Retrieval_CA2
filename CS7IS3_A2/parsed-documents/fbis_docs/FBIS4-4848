The regular flight service will be the first to open between the two countries since the Vietnam war. The officials said both Japan and Vietnam will operate thrice-weekly Boeing 767 flights via Hong Kong or Bangkok. Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways and Vietnam Airlines plan to operate the flights. The two countries failed to agree, however, on opening a route between Narita Airport, outside Tokyo, and Hanoi since the Japanese airport has no additional space, the officials said.
