FR941004-1-00096 FR941004-1-00018 Section 1357.15(u)␣Quality Assurance We are proposing in §1357.15(u) that the State describe in the CFSP the quality assurance system it will use to regularly assess the quality of services provided under the CFSP. There is agreement by practitioners in the field and others that the quality of child welfare services needs improvement. This includes both quality standards for services as well as best practices for casework. We also consider quality services to be an integral part of achieving better outcomes for children and families. We encourage and support State efforts as they develop creative ways to determine and strengthen the effectiveness of their services. In designing, expanding, and implementing quality assurance activities, States may wish to refer to the principles in 45 CFR 1355.25. Examples of quality assessment techniques include: •Soliciting input on the effectiveness of services from public and private service providers, parents, foster parents, children and youth, other clients, and various representatives of the public. •Reviewing case records based on a random sample of cases representative of the population of children and families served. •Compliance with the recommended standards of national professional organizations serving children and families e.g., Child Welfare League of America, Council on Accreditation of Child and Family Service. •Establishing specific reporting requirements to monitor contractual service providers. We considered establishing minimum Federal standards for quality services. However, due to the wide range of differing State circumstances, we decided that, at this point, it should be left to each State to design its own quality assurance system. ACF may review, at some later date, the quality assurance systems established by the States and may consider alternate approaches to improve the quality of services. We solicit recommendations for model approaches and procedures as well as measures or indicators of quality deemed to be basic. Section 1357.15(v)␣Distribution of the CFSP and the Annual Progress and Services Report Section 432(a)(5) requires that an annual report on services (Annual Progress and Services Report) must be made available to the public. Section 1355.21(c) also requires that the title IV&hyph;B and IV&hyph;E plans be made available for public review and inspection. We are proposing in §1357.15(v) to further implement these requirements by specifying that the CFSP must include a description of how the State and the Indian tribe will make these documents available. In addition, we propose to require that State agency and Indian tribal organizations within the State receiving title IV&hyph;B, subpart 2 funds, exchange copies of their CFSPs and their Annual Progress and Services Reports. We believe it will be useful to States and Indian tribes to share the CFSP and the Annual Progress and Services Reports, both with each other and with those individuals, agencies, and organizations a part of the ongoing consultation and coordination effort. Such dissemination can lead to increased support and coordination of services. Annual Progress and Services Reports may also be used in preparing briefings for State Advisory Councils, State legislators and budget officials, and in highlighting accomplishments in the media. We have not specified the form or process such distribution should take. A variety of dissemination methods may be used, e.g., newspapers, newsletters, distribution to participants in the planning process, meetings with advocacy and constituency organizations, and electronic bulletin board notices.
