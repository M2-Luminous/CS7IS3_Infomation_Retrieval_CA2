According to a statement of the ministry collegium distributed Monday [23 May], Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov "exceeded his powers and actively interfered in the activities of the law-enforcement bodies." "Yuriy Meshkov's decree to remove A. Plyuta as Crimean interior minister and appoint Valeriy Kuznetsov as acting minister was made unilaterally, without coordination with the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, breaching the Ukrainian Constitution and the law on power-sharing between state power bodies of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic," the document stated. According to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, "a destabilization of the general situation can be seen in Crimea, the number of serious crimes, often with the use of firearms continues to grow." In the meantime, Crimean police units are used to guard radio and television broadcasting installations allegedly planned to be seized by Kiev instead of preventing and investigating crimes, the document said. The authors of the statement assess Kuznetsov's actions to ensure the safety of people as "unprofessional and inadequate considering the criminal situation in Crimea." The Ukrainian Interior Ministry collegium put all responsibility for what is going on in Crimea and its unpredictable consequences on Kuznetsov and those forces, which created the conditions for this situation.
