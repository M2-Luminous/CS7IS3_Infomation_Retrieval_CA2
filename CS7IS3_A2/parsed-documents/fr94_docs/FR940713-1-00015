FR940713-1-00015 FR940713-1-00001 There are currently a total of 8382 in-plant inspector positions, including poultry and meat inspectors. These proposed enhancements would not have any impact on the total number of inspector positions. There are 424 total in-plant inspector vacancies. FSIS has requested funds for 200 additional inspectors for FY95 to help fill some of these vacancies. The implementation of these poultry enhancement changes would not have an impact on the number of vacancies. The total number of inspectors available for off-line duties as a result of the proposed poultry enhancement program would be 139. (See Tables 3a. and 3b.)
