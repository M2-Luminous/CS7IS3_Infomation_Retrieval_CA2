FR940627-2-00125 FR940627-2-00052 [Docket No. 030&hyph;32190; License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 EA 93&hyph;238] Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc., Evanston, Wyoming; Order Suspending License (Effective Immediately) and Demand for Information I Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc. (Licensee or WIX) is the holder of Byproduct Material License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Parts 30 and 34. The license authorizes the Licensee to possess sealed sources of iridium-192 in various radiography devices for use in performing industrial radiography activities. The license, originally issued on August 12, 1991, is due to expire on August 31, 1996. II In April 1993 and in January and March 1994, the NRC conducted inspections and investigations of Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc., at the company's offices in Evanston, Wyoming, and at temporary job sites near Granger, Wyoming. These inspections and investigations identified numerous violations of NRC's radiation safety requirements, including some violations which were found to have recurred after being found in previous inspections. These violations were described in inspection reports 030&hyph;32190/93&hyph;01 and 030&hyph;32190/94&hyph;01 issued on May 12, 1994. In addition, based on the investigations conducted by the Office of Investigations (OI), several of the violations have been determined by the NRC to have been committed deliberately by Licensee employees. In a March 2, 1994, letter to the Licensee, the NRC described the apparent violations that had been identified as of that date and confirmed the arrangements for the Licensee to attend an enforcement conference in the NRC's Arlington, Texas office. The enforcement conference, which was transcribed, occurred on April 1, 1994. The Licensee was represented by Mr. Larry D. Wicks, who is the president and owner of WIX as well as the company's designated radiation safety officer (RSO). The most significant of the NRC's concerns, and many of the violations, are related to a July 31, 1993, incident involving a WIX radiographer and radiographer's assistant who were performing radiography on a pipeline near LaBarge, Wyoming. The incident involved a radiographic device containing a 37-curie, sealed iridium-192 source and resulted in a potentially significant radiation exposure to the radiographer's assistant. This incident was reviewed during the inspection and investigation that began in January 1994. The following information regarding this incident is based on joint interviews conducted by the inspector and investigator; on signed, sworn statements taken by the investigator during these interviews; and on statements made by Mr. Wicks at the April 1 enforcement conference. With the exception of certain statements made by Mr. Wicks at the enforcement conference, which are noted below, all other statements were made to the inspector and investigator during their joint interviews of WIX personnel.
