According to him, the Black Sea Fleet is equipped with outdated rocket weaponry of the former USSR, some of which is no longer produced by the industry. In the past seven to 10 years, scheduled maintenance of the rocket artillery weapons has not been performed, and only emergency repairs and renovations have been conducted. The average age of the ships is 15-20 years, and no money has been allocated lately for their servicing. No new ships have been added to the Black Sea Fleet in the past few years, while modernization and reequipment of the existing ships, considering their old age, does not look justifiable. According to Oleksiy Ryzhenko, [words indistinct] five submarines, 20 auxiliary vessels, and five special task ships of the Black Sea Fleet are currently being repaired at Ukraine's shipyards. Another 77 ships and vessels are due to be sent for repair. The rear admiral said that the intensity and quality of combat training has suffered a drop for a number of reasons, while "the occasional appearance of 20-25 ships does not prove the power or combat readiness of the Black Sea Fleet. One cannot seriously say that this fleet is a guarantor of CIS security," Oleksiy Ryzhenko believes.
