Discussing international indifference toward Israel's piratical act of kidnapping Lebanese citizen Mustafa Dayrani from his home in Lebanon, TISHRIN explains that this indifference has encouraged Israel to persist in its aggressive policy against the population of southern Lebanon. TISHRIN adds: While the Arabs, including Lebanon, call for a just, honorable peace, Israel insists on lame, phased agreements that will give it a free hand and consolidate its hegemony in the region, contrary to UN Security Council resolutions and UN principles and conventions. The paper adds that Israel is behaving as if it is above international law, selecting from the UN Security Council resolutions only what is useful for its expansionist schemes, usurpation, and settlement. Concluding, TISHRIN says: Israel's attacks will not weaken Lebanon's determination to restore its territory. Rather, they will consolidate the Arab parties' conviction that the Tel Aviv rulers reject a just, comprehensive peace in the Middle East. It is the right of Lebanon and the Arabs to escalate resistance to ensure Israel's compliance with the resolutions and principles of the international community and put an end to the aggression it has been continuing for many years. In a commentary, AL-THAWRAH discusses peace Israeli style. Practically, the paper says, this peace means taming the region and ravishing its countries, people, wealth, and ideologies, turning it into an obedient tool in the hands of Israel. After reviewing Israel's practices against the peace process, up to and including the act of piracy carried out against a Lebanese citizen and other attacks on southern Lebanon, the paper says this is another image of the peace that Israel wants. This is the only peace that it looks for. It is a peace that gives Israel a free hand in the region, undeterred by any laws. Therefore, it has been pushing peace on the Syrian track toward a dead end because the peace Syria understands is the opposite of this and because Syria rejects any peace that is not just and comprehensive. AL-THAWRAH explains that despite its serious and sincere desire for peace, and despite its great appreciation for the U.S. role and the Clinton administration's efforts to advance the peace process, Syria believes that the United States should explicitly and publicly point to the party that is obstructing peace and is seeking to impose its own terms, which contradict the bases of the peace process and international resolutions. At the end of its commentary, AL-THAWRAH calls on the United States to develop its stand and role and to act according to its convictions in light of the stands of the parties to the peace process. It also calls on the United States to make the side obstructing peace comply with peace requirements and implement the relevant UN resolutions.
