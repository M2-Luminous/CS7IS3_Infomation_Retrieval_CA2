FR940706-2-00019 FR940706-2-00013 Commenters suggested that proposed §364.53 be modified to recognize the fact that records may be electronic as well as written. The Secretary agrees with the commenters. With the exception of an IL plan or a waiver of an IL plan, both of which require a consumer's signature, the Secretary anticipates revising §364.53 in the final regulations to allow records to be maintained electronically. Commenters suggested that the State standards in proposed §364.55 should not be permitted to exceed the standards in section 725 of the Act. The standards referred to in proposed §364.55 are actually the standards that the designated State unit (DSU) is required to develop pursuant to proposed §365.31 for those service providers that are not centers or for centers that are providing specialized IL services under a contract with the DSU. The Secretary anticipates adding language to the final regulations to make this clear. One commenter objected to the words ``other information'' in proposed §364.56(c)(2) because of the possibility that service providers may use this language to withhold information from a consumer. Proposed §364.56(c)(2) does not permit a service provider to withhold information from a consumer. Proposed §364.56(c)(2) merely requires that, if a service provider determines that releasing medical, psychological, or other information may be harmful if released directly to the consumer, the service provider shall release this information to the consumer through a qualified medical or psychological professional or the individual's legally authorized representative. The Secretary does not expect any change to §364.56(c)(2) in the final regulations. Part 366 One commenter suggested adding a requirement to the selection criteria in proposed §366.27 that the governing board be reflective of the localities to be served by the proposed center. The Secretary believes that, rather than adding the suggested language to the selection criteria in proposed §366.27, replacing the words ``another'' and ``other'' in proposed §366.28(a) with ``bordering'' and adding similar language in §§366.2(a)(1)(i), 366.28(a), and 366.29(a) of the final regulations is more appropriate. In this manner, centers will be limited to operating within a ``local community,'' as required by section 702(1)(A) of the Act. One commenter considered the selection criterion in proposed §366.27(a)(2) too vague and suggested that it be expanded to ``not appear to be the traditional `needs assessment' that creates more service providers.'' The Secretary believes that the criterion adequately explains how an applicant can be expected to identify the need for a new center in a community and how the applicant plans to address this identified need. The Secretary does not expect any change in the final regulations. Commenters suggested reducing the points allotted to ``plan of operation'' and increasing points for ``involvement of individuals with significant disabilities'' in the selection criteria in proposed §366.27(g) and (h), respectively. Commenters also felt that the proposed selection criteria should include the involvement of individuals with significant disabilities in the preparation of a center's application. The Secretary believes that the points assigned to the ``plan of operation'' selection criterion appropriately reflect its value. The Secretary agrees that participation of individuals with significant disabilities in the preparation of applications is important and anticipates substituting the phrase ``developing the center's application'' for the phrase ``conducting center activities'' in §366.27(h)(1) of the final regulations. Selection Criteria In evaluating applications for grants under this competition, the Secretary uses the selection criteria in §366.27 of the notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24814, 24838&hyph;24839), with the anticipated changes discussed in this notice. Applicants should prepare their applications based on the proposed regulations, as modified by the expected changes contained in this notice. If additional changes are made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review, applicants will be given the opportunity to revise or resubmit their applications.
