After the parliamentary elections, Hungary should continue to press on down the path it has followed over the past four years, Surjan said. Owing to its policy programme and team of experts, the KDNP is capable of giving a positive boost to the current government's work, he said, stressing that the present governing coalition should be transformed and refreshed rather than dismissed. In Surjan's view, conservative Christian Democratic policy should play a determining role even in the future, because neither the liberal nor the socialist alternative can solve the country's current problems.
