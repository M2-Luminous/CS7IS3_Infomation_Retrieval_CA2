In the course of the meeting, which ran 20 minutes longer than planned, the French president said Hungary naturally belongs to the European organizations, and France will be its supporter and partner in the integration process. At a press conference for Hungarian journalists after the cordial political discussions, Boross said that, similar to his other French negotiation partners, President Mitterrand indicated that the senior French political groups hold a favorable view of Hungary. Discussions were also held on Hungary's intention to become a member of the European Union. President Mitterrand called attention to the fact that the member countries of the Union "do not particularly like" the special demands posed by individual countries. Boross said Hungary has at least five or six such special requests. He mentioned the agriculture debate as one of the delicate issues of membership. Boross held out the prospect that the government would announce a new agricultural program at the end of March.
