The country's net foreign debt, tallied by excluding overseas assets from the total foreign debt, jumped to 8.7 billion dollars at the end of March from 7.87 billion dollars at the end of last year, a BOK report said Wednesday. The report said the total foreign debt had increased 1.21 billion dollars to 45.08 billion dollars as of March from 43.87 billion dollars at last year's end, while the value of overseas assets rose just 380 million dollars from 36 billion dollars to 36.38 billion dollars during the same period. The net foreign debt dropped to 10 billion dollars last August from 11.1 billion dollars at the end of 1992, falling further to 7.71 billion dollars last November before starting to increase slightly afterwards. The upward trend has continued this year. The surge was due to the widening trade deficit, which hit 2,524 million dollars during the first quarter this year, the drastic reduction of foreign investment in the domestic stock market and the increase in short-term foreign debt, according to the report. The amount of long-term debt with a repayment term of more than one year fell to 24.57 billion dollars as of the end of March from 24.71 billion dollars at last year-end, while the short-term debt with a repayment period of less than one year increased 1.35 billion dollars to 20.51 billion dollars from 19.16 billion dollars during the same period, indicating the country's aggravated foreign debt structure, the report said. The long-term debt decreased due to a government policy of curbing the introduction of long-term foreign loans for fear of a flood of incoming foreign money including stock investment capital, experts say. The increase in short-term debt, meanwhile, can be explained by the government's efforts to ease various restrictions on foreign trade financing, including extension of the credit purchase period to 120 days from the previous 90 days starting Jan. 1, they say.
