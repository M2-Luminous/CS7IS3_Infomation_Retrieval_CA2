Latvian Ambassador in Germany Andris Kesteris told DIENA in a telephone interview that a few months prior to Germany assuming the leadership post, it wants to clarify, along with the Baltic states, what concrete steps should be taken to reach this goal. Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister Georgs Andrejevs presented a speech on the problem of Baltic states receiving associate status in the EU, saying that by granting associate member status to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the EU could affect a much more effective neutralization of the Russian concept of the "near abroad" -- this according to the press center of the Latvian Foreign Affairs Ministry. "These concepts -- near abroad and zone of special interests -- are denied categorically by us and our neighbors," said K. Kinkel, according to REUTER. As DIENA correspondent in Bonn O.J. Rozitis reports, referring to information released by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs on K. Kinkel's consultations with the Baltic foreign affairs ministers on the morning of 9 March, K. Kinkel emphasized that the Baltics have always mirrored European stability. This is why Germany is interested in consolidating relations between the Baltic states and Russia. As an example, K. Kinkel cited the positive role of Germany in talks between the United States [as published] and Latvia concerning a compromise on the Skrunda radar station. A. Kesteris told DIENA that in the course of discussing the relations of the Baltic states with Russia, the German minister of foreign affairs expressed his approval of the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia by 31 August of this year, and congratulated the foreign ministers on the agreement which was reached on the issue of the Skrunda radar station continuing to function, albeit temporarily, after the troops are withdrawn. The Latvian ambassador to Germany stated that the problems of the inhabitants who came to Latvia after the 1940 occupation are understood by Germany with greater precision. The DIENA correspondent in Bonn, Ojars J. Rozitis, reports that the British newspaper FINANCIAL TIMES has cited the German foreign affairs minister as saying that Russia should not link the withdrawal of its troops from the Baltic states with the rights of Russians residing in these states. After the recent break in Russian-Estonian talks, Great Britain and the United States have also expressed similar opinions. This question is also said to be a topic of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's talks with Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev, which are scheduled for next Monday [14 March] in Vladivostok. At the same time, world press agencies report that during the meeting with the Baltic foreign affair ministers, the German minister of foreign affairs encouraged Latvia and Estonia to integrate the Russian minority. This integration is vital for future relations with Russia, the chief German diplomat said, advising the Balts to avoid angering the Russian nationalists and to promise to observe the rights of ethnic Russians. In reply to a question at a news conference, as to what could possibly be the reaction of the West if Russia does not comply with its agreements, Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister Georgs Andrejevs answered that thus far Latvia has fulfilled all the recommendations of Western countries. The West has accepted it, and therefore they will be responsible for it, G. Andrejevs said. The German foreign affairs minister agreed on that point. Nevertheless, K. Kinkel expressed the belief that it would not be advisable to create sharp, provocative political borders with Russia. At the same time, K. Kinkel emphasized that during his recent meeting with Russian Foreign Affairs Minister A. Kozyrev in Athens, he told him categorically that Germany expects Russia to observe its international obligations regarding troop withdrawal from the Baltic states, O.J. Rozitis reports. Germany is categorically against granting Russia a special mandate for peacekeeping on the territory of the former Soviet Union. In the event it becomes necessary, it should be the mandate of the United nations or CSCE, for every different case, providing that the legal government of the country agrees to it. The Baltic states should not be included in the formula of "the former republics of the USSR." Such is the position of Germany conveyed by the press center of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. O.J. Rozitis reports that the Baltic foreign ministers unanimously stated at the press conference that they are not afraid of close relations between Russia and Germany, or Western countries in general, because only with the assistance of these countries can Moscow be influenced. "The only thing we fear is that these big countries may once again sacrifice our small countries for the purpose of stabilization," said G. Andrejevs. As for the often asked question concerning so-called human rights violations, A. Kesteris told DIENA that this question had not even been mentioned during the talks of the four ministers. Issues related to the Partnership for Peace program and the associative status of the Baltic states with the Western European Union were also discussed.
