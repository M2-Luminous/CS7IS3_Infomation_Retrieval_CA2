At the same time, unity must be obtained regarding the future size of the blocking minority in the EU Council of Ministers. Most people continue to believe that it will succeed. However, in the run-up to a meeting between EU foreign ministers today there has been considerable uncertainty as to whether the EU can untangle the two knots that are continuing to block enlargement of the Union to include Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Norway as from 1 January next year. The first knot, the fisheries dispute with Norway, appears to be the easiest to untangle. When the negotiations with Norway were broken off last week, it was -- after all -- just cod worth less than 40 million kroner that separated Norway from reaching an agreement on accession to the EU of the kind already secured by Sweden, Finland, and Austria. "Historical" Fish The key issue continues to be Spain's demand that Norway return Spain's "historical" fish. Until 1981, Spain had fishing rights in Norwegian waters, and Spain is now demanding a quota of cod from Norway if Norway accedes to the EU. Meanwhile, the Norwegians are refusing to hand over a single fish. A solution to the dispute lies in so-called paper fish, whereby Spain would be given a share of the expected growth in Norwegian cod resources, as calculated by marine biologists -- on paper, at least. That would satisfy Spain's demand for Norwegian fish, while the Norwegian Government would be able to say that it had not relinquished any of Norway's current resources of fish. A second possibility would be for the EU countries to buy a cod quota for Spain from a third country, e.g., Russia or Canada. However, this solution is not regarded as satisfactory by Spain, which -- for reasons to do with its national psychology -- is demanding that Norwegian cod be served at its table. Knot Number Two In any case, an acceptable solution for Spain in the confrontation with Norway is still a precondition for being able to untangle knot number two in the enlargement process, namely the question as to how big the so-called blocking minority in the EU Council of Ministers will be. Here, too, it is Spain that is proving uncooperative by refusing to allow the threshold for a blocking minority in the Council of Ministers to be extended from 23 out of 76 votes to 27 out of 90 votes in the context of Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, and Austrian accession. However, Spain is being strongly backed by the United Kingdom, both countries -- being relatively large EU countries -- fearing that they will lose their capability of blocking EU legislation if the threshold for the blocking minority is not kept at 23. The United Kingdom has 10 votes and Spain has eight in the EU Council of Ministers. Italy has also periodically flirted with the idea of supporting this attitude. Meanwhile, Germany, France, and the smaller EU countries are insisting that the threshold for the blocking minority in the Council of Ministers be adjusted in the context of EU enlargement, so that it continues to represent 30 percent of the total number of votes, as is currently the case. German Press Germany is also expected to exert great pressure on Spain and the United Kingdom today with a view to moving them to drop their minority view regarding the number of votes. Otherwise there is a risk that the entire enlargement of the EU will be delayed when the European Parliament in Strasbourg refuses to approve an agreement based on the Hispanic-British model. Spain is expected to cave in to economic pressure to relinquish its attitude, partly as a result of the country receiving a good fisheries agreement with Norway, and partly as a result of Germany -- as the "treasurer" of the EU -- coming up with ill-hidden allusions to the renegotiation of EU policy on subsidies for Mediterranean agriculture, which will take place later this year, where Spain stands to win -- or lose -- large amounts of funding. The resistance by the British is of a more political, principle-based character. However, as THE FINANCIAL TIMES, among others, pointed out in an editorial, the United Kingdom has a fundamental interest in seeing Austria and the Nordic countries join the Union. At the same time, Prime Minister John Major will not gain any ground over the Euroskeptic right wing of his Conservative party by driving the conflict further toward a possible extra EU summit meeting, at which the British would in any case be forced to give way, the newspaper points out. According to the FINANCIAL TIMES, "stupid Albion," as the paper calls the United Kingdom, using a paraphrase of a former French insult referring to the British, has certainly made a fool of itself on this issue.
