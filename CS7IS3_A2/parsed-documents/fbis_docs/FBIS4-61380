The elevation of the Karabakh Armenians, who at present have no status at all, to prominence at the Bishkek meeting shows that the talks are being basically conducted to put pressure on Azerbaijan. The course of the developments also shows that Armenia, which avoids heeding the CSCE mission, is trying to solve the problem speedily and within the CIS framework at every opportunity and at all costs. The sudden recognition of Daghlyk-Karabakh as a conflicting side by Azerbaijan might place the Republic, which has been waging a war with Armenia for years now, in an inextricable position. Such a step would not only tie Azerbaijan's hands militarily and politically, but might also impede the proper understanding of the nature of this war at the international level. This is because at the initial stages of the problem, when talks were being held to put an end to war under the CSCE mandate, Armenia and Azerbaijan took part as sides in the conflict and representatives of the Armenian and Azerbaijani communities of Daghlyk-Karabakh participated as observers. Why can Azerbaijan not recognize Daghlyk-Karabakh as an independent side in the conflict? Because such recognition would in practice mean the recognition of the existence of the Daghlyk-Karabakh army, regardless of Karabakh's future status. This could have grave consequences in the future. Also, such recognition on the eve of the Minsk conference would mean prematurely determining various parameters for the status of Daghlyk-Karabakh. And this will eventually entail further concessions. Most important, the recognition of Daghlyk-Karabakh as an independent side in the conflict aims at providing insurance for the aggressor Armenia. Naturally, the CIS states, primarily Russia, are only trying to shield Armenia. And the Azerbaijani side's resistance to that approach at Bishkek would most likely have a bearing on the situation on the front lines in the near future. However, regardless of the fact that the aggressor is not being identified at the present time, the changing atmosphere in the world will probably not allow the aggressor to remain in the shadows indefinitely.
