The meeting was attended by Mihoub Mihoubi, adviser in charge of diplomatic affairs and the president's official spokesman. Upon leaving the state president's office the Yemeni envoy made the following statement: [Begin Salim Salih Muhammad recording] We explained to his excellency the brother president the latest developments in the situation in Yemen and the current war, which was started by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on 27 April, when he declared war on the southern regions. Eight weeks have passed but fierce fighting is still going on causing huge human and material losses. [passage omitted] We are calling on the Arab brothers, and Algeria in particular given its place in our hearts as well as its experience, to play a role and help us to secure an immediate cease-fire so as to stop the bloodshed and save those Yemenis who are still alive and the installations which are still standing. We are also urging them to recognize the situation before unification which has failed in its four years to achieve the amalgamation of two systems, two armies, two state institutions, two currencies, etc. We want a return to the situation before 22 May 1990. This is our stand. And we are now defending our right and the right of our children to life and to the protection of our property which is being destroyed day in and day out. [passage omitted] We are, therefore, urging all our brothers in the Arab Maghreb or in the Arab Mashriq to stop this war through the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution and resolve this problem wisely through dialogue and dialogue alone.
