The Foreign Ministry is vested with the power of designing and furthering our country's insertion into the regional or world scene by applying the strategies it deems most appropriate. Uruguay has been and is respected for its stance on foreign policy. It has developed a philosophy that is respectful of international law, and which endorses nonintervention, self-determination, and the peaceful settlement of controversies. This is the reason why Uruguay's stance is taken into account when important decisions have to be made, not only concerning specific matters in our region, but also concerning the entire community of nations. That which at present best characterizes Uruguayan foreign policy is the strategy of concentric circles. For Uruguay, its geopolitical situation in the region takes precedence over everything else. The Western Hemisphere and Ibero-American relations come next on its list of priorities, and the rest of the world comes last. Indeed, our national identity is forged by the give and take of ideas with our neighboring countries, and from there we can project our image to the rest of the world. Uruguay has followed two different approaches in its foreign policy, stemming precisely from its strategic location: the meridian policy and the parallel policy. The latter referred to the unavoidable influence exerted by Argentina and Brazil on Uruguay's geopolitical situation. The meridian policy, on the contrary, has to do with the fact that Uruguay is located in a region where the River Plate Basin is of necessity a point of reference. Therefore, in light of its geographic location as the bridge country, the country with extensive grasslands, it plays a very significant role as an outlet, as a port for the shipping of products from the River Plate Basin made up of Paraguay, Bolivia, important regions of Brazil, and principally the Argentine Mesopotamia [Misiones, Corrientes, and Entre Rios Provinces]. This meridian policy entails devising a subregional policy that is mindful of and builds on the strategies followed by Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, and Bolivia. It is within this context that the country's policy on issues like the waterway, or the channels, is analyzed. It is against this backdrop that the conditions for being the outlet for the region's production -- which will enable Uruguay to strengthen its position at subregional and especially regional levels -- take shape. The process of consolidating strategies that range from subregional to hemispheric, from Ibero-American to global, must be achieved with openness and professionalism. The Uruguayan outlook has thus gone beyond merely commercial considerations in deciding to join Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. This decision was well received by political parties, and was passed with unanimous approval in the Senate. Uruguay's path toward integration was to a certain extent already predetermined. In fact, Uruguay's joining Mercosur was like a person jumping onto a moving bus. The alternatives Uruguay had, in CAUCE [Argentine-Uruguayan Agreement on Economic Cooperation] and PEC [Trade Expansion Protocol], would have been eliminated when the integration process between Brazil and Argentina concluded. Uruguay thus had no alternative but to join Mercosur in order to avoid losing all its alternatives, and to have a say in the many decisions to be made by this organization concerning both political and trade matters. Within the framework of Mercosur, Uruguay's option is to gamble on the enlarging of the market so that trade between its members will be increased. The old import substitution model is no longer prevalent, and the globalization and opening of regional markets -- which is the outcome of similar domestic policies -- will benefit from the optimal use of comparative advantages and economies of scale. This policy on integration is complemented by the idea of establishing low tariffs so as not "ghettoize" (confine) our trade to the region, but rather to use it as a tool to insert our country into an increasingly competitive world. Whenever we define our position within GATT, or within the system of international cooperation, we not only stress the comparative advantages derived from a country's resources, such as beef, wool, or weather conditions, but also bear in mind the values added in manufacturing, specialization of human resources, the incorporation of technology, etc. This all leads one to conclude that no matter what their size or population, countries can be more competitive precisely on the basis of these variables. This subject of competitive advantages thus also points to our leanings in foreign policy and our position in the international community. It should moreover be pointed out that foreign policy (which seeks to defend our markets and our positions) is necessarily linked to education by virtue of its ties with the productive sector, and also to the necessary political consensus that prevents policies from being erratically changed every five years, because of changes brought about as a result of electoral strategies. [passage omitted] The current importance of negotiations in the Uruguay Round of the GATT trade talks can be assessed in terms of the different issues that are at stake on the negotiating table. So much so that GATT's trade negotiations have reached a stalemate. They have bogged down precisely over a multilateral proposal for the solution to the trade problem put forward by GATT's director general who, aware of the difficulties and controversies between developing and industrial countries and among industrial countries themselves, made a multilateral proposal that envisaged certain concessions by all GATT member countries. It included the so-called access to agricultural markets, which is one of the most sensitive issues for our economies. This leads us in a way to acknowledge the instability with which we sometimes have to deal in the realm of international relations, and realize that trade policies like those within Mercosur, GATT, etc., occasionally involve economic and political questions that go beyond the daily political tug-of-war to which a country may be exposed. The approach that we follow is then to focus first on the subregion, then the region, the hemisphere, and insertion into the world. This approach has new variables entailing new subjects. Finally, it is necessary to bear in mind that Uruguayan foreign policy -- like many aspects of our country's institutional and social life -- needs to be professional. [passage omitted] Each member of the foreign service is an official representing the leading multinational image of Uruguay, with branches and officials all over the world, making decisions and really keeping their fingers on the pulse. We need to demonstrate institutionality and coherence, so that Uruguay's foreign policy is not simply a matter of soirees and red carpet treatments, but rather a policy that entails knocking at the doors of people who work, produce, export, and trade. A country of 3 million people that could well pass for a district of Sao Paulo or Buenos Aires, and not exactly one of the more wealthy ones, must be capable of taking good advantage of all these things with a competitive spirit and the desire for improvement. Within Mercosur, he who follows the wisest strategy is better structured, and he who develops his human resources or comparative advantages more appropriately will be able to double, triple, and even be the leader in the streamlining and modernization of the country's productive structure. This is indeed foreign policy, international policy, and geopolitical and commercial insertion.
