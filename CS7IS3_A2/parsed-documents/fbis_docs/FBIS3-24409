Yesterday letters from Maritime Kray Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko containing a request to support the idea of establishing free economic zones on the territories of individual Nakhodka industrial enterprises were delivered to the apparatus of the president and prime minister. Thus, for all practical purposes Nakhodka is rejecting the status of free economic zone previously granted to it as an administrative territory. Up until now, not a single one of the free economic zones has made such proposals. The idea of establishing local free economic zones reflects the desire of the directors of major industrial enterprises who have become owners of them as the result of privatization to strengthen their positions by obtaining special status for the industrial zones they control. Their initiative is actively supported by the administration of Nakhodka and Maritime Kray. However, it is fairly unlikely that it will be approved by the federal authorities. The prospect of establishing microzones was considered for the first time during a Maritime Kray visit by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, chairman of the Yabloko parliamentary faction, to Nakhodka, where he held a meeting with representatives of the city administration and industrial circles. At that meeting local industrialists made their concept of the development of the Nakhodka Free Economic Zones public for the first time. Thus, Viktor Gnezdilov, head of the city administration, stated in a discussion with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy that, since the idea of developing the free economic zone as a unified complex of industrial and agricultural territories had so far not found support in the structures of federal authority, the free economic zone's new administration considered the strategy of developing local zones around Nakhodka's major enterprises to be more effective. According to that concept, in place of the Nakhodka Free Economic Zone, about eight enclave zones, including the Nakhodka Commercial Port Zone, the Vostochnyy Port Zone, the Nakhodka Tin Can Factory Zone, and the Reinforced Concrete Structurals Plant Zone, should be established. Despite the fact that the heads of the city administration and executives of local enterprises are putting forward the concept of local free economic zones, what evidently would be involved are duty zones, the conditions of operations in which fully meet the ambitions of Nakhodka enterprise executives. KOMMERSANT: In Russia the regulations for duty-free zones that have been legislatively approved provide for the possibility of placing and using imported goods in them without regard to customs duties and taxes. What is attractive about duty-free zones, for both Russian and foreign businessmen, is not just the fact that imported goods may be kept on their territories without customs inspection for as long as one likes, but also the fact that production operations may be carried out in them and, in such cases, export duties, the value-added tax and excise taxes will be based only on the components that were brought in from elsewhere in Russia. World experience indicates that, because of the half-way nature of the special breaks established by legislation, duty-free zones have not been an effective tool for attracting investments. In this connection, the idea of establishing microzones around major industrial facilities could not result in fundamental changes in the socioeconomic situation in Nakhodka. From every indication, those who have initiated the idea of establishing local zones are also guided, first and foremost, by their own "local" interests, which square poorly not only with federal goals but with the objectives of regional development. Such a situation is a result of privatization, whereby the executives of the leading enterprises received large packages of stock in the new joint-stock companies and, for all practical purposes, became the owners of their enterprises. Following that, in December 1993, the representatives of the industrial lobby, in alliance with the city administration, took over the leading positions on the free economic zone's Administrative Committee. As strange as it may seem, the idea of local zones was supported by the Maritime Kray administration and the kray governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko. The kray authorities' interest in establishing the microzones is understandable--such zones, only very nominally oriented toward federal structures, would be tightly linked to local authorities who controlled their power supply and utilities. Moreover, the establishment of a network of "growth points" on the basis of the kray's strategic enterprises could become a pretty good substitute for the separatist idea of singling Maritime Kray out as a separate enclave "growth zone." Stages in the Development of Free Economic Zones in Russia 1991: The status of free economic zones is granted to nine territories on the scale of oblasts and republics within Russia. 1992: The status of free economic zones is granted to three more regions. 1993: All free economic zones with the exception of Kaliningrad Oblast are deprived of duty breaks and privileges. The first three duty zones are established: Sheremetyevo, the Moscow Free Port and the Free Port Terminal. 1994: The Nakhodka Free Economic Zone rejects the status of a free economic zone and submits a proposal to establish four local zones that resemble duty zones on its territory.
