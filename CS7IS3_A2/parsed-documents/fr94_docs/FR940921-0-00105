Section 86.142&hyph;90 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraph (o) introductory text and adding paragraphs (q) and (r), to read as follows: §86.142&hyph;90 Records required. * * * * * (o) Additional records required for diesel vehicles: * * * * * (q) Additional required records for natural gas-fueled vehicles. Composition, including all carbon containing compounds; e.g. CO 2 , of the natural gas-fuel used during the test. C 1 and C 2 compounds shall be individually reported. C 3 and heavier hydrocarbons, and C 6 and heavier compounds may be reported as a group. (r) Additional required records for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Composition of the liquefied petroleum gas-fuel used during the test. Each hydrocarbon compound present, through C 4 compounds, shall be individually reported. C 5 and heavier hydrocarbons may be reported as a group. 63. Section 86.143&hyph;96 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b)(1)(ii)(B), to read as follows: §86.143&hyph;96 Calculations; evaporative emissions.
