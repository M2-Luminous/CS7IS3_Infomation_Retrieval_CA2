There are a lot of such issues, they should not be played up or played down for political needs, Qian said, and China hopes both sides adopt a realistic attitude towards addressing these issues. Qian made the remarks when responding to a question at a press conference here sponsored by Zhou Jue, spokesman for the current session of the Eighth National People's Congress. On the export of prison labour products, Qian said that even the United States acknowledges that its prison labour products are exported to some countries. The U.S. side, however, does not want prison labour products from other countries to enter the United States, Qian said. Qian said China has a big market and it is entirely possible for China not to export its prison labour products to the United States. Moreover, the issue has already been settled. On the question of immigration freedom in relation to MFN status, Qian said that again this is not a problem as far as the Chinese side is concerned. Even the U.S. side acknowledges that China does not place obstacles to large scale immigration to the United States. The obstacle now is that those who are found with an intention of immigration are denied the visa to the United States. What is more. Qian said, China has the problem of illegal immigration, and "we are discussing ways to solve the problem."
