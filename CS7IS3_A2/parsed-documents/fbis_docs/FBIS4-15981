Our correspondent Yuriy Kuzmenko asked Stanislav Mikhaylovich Korochkin, chief of Magadan Basin Okhotrybvod [Okhotsk Sea Fishing Administration] Department to comment on the event. [Begin recording] [Kuzmenko] Stanislav Mikhaylovich, does the Washington agreement specifically provide solutions to problems affecting the central part of the Okhotsk Sea? [Korochkin] After a great deal of preparatory work, three years of preparatory work and 10 meetings, six countries finally signed an agreement in Washington agreeing to regulate fishing in the central part of the Bering Sea. Subsequently, if governments of four countries ratify this agreement, it will acquire the power of a convention with all its ensuing consequences. A fishing moratorium has been placed on the central part of the Bering Sea until the end of 1994, after which, a committee will be formed to determine the Alaska pollock catch quotas based on research into stocks. The fishing quotas will be distributed at a conference of the member countries. Moreover, I want to emphasize that Russia and the United States will have 80 percent of the possible catch, 20 percent will be shared by the remaining countries. It can be said without exaggeration that this is a unique agreement. This is the first time that such an agreement has been signed concerning the northern Pacific Ocean and this, of course, gives certain hope that a similar solution can be found to the central Okhotsk Sea issue. [Kuzmenko] So this means that there is hope that foreign fishermen will cease their shameful conduct in the Okhotsk Sea? [Korochkin] Yes, there is certainly hope. However, the work on the Bering Sea agreement took three years because powerful pressure was exerted by the United States, since the Alaska pollock there belongs to the Aleutian state primarily because it is in the U.S. zone. However, the Alaska pollock in the Okhotsk Sea is (?mostly) ours and that is why everything depends on the actions of our government and on how it can prepare and influence the position of other countries. [Kuzmenko] Stanislav Mikhaylovich, what is the situation today in the central part of the Okhotsk Sea? [Korochkin] Today, the usual situation prevails in the central part of the Okhotsk Sea. Our fleet is not working there since the introduction of the moratorium last year. However, Polish and Chinese vessels continue to work there, some 40-50 ships. However, South Korea has withdrawn its fleet from the central part of the Okhotsk Sea. In exchange for the South Korean Government's agreement to withdraw the fleet, our government has allotted the South Korean fleet 32,500 tonnes of Alaska pollock in our economic zone in western Kamchatka, the northern Okhotsk Sea fishing area, and [words indistinct] Kamchatka region. [Kuzmenko] And at the present time, Okhotrybvod vessels with inspectors on board are constantly patrolling the central part of the Okhotsk Sea. [Korochkin] Yes, quite right. After the introduction of the moratorium, the Fishing Committee issued an order making Okhotrybvod responsible for the main coordinating work to protect the central part. Beginning in the summer of last year, one of our command patrol boats has constantly patrolled the area with inspectors on board and, money permitting, we regularly carry out aerial surveillance of the area. That is, we have the situation fully under control. [Kuzmenko] Thank you. [end recording]
