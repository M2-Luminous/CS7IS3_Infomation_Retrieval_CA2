FBIS4-27660 "dreas107_m_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 Thailand Reception Center Needed for Repatriation Reception Center Needed for Repatriation BK0206083994 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 2 Jun 94 p 6 BK0206083994 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] Thailand yesterday renewed its call for the establishment of a reception centre in Laos as a way of speeding up the repatriation of some 12,000 Laotians. Praphakon Samiti, director of the Interior Ministry's Foreign Affairs Division, made the call before international participants at a technical meeting convened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Mr Praphakon said the repatriation of the refugees had gathered momentum but pointed out that some 9,000 Laotians were "expected" to remain in Thailand after the planned closure of Ban Napho camp at the end of this year. "I do hope that all parties concerned will join to put more effort into solving the residual caseload," he said. Questions of repatriation and resettlement are being discussed at the two-day technical meeting called to seek ways of clearing camps in first asylum countries of some 80,000 Indochinese by the end of next year when the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) drawn up in 1989 expires. The technical discussions have drawn representatives from Vietnam and Laos as well as first asylum, resettlement and donor countries -- including Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brunei, Canada, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, United Kingdom, United States and European Union. Mr. Praphakon expressed hope that the idea of setting up a reception centre in Laos would be pursued at a meeting comprising Thailand, Laos and the UNHCR due to take place later this month. The centre will house returnees pending determination of a permanent resettlement site, he said. Elaborating on the idea in a separate interview, Mr Praphakon said it would function as a "halfway house" where skills training could be provided to the returnees. The UNHCR's Thailand representative Ruprecht von Arnim said he was open to the idea. But he emphasised the need to address the Laotian Government's concerns about employment for the returnees. Vientiane will not accept a simple "transfer" of Ban Napho to Laos and the UNHCR will find it difficult arriving at an arrangement which might become an "open-ended commitment", he said. Mr Praphakon said Thailand would complete the process of status determination of Vietnamese encamped in the country by June 24. He said some 6,000 Vietnamese were expected to sign up for voluntary repatriation by the end of this month. But he pointed to some 3,000 hard core cases which would be more difficult to deal with, and called for a stepped-up campaign to encourage them to volunteer for repatriation. He also urged resettlement countries to live up to their pledges and drew attention to the estimated 250 Vietnamese encamped at Sikhiu who have been "screened-in" as bona fide refugees but rejected.
