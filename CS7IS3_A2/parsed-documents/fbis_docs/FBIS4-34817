The automotive industry's export trade grew by 136 percent in the first quarter of the year as compared with the corresponding period in 1993, with earnings totaling $34.3 million. This expansion was due mainly to a surge in sales to Argentina of cars assembled in Uruguay. There was also an upturn in the export figures for the livestock sector, which grew 140 percent in the first quarter, with earnings of $29.7 million. The export of traditional products, representing 35 percent of the country's total exports, recorded the greatest expansion, earning $137.1 million. This was due mainly to the upswing in the demand for and price of wool. Exports of dirty and semiwashed wool grew by 125 percent in volume, reaching 8,670 metric tons in the first quarter. Exports of meat and meat by-products rose by 14 percent, totaling $120 million. Other exports, however, which had greatly expanded last year, have so far this year recorded a decline. Exports of rice, for example, plummeted by 25 percent, while the export of electricity, which amounted to $11.3 million in the first quarter of 1993, is practically zero due to the drop in Argentine demand.
