Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation [Docket No. CP94&hyph;822&hyph;000] Take notice that on September 30, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue, S.E., Charleston, West Virginia 25314, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;822&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211) for authorization to construct and operate an additional point of delivery for interruptible transportation service to Gasco Distribution Systems, Inc. (Gasco) in Morgan County, Ohio, under Columbia's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;76&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Columbia proposes to establish a new point of delivery to Gasco at a location where it currently receives volumes from Gasco. Columbia states that it will deliver up to 100 dekatherms per day, 36,500 annually, to Gasco at the new point. Columbia further states that the new point has been requested by Gasco for interruptible transportation service for residential and commercial use. Columbia states that the quantities to be provided through the new point will be provided on an interruptible basis, and therefore, will have no impact on Columbia's existing design day and annual obligations to its customers. In addition, Columbia states that the estimated cost to establish the new point of delivery will be $15,778, which Gasco has agreed to reimburse Columbia for the total cost, plus any gross-up for tax purposes. Comment date: November 18, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before the comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and/or permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for applicant to appear or be represented at the hearing. G. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
