A catastrophic fall in production, a large "hole" in the local budget, a complex crime situation, and the low incomes of the city folk hamper the accomplishment of many social and economic tasks. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the supply of basic necessities--meat, butter, sugar, and even bread--in the city is as bad as it gets. This is no longer about obtaining merchandise with monthly ration cards, but about supplies to so-called closed institutions as well. Without exaggeration, many day-care centers and boarding schools are almost on starvation rations. Under these difficult circumstances, moral and material aid should also be provided to 350 families of martyrs and more than 30,000 refugees. There is one more difficulty. It is found in the fact that the desire to do as much as possible is not matched by the financial and economic potential and runs into the absence of clear-cut laws in the sphere of the economy and the banking system. How do the city authorities operate under such complex conditions? What is their vision of solutions to the most painful problems of the city's economy? Elsavar Ibragimov, the head of executive power of the city of Gyandzha, discusses this. Incidentally, let us note that he is the fifth person to hold this vital position in the last two years. [Ibragimov] When this office was entrusted to me in November last year, many people were interested to know whether I had a specific program for economic and social recovery in Gyandzha. Of course, there should be an element of planning in the work. This is certain. Unfortunately, in the last two to three years the condition of the city had become so lamentable that it was not easy to decide what to undertake first. There were problems with bread, gasoline, gas, and electricity; there was a shortage of cash in banks.... On top of everything, the crime situation has also become aggravated. Against the background of these unfavorable phenomena, certain forces have repeatedly attempted to disrupt the operation of the industrial sector and to discredit state authorities. We recall the nightmare of last winter and our powerlessness to do anything in response to a never-ending stream of complaints about the absence of gas. They began to use electricity everywhere to heat apartments. As a result, overloads caused 42 substations to burn out. In turn, without the substations it was impossible to provide drinking water from artesian wells. In a word, conditions were those of a city under siege. Everything possible was done in order to mitigate the situation. Despite their internal difficulties, many enterprises and organizations provided assistance to the city at that time. [Abdullayev] As we recall, that time was difficult for the residents of Gyandzha indeed. However, as we can see, the situation has more or less stabilized. We would like to know what the priorities are in the operation of the executive authorities at present. [Ibragimov] Locally, be it in a city or rayon, the operation of the authorities is rated on how good the supply of bread and water to the people is, what condition the roads are in, how urban transit operates, and how effective crime-control measures are. In the process, they entirely lose sight of the economy. I know that it will appear strange, but a majority of the residents of Gyandzha for some reason do not see that the city's facilities are dependent on how the industrial potential is used. It is no secret that the severance of economic relations and the introduction of national currencies in all former Soviet republics have paralyzed all industries almost everywhere. Certainly, Gyandzha is no exception on this score, either. Suffice it to mention that the decline in the volume of production since the beginning of this year comes to 20 percent of the corresponding period of 1993. As we can see, the causes are objective in nature in this case. It is understandable why we are not in a position to eliminate them with our own resources. For this reason, we focused our attention on areas of the development of the urban economy which are feasible for us; these are the roads, water supply, sewers, transportation. Incidentally, at one time large funds were assigned for these purposes. However, very little was actually done. There are no such centralized receipts now. However, the demand of the population for such services has, on the contrary, increased. Suffice it to say that one-quarter of the city does not have sewers; the water supply also leaves a lot to be desired. [Abdullayev] You said that at one time sizable funds were allocated to meet the needs of the city, and even stressed that this was done on a centralized basis. Clearly, all this is a matter of the past. Everything now depends on the potential of the city treasury.... [Ibragimov] I will say right away that it is being replenished with difficulty. Thus, in 1994 the expenditure side of the budget comes to 3 billion manats, whereas the revenue side is one-half that amount. Therefore, the budget deficit is set at 1.5 billion manats from the outset. This is why we are forced to take out a loan. Recently, we wheedled out 150 million manats from the Ministry of Finance of the republic. We received slightly more than this amount from that same Ministry of Finance last year. Living on credit has already become something of a norm. Opportunities for an infusion into the budget will remain quite modest until we succeed in substantially raising the effectiveness of the national economy. Some see a way out in raising taxes, floating internal and external loans, and currency emission. However, this is not the way. Incidentally, I cannot but recall the high tax rates on commercial space which were introduced a few weeks ago. In essence, this is a tax on empty counters. As a result, the stores divided their sales floors into two parts. One of the halves is supposedly assigned for storage. Many stores in Gyandzha have become quite ugly because of this. Yet this could have been foreseen had they been aware that the condition of the state trade sector is now lamentable. Unfortunately, we appear to have forgotten that all of 80 percent of the budget, at any rate in Gyandzha, is replenished by contributions from the profits of industrial enterprises. So, if they functioned the way they did before, there would be no problems at all. However, as we can see, industry turned out to be powerless in the face of the disintegration of the unified economic mechanism on which the economy of the Soviet period was based. [Abdullayev] In a word, it so happens that now it is difficult to hope for the implementation of particular large economic projects. To your mind, is there a way out of this financial impasse? After all, there are times when you cannot get loans. Besides, on occasion it is very hard to pay them back. [Ibragimov] We understand this full well. I admit that the money received goes into a bottomless pit--this is how expensive everything has now become. For example, we recently spent 70 million manats we had obtained on credit just to cosmetically repair the roads. You would agree that under the circumstances it would be best to use internal reserves. This is what we are doing. Thus, we began, on a contractual basis, the construction of a shopping area in which 44 small stores will be located. Construction was done by a special construction and repair trust reporting to the city executive authorities, with funding being used from both legal entities and individuals. This made it possible to contribute more than 27 million manats to the treasury. Later, these funds were used to restore a 4 kilometer-long water main as well as sewers within the city limits. In a word, we saved a lot of funds. This is point one. Second, a work opportunity was provided for the special repair and construction trust whose financial situation was difficult. The search for internal reserves continues. We have several developed projects whose effectiveness has been evaluated. The construction of single-family houses, the sale of unfinished apartments in standard high-rise buildings to the population, and other measures. We want to thus draw housing and land allocated for houses and dachas into circulation on the market. Later, it will be possible to also sell small state enterprises, especially ones that are unprofitable. However, these are all forced measures. How are we to proceed otherwise if the funds taken in by the budget make it possible to pay only 60 percent of the wages in organizations financed from the budget? We have to compensate for the lacking 40 percent through loans. Unfortunately, as I see it, the people in Gyandzha, like those in other regions, do not always have a clear notion of the processes that are underway. They forget that previously the enterprises of the republic operated at full capacity. At present, many plants and combines in Gyandzha and everywhere else are on the brink of shutting down production. [Abdullayev] Actually, this is easy to conclude based on the fact that many locally produced goods, even basic ones, have disappeared from store shelves. [Ibragimov] The trouble is that a catastrophic slump in production has been registered not only in Gyandzha but everywhere. This is not to justify our local shortcomings. There is no dearth of those. Suffice it to say that compared to the corresponding period of last year, the decline in production in the first two months of this year comes to five tonnes for butter, 248 tonnes for dairy products, 720 tonnes for laundry soap, and 242 tonnes for meat and meat products. Some 110,000 fewer square meters of carpet and carpet products and 296,000 fewer pieces of porcelain products were produced. The list goes on. How are we to reverse the situation? We think that it is necessary to either undertake reorientation of industries or perfect the banking system. It is not ruled out that other constructive ways out of the impasse exist. Who should show the initiative? Primarily, reorganization of the industrial sector is at issue. So far, market reforms have not affected it at all. This is how it happens that the ministries should act as helmsmen. However, the ministries work on anything at all except production. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture responded with absolute calm to a stoppage at enterprises in Gyandzha such as the confectionery plant, the meat combine, and the dairy combine. The same situation has emerged with the production of industrially manufactured construction materials. The management of the industry is unconcerned about the fact that finished products worth billions of manats have accumulated at the alumina combine. The same is the case at the instrument-making plant. I will say this: The countless army of ministerial officials is of no use at all. Yet, they are good at harming all endeavors. I will give the following example. By a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers, the executive authorities of Gyandzha were authorized to dispose of 15 percent of the products manufactured at the enterprises of the city. We could bring in to Gyandzha many types of foodstuffs through barter transactions by taking advantage of this right. However, the ministries demand that we prepay the proportion of products which we could dispose of, but we do not have funds for these purposes "ahead of time." Our appeals to the heads of departments asking that they themselves provide foodstuffs to at least the day-care centers and hospitals reporting to them likewise produce no results. A vicious circle emerges. The answer is found in shortages, in the striving to make money off them, make it in any way possible. For example, overstocked warehouses at wineries, incidentally not only in Gyandzha, testify to this. One cannot help getting the impression that such an economic situation suits some people. [Abdullayev] How does the community of directors respond to this? [Ibragimov] It tries to avoid mass unemployment. For our part, we support in every way possible all initiatives of enterprise managers aimed at offering new jobs and becoming self-sufficient in at least the basic necessities. We also encourage the development of entrepreneurship and small businesses. These forms of activity that are new to us make it possible to provide jobs for many residents of Gyandzha. Suffice it to say that about 6,000 people work at small enterprises and in associations. [Abdullayev] As we know, a slump in production, deficit, and inflation are always accompanied by mounting crime-generating tensions. We would expect that not everything is favorable on this score in Gyandzha, too. [Ibragimov] You know, even earlier our city was one of the hot spots on the criminal map of the republic. The motives for and nature of crimes have now changed in a way. First, organized crime dominates. Second, if I can put it so, criminal entities have begun to penetrate industrial facilities, commercial structures, and banks. Moreover, they frequently attempt to control the activities of local authorities in the area of personnel selection. There are things for us to think over in this area. As is known, in the West organized crime controls only the criminal sectors of activity, such as prostitution, the drug trade, and gambling. In turn, our organized crime controls virtually all types of activities. This is associated with the fact that for a number of objective reasons, many facilities have in a way become criminal themselves. For example, in the environment of the severance of economic relations and absolute shortages, many enterprise managers are forced to resort to illegal means in order to obtain the resources necessary to fulfill production plans. This is how the initial knots of corruption are tied. Honest people also get caught in its nets against their will. For example, how are they to avoid the so-called "payola" which has become the norm when final products are sold? What kind of measures can one take given that the criminal elements intertwine with police organs and officials of all ranks? It is no secret that such intertwining endangers the political and economic development of our republic as a whole. In Gyandzha we are particularly concerned about the growth in grave crimes. In the last 1.5 years alone, 83 premeditated murders were committed. Most of them occurred last year when many firearms were "making the rounds" in private hands. Owing to the measures taken, bursts of automatic weapon fire are no longer heard at night, but based on certain facts we can conclude that by far not all of the weapons have been confiscated. [Abdullayev] However, the executive authorities are also responsible for order in the city.... [Ibragimov] Certainly. However, we are frequently at odds with the leadership of the republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs. Thus, a few months ago the chief of airport police was relieved from his position by a decision of the city executive authorities. However, our petition on this issue still remains "unresponded to"--pardon me for unintended bureaucratese. All of this causes various false rumors. The most terrifying thing is that people lose their belief in justice. [Abdullayev] As is known, progress in society as a whole largely depends on the welfare of all regions. This begs the question.... [Ibragimov] I understand. I think I will be expressing everybody's opinion if I say that we first of all need to put an end to the war by political means. It claims many human lives. In Gyandzha alone 350 families are in mourning; tens of thousands of refugees are in a hopeless situation. Putting it plainly, people are just tired. The republic budget is not standing up to the war, either. For this reason the citizens of Gyandzha, like an overwhelming majority of Azeris, entirely support the peace-loving policy of the president of our republic. Of course, we understand that not everything will fall into place, and not right away. However, we believe that even a bad peace will make it possible to refocus our attention on the implementation of reforms and the economic revival of Azerbaijan. [Abdullayev] We second your hopes. Thank you for the interview.
