TT's new leader also stresses the importance of maintaining a steady course in economic policy. "Predictability and stability are important," he stressed. George Ehrnroth warns various interest groups against useless bullying on the EU issue. "Declaring that `we will not join unless we get this and that...' is dangerous. This applies not to only the closest circle around the MTK [Central Federation of Agricultural Producers], but also the SAK [Confederation of Finnish Trade Unions], whose chairman has indicated a special link between the position on the EU and the general validity of the collective wage bargaining agreement. ``Let us now get a good result through negotiations, not bullying. The people and the parliament can then decide whether to take it or leave it. ``All of us surely agree that Finnish agriculture must be ensured a reasonable basis of existence. The rural districts must stay populated and we must safeguard our self-sufficiency in foodstuffs. ``Agriculture cannot, however, cope better than the economy as a whole. Industry will prosper if we are in the EU. As a consequence, the whole economy -- including agriculture -- will fare better than outside the EU.'' EEA Is Only the B League ``The choice is not between the past and the EU. What is at stake is our capacity to adapt inside or outside the EU. Adaptation within the EU is certainly easier in the long run.'' Ehrnroth said that being part of the single market is an important prerequisite for attracting investments to Finland. "The EEA [European Economic Area] agreement provides in principle good opportunities in this respect. But if the EU is the A team, the EEA remains just the B team. ``Industrial enterprises always try to minimize their risk-taking in investments. As members of the EU we will be committed to convergence targets (targets of a disciplined economic policy), in a stronger way than now. This means greater adherence to the policies of low inflation, stable currency rates, and other general political objectives, than if we were members of the EEA,'' he explained. "This will influence investment decisions among Finnish enterprises as well as direct foreign investments and purchases of shares on the Finnish stock market." There Have Been Many Positive Developments TT's chairman said that the Finnish economy has shown many positive developments during the past year. A fundamental one has been the rapid growth in exports that has created a positive trade balance and further on a positive payment balance. Foreign debt, which was approaching a critical limit, has also turned. The interest level has also come down and some intelligent solutions in terms of cost control and flexibility have been reached on the labor market. "But the economy is still out of balance," said Ehrnroth, alluding to the high unemployment rate and the enormous deficit of the state economy. ``It is essential that we do not stop and give a sigh of relief. We must stay on the steady course of restructuring. The depression is cyclical only in part.'' The improved balance of payments has created a base for confidence in the Finnish economy. But to maintain this confidence we must continue our target-oriented financial policy. "Any emerging doubts regarding the continuation of a dynamic export strategy will show as a halt in foreign investments. The crisis in finance may worsen again," Ehrnroth warned. He gave the reminder that foreign investments on the stock market alone have reached 30-40 billion markkas in a short time. Other important direct investments are those of ABB [Asea Brown Boveri], ICL, and Kvaerner Masa-Yards. We should get more of these. The Election Budget Is a Big Risk Ehrnroth said that historically there has been an "alarmingly high" correlation between election years and soft budgets. "We cannot afford to make that mistake again. We must really hope that the government has stable ground under its feet." Ehrnroth pointed out that the state economy contains concealed deficits over and above this year's 70-billion-markka national deficit. "The TEL [Employee Pension System] alone contains a 5 billion deficit this year." Good Competitiveness Is Needed The Ministry of Finance estimates that Finnish price competitiveness is now about 40 percent above its historical average. Rapid growth in productivity, moderation in wage settlements, and the exchange rate of the markka will determine our competitiveness. "The markka has strengthened lately. This is understandable due to the somewhat excessive weakening of the exchange rate. The growing pressure to force the markka upwards should now be countered with lower interest rates. A continued re-evaluation would be harmful to competitiveness and hurt exports, an area where success is extremely important." Ehrnroth stresses the importance of maintaining a stable currency and a low interest rate also on a longer-term basis. The Land of Quality Products "Finland should never become a down-market producer because of a weaker markka. Our nation can only manage by producing high-quality products with a sufficient R&D content. ``These products require markets that are considerably greater than Finland's. To maintain our present standard of living, we must be able to participate freely in the international distribution of work, with our proper sectors, where we can continue to develop.'' Ehrnroth thinks there may be a longer-term risk that the markka will be revalued if productivity grows rapidly and costs are kept under control. "The development of the markka depends to a large extent on these factors. There is currently no great danger that the markka will grow stronger." Ehrnroth pointed out that the total industrial labor costs in Finland are about the same as in the Nordic countries, France, and the Netherlands. They are clearly higher than those of Spain and Portugal, to say nothing of Poland and the East European countries.
