ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends the regulations governing institutional eligibility under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). The regulations implement new HEA statutory provisions that were added by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993. In general, these new statutory provisions tightened the eligibility requirements for institutions participating in the student financial assistance programs authorized under title IV of the HEA (title IV, HEA programs). The regulations also clarify existing provisions, and, in keeping with the statutory changes, tighten procedures governing institutional eligibility determinations. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations take effect on July 1, 1994, with the exception of §§600.5, 600.7, 600.10, 600.20, 600.30, 600.31 which will become effective after the information collection requirements contained in these sections have been submitted by the Department of Education and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. If you want to know the effective date of these provisions of the regulations, call or write the Department of Education contact person. A document announcing the effective date will be published in the Federal Register .

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Institutional Eligibility regulations contain requirements that apply to all postsecondary educational institutions that seek initial or continued eligibility to apply to participate in the programs authorized by the HEA. On February 10, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this part in the Federal Register , 59 FR 6446&hyph;6465. The NPRM included a discussion of major issues surrounding the proposed changes that will not be repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which a discussion of those issues can be found. Definitions in §600.2 (pages 6446&hyph;6447). Institution of higher education in §600.4 (pages 6447&hyph;6448). Proprietary institution of higher education in §600.5 (pages 6448&hyph;6450). Conditions of institutional ineligibility in §600.7 (pages 6450&hyph;6451). Treatment of a branch campus in §600.8 (page 6451). Written agreement between an eligible institution and another institution or organization in §600.9 (page 6451). Date, extent, duration, and consequence of eligibility in §600.10 (pages 6451&hyph;6452). Special rules regarding institutional accreditation or preaccreditation in §600.11 (page 6452). Change in ownership resulting in a change of control in §600.31 (pages 6452&hyph;6454). Eligibility of additional locations in §600.32 (page 6454). Loss of eligibility in §600.40 (page 6454). Termination and emergency action proceedings in §600.41 (page 6454). The following discussion describes the significant changes since publication of the NPRM and the manner in which certain critical provisions will be initially implemented. They are discussed in the order in which they appear in the text of the regulations. If a provision applies to more than one section or is included in more than one section, it is discussed the first time it appears with an appropriate reference to its other appearances. Section 600.5␣Proprietary Institution of Higher Education With regard to the two-year rule, the Secretary provides exceptions to the requirement that the program an institution lists on its initial eligibility application be substantially the same as the program it offered for two years preceding that application. An institution may satisfy the two-year rule even if it substantially changed the subject matter of its program over the two-year period if that change was made because of new technology or the requirements of other Federal agencies. In addition, an applicant institution may count as part of the two-year rule any period during which it was a branch campus. These changes also apply to the two-year rule for postsecondary vocational institutions in §600.6. The Secretary changed the manner in which an institution calculates whether it satisfies the 85 percent rule. Instead of determining the amount of title IV, HEA program funds it received over an award year and the amount of revenues it received over a fiscal year in the fraction set forth in §600.5(d), institutions will use their latest fiscal year to determine both amounts. Instead of determining the amount of title IV, HEA program funds received on a cash basis of accounting and the amount of revenue received on an accrual basis of accounting, institutions will use a cash basis of accounting for both title IV, HEA program funds and revenues. Institutions must report to the Department of Education that they do not satisfy the 85 percent rule no later than 90 days after the last day of their fiscal year, and institutions that fail to satisfy the 85 percent rule will become ineligible on the last day of their fiscal year.
