The Title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C numerical standards were derived from PY 1992 aggregate performance data reported on the JTPA Annual Status Report (JASR) and are generally set at a minimally-acceptable level that approximately 75% of the SDA's can be expected to exceed. Revising the numerical standard for the Youth Entered Employment Rate (YEER) in the same way would lead to reduced standards for SDAs. However, recent National JTPA Study results suggest that employment and earnings experienced by out-of-school youth in JTPA fall short of acceptable levels. Therefore, to encourage improved services to out-of-school youth, the numerical standard for the YEER will remain at its current level of 41 percent. Earnings standards have been adjusted to account for expected future inflation. Finally, an additional special adjustment has been made to employment-related standards to account for the requirement in section 106(k) that permits credit, for performance standards purposes, only for employment that is scheduled for 20 or more hours per week. Similar to the Title II&hyph;A and Title II&hyph;C standards, the Title III standard was derived from PY 1992 performance data reported on the Worker Adjustment Program Annual Program Report (WAPR). This standard is set at a level that, approximately, 75 percent of the substate areas can be expected to exceed. As with the employment measures for Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, an adjustment has been made to take into account the 20-hour per week employment requirement. Since discrete aggregate data were not available for PY 1992 Section 204(d) Older Worker program performance, available SPIR data were used to assist in setting performance standards levels for that program. As with the employment measures for Titles II&hyph;A, II&hyph;C, and III, an adjustment has been made to take into account the 20-hour per week employment requirement. Note: Programs operated under section 204(d) are State programs even though they may be managed by various local entities. Therefore, performance standards will be applied to the total older worker programs State-wide. Unlike the adult and youth programs under Title II&hyph;A/C, however, no incentive awards or sanctions are associated with these standards. 6. Implementing Provisions . The following implementing requirements must be followed: A. Required Standards . For Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, Governors are required to set, for each SDA, a numerical performance standard for each of the six Secretary's measures; for the Older Worker program, Governors are required to set numerical Entered Employment Rate and Average Wage at Placement standards for programs operated under section 204(d); for Title III, Governors are required to set for each substate area a numerical performance standard for the Entered Employment Rate and are encouraged to establish an Average Wage at Placement goal B. Setting the Standards . Consistent with new legislative provisions, Governors are now required to adjust the Secretary's performance standards to reflect local area circumstances (section 106(d)). Such adjustments apply to Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C, section 204(d) and Title III programs, and must conform to the Secretary's parameters described below: 1. Procedures must be: _Responsive to the intent of the Act, _Consistently applied among the SDA's/SSA's, _Objective and equitable throughout the State, _In conformance with widely accepted statistical criteria; 2. Source data must be: _Of public use quality, _Available upon request; 3. Results must be: _Documented, _Reproducible; and 4. Adjustment factors must be limited to: _Economic factors, _Labor market conditions, _Geographic factors, _Characteristics of the population to be served, _Demonstrated difficulties in serving the population (this adjustment factor is new), and _Type of services to be provided. The Department offers Governors an adjustment methodology that conforms both to these parameters and to the requirement in section 106(d). This methodology covers Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C Section 204(d), and Title III programs and will be provided to States in a soon-to-be issued Training and Employment Information Notice. Should the Governor choose to use an alternate methodology, or make adjustments not addressed by the Departmental model, it must conform to the parameter criteria and be documented in the Governor's Coordination and Special Services Plan (GCSSP) prior to the program year to which it applies. The State Job Training Coordinating Council and, where appropriate, the State Human Resources Investment Council must have an opportunity to consider adjustments to the Secretary's standards and to recommend variations. To determine whether an SDA has met or exceeded a performance standard, Governors must use actual end-of-year program data to recalculate the performance standards. C. Performance Standards Definitions . Governors must calculate the performance of their SDA's, SSA's, and section 204(d) programs according to the definitions included in the Attachments. D. Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C Incentive and Sanction Policies . Performance standards are to be established for programs funded under Titles II and III of the Act. In applying the Secretary's standards for Titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C, Governors must use the six core measures and also consider criteria relating to programs successfully serving out-of-school youth and placement in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits. Governors are encouraged to begin using these criteria in PY 1994 incentive policies; these criteria are required (i.e., they cannot be zero-weighted) to be incorporated into State incentive policies beginning in PY 1995. Governors may select additional non-cost measures, such as increased service to hard-to-serve participants, to form the basis of incentive policies as long as the following criteria are met: 1. As the basis for making incentive awards, the Governors must use all (i.e., cannot ``zero weight'' any ) of the six Secretary's core measures. Beginning in PY 1995, Governors will also be required to reward innovative out-of-school youth program models either identified by the Department of Labor or recognized by the State as having a demonstrated record of success, and placements in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits. Although successful programs for out-of-school youth remain the cornerstone of out-of-school incentives, SDA's will still be expected to exceed the 50 percent minimum service level to be rewarded under that criterion. Governors have considerable flexibility in implementing the new incentive criteria. Suggested approaches to addressing these criteria are included as Attachments 3 and 4 to this TEGL. Decisions regarding the relative weight or emphasis of each core measure (e.g., the Youth Entered Employment Rate) and incentive criterion (e.g., placement in jobs with employer-assisted benefits) in a State's incentive award formula rest with the Governor.
