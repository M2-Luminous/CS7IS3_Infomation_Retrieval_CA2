Responding to a question on detention of some pro-democracy elements during the visit of French prime minister to Beijing and Shanghai, Shen Guofang said: First I must correct you, they are not pro-democracy elements, they are criminal elements. Many of them are still on parole, during which period the Chinese judicial department has the power to take any action, and this is entirely unrelated to the French prime minister's visit to China.
