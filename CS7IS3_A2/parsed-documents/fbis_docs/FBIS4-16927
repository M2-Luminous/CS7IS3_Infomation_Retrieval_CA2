No official response from the central authority followed, however. The Crimean President's Decree on currency regulation and control provides, in particular, for establishment, within a two-month term of the Crimean Interbank Currency Exchange, which is supposed to sell the mandatory 50-percent share of Crimea's aggregate hard currency incomings to Crimea's residents. Prior to the hard currency trading onset Crimean residents are free to opt for one of the following modes: (a) Effect mandatory 50 percent currency sales and purchases on the Crimean interbank market at a free rate, or (b) Pay the currency tax at rates set by the Crimean Government. The remainder of hard currency incomings is supposed to be used by Crimean residents at their discretion. Foreign currency means derived by natural person-residents by way of their labor remuneration, except those earned through business activities, are exempt from the otherwise mandatory sale. The Crimean Republican Bank sets exchange rates for currencies on a daily basis. So, if this decree proves viable and working, Crimea's currency regulation mode will radically differ from the Ukrainian government-imposed practices, which imply mandatory selling a half of all the currency earned by Ukrainian producer-exporters at the NBU [National Bank of Ukraine]-set rate maintained at the very unrealistic 1,2610 krb. [karbovonets]:1 USD rate for over five months by now. The other half of hard currency earnings may be used only by the agreement of the Cabinet's body, which was specifically set up for this purpose. Crimean President Meshkov's decree on improving taxation and settling in Crimea's national economy contains some innovative provisions, not consistent with Ukraine's active legislation, in particular, abrogation of the income tax and introduction of a 30 percent tax on juridical persons' profits, consumption funds for all tax-payers, irrespective of their proprietorial form status, reduced VAT and excise for a number of commodities to spur their marketing. The decree's preamble states that their issuance was by way of compliance with President Kravchuk's decree of 23 June 1993 "On the open economy regime on the Crimean Republic's territory." In view of Kiev's lacking official comments it's a matter of pure guess-work and sheer conjecture to try to both determine the Crimean presidential decrees' politically declarative content and predict how soon, if ever, they will be nullified by President Kravchuk. However, if really implemented, they are certain to attract a massive flow of banking capital into the peninsular republic. Many analysts tend to trace the decrees to Chairman of the Crimean Council of Ministers Saburov, who more likely than not is their architect.
