The Notice was published in the Federal Register on March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12984). The Company requested that the Department review its certification for workers of the subject firm. New information from the company shows some worker separations in Arizona who were engaged in employment related to the production of computer printer ribbons. The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers of Aspen Imaging International Inc., who were affected by increased imports of computer printer ribbons. The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,383 is hereby issued as follows: All workers of Aspen Imaging International Inc., Lafayette, Colorado and in Arizona engaged in employment related to the production of computer ribbons who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after May 3, 1993 and before March 1, 1994 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. I further determine that all workers at Aspen Imaging International, Inc., Lafayette, Colorado engaged in the production of laser printer toner cartridges are denied eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 5th day of August, 1994. James D. Van Erden, Administrator, Office of Work-Based Learning.
