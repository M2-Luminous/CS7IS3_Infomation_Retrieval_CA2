At a news conference held at the Arab League this evening on the sidelines of the Arab League Council meetings, he said Egypt rejected Iraqi aggression and launched the first formula of Arab legitimacy rejecting aggression and occupation. He added that Egypt's stand took shape in an effective participation in efforts to eliminate the effects of aggression. He expressed his belief that the Security Council will not lift the sanctions imposed on Iraq as long as Iraq continues to disrespect Kuwait's independence and sovereignty, refuses to implement Security Council Resolution 833, refuses to repatriate Kuwaiti and other detainees, and refuses to return all property and compensate those affected by the aggression. He said: We are all suffering because of the Iraqi people's suffering but we must emphasize that the one responsible for the continuation of this suffering is Iraq, which rejects international resolutions, particularly Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712, which provide food and medicine for the Iraqi people. He added that Iraq is still threatening security and stability in the Gulf region and is far from fully implementing all articles of the Security Council resolutions on its aggression against Kuwait. He went on to say that Iraq procrastinates and is selective about these resolutions and is pursuing its repressive measures against its people. Replying to a question on Kuwaiti detainees held in Iraq, he said the detainees' files that were forwarded to the International Red Cross were full and complete but Iraqi authorities did not allow the Red Cross to visit Iraq and search for the detainees. He turned down an Iraqi proposal to form a popular committee from the Gulf countries to visit Iraq for a fact-finding mission on the detainees. He said Kuwait has done a great deal for Arab solidarity and it is not happy with the Arab world's current fractured situation. But, he added, the Kuwaiti people find it difficult to accept reconciliation with Iraq unless it implements all Security Council resolutions. He noted that he intends to visit the Arab Maghreb countries soon to improve ties with them. He stressed Kuwait's identity and its Arab affiliation despite joint military maneuvers with Western countries. He said Kuwait will sign a security accord with Russia as part of its efforts to sign security accords with the Security Council's permanent members. The Kuwaiti foreign minister said his country has extended development aid for the Iraqi people in the north and south and affirmed that Kuwait does not favor the partition of Iraq. He said he has good ties with the Iraqi opposition but stressed that this does not mean an alliance with the opposition to overthrow the Iraqi regime. He noted that Kuwait has lifted the boycott in the second and third degrees on companies that deal with Israel but affirmed that Kuwait will not lift the first-degree, direct boycott of Israel until after Israeli forces have withdrawn from the occupied Arab territories. He said his country is not prepared to host Israelis in the framework of the Middle East multilateral peace talks. Answering a question on the demarcation of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border, the Kuwaiti foreign minister said the territory that was given to Kuwait by the UN agreement did not result in the addition of a single inch of Iraqi land to Kuwait and, thus, Iraq lost nothing because this territory was originally Kuwaiti. [In an earlier Cairo-datelined report of the news conference, Cairo MENA in Arabic at 1538 GMT on 27 March added: "Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, Kuwaiti first deputy prime minister and foreign minister, announced that his country will host a conference of the Damascus Declaration countries in June."]
