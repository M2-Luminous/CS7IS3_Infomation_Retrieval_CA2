The mainly economic principles that Mr. Cosea has followed so far have been replaced by mainly political ones, to an overwhelming degree. No doubt, Mr. Cosea has an innate talent of "causer," along with an intellectual finesse that make him outstanding among the members of Vacaroiu's cabinet. However, Mr. Cosea failed in his attempt to totally hide the clear pressure he is facing from the representatives of the leftist PDSR to limit, at least in the first phase, the possibility of concentrating capital in the hands of a few businessmen or society people. Accelerated Privatization Does Not Require Legislative Modifications [ROMANIA LIBERA] Mr. Cosea! The Council you are heading has developed a program of accelerated privatization. Is this a readapted old program, or a totally new one? [Cosea] This is not a new program; nor can it be a new program because other people have considered this problem before us. The various programs that are now in circulation under various names in Bucharest are actually programs of Prague University, namely the programs of Rapacinski and Friedmann. In the new program, we are starting from some rules of the game that cannot be ignored: 1. The current legislation must be preserved although, from my viewpoint, it would have been preferable to modify it, namely to simplify it and make it more transparent. The present law is not very bad, but it is too sophisticated and disregards some realities prevailing in Romania, namely the reduced economic education and an almost non-existent infrastructure and computerization in this area. 2. The need for the privatization process to be fully transparent because, at the level of the individual person, privatization means corruption, quick accumulation of wealth, and traffic through influence. 3. A maximal simplification of the procedures and methods. And very much connected to the above is the possibility envisaged in the new program, namely to use a variety of privatization methods, not only the MEBO [Management and Employee Buy-on] or a standard method, for example. One Certificate -- One Man -- One Enterprise [ROMANIA LIBERA] Concretely, what is the time span of the privatization program? [Cosea] In the first phase, the program aims at solving two problems: Setting up the system of ownership certificates and establishing a secondary capital market in which these certificates can be marketed. Through this program, we proposed to limit the possibilities of changing these certificates into stocks at the enterprises to be privatized, on the basis of "one certificate/man/enterprise." We must give equal chances to all the certificate owners, at least in the first wave of privatization (about 3,000 enterprises eligible for privatization beginning with 1 September 1994), because there is real social pressure in this direction. [ROMANIA LIBERA] However, when some people have sold their certificates for meager sums, there were generally buyers; in other words, there was a certain balance of supply and demand [Cosea] From the viewpoint of the market economy, there is indeed a perfect balance. The only problem is that we do not have a market economy, and the level of our economic education does not allow such an approach. Once a person has sold his certificate, I can tell him "good day." But he will ask me what the government has done in the last two years to explain to him how and when to use these certificates. Nothing! Therefore, we thought of an equitable solution, but I repeat, in the first "wave" of privatization. The Last Train for Romania [subhead] [ROMANIA LIBERA] Will such a restrictive measure lead to a conflict between the government and the large owners of certificates, many of them important supporters of the government? [Cosea] In this first phase, privatization will certainly create great dissatisfaction. This also explains the lack of political will that has been characteristic so far. Privatization is a risk and, for any party, it can become a factor of losing support. When they accepted this role, those who are in the government must also have accepted the risk of leaving the game. On the other hand, they have an immense responsibility, and knowing the moment when actions must be taken is of major importance. This moment is the last one for Romania. If we continue to delay privatization and continue to be afraid of the possibility of losing political support or of a government fall, the risk is great.... [ROMANIA LIBERA] Is this program the best version of privatization for Romania? [Cosea] In any case, this program will accelerate privatization and, in the second phase, by liberalizing the exchange system of the aforementioned certificates (beginning with 1 January 1995), a series of improvements will be made to allow access to an unlimited number of certificates on the market. There Are No Declared Enemies [ROMANIA LIBERA] Could this program be blocked by a decision? [Cosea] Theoretically, it can be blocked at the level of three factors: the Private Property Funds, the State Property Fund, and the Government Property Fund. However, it has no declared enemy yet. [ROMANIA LIBERA] You advance the possibility of privatizing 3,000 enterprises in the framework of this program by the end of this year. The representatives of the World Bank in Bucharest showed distrust in this version, and only saw the possibility of privatizing a few hundred enterprises at this stage. [Cosea] The program was presented to the World Bank and they made some constructive observations with some interesting points. I know that there is distrust regarding the number of firms that can be privatized this year, but I think that we can carry out what we have decided. [ROMANIA LIBERA] You are the first Romanian official who connected his position to the implementation of a certain goal. You declared that you would have resigned if the treaty with the IMF had not been signed at the end of 1993. Will you do the same if this program is not fully implemented? [Cosea] I think that, before I resign, if the program is not implemented, they will dismiss me!
