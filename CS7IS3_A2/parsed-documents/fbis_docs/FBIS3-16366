Among the problems facing the Cabinet of Ministers today Oleg Soskovets named "the state's participation in the country's economic development, the improvement of tax policy, the elimination of nonpayments, and the social thrust of reforms." The government is particularly concerned at the situation in the social sphere, in agriculture, and in the military-industrial complex. According to Soskovets, a complex situation is taking shape in the military-industrial complex today. Economic ties between enterprises have been ruptured by ill-considered conversion, and in some places the defense industry's scientific and production potential has been seriously undermined. A further reduction in the defense budget could lead to the total stoppage of production facilities working for the needs of defense. Reducing expenditure on the Armed Forces means "freezing" the further course of reforms and of structural restructuring in the Russian Army. As Oleg Soskovets said, the government is drawing up measures to encourage production in the sphere of the military-industrial complex. In particular, conditions are being created for emerging onto the foreign market and expanding the defense industry's export potential. As regards the state budget as a whole for 1994, in Oleg Soskovets' opinion the revenue part has not been worked out here. For example, the planned revenue from privatization has been understated. But the budget will be finalized in the government as early as this week, and the document will be submitted to the State Duma committees. At present the budget deficit stands at 9.9 percent. The government is concerned at the social stratification of society, which is unprecedented on the scale of modern civilized countries, when approximately 30 percent of the population is living below the poverty line, while the incomes of another section of Russians are growing inordinately. At the same time commercial activity is most lucrative, as distinct from activity in the sphere of physical production.
