Nikolaou: "Prime Minister Mitsotakis' Tragic Mistakes"] [Excerpt] The deadlock our country faces today in our foreign policy -- and particularly our isolation in the Skopje issue -- originated in the tragic mistakes of the Mitsotakis government. However, the then-opposition, which is today the government, bears serious responsibilities because it, too, focused on the question of the name [Macedonia]. These views were expressed by former Prime Minister G. Rallis in an interview given to TO VIMA. The former prime minister urges the political leadership to agree on a consensual policy to find a realistic solution. G. Rallis in his interview with our political editor N. Nikolaou speaks also on the government's policies up till now and finds that A. Papandreou is not keeping his promise to offer equal treatment under the law to all citizens, but instead he is bringing back the partisan way of thinking in the Army, the civil administration etc. Here is the text of the interview. [Nikolaou] The government has already completed three months in power. It may be that it is too early to assess its work (although in the economy much has already been done), but it would be useful to have an evaluation of at least the "style" of the new government. [Rallis] I was hoping that A. Papandreou with the experiences of his previous eight-year term as prime minister and with the knowledge that this is his last term as prime minister -- regardless of the likelihood of his moving to the presidency of the republic -- would this time keep the promise he gave right after the 1981 electoral victory of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] that he would be the prime minister of all Greeks -- a promise he soon forgot. The disappointing fact is that, unfortunately, not even now is he going to carry out this promise which, in any event, is a self-evident democratic principle for a parliamentary prime minister. Already from the very first days of his new prime ministership, it appears that in all political decisions the partisan spirit is prevailing and that in the end he surrenders to that spirit. It is not necessary to emphasize how destructive the perpetuation of this tactic is for our country. [Nikolaou] But has he given any signs of such a divisive policy? What specific instances do you have in mind? [Rallis] I want to believe that this tactic of going along with this partisan mentality is not his deliberate personal choice. What is important, however, is that regardless of his intentions the harmful effects are there and more are coming at a time when, because of the many and critical problems facing the country, it is imperative that we avoid upheavals and that we promote instead peace and tranquillity. But the events of the last days in December in the sector of city transportation in Athens and in the armed forces show that the need for calm, especially at this moment, is hardly understood. [Passage omitted] [Nikolaou] Let us move now to the armed forces. By what logic did the present government not have the right to recall to active duty officers who were removed for purely partisan reasons? [Rallis] I would like to make a few comments regarding the events in the crucial and sensitive sector of the armed forces and of the police. In July 1974, immediately after the fall of the dictatorship, the former government of national unity faced a tremendous problem caused by the seven-year dictatorship especially in the armed forces. In spite of those difficulties, the government of national unity managed to deal with the situation by recalling to active duty only one high-ranking officer, Lieutenant General Dionisios Arbouzis. Many other excellent officers were in retirement, such as Peridis and Erselman -- to speak only of those who have passed away -- but there were many others too. Nevertheless, the former government decided that for the good of the armed forces it should not recall them to active duty. With this policy the government restored and secured not only legality but also order and discipline in the armed forces. The beneficial effect was soon evident in the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, which became indeed strong and battle-ready. Today's government, when it took over two and one-half months ago, faced no similar problems nor did it face any unrest in the armed forces. Therefore, it had no reason to replace their leadership. In any event, the military leadership -- namely the chiefs of the four general staffs and the commander of the armed forces [Stratia] -- should be replaced only in the event they refuse to implement the government's defense policies. Such a problem did not exist. The government's view of a multiparty military leadership with representation from all parties and other new-found ideas are totally unacceptable. The cadres of the armed forces do not belong to political parties nor do they act in a partisan way. Free, democratic citizens vote for the candidates of their choice, but they belong to the armed forces and to the nation, not to political parties. Nonetheless, the government has recalled to active duty several retired general officers in all three weapons, four of whom took over the post of chief in the General Staff of National Defense [YEEThA], the Army General Staff [YES], the General Staff of the Air Force [YEA] and the General Staff of the Navy [YEN]. And let me say that it is possible that all four are good officers but I do not think that they are better than the two I mentioned earlier. As General Verivakis, the former chief of YEEThA, correctly said, the return of the retired officers to active duty has indeed created a major issue in the ranks of the officers and of the armed forces in general. Self-respect and the unrest caused many resignations harmful to the cohesion, the strength, and the defense capabilities of the armed forces. Personally I would agree with those resignations. But I cannot but appreciate the honest and courageous decision of those who resigned sacrificing their career to uphold the ethical code that must guide the officer corps. I cannot understand why Air Force General N. Kouris, the present deputy minister of defense, did not protest this partisan domination of the armed forces, which brings back to our country the mentality and the political climate of national discord between the World War I and II, which brought such calamities to the nation. And I must say that I have personal knowledge of General Kouris' abilities because of my work with him when I was prime minister. [Nikolaou] The New Democracy [ND] government had recalled retired officers to active duty, and in fact some of them had served in the military police [ESA] during the dictatorship as stated recently in the Chamber of Deputies. [Rallis] Yes, the ND government had recalled to active duty two retired general officers of the Air Force, and appointed them as chief and deputy chief of the Air Force general staff. It should have avoided it. In any event, there is a great deal of difference between that and the actions of the PASOK government this time. First of all, only two officers had been recalled then, and only in the Air Force. Most important, those two officers were not party cadres as is the case today. It is generally known that the Navy officer who was recalled to active duty and was appointed chief of YEEThA was until the eve of his recall a member of the PASOK Central Committee. Regardless of the abilities and the qualifications of the recalled officers, and for some of them I have many reservations, the fact that immediately after their retirement they had become active PASOK party cadres should have ruled out any thought of bringingh them back to active duty. Never before has a similar action taken place and indeed to such extent not only in the armed forces but also in the police, even in the fire-fighting corps. Retired officers were chosen for their leadership, too. This is an unbridled effort to bring the party into those crucial sectors which are directly related to our national integrity and social protection, at a time particularly critical for our country. [Nikolaou] Which were in your view the mistakes of the previous government with regard to Skopje? [Rallis] In my opinion, it was a very serious error that from the beginning the main -- the excessive, I would say -- focus was on the name of the small state, and that the proper emphasis was not given to the question of the borders, the Constitution, the flag, and the propaganda which I believe were much more important than the name. We fought with such a policy on a problem which the foreigners -- especially our European partners and the Americans -- cannot understand to the degree we wished, while at the same time we encouraged inside the country a not only useless, but in many ways dangerous nationalistic paroxysm. For the small Skopje state, without historical and cultural tradition, the name, even unwarranted, and the language, even if manufactured, constitute the only foundation for a separate state existence. I do not underestimate the significance of the name, nor do I ignore the ulterior motives it conceals. But the development of a specific threat we could have averted and eliminated through international guarantees and especially with the strengthening of our domestic front in all sectors. Errors of Strategy and Tactics [Nikolaou] On which specific areas do you find the erroneous moves of the Mitsotakis government? [Rallis] The moves of the government were unfortunate in several areas including (a) it did take advantage of the opportunity offered by the Pineiro Package; (b) after the removal of Samaras from the Foreign Ministry, the former government, instead of taking advantage of the opportunity to proceed with a "mid-course correction," continued with increased zeal the policies of the dismissed minister in full agreement with the former opposition; and (c) the government did not assess properly the alternative solutions as well as the possibility Skopje had to bypass the European Union. So, without a community plan which could have been an improved version of the Pineiro Package we were left to face the difficult problem alone, relying only on the "community solidarity" which is effective only when it is invoked by our strong partners. [Nikolaou] What were the consequences of our haphazard policy on Skopje? [Rallis] The consequences of this policy were clearly negative from the point of view of organizing the strategy and tactics for the effective defense of our national rights and the safeguarding of our country's interests. But there were also adverse consequences as a result of our policies including (a) the almost total concentration of our foreign policy on the Skopje issue, at the expense of any other constructive effort that could be undertaken for our country and any opportunity that came along in the new order in the Balkans and (b) essential weakening of our position on the coming developments of the Cypriot problem, especially at a time when the Cypriots ask for our most active assistance. In closing, I would like to say, sadly, that the Skopje issue is going from bad to worse for us, with the danger that we may not achieve what previously was given to us, as it has happened before in the Cypriot issue, too. We are reaping now the bitter harvest of our mistakes. But who is to blame? The present government accuses the previous government and today's opposition accuses the government. No one accepts responsibility on his part. But it is certain that they are all to blame -- government and opposition. It is at least hypocritical for one party to blame the other. This is an attitude which does not serve the national interest -- I would say it is harmful instead -- nor does it bring honor to the political leadership and neither does it upgrade our political life. The fatigue caused to the international community by prolonging this issue and the damage from this continuing deadlock cause haphazard and unrealistic moves. This situation should have forced the political leadership to agree at last on a consensual policy (which we often advocate but never implement) to find a realistic solution to this problem, a solution which of course will safeguard our interests. The Mistakes of Prime Minister Mitsotakis [Nikolaou] The recent developments on the Skopje issue with the diplomatic recognition of this state by six countries of the European Union show that the policy followed primarily by the previous government was leading to an impasse. How do you evaluate more generally this policy? [Rallis] In April 1992, while I was addressing the Chamber of Deputies on the Skopje issue, and in June of the same year in a joint statement on this issue with seven other personalities, we tried to turn the policy and the actions of the former government on this national issue to the right direction, without weakening our country's bargaining position. I had foreseen even then -- with accuracy, almost prophetically -- the adverse developments for Greece which followed and which unfortunately continue with painful consequences. Neither my efforts nor my specific warnings had any positive effect. [Nikolaou] Your proposal was not accepted by the government at that time. Was this the reason that led eventually to resigning as parliamentary deputy? [Rallis] The way things were going my worries intensified. I could not approve the actions of the government and -- even less -- I could not agree with the demagogic and jingoistic policies of the opposition, which had forced the ND government to a policy of impasse on the Skopje issue. PASOK is equally responsible for this deadlock. So I decided to resign from my parliamentary position on March 29, 1993, just before the voting on the Skopje issue shortly after midnight, with a letter addressed to the president of the Chamber of Deputies.
