FR941103-0-00074 FR941103-0-00010 (1) Emissions Inventory The CAA required an inventory of all actual emissions from all sources, as described in section 172(c)(3) by November 15, 1992. On November 13, 1992, the Cabinet submitted an emission inventory on the Owensboro and Edmonson County area. (2) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) The CAA also amended section 182(a)(2)(A), in which Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that O 3 nonattainment areas fix their deficient Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rules for O 3 . Areas designated nonattainment before amendment of the CAA and which retained that designation and were classified as marginal or above as of enactment are required to meet the RACT Fix-ups requirement. The Owensboro and Edmonson County areas were not designated nonattainment prior to 1990 and were classified as marginal O 3 nonattainment pursuant to the 1990 CAA. Therefore, these areas are not subject to the RACT fix-up requirement. However, Kentucky chose to apply RACT on all major sources which commenced on or after the effective date of a particular RACT rule. Kentucky submitted VOC RACT SIP revisions through the Cabinet to EPA on February 12, 1992, October 20, 1992, February 17, 1993, and March 4, 1993. Action was taken December 12, 1993, on the SIP revision submitted on February 12, 1992. Action was taken June 23, 1994, on the SIP revisions submitted on October 20, 1992, February 17, 1993, and March 4, 1993. (3) Emissions Statements The CAA required that the SIP be revised by November 15, 1992, to require stationary sources of oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) and VOCs to provide the state with a statement showing actual emission each year. This request to redesignate was submitted prior to the November 15, 1992 emissions statement deadline. Therefore, the emissions statement program is not a requirement for the Owensboro and Edmonson County areas. (4) New Source Review (NSR) The CAA required all classified nonattainment areas to meet several requirements regarding NSR, including provisions to ensure that increased emissions of VOCs compounds will not result from any new or major source modifications and a general offset rule. A SIP revision incorporating these requirements was due November 15, 1992. This request to redesignate was submitted prior to the November 15, 1992 NSR deadline. Therefore, the NSR program is not a requirement for the Owensboro and Edmonson County areas. 3. The Area Has a Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the CAA Based on the approval of provisions under the pre-amended CAA and EPA's prior approval of SIP revisions under the amended CAA, EPA has determined that Kentucky has a fully approved O 3 SIP under section 110(k) for the marginal nonattainment areas, which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as discussed above. 4. The Air Quality Improvement Must Be Permanent and Enforceable Several control measures have come into place since the nonattainment areas violated the O 3 NAAQS. Of these control measures, the reduction of fuel volatility from 11.4 psi to 8.6 psi, as measured by the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), and fleet turnover produced the most significant decreases in VOC emissions. The table below summarizes total emissions for VOCs. The difference between 1988 and 1990 are actual permanent and enforceable emission reductions which are responsible for the recent air quality improvement in the areas. The VOC emissions in the base year are not artificially low due to local economic downturn. The technical support documents (TSD) contain additional information on these reductions.
