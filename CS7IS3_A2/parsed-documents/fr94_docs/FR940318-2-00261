FR940318-2-00261 FR940318-2-00129 Federal Railroad Administration Petition for Waivers of Compliance In accordance with title 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has received from The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company a request for waiver of compliance with certain requirements of Federal regulations. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (ATSF) (FRA Waiver Petition Docket Number SA&hyph;93&hyph;8) The ATSF seeks a waiver of compliance from certain sections of 49 CFR part 231, Railroad Safety Appliance Standards. ATSF is requesting a permanent waiver of the provisions of 49 CFR part 231 which requires that bolts attaching handholds and other safety appliances on freight equipment be ``riveted over''. Title 49 CFR 231.1 (h)(4) requires that side handholds be securely fastened with not less than 1/2 inch bolts with nuts outside (when possible) and riveted over, or with not less than 1/2 inch rivets. Several other sections in part 231 address the application of safety appliances (sill steps, ladder treads, etc.) which requires that they be securely fastened with not less than 1/2 inch bolts with nuts outside (when possible) and riveted over, or with not less than 1/2 inch rivets. ATSF states that there is an inconsistency in the manner in which bolts on freight cars and those on locomotives must be secured. The regulations pertaining to bolts securing handholds on locomotives contain no similar requirement. See 49 CFR 231.30. ATSF relates that they use state-of-the-art elastic stop nuts which are not riveted over but have locking effectiveness and application advantages superior to those of metal bolts that are ``riveted over''. ATSF states that because there appears to be no safety related justification to treat safety appliance standards differently, the requirement that bolts on freight cars be riveted over is superfluous. Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comments, they should notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request.

All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.&hyph;5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.
