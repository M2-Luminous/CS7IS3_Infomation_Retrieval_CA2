In its election statement, the Bloc of Patriotic Forces heavily criticized the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents for "plotting to continue Ukraine's Nazi-style occupation of the Russian peninsula of Crimea." The participants in the rally voiced their unanimous contempt for Clinton and Kravchuk, saying they are doomed to "the pitiful fate of all invaders of Russian territories." The rally approved an appeal to Yevhen Saburov, the future prime minister of Crimea, demanding "an end to all talk of Crimea being a part of Ukraine." The rally urged "all patriots of Russia" to boycott the election to the Supreme Council of Ukraine and the election to the Supreme Council of Crimea according to party lists. The "patriots of Russia" proposed voting for their own candidates to the Supreme Council of Crimea, whose list was announced at the end of the rally.
