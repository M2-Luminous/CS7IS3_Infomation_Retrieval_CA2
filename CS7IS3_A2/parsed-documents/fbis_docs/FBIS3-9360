Beginning 2 January 1990, General Nicolae Militaru, [then] minister of national defense, and Gelu Voican led the takeover of the Securitate structures by the Ministry of National Defense. They elaborated a draft decree stipulating the establishment of the National Security Council [Consiliul Sigurantei Statului], but Ion Iliescu refused to sign it. Nicolae Militaru ordered the 566 officers working for the Bucharest Municipality Securitate and the majority of the officers of the former 4th Directorate for Military Counterespionage to be transferred to reserve duty. During the month of January [1990] Gelu Voican obtained the assent of the Provisional Government and Ion Iliescu to utilize the officers of the former Bucharest Municipality Securitate to set up a special directorate of the Ministry of Interior, which was done in maximum secrecy. They named that directorate UM [Military Unit] 0215. Its first commander was Admiral Cico Dumitrescu. However, the person that actually had command over the unit was Gelu Voican Voiculescu, who was also deputy prime minister. His first counselor was reserve General Nicolae Voican. One of his closest aides was Viorel Tache, formerly subordinate to General Doicaru at UM 0920, later officer of the "Inimical Writings" [Inscrisuri Dusmanoase] Bureau of the Bucharest Municipality Securitate, and currently owner of the Georgiana Ltd [company]. Later on the command [of UM 0215] was taken over successively by counterespionage Colonels Florin Calapod, Cristescu, and Harosa. An ample report that was broadcast on 11 February [1990] by Radio Free Europe revealed that during the time when Mihai Chitac was [interior] minister, the officers and noncommissioned officers of UM 0215 owned a number of false identification cards, each using various names, in the same way the Greek General Grylakis [involved in the Petromin scandal in Romania] and his men do, all of whom currently are under penal investigations in Athens. Following the 20 May 1990 general elections, UM 0215 was involved in every dirty affair: in the printing and circulating of the so-called Iron Guard fliers in Bacau and Bucharest, and the fabrication of false documents intended to discredit Corneliu Coposu, Radu Campeanu, and Marian Munteanu [opposition personalities]. On 18 February 1990 they staged the mob's forcing its way into the government headquarters, later on they acted to discredit the marathon rally in University Square, and in June 1990 they directed the moves of the miners in Bucharest. The Radio Free Europe report also mentions the fact that over that period of time the main opposition parties and the persons close to the significant opposition leaders were penetrated by officers of that unit. On 14 June 1990, Colonel Ion Nicolae and First Sergeant Corneliu Dumitrescu of UM 0215 supervised the stealing of documents and valuables from the home of [opposition leader] Ion Ratiu. Following the appointment of Doru Viorel Ursu as [interior] minister, they ceased to use false identification cards and manifold identities. The leadership of the unit was replaced by appointing Colonel Jenica Iosif as its commander and Colonel Ion Condoiu as deputy commander. That is when the rivalry began between UM 0215 and the SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service]. It seems that as long as the portfolio of interior was held by Doru Viorel Ursu and Victor Babiuc, the actions against the political opposition ceased. About 100 officers of the unit were transferred to SRI. This was followed by the firing of Colonel Ion Rusu. The current official structure of the leadership of UM 0215 is as follows: The Counterespionage Division is headed by Colonel Gheorghe Stan, former deputy of General Emil Macri; the Intelligence Division headed by Colonel Ion Condoiu; the aforementioned division consists of three services: The Antihooligan Fighting and Protection Service, headed by Colonel Dumitru Ionel; the Delinquency and Parasitism Service, headed by Colonel Dumitru Constantin; and the Economic Intelligence Service, headed by Colonel Ion Mandrila.
