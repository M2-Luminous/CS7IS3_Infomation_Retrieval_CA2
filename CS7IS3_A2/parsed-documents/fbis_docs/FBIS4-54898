Following the meeting with his counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, yesterday, today he met with Defense Minister Volker Ruehe. He also had talks with Hans Ulrich Klose, leader of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] group in the Bundestag. Eduard Kukan is now on his way to Berlin. Shortly before he left, our correspondent Branislav Zvara asked him to briefly sum up his talks so far: [Begin recording] [Kukan] After we had talks with Minister Kinkel, we were pleased to hear of support for Slovakia's efforts aimed at membership of the European Union and NATO, as was the case of Portugal, Spain, and other countries. In geographic terms, Germany is our closest partner, and Germany knows intimately the process of transformation that is under way in Slovakia because Germany itself is pursuing a similar process in one part of its territory. [passage omitted] [Zvara] Did you discuss the agreement on Slovakia's association with the European Union? According to Bundestag Chairwoman Mrs. Rita Suessmuth, this agreement should be ratified before the summer vacation. [Kukan] We discussed this issue, which Slovakia considers very important at this time, because before we submit our official membership application, all twelve [European Union countries] will have to complete the ratification process. Two countries, Denmark and Great Britain, have ratified the association agreement so far. Minister Kinkel reassured me that he does not envision ratification problems in the Bundestag and that it should take place as early as July. [Zvara] Minister, contacts between the Slovak Republic and Hungary have recently been very intensive. I would like to know whether Mr. Kinkel was briefed about these issues and mainly whether he was briefed about tackling some problem areas that have played a rather negative role in relations between Hungary and Slovakia. [Kukan] Germany is following with great interest the development of relations between Slovakia and Hungary. We discussed these issues, and the outcome of our discussion was that we will facilitate our own rapprochement with Europe if we can prove that we are sufficiently politically mature and advanced to address these issues on a bilateral basis. I assured the minister that this was precisely the way in which Slovakia approached these issues and that the new government has succeeded in creating a better and more calm atmosphere in relations with Hungary and that this atmosphere will, in effect, lead to solving these issues on a step-by-step basis, starting with the issues of lesser importance and later focussing on the big treaty with Hungary. We are confident that the two of us will be able to resolve these issues. [passage omitted] [end recording]
