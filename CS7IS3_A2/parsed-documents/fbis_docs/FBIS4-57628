Perez Balladares was accompanied by his future Foreign Minister Gabriel Lewis Galindo, his adviser Jose Luis Sosa, and Samuel Lewis Navarro at a joint news conference with Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, with whom he met at the government palace during a visit in which they discussed bilateral topics. Referring to the Treaty's fulfillment, he explained that the U.S. military presence will end on 31 December 1999 and that the bases will cease to exist on Panamanian territory. "For Panamanians, the return of the Canal and surrounding areas, as well as the administration of the Canal, are not open for discussion," Perez said. But he did admit that the United States and Panama could associate for other purposes. "We could say that the United States, Panama, and the world have a common enemy in narcotraffickers." According to Perez, the new Panamanian Government will be willing to discuss associating with other world nations in the antinarcotics struggle but noted that this does not mean retaining the military bases. Regarding the elimination of the Army's existence from the text of the Constitution, he made it clear that he is determined to end any chance that military regimes could recur. He told journalists that he had agreed with President Guillermo Endara on introducing into the Legislative Assembly a list of constitutional reforms, which includes eliminating any vestige of the National Guard (Army) from the Constitution. On the topic of Central American integration, he said that although there are common points of agreement between the two countries, from an economic standpoint Panama harbors some fears regarding its possible integration with Central America. In Perez's opinion, undoubtedly very good intentions will prompt a continuation of the dialogue with President Figueres to strengthen ties between the two countries. He said he would leave this topic, which he described as "very technical," for future Planning Minister Guillermo Chapman to study.
