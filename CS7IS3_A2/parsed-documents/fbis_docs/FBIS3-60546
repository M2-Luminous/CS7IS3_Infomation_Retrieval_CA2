The Serum Institute fears that we will have a new measles epidemic within the next few years. The fear is due to the fact that requests for the MFR [measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccination dropped 10 percent this year. (This vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and German measles, ed.) ``The public's support of MFR vaccinations is too low to enable us to stave off a measles epidemic in the long run,'' said Tove Ronne, chief physician at the State Serum Institute. ``At present measles is generally not seen in Denmark. But at some point the disease will be introduced into the country again. And as by now quite a few children are not vaccinated against measles there will be fertile ground for an epidemic. A measles epidemic can occur only if there are enough unvaccinated children in a society who can infect each other and thus keep the epidemic going. ``Today we have a large group of somewhat older children who have not been vaccinated. In the event of an epidemic these children run a bigger risk than they did before because the risk of complications increases with age,'' Ronne said.'' Vaccinations for children is a service that is offered to parents. There is no charge and they are not compulsory. ``The first MFR vaccination is given when a child is 15 months old. So theoretically babies below that age risk being infected with measles if they are in day care centers with somewhat older unvaccinated children,'' Ronne said. Inflammation of the brain is one of the serious complications of measles. In Africa the disease is responsible for 5 percent of deaths among children.
