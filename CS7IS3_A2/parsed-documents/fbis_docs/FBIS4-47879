Ferial Hafferjee reports: [Begin recording] [Hafferjee] One of the biggest nettles an ANC-led government will have to grasp, is land reform. Today the ANC held a first post-election policy conference where it recounted its land plans. Among these are ways to deal with land restitution for those who lost their land through apartheid policies, and with land redistribution necessary to correct the imbalance, which still has over 80 percent of the land in the hands of 13 percent of the population. Land restitution alone is likely to see a million claims come before a land claims court. Land redistribution is likely to be an even bigger undertaking. What will it all cost? Well, the ANC didn't have the figures with them today but they did say that there would be two budgets, one for land restitution, which will last for three years, and a separate budget for land reform and redistribution. Derek Hanekom is the ANC's coordinator of land and agricultural policy. Mr. Hanekom, the policies you've outlined today are not new, but does the ANC say them with a new confidence, with your hands on the reins of government and on the purse strings of government? [Hanekom] Well, of course we have a lot more confidence, not that we ever really doubted that we would win these elections, but it's a good feeling to know that the majority of people in South Africa have come out in overwhelming support for us on the basis of our policies, not on the basis of rhetoric, or symbols, or anything like that. We want to address them in such a way that they do not have a negative effect on the country's economy, that people...[pauses] that they don't lead to social instability or threaten people's property interests, etcetera. It is very important for us to show to our electorate that we are serious about our promises. [Hafferjee] Could you just tell me in a nutshell how you are going to deal with the two R's -- restitution and redistribution? [Hanekom] The two major aspects of a land reform program in South Africa, will, as you said, lie in a restitution program, that means returning the land to those people who were forcibly removed from their land, and other measures of redistribution. On the restitution side we have announced today that we intend setting up a land claims court and we also said today that it is a concept which enjoys very wide support, that dealing with this very sensitive issue through a court, is the only fair way of dealing with it. We believe that there should be accompanying land redistribution processes, which means that those people who are excluded from the court process must also be able to gain access to land. We are saying one of the measures which we could introduce is to ensure that they are able to get...gain access to finance for land purchase. People who are prepared to buy land, but do not have the means to do so, who cannot reasonably be expected to pay full market value of their land because it will take them some time before they can establish themselves properly on that land -- we believe that they should be the beneficiaries of a state assisted program. None of this, none of our land reform program is based on expropriation or based on confiscation. [end recording]
