FR941216-1-00066 FR941216-1-00011 The proposed regulations also modify §1.274&hyph;2(f)(2)(iii) of the regulations to include spousal travel described in section 274(m)(3) of the Code among the expenses deductible by the employer when treated as compensation pursuant to section 274(e)(2). To the extent that the employer treats all or parts of club dues as compensation to the employee, the employer is permitted a deduction under section 162(a) of the Code pursuant to section 274(e)(2). The Department of the Treasury and the IRS believe that items described in section 274(a)(3) and (m)(3) of the Code should be treated similarly. Therefore, the proposed regulations modify §1.274&hyph;2(f)(2)(iii) of the regulations to achieve this consistent treatment. Clerical changes have been made to §§1.274&hyph;2(c)(6) and 1.274&hyph;2(f)(2)(i) of the regulations to alert the reader to the fact that these provisions apply only to transactions before January 1, 1987. Both paragraphs pertain to a former version of section 274(e)(1) of the Code that was repealed by section 142(a)(2)(A) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Special Analyses It has been determined that these proposed regulations are not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. Comments and Public Hearing Before adopting these proposed regulations as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments that are submitted (preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) to the Internal Revenue Service. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying in their entirety. A public hearing has been scheduled for Friday, April 14, 1995, 10 a.m. in the IRS Auditorium, Seventh Floor, 7400 Corridor, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. Persons who wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments and an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic by March 24, 1995. A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person or team for making comments. An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing. Drafting Information The principal authors of these proposed regulations are David N. Pardys, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee Benefits and Exempt Organizations), and John T. Sapienza, Jr., Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax and Accounting), IRS. However, personnel from other offices of the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1 Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Proposed Amendments to the Regulations Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is amended as follows: PART 1_INCOME TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 continues to read in part as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 ␣*␣*␣* Par. 2. Section 1.62&hyph;2 is amended by adding a second sentence to paragraph (h)(1) as follows: §1.62&hyph;2 Reimbursements and other expense allowance arrangements. * * * * * (h) Withholding and payment of employment taxes_(1) When excluded from wages. ␣*␣*␣* If an arrangement provides advances, allowances, or reimbursements for meal and entertainment expenses and a portion of the payment is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan under paragraphs (d)(2) of this section due solely to section 274(n), then notwithstanding paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, these nondeductible amounts are not treated as wages and are not subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes. * * * * * Par. 3. Section 1.132&hyph;5 is amended by adding paragraphs (s) and (t) to read as follows: §1.132&hyph;5 Working condition fringes. * * * * * (s) Application of section 274(a)(3). (1) If an employer's deduction under section 162(a) for dues paid or incurred for membership in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose, is disallowed by section 274(a)(3), the amount, if any, of an employee's working condition fringe benefit relating to an employer-provided membership in the club is determined without regard to the application of section 274(a) to the employee. To be excludible as a working condition fringe benefit, however, the amount must otherwise qualify for deduction by the employee under section 162(a). If an employer characterizes as compensation under section 274(e)(2) the amount paid for or incurred for membership in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose, then the expense is deductible by the employer as compensation and no amount may be excluded from the employee's gross income as a working condition fringe benefit. (2) Examples. These examples illustrate this paragraph (s): Example 1. Assume that Company X provides Employee B with a country club membership valued at $20,000 which X does not treat as compensation under section 274(e)(2). B substantiates, within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section, that the club was used 40 percent for business purposes. The business use of the club (40 percent) will be considered a working condition fringe benefit, notwithstanding that the employer's deduction for the dues allocable to the business use is disallowed by section 274(a)(3). Therefore, B may exclude from gross income $8,000 (40 percent of the club dues, which reflects B 's business use). B must include $12,000 in gross income as a fringe benefit (60 percent of the value of the club dues, which reflects B 's personal use). X may deduct as compensation the value of the club dues which reflects B 's personal use provided the amount satisfied the other requirements for a salary or compensation deduction under section 162. Example 2 . Assume the same facts as Example 1 except that Company X treats the $20,000 which it pays for Employee B 's club dues as compensation under section 274(e)(2). B can substantiate, within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section, that the club was used 40 percent for business purposes. The business use of the club (40 percent), however, will not be considered a working condition fringe benefit because the section 274(a)(3) disallowance will apply to B . Therefore, B must include $20,000 (the entire of the club membership) in gross income.
