The aforementioned document apparently can be viewed as the manifestation of a rather traditional trend among the leadership of the republic of late to significantly correct, and even to reduce entirely to nothing, ideas that were popular a year or two back, which were implemented at a declaratory level and as a rule not developed either juridically or practically. One of these is the idea of creating free economic zones as one of the basic factors in the formation of an export orientation for the republic. The president's edict is commented on for PANORAMA by Rust Zholamanov, manager of the Strategic Economic Development Department of the Strategic Research Institute under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. "Our institute recommended that the government adopt this measure, based on a number of factors. We will start with the fact that free economic zones presuppose a special tax policy, customs system, and principles of investment. None of this, as we know, was worked out. Moreover, the free economic zones in Kazakhstan encompass territories that are too big, and when you consider that there were nine of them in the republic and that they were formed on the basis of oblasts, as a result, the question goes beyond a strictly economic scope, taking on a political nuance--the territorial integrity of Kazakhstan could be threatened. It will be recalled that in its time the breakup of the USSR began precisely with the idea of regional economic accountability, which was implemented with great success by the Baltic republics. It was so great that they were the first to leave the Union system as a result. "The free economic zones not only assume the existence of a definite technological infrastructure--international communications centers, hotel complexes, and transportation support--but they also must have commodity or technological potential for access to both foreign and domestic markets. "And, finally, there is no strategy as such in Kazakhstan for the development of free economic zones. "Our institute is now preparing a concept for a republic regional policy that develops a version of the mechanism for managing regions in general and an optimal formation of free economic zones in particular."
