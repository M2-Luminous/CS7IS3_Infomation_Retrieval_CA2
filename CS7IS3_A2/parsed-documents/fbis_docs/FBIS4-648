This afternoon Cuito, the capital of Bie Province, was the scene of heavy fighting between government and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] forces. At the moment no one has given an explanation for the flare-up, which has already caused at least 20 deaths. Our correspondent Paulo Juliao reports: [Juliao] Fighting between government and UNITA forces has been resumed and the city of Cuito is once again under heavy shelling. The clashes started at about 1600. The causes of this new flare-up between the Luanda and Savimbi forces are still unknown. A source here in Luanda has said that 20 people have been killed in Cuito in the past few hours. There are no figures for the number of wounded. The Cuito clashes are being interpreted here as a counter- offensive by UNITA forces following their loss of a substantial part of the city of Dalatando, capital of Cuanza Norte Province, occupied by the rebels for over two years now. It will be recalled that Cuito was recently visited by UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi. Some believe that he instructed his forces to resume the fighting, hence today's developments.
