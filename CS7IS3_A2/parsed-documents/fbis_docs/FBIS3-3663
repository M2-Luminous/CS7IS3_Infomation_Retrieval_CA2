Beijing has deployed extra police and state security agents to keep tabs on dissidents, a number of whom have been hauled in for day-long questioning during the past week. Sources in Beijing said that groups of well-known dissidents had sent "private letters" to National People's Congress (NPC) Chairman Qiao Shi demanding parliament put an end to "archaic and undemocratic" laws and malpractices. And yesterday, police in Tiananmen Square took away at least two people who tried to distribute leaflets that apparently called on the Communist Party and NPC members to speed up democratisation. Among the letters sent to Mr Qiao, one decried the series of statutes against "counter-revolutionary activities" used to incarcerate the bulk of the country's prisoners of conscience. The dissident groups also urged the Eighth NPC, whose second plenary session ends today, to repeal administrative regulations empowering the police to detain suspects for months for "shelter and investigation" and to lock people up in "re-education through labour camps" for up to three years. One petition said such practices violated the spirit of the law by allowing the police to deprive the human rights of citizens [as published] without going through the judicial process. Last Thursday, three dissidents, Zhou Duo, Liu Xiaobo, and Min Qi, were subjected to six hours of questioning in relation to a letter they had sent to the Public Security Ministry. The document, dubbed "Petition 306", criticised the authorities for detaining intellectuals before the arrival of American Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The trio were let off with a warning. Sources in the dissident community said "scores" of friends of dissident leader Wei Jingsheng were planning to hold a party next Tuesday to mark the 15th anniversary of his imprisonment. Police are understood to be determined to force the organisers to give up their plans before Mr Wei, who had been asked by police to leave town during Mr Christopher's visit, returns to the capital later this week. Witnesses at Tiananmen Square said at least two protesters were arrested when they tried to distribute pamphlets as a group of NPC delegates were walking out of the Great Hall of the People. One incident occurred on the north side of the square, near the gate where the late Chairman Mao proclaimed the founding of the communist state in 1949. Another took place at the Monument to the People's Heroes in the centre of the square. Police scrambled to gather up all the pieces of paper. There was no indication what the leaflets said. One witness saw police throw a person into a car and drive off immediately after the incident. Police took film away from Manuel Ceneta, a photographer for Agence France Presse. Later a government employee named Gao Hongmin visited the office of a Western television network to show them copies of a leaflet he said he wanted to distribute in Tiananmen Square yesterday afternoon. The leaflet called for a fully free market economy, gradual steps towards democracy and a reversal of the official verdict on the 1989 pro-democracy protests. Gao, 44, said he was working alone and had no connection with the morning leaflet attempts. He was grabbed by security agents on leaving the guarded compound and thrust into a car. Last night, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement that two Chinese women "were stopped by other citizens for disturbing public order this morning". The wording suggested the women were arrested. The Foreign Ministry statement said "it was improper for foreign journalists to cover news in China without going through necessary formalities". Meanwhile, 500 intellectuals yesterday reportedly petitioned Beijing to free more than 100 victims of Japanese war crimes who were detained last Friday while protesting outside the Japanese Embassy in Beijing on the eve of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit. While Beijing police yesterday reportedly released most of the detainees, who were elderly people from the provinces, they held on to Tong Zeng, a veteran organiser of the war-reparations movement. The petition, addressed to the NPC, called for the immediate release of Mr Tong and other detainees. It said police last Friday had taken tough action against protesters who had acted in a "peaceful and obedient manner"
