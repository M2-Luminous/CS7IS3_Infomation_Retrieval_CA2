FBIS4-33235 "drlat107_o_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-107 Daily Report 31 May 1994 Colombia Article Views Suspended U.S. Radar Operations Article Views Suspended U.S. Radar Operations PA0206185794 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 31 May 94 pp 1A, 11A PA0206185794 Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO Spanish BFN [Text] Since the Cartagena Agreement on the struggle against drug trafficking was signed on 15 February 1990, which includes the United States, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, never has such a tense situation been generated among the signatory nations as the one observed last weekend between the United States, Colombia, and Peru. One month ago, the Pentagon issued an order to suspend operations of the two radars that detect aircraft. These radars operate in Colombia as a result of that agreement. The same decision was made regarding the radars that operate in Peru. This decision -- labeled by high-ranking Colombian Government spokespersons as "not consulted, untimely, unilateral, and discourteous" -- has not been officially communicated to the authorities by the U.S. Government which has preferred to remain silent. The incident began on Sunday, 1 May. On that day, the Colombian Air Force officer in charge of radar operations in Aracuara and Leticia (Amazonas), officially communicated to the Defense Ministry that the passing on of information on flights from the radars was being suspended by the U.S. military without any explication. Since then and to the present, the two Colombian radars have not been operating. The order was issued by the Pentagon to the soldiers through the U.S. Southern Command in Panama. A high-ranking government official said: "The news was baffling although at the beginning it was said that the suspension was only for eight days." The following day, a Colombian Government official contacted the embassy, which had no official information. At that point, President Gaviria decided to request a formal explanation for what was happening. That was 28 days ago, and no reply has been received as yet. In Colombia, the matter was handled with confidentiality, until Sunday, when U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST reported that Colombia and Peru "would take reprisals" against the United States as a result of its decision to suspend operations of the four radars. Those "reprisals" would be the decision to ship out of the country two 30-year-old radars that were used in the Vietnam War and which have been of no use in the struggle against drug trafficking for the past month. A government spokesman said that of course the removal of the radars would also be accompanied by "a cordial invitation" to the U.S. soldiers and experts in charge of their maintenance to leave the country. No government official has confirmed or denied that decision. A government spokesman consulted by EL TIEMPO, however, said "it is obvious that if the radars are useless, there is no sense in keeping them or their technicians in Colombian territory." Meanwhile, the authorities know that drug traffickers' illegal flights have been on the rise in the past month due to the total absence of control in that Amazon area. This is where drugs from Bolivia and Peru enter Colombia. The official report on the illegal flights indicate that in 1993, in that area, 375 aircraft were detected and up until 1 May this year, 200 flights were reported. This past month an average of one illegal flight per day has been added. The government's final determination on the U.S. decision will only be adopted when the United States gives a formal explanation of what is occurring. In the meantime, it is only known that the suspension of radars operations was decided by the Pentagon, apparently without the blessing of the State Department or the Justice Department. What some government officials fear is that an explanation will never be received, therefore Colombia will have to make a decision. Those who are caught driving under the influence of drugs or other substances will be sentenced to pay the minimum of 20 equivalent salaries, and their driver licenses will be suspended for up to a year. They will even be arrested for 24 hours, and their vehicles will be impounded. Likewise, those who, through a medical examination, are found addicted to any psychotropic substance will not get their licenses renewed, and those who, after obtaining their licenses, become addicts or second time offenders in illegal possession of ammunition, arms, or explosives will get their licenses revoked. Heads of public offices are authorized to unilaterally breach work contracts when public employees go to their workplaces under the influence of any substance or when they consume or incite others to consume drugs in the workplace. Furthermore, all public employees of sound mind are forbidden from using and consuming drugs and psychotropic substances. They will be penalized as stipulated by Decree-Law 2400 of 1968 and by other regulations that supervise public posts. The consumption of psychotropic substances and drugs is also forbidden to those who, due to the nature of their jobs or professions, impose risks to others. The Decree includes in this category drivers of any type of vehicle, pilots, ship captains, aviation students, flight instructors, machinists and operators, doctors, dentists, and other health professionals who deal with or tend combustible or flammable materials and substances, including explosives, toxic, poisonous, corrosive, or radioactive substances, as well as those who bear or ship arms, air traffic controllers and operators, and all ground plane maintenance and support technicians. The violation of these regulations by these professionals will lead to the suspension, disqualification, or revocation of the license or permit to practice their professions. The family, community, society, and state will be responsible for promoting or implementing policies geared toward avoiding and undermining the causes and consequences of drug consumption. This is why the National Drug Council will have to evaluate the scope of the problem and coordinate with other governmental institutions projects of prevention and programs that will be implemented locally, regionally, and nationally. The country's radio and television stations will also have to air campaigns aimed at fighting drug trafficking and consumption as often and as long as the National Drug Council deems convenient. To that effect, the government ordered the council to issue, within 30 days, pertinent regulations and asked the Communications Ministry to continue to promote and develop communication strategies to overcome this problem; besides, the Health Ministry, secretariats, and departmental services will embark on rehabilitation campaigns and programs at the level of their treatment facilities. Finally, public and private employers must conduct permanent prevention campaigns to make preventive measures effective, and they must let authorities inspect and investigate as needed. Drug use and consumption were banned from public places, including theaters and stadiums, as well as ships, planes, government offices, restaurants, bars, night clubs, hotels, and parks. Managers and directors of public places will be able to expel drug consumers. Those public places that allow drug consumption will be temporarily closed for up to 30 days. Drugs whose effects enhance athletic performance, reduce anxiety, and artificially diminish exhaustion cannot be used in any sport activities. Doctors who prescribe these type of substances to athletes will no longer be able to practice in the country. Those who drive under the influence of drugs will be sentenced to pay up to 20 minimum monthly salaries, and their driver licenses will be suspended for up to a year. They will also be detained for 24 hours. No public or private employee will be able to go to his workplace under the influence of drugs or to consume them while working. Violating this regulation will cause employers to breach his contract. The decree also stipulates prison inmates are forbidden from possessing or consuming drugs and psychotropic substances, as stipulated by 1993 Law No. 65 of the Penitentiary Code. After medical, psychological, and psychiatric evaluations are made, prison medical services will include rehabilitation treatment for inmates who are consuming psychotropic substances to help them recover. This regulation does not exempt them, however, from being penalized, as stipulated by the law. Penitentiary and surveillance guard members who are caught consuming or possessing drugs or who bring drugs to prisons will be fired. Disciplinary measures will be taken as well. From now on, those who request gun licenses will be given a psychological and physical aptitude test. In case they are found to be drug or psychotropic substance addicts, their licenses will be revoked. Furthermore, those who bear arms, explosives, or ammunition under the influence of these substances will be sentenced to pay up to the minimum of one monthly salary, although this does not mean they are exempt from disciplinary measures. Second time offenders will have their gun licenses permanently revoked as stipulated by Decree 2535 of 1993. The Minors Protection Code stipulates minors, pregnant or nursing women, and those who are considered unstable according to the Civil Code are forbidden to consume drugs. The regulation indicates women in either one of these two conditions or minors who consume drugs will be sent to a family counselor who will be able to reprimand the dependent minors' parents, to grant custody to a close relative, to place them in a foster home or a special protection center, or even to begin procedures to adopt neglected minors. These measures are aimed at guaranteeing personal care and abating the perils that may threaten minors' health and morale.
