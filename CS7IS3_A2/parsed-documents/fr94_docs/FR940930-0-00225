FR940930-0-00225 FR940930-0-00029 The labor/management group supports this section as proposed. There were no other specific comments. Final Rule This section is adopted as proposed. Section 234.215‚ê£Standby Power System The proposed rule requires that if alternating current power is used as the primary source of power, a standby battery must be provided. The proposal also requires that an indicator or alarm be used to indicate when the alternating current power is off. The proposal also requires that the battery be designed and maintained to provide at least 48 hours of normal operations of the crossing warning device when primary battery-charging current is removed. In drafting the proposed rule, FRA was addressing the most common type of crossing installation in the nation_a battery-operated system in which the batteries are constantly being recharged by alternating current from a commercial or private source. In these systems, if the supply of alternating current is interrupted, the batteries continue to operate the system. If alternating current is restored before the batteries are discharged there is no interruption in operation. However if alternating current is not restored in time to recharge the batteries before they are fully discharged, warning system operations will be interrupted. FRA recognizes that systems other than the typical system addressed in the proposed section are in operation or may be in the development stage. We do not want these rules to hinder development of possible alternative equipment and systems. Various commenters, including the labor/management group, Consolidated Rail Corporation, LIRR, NJ Transit, and APTA, opposed all or part of the proposal. The Maine Department of Transportation and the New York State Department of Transportation supported the 48-hour battery capacity provision. Labor/management commented that it would be difficult and very expensive (approximately $180 million) to meet the proposed requirements for battery capacity. Commenters stated that the indicator light or alarm requirement would be difficult and expensive to implement and maintain because of the number of locations that would require installation (as many as 50,000) and the high probability of vandalism to such installations. After reviewing the comments, FRA has deleted the power-off indicator requirement. FRA recognizes that different crossings have different back-up power needs. A crossing tied into commercial power in a large metropolitan area does not necessarily need 48 hour back-up power. If power were to fail in that area, the failure would likely be for a relatively short period of time. This contrasts to crossings in rural areas where, if there is a power failure, discovery of the failure itself may take a relatively long time. FRA is therefore revising the rule in recognition of the variety of crossing situations. Availability of automatic notification of warning system problems is also a factor. For instance, by linking warning devices to a digital data network, information concerning primary power status and the unit's operational status can be almost instantaneously communicated to a railroad control center. FRA wishes to provide flexibility for railroads and their suppliers to develop and deploy cost effective technology that can provide advances in both safety and efficiency. Given those facts and the industry's testimony about the capabilities of the back-up power devices being employed, FRA has shifted to a straight-forward performance standard: FRA will require that a standby source of power be provided to ensure the highway-rail grade crossing warning system continues to function normally if there is an interruption in primary power. We will not require that a specific type of back-up power be available, nor will we establish a minimum period for standby capacity. Those decisions will be left up to the railroads or the authorities installing new systems. Also left to a railroad or the installing authority is installation of a conventional power-off indicator or indicators based on new or developing technologies. While installation of these devices is optional, railroads remain responsible for ensuring that warning systems remain operational.
