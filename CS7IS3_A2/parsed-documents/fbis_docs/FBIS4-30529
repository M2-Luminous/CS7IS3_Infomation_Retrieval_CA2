The news analyst says: The Japanese reactionaries dispatch more and more soldiers of the "Self-Defence Forces" [SDF] overseas for military exercises. They unhesitatingly utter such words as denying the criminal nature of the past war of aggression and inciting militarism. They undisguisedly work to fascistize the domestic system and legitimate overseas military action. Through the enactment of an "emergency law" and revision of the "law on the SDF" they try to legitimate the overseas dispatch and military action of the "SDF" and mobilize the manpower and material resources of Japan lock, stock and barrel for military reinvasion. Facts show the Japanese militarists, taking advantage of the failure of the policy of strength of superpowers, are going to revive the old empire and repeat the history of aggression. The reinvasion fervour of the revived militarist ghosts has reached the extremity. The Japanese reactionaries' talk about "threat" and "crisis in security" is an excuse for justifying their militarist acts for aggression. Under this pretext, they are inciting the consciousness of crisis and war at home and building public opinion to malrevise the "peaceful Constitution" and the "law on the SDF" and enact a wartime law. The danger of revived militarism of Japan today is incomparably greater than it was. Their acts for military reinvasion, however, lead to the same doom of Japanese imperialism that ran riot in aggression on Asia in the past. They must learn a lesson from the past defeat and act with discretion.
