Commenting on the USTR's report, Minister of Economic Affairs Chiang Ping-kun said on 1 April: As the ROC's trade surplus against the United States has been significantly reduced and tariffs on some industrial products have been cut to the level of advanced countries, our country should be able to avoid facing the U.S. Super 301 action. The minister added: The ROC's efforts at protecting intellectual property rights [IPR] should be affirmed. Last year the problem of imitation was not as serious as in previous years, and exports of replicas decreased considerably. Our country should be dropped or downgraded from the special 301 priority observation list. The USTR report's section dealing with the ROC consists of seven major categories, including import policy, testing standards, government procurement, IPR protection, service trades, and investment. According to the Board of Foreign Trade, so far as tariffs are concerned, the United States takes note of the ROC's progress in lowering import duties, but still maintains that those on farm products and automobile parts are overly high; in IPR protection, Washington views the situation in the ROC as having improved, but believes that serious problems remain in implementation. Moreover, Washington regards the ROC's fourth TV station's unauthorized relay of satellite programs as a very serious problem; and it deems the ROC's patent reviewing system as not yet totally open. The USTR's report shows deep concern over the ROC's financial service trade, investment barriers, monopolistic measures, and telecommunications service. Take, as examples, the U.S. Mutual Insurance Company's inability to set up a branch office in Taiwan, the ban on insurance companies setting up subsidiaries in Taiwan; the restrictions on investing in domestic insurance companies, and the ban on investing in housing and real estate. The minister said: Taiwan's trade barriers, such as high tariffs on certain products and restrictions on imports to certain areas, have been included in the agenda of negotiations with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]; and they will be resolved once the negotiations for GATT membership are completed. Therefore, Taiwan should be able to avoid facing Super 301 action.
