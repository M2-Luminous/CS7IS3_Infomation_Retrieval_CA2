About 11 people were travelling in a minibus and distributing pamphlets in the area, when they were stopped by a crowd of people. Two men escaped and alerted the authorities. A subsequent police search found seven hacked and burned bodies in the Thafamazi area of Ndwedwe. Their vehicle was also set ablaze. By late Tuesday, however, police detained six people under emergency regulations. Ndwedwe has been dogged by intense political fighting over the past ten years. [Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in English at 0500 GMT on 13 April say the seven people were killed "while handing out pamphlets of the Transitional Executive Council in Ndwedwe north of Durban." "According to eyewitnesses, the seven who were killed were kidnapped by a group of men at a school yesterday. They were interrogated by their kidnappers and dragged into a bush where they were shot and hacked to death. The police said the attackers had perhaps mistakenly connected the group to a political party. Four arrests have been made."]
