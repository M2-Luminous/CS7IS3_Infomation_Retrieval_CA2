Hoynck, Secretary General of the CSCE, by Igor Belov, in Vienna, date not given: "The CSCE: For Security from Vancouver to Vladivostok"] [Text] The range of tasks for the first secretary general in the history of the CSCE -- 60-year old German diplomat Wilhelm Hoynck was elected to the office around a year ago -- is quite wide. First and foremost he is expected to provide administrative assistance to the chairman of the CSCE Council, who is elected for one year from among the member countries' foreign ministers. He is empowered to coordinate the operations and actions of the peacekeeping missions carried out within the CSCE framework and represent the all-Europe structure in contacts with other international organizations. On the instructions of the CSCE Council chairman the secretary general can also put forward political initiatives. Our representative met with Wilhelm Hoynck at the CSCE Secretary General's residence in Vienna and asked him to answer a number of questions. The first question was this: What are the main tasks facing the CSCE this year? [Hoynck] In 1994 we have fundamentally the same aim as last year. I have in mind the attempt to make a CSCE contribution to the creation of a new degree of stability in the gigantic region from Vancouver to Vladivostok. This is a very ambitious program, and I think that the CSCE is best suited to show what it can do in the sphere of preventing conflicts and in the peaceful settlement of crises. But all this must be based on the CSCE's efforts to deepen the process of the observance of commitments with regard to the human dimension. Only then will those structures aimed at ensuring the full respect of human rights and basic freedoms and the implementation of the principles of democracy and the rule of law really take root. This is a great range of tasks in which the CSCE must achieve progress. [Belov] How do you assess the new NATO "Partnership for Peace" program? Will this program not reduce the CSCE's activeness in the efforts to establish a just and lasting peace in the general European region? [Hoynck] Assessing the "Partnership for Peace" program is, of course, not the prime task of the CSCE secretary general. However, I would like to draw attention to the fact that a CSCE foreign ministers' joint statement gave the program a fundamentally positive assessment. I would also like to refer to the statement issued by the NATO countries' heads of state and government at their meeting in Brussels at the start of January 1994. In that statement the CSCE is again assigned a very great role. I want to emphasize that the two documents that I cited coincide on the central question. I am talking about the principle of the indivisibility of security in Europe. I believe this to be of very great significance. It is also important that the common concept of security in Europe is built on a foundation of cooperation rather than through the buildup of countermeasure forces. On this main premise or, if you will, philosophical idea it seems to me that NATO and the CSCE adhere to the same opinion. In such a system all states will occupy the place that suits them and each state individually will be able to introduce its own legitimate security interests into the system. [Belov] What role might the CSCE play in the matter of stabilizing relations among countries within the CIS? How do you view the possible participation of Russia's Armed Forces in peacemaking missions on former Soviet Union territory? [Hoynck] These two questions are interconnected but have different aspects nevertheless. As for the process of developing the CIS, it seems to me that it will be stable and directed toward the future if all CIS members take greater account of the principles elaborated within the CSCE framework. There is a wide spectrum of opinions, beginning with the catalogue of principles contained in the CSCE's Helsinki Final Act. This includes the principles of national sovereignty, the inviolability of borders, freedom of the choice of allies or freedom not to take part in alliances. I believe that any association of states in the region between Vancouver and Vladivostok which is founded on voluntary participation and is democratically administered would serve to strengthen stability in this region. Permit me to emphasize once more: I am profoundly convinced that, the more widely the principles of the CSCE are applied within the CIS, the firmer and more stable the CIS itself will be. Now I should like to talk about the role of the Russian Armed forces in the peacemaking process. This is a very important and very complex question. It is complex for all the participants, primarily for those countries where conflicts are taking place which those countries themselves are incapable of ending independently. This is thus a question of countries which need outside help. Without doubt this is a complex question both for the Russian leadership, for states which are Russia's neighbors, and for all CSCE member countries. It is absolutely clear that within the CSCE framework some countries have considerably greater potential than others in this respect. It is also clear that in the course of conflicts these countries will be dealing with a request for help from neighbors near and far. There are absolutely obvious examples in this regard. I have in mind Georgia and Tajikistan. In both those countries a situation has been created which, according to the assessment of those countries themselves, could not be resolved without Russia's participation. The fact that Georgia and Tajikistan as well as the Russian leadership were committed to ensuring that the decision to provide assistance did not bear a purely bilateral character but was implemented within a multilateral framework emphasizes the CSCE's significance. Although from the viewpoint of international law help in this aspect could be purely bilateral in character. Of course, if such actions are carried out within the CSCE framework they must correspond to the CSCE's principles. It is also obvious that general powers, a kind of carte blanche, cannot be given in this matter but each specific opportunity must be examined in specific terms. I am deeply convinced that the real interests of each of the states needing help, the interests of Russia and all the other CSCE members are best served by the approach in which all such measures and events are implemented as part of a multilateral process. [Belov] How would you assess relations between the CIS and the CSCE? [Hoynck] Mr Ivan Korochen, executive secretary of the CIS, recently visited us at our invitation. I would regard that visit as one of mutual acquaintance. The meetings between the CIS executive secretary and delegations from CSCE countries showed that the latter have many questions about the status of the CIS and the possibilities of cooperation. The discussions showed that the CSCE national delegations understand very well that the CIS is a commonwealth of states in development, that the commonwealth itself emerged overnight, as it were, in an extremely difficult situation for all its members, and that the important thing now is that development should proceed in a direction corresponding to the principles of the CSCE. I believe that such contacts should be developed in the future in the interests of "transparency." Then the CIS countries and the CIS executive secretariat will have a complete understanding of what the CSCE is doing. And the CSCE delegations will deepen their knowledge of how matters are developing within the CIS.
