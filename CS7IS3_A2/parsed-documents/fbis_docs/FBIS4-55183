Tihomir Vinkovic reporting for the midnight bulletin of Croatian Radio from Vienna: There has still been no agreement on the cantonal maps in the Bosniak-Croat federation. It seems that stands have been harmonized on the hitherto controversial issue of central Bosnia. The area is planned to be one whole canton organized on the parity principle to reflect the 1991 population census. Western Herzegovina is envisaged as a Croat canton and the eastern part of Herzegovina will also be organized on the parity principle. The negotiations will resume at 1000 on 11 May.
