In a letter addressed to the Security Council, which was made public in New York yesterday, Cameroonian Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono said that on 18 February, the Nigerian Armed Forces launched brutal attacks against Cameroonian troops stationed at Bakassi Peninsula in violation of the territorial integrity of Cameroon. My government reiterates its determination to resolve this dispute through peaceful means in full compliance with the objectives and principles of the UN Charter, Oyono stated adding that Cameroon will continue to seek the appropriate international channels for resolving this issue. Meanwhile, French diplomacy has been activated. After Yaounde, a French diplomatic and military delegation went to Abuja, Nigeria, where it met with President Sani Abacha. Nothing filtered from that meeting but it is known that the Nigerian Government stated yesterday that this conflict could be resolved bilaterally. The same feelings are shared by the radical Cameroonian opposition. Social Democratic Front Chairman John Fru Ndi still believes in dialogue in order to prevent the worst. We have on the line, Mr. Fru Ndi whose statement is translated by Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou. [Begin Fru Ndi recording, in English with superimposed translation into French] I do not think that Cameroon's border problems with our neighbors Nigeria, Chad, or others should lead to a civil war. I think we should hold dialogue with those countries in the African way and we should try to resolve the problems of our border peoples, but if we have to resort to war it will only result in dividing our continent. I am convinced that the problem could be resolved at the OAU. In Cameroon, we have about 2 million Nigerians and in Nigeria we have some 800,000 Cameroonians studying or doing business. Having said this, I believe good neighborliness must be encouraged instead of seeking to provoke a civil war that will divide our people. [end recording]
