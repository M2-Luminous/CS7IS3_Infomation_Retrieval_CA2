This structure is made up of two compartments, one for liquid oxygen (LOx) and the other, for liquid hydrogen (LH2). Qualification was obtained by executing a burst type rupture test. Rated flight pressure for the tank are 4.8 bars for the LOx compartment and 2.4 bars for the LH2 compartment. For the test, internal loads were simulated by pressurized nitrogen and local external stress by hydraulic actuators. Testing was done in a pit 30 meters deep and 9 meters in diameter, at the Cryospace premises at Les Mureaux during the night of 16 to 17 February. Pressures reached during rupture complied perfectly with anticipations. Nearly 700 measuring probes were placed on the structure, which, during the test, swells by several centimeters in height and several tens of centimeters in breadth. The rupture test was done using a tank identical to the flight model, except for the hydrogen compartment, which was shortened. Results will enable specialist from Cryospace and Aerospatiale, industrial architect and stage builder of the Ariane 5 to validate structural skin covering dimensions to determine safety margins adapted to flight pressures and fine tune computational modules for future tanks.
