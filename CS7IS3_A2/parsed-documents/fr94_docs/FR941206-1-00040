FR941206-1-00040 FR941206-1-00007 40 CFR Part 63 [AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;5114&hyph;3] RIN 2860&hyph;AD57 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants; Proposed Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutant Emissions From Wood Furniture Manufacturing Operations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: The proposed standards would limit emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from existing and new wood furniture manufacturing operations located at major sources. The proposed standards implement section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act as amended, which require the Administrator to regulate emissions of HAP listed in section 112(b) of the Act. The intent of the standards is to protect the public by requiring new and existing major sources to control emissions to the level attainable by implementing the maximum achievable control technology (MACT), taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, any nonair quality and other air quality-related health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements. The EPA is also proposing Method 311 with the standards. Method 311 will be used to assist in demonstrating compliance with the proposed emission limitations. DATES: Comments. Comments must be received on or before February 21, 1995. Public Hearing. A public hearing will be held, if requested, to provide interested persons an opportunity for oral presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning the proposed standards for wood furniture manufacturing operations. If anyone contacts the EPA requesting to speak at a public hearing by January 4, 1995, a public hearing will be held on January 19, 1995, beginning at 9:30 a.m. Persons interested in attending the hearing should notify Ms. Kim Teal, (919) 541&hyph;5580, to verify that a hearing will occur.
