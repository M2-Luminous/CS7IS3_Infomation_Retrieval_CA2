FR940208-0-00115 FR940208-0-00031 Issue 35: Several people were concerned that designation of critical habitat would preclude the recreational use of lands that their families have used for generations, and they strongly opposed its designation. Service Response: Designation of critical habitat is not synonymous with setting aside wilderness, locking up the lands within, or prohibiting all uses. The Service anticipates that the land management agencies will designate roads and trails within critical habitat, and that they will close some roads that are secondary and not necessary for access to private lands or mines. Also, designation of critical habitat could increase certain types of recreational use. Many people enjoy areas that show fewer signs of human activity. Activities considered not likely to adversely affect critical habitat include hunting, picnicking, casual horseback riding (on designated roads and trails), camping, birdwatching, bike riding (on designated roads and trails), hiking, and motor vehicle use on designated roads. Issue 36: Some local agencies and utility companies were concerned that designation of critical habitat would affect their ability to access, use, and maintain existing facilities, rights-of-way, and fee property. Some stated that existing utility corridors should be excluded from critical habitat designation. Several agencies were concerned that critical habitat designation would either exclude or significantly increase the cost of future public works projects. Service Response: Designation of critical habitat should not interfere with on-going maintenance of existing roads and utilities. These structures do not normally contain primary constituent elements, and they would, therefore, not be affected by the designation. Routine maintenance operations on existing pipelines, buried fiber-optic lines, and electrical transmission line rights-of-way are generally covered under existing section 7 consultations and are not likely to constitute adverse modification of critical habitat. Any expansion, addition, or modification within the rights-of-way or fee property will be subject to section 7 consultation if authorized, funded, or carried out by a Federal agency. Through such consultation, the Service will determine if the proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the desert tortoise or destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. Issue 37: Several individuals requested that the final rule contain a discussion of how CHUs will be managed. Other members of the public were concerned that critical habitat designation forces creation of a management plan, establishes population goals, or prescribes specific management actions.
