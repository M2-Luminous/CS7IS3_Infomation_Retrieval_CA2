FR940504-0-00034 FR940504-0-00010 34. If a default or disqualification involves gross misconduct, misrepresentation, or bad faith by an applicant, the Commission also may declare the applicant and its principals ineligible to bid in future auctions, and may take any other action that it may deem necessary. Where specific instances of collusion in the competitive bidding process are alleged during the petition to deny process, the Commission may conduct an investigation or refer such complaints to the United States Department of Justice for investigation. 35. If the high bidder makes the down payment in a timely manner, a long-form application will be required to be filed by a specified date, generally within ten business days after the close of the auction. The Commission will then review the long-form application to determine if it is acceptable for filing. Upon acceptance for filing, the Commission will release a Pubic Notice announcing acceptance for filing of the long-form application thus triggering the filing window for petitions to deny. 36. The long-form application must include as an exhibit a detailed explanation of the terms and conditions and parties involved in any bidding consortia, joint venture, partnership or other agreement they have entered into relating to the competitive bidding process prior to the close of bidding. All such arrangements must have been entered into prior to the filing of the short-form application. If all petitions to deny are dismissed or denied, the Commission is satisfied that the applicant is qualified, the license(s) will be granted to the auction winner. 37. The Commission need not conduct a hearing before denial if it determines that an applicant is not qualified and no substantial issue of fact exists concerning that determination. In the event that the Commission identifies substantial and material issues of fact in need of resolution, Sections 309 (j)(5) and (i)(2) of the Communications Act permit in any hearing the submission of all or part of evidence in written form and allows employees other than administrative law judges to preside at the taking of written evidence. 38. As a general rule, when an auction winner defaults on its final payment or is otherwise disqualified after having made the required down payment, the best course of action is to re-auction the license. Nevertheless, if a default occurs within five business days after the end of bidding, the Commission retains the right to offer the license to the second highest bidder at its final bid level, or if that bidder declines the offer, to offer the license to other bidders at their final bid levels. If a new auction becomes necessary because of a disqualification or default more than five business days after the end of bidding, we will afford new parties an opportunity to file applications to assure that serious interested bidders are in the pool of qualified bidders at any re-auction. 39. Reservation Prices. We will retain the flexibility to utilize a reservation price below which a license would not be awarded if we decide that it is appropriate in a particular auction. The reservation price could be disclosed, in which case it would effectively constitute a minimum bid, or it could be undisclosed. Regulatory Safeguards 40. We will impose a transfer disclosure requirement on licenses obtained through the competitive bidding process, whether by a designated entity or not. We will give particular scrutiny to action winners who have not yet begun commercial service and who seek approval for a transfer of control or assignment of their licenses within three years after the initial license grant, in order to determine if any unforeseen problems relating to unjust enrichment have arisen outside the designated entity context. The applicant will be required to file, together with its application, the associated contracts for sale, option agreements and all other documents disclosing the total consideration received in return for the transfer of its license
