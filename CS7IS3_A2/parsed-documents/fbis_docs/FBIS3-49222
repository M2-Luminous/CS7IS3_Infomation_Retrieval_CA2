Mrs. Albright is the highest ranking U.S. official to visit Croatia so far. Madeleine Albright's visit to Zagreb is the beginning of her European tour that will take her to 13 countries, mostly those that embarked on the road to democracy as a result of the fall of communism in the East. [passage omitted] [Begin Albright recording] The conflict in this region has no justification. Aggression cannot be justified. War crimes cannot be justified. Blocking humanitarian aid convoys cannot be justified. It is time to stop the excuses and start making good on many of the unfulfilled promises. Second, the United States has supported and will continue to support the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia. At the same time, the United States will continue to insist on a peaceful, nonmilitary resolution of the problems of Croatia's occupied territories and full respect for the rights and dignity of all citizens of Croatia regardless of national identity. [end recording] [Announcer] In a brief meeting with the press, the U.S. envoy answered several questions. Among other things, she explained what will be done regarding the incessant Serb attacks on Sarajevo. The United States is aware of what is going on there and is monitoring the situation with concern. Should the Blue Helmets' role be altered from protecting the peace to imposing peace? The reply was that UN soldiers should continue performing their duties as they have been doing so far. [passage omitted] After the meeting with reporters, Madeleine Albright and the John Shattuck, assistant human rights adviser to the secretary of state, visited the U.S. military hospital at Pleso where 150 members of the U.S. Air Force are currently working. According to her schedule, the U.S. envoy will visit Vukovar tomorrow. [Begin Albright recording] It is very important for me as a representative of the United States and as a member of the Security Council to be able to see Vukovar and to be able to see the mass graves there. I think this is something that we are very concerned about and I hope very much that there will be clear access for us. [end recording] [Announcer] The U.S. envoy is scheduled to be received by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman tomorrow.
