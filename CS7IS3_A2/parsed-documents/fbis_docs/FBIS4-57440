[Granic] Croatia is no longer just a country at war. Only 25 percent of our territory is still occupied, to be more precise under the control of the United Nations. We signed cease-fire agreements with the local Serb authorities and we expect to hold the second round of negotiations regarding economic issues and the return of refugees, and then begin political negotiations. Croatia is a very stable and democratic country. It has the most stable economy in the entire region. Our inflation will not go over 12 percent. Croatia expects a reasonably good tourist season. We are also in a full process of privatization. [Seguel] I am even more confused over why you are in Chile. [Granic] Because Chile was one of the first countries to recognize Croatia. Also because our economic relations are very good. The most important reason is to explain the current situation of my country which could be and wants to be the door to Eastern Europe and an opportunity for investments. Some Chilean-Croats have already bought companies in Croatia, like Mr. Luksic who bought the second largest brewery in our country. [Seguel] While there is a conflict, it is cheap to buy. Are you saying the war will end soon? [Granic] That is not easy to say. The most important thing will be future negotiations regarding a final agreement, and all the economic issues that will certainly be discussed with the local Serb authorities. [Seguel] How difficult was it for you to negotiate with the Serbs taking into account their terrible image as aggressors, according to the international media? [Granic] It has been very difficult right from the start but still the negotiation continues to be the cheapest way for the peaceful reintegration of the zones under UN control in Croatia's legal system. [Seguel] What was your most difficult moment during the negotiations? [Granic] There were two difficult moments. The negotiations with the local Serb authorities and the negotiations with the Armed Forces of the former Yugoslavia for exchanging prisoners. [Seguel] Why do you believe the Serbs continue the policy of occupying the territory? Will it be costly to them in terms of image in the future? [Granic] It is an unreasonable policy in the long-term and in the short-term it is also costly because its economy is in ruins. Serbia is absolutely isolated and it believes the more territory it has at the time of the negotiations the stronger its position will be. [Seguel] What is your basic rule for negotiations? [Granic] The main thing is that the zones under UN control return to Croatia. We are ready to discuss the rights of the minorities, the ethnic communities, and local autonomy. We are willing to accept international supervision. Croatia will accept negotiations with Serb-Croatian authorities regarding future local autonomy as well as guarantees for minorities, but we are not willing to negotiate our borders. [Seguel] There seems to be more people who want the war to continue than those who advocate peace. [Granic] The future negotiations will include talks on the demarcation between the Bosnian Federation (Muslims and Croats together) and the Serbs, and the type of association between the Serbs and the federation because we will ask the Serbs to join the federation. I believe the Serbs will refuse. I believe the problem of demarcation relates to the percentage of the territory we talked about. The Serbs now have control over 70 percent of it and we have proposed 51 percent for the federation and 49 percent for the Serbs. [Seguel] And what did they answer? [Granic] They proposed no more than 47 percent for the federation and the Muslims proposed 60 percent. Another important problem here will be the corridor the Serbs will probably attack soon. It is also very important to prevent that Serbian offensive. [Seguel] So you already know how the war will continue.... [Granic] It is simple. But let us go on, the Serbs have placed some conditions on signing a total cease fire and the start of negotiations, such as lifting economic sanctions. This is why it is necessary more than ever to keep the pressure on the Serbs very firm. [Seguel] Why does it seem that when the aggressor is so clearly identified, the international community cannot act or does not want to act with more force? [Granic] This is the question the people on the streets in Croatia ask. There are two basic reasons. On one side there were the different interests of the great powers and on the other side there is the brutal Serbian aggressiveness. Probably, there has never been anything similar in the history of Europe. The decisions by both the European and international community came late and they did not serve or they were not implemented with enough decision. The Serbian aggression should have been stopped and prevented in Vukovar, when a Croatian city that was under siege for two full months was continuously bombed. At that time, 2,000 people were killed. And in the harshest 72 hours, 2,500 people were killed. Had the international community acted then, it is possible that the conflict would have developed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Seguel] Did you expect or were you surprised by the attack on Gorazde? [Granic] I was only surprised at its brutality. This was unreasonable for the Serbs to do because, looking at it from a reasonable manner, the only path the Serbs have ahead is the path of negotiations and to seek a peaceful end to the war in Bosnia. [Seguel] If you were not surprised by the attack on Gorazde and if you could predict what the Serbs will do, what other surprises can the international community expect? [Granic] The plans of the Serbs are quite clear. Their strategic interests are, first, to widen the corridor in the Brcko zone. Other interests include the Muslim settlements in the eastern part of Bosnia and in Bihac. All this depends exclusively on the international community. In other words, if the international community shows enough firmness in its decision to get the Serbs to negotiate and also to get the Muslims, who are the most threatened, to join in. Regarding the Republic of Croatia, we will support the agreements signed in Washington and this means the installation of the Federation of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We will support solutions leading to cease-fire in the region. We will support the pressures exerted on the Serbs to make them join the negotiations. [Seguel] Do you like to negotiate, or are you tired of it? [Granic] Yes, I like it. In addition to the negotiations that I have already mentioned, in which I was the chief Croatian negotiator, I also headed the group that negotiated with the Muslims. The are still plenty of negotiations to carry out and it is tiring work. I believe the Washington agreements were the best success so far. I would be the happiest person in the world if I could finish everything this year because I would prevent a lot of human suffering. So many atrocities have been committed and there have been so many victims that I believe we should all do everything possible to end it. [Seguel] Has this war helped you to understand matters that made no sense during Tito's Yugoslavia? [Granic] During the Tito years, especially in 1974 when the current Constitution was proclaimed, he was strongly sensitive to the topic of nationalism in Yugoslavia. He kept Serb nationalism under control, and he also controlled the economy. All types of contradictions emerged after Tito, like the aggressive Serb nationalism that sought a great Serbia, and of course the resistance of the others. The presidents of Slovenia and Croatia proposed a confederation before the war. This was rejected by the Serbs. Now there is absolutely no chance of any type of union between the Serbs and Croats. We can only be neighbors. [Seguel] What will you do after the war? Will you return to being a doctor or continue as a negotiator? [Granic] I have become so deeply enmeshed in political life that it will be very difficult for me to return to the medical profession. The end of the war is currently my motivation, as are the development of democratic institutions, European relations and integration, and participation in the creation of a modern democratic state. [Seguel] Are all parties in Croatia in agreement regarding the progress of negotiations? [Granic] All parties agree regarding the negotiations with the Muslims. As for the Serbs, the opposition parties do not agree because they are against any type of negotiation unless Serbia publicly recognizes the Republic of Croatia. We also want Serbia to do this, but it is our belief that it must be a mutual recognition, and this can be achieved step by step. There is also the matter of economic cooperation, but for this to occur there must be a restoration of communications by road, rail, and the restoration of the oil pipeline system. The return of refugees, or displaced persons, and that of "the external states" are also important. Talking about the opposition, they are convinced that they could carry out privatizations much better than the party that is in power. But this is a part of democracy, and we are aware of some errors we have made, but we believe Croatia is a stable country. [Seguel] Could you put on a doctor's smock and diagnose the sick patient in front of you (Yugoslavia)? [Granic] Without resolving the complex situation in which Yugoslavia finds itself there can be no peace solution for Croatia. A peaceful solution cannot be achieved without strong and firm assistance from the international community. Then there is the question of how, at the same time, to resolve the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the zones in Croatia that are protected by the United Nations. These are two fundamental problems. Of course, the international community still has the problem of resolving stability in Macedonia, it still has to ensure the autonomy of Kosovo, human rights problems, ethnic problems, and the rights of the national minorities that live in Serbia, especially those of the Croats. It must also solve the question of the system of regional security. In sum, a sick patient that needs a multipurpose team to help it recover, including a long convalescence.
