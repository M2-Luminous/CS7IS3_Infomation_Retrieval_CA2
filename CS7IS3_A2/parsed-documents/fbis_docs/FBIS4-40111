"As president, I have done my utmost to promote Ukraine's further integration with European structures and to strengthen economic and political relations with CIS countries, above all Russia," he stressed. The Ukrainian head of state believes that "the signing of the tripartite agreement, which gave the Ukraine clearcut guarantees for its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and financial, economic and technical assistance, has made a great contribution to improving the international situation." The president reminded his listeners that Ukraine was one of the first to sign the Partnership for Peace, and it has become a participant in the NATO program. But according to Leonid Kravchuk, "cooperation with the CIS countries remains a priority for us, and it was in this context that Ukraine signed all the important economic agreements." The president singled out Russia as "a traditional partner with whom we have signed over 75 documents of various kinds on the development of economic and political ties". It was reported by Leonid Kravchuk that a broad-scale agreement on cooperation, friendship, and partnership with Russia is currently being drawn up which, in his opinion, "will bring Ukrainian-Russian relations onto a qualitatively new level and will register fundamental clauses determined by our way of life, history, and the futures of the two countries." The president is reckoning on signing this document immediately after the problem of the Black Sea Fleet has been solved. Touching on the issue of ways for Ukraine to extricate itself from the crisis, Leonid Kravchuk said that "first of all, a block of financial problems must be resolved: mutual computations, credits, the banking system." He reported to listeners that this program already exists and it has been agreed upon at all levels. The president thereby name the priorities for getting out of the crisis -- foodstuffs and energy resources. "The successful solution of these issues will give an impetus to the development of other sectors," Leonid Kravchuk stressed. In his view, it is also necessary to set up a normal investment climate in the country. "The laws on investments should be stable." In his speech the president paid considerable attention to the issue of building a sovereign state. He thinks that "at the present time, it is necessary to stop any discussion on where we are going and what kind of society we are building." The forthcoming elections themselves will testify to the fact that the people are voting for a presidential-parliamentary republic. "Therefore," Leonid Kravchuk noted, "a new constitution must be adopted immediately after the elections, the relative power structures and a strong government must be set up and the necessary powers must be given to the president, and additional elections to the Supreme Soviet need to be held."
