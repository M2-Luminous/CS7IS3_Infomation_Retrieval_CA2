The various kinds of ground test facilities and devices that have gone into operation make it possible to carry out any conventional or routine test on satellites and rockets on the ground. Wind tunnels provide test results at different stages of rocket launching while large-sized heat-testing devices ranging from one m to seven m in diameter allow simulations for satellite flights in outer space and in different temperatures. China has also built a gigantic rocket testing launch pad which is 59 m high, 41 m long and about 22 m in width, providing a large amount of test data for rocket engine system designs. In addition, it has also built a huge centrifugal machine and vibration test tower, both controlled by modern computers.
