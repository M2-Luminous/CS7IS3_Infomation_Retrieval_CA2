The documents -- transcripts from the secret trial of a South African Air Force officer and from the government's classified submissions to the International Atomic Energy Authority [as published] (IAEA) -- show that much vital information has been kept from the public. They also show that President Frederik de Klerk's statement to parliament on 23 March 1993 that the government had built then destroyed just six crude nuclear devices fell far short of the whole truth. The sophistication of the securocrats' nuclear ambitions in the 1970s and 1980s was grotesquely at odds with the disarray and venality among the government officials involved in the project, as evidence given in the secret trial of Air Force Brigadier Johann Blaauw in 1987-88 at the Supreme Court in Capetown makes clear. Classified documents from the trial obtained by AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL trace how Brig. Blaauw, who negotiated a deal with Israel for the supply of tritium (a key ingredient required to make thermonuclear weapons) fell out with former Minister of Labour and Mines Fanie Botha. Blaauw claimed that Botha had promised him diamond concessions in Namaqualand, on South Africa's western seaboard, in return for his work on the nuclear programme but then failed to deliver. Botha denied this but said that Blaauw had threatened to make public details about the nuclear programme and the alleged improprieties linked to it. By the time of their falling out, Botha had incurred substantial debts and had his assets sequestrated following his resignation from ministerial office and parliament on 15 November 1983 after some highly critical press reports. In November l984, the police in Pretoria arrested Blaauw on charges of attempted extortion against Fanie Botha and possession of secret data concerning the Koeberg nuclear power reactor. However, Blaauw was acquitted in September 1988 and he is still pursuing his claim for the allegedly promised mining concessions through the civil courts. Blaauw had an exemplary Air Force career which began in World War II and included service with Western forces in Palestine, the Korean War and the Berlin airlift. Following his retirement from the Air Force in l975, Blaauw was the messenger in some of Pretoria's most sensitive military transactions with Israel. It is difficult to see how De Klerk, who took over the mining portfolio from Botha, would not have been briefed about the tensions between Botha and Blaauw and the nature of Blaauw's work on the nuclear programme with Israel. In fact, De Klerk testified at Blaauw's trial, saying that Fanie Botha, a political rival, approached him after a cabinet meeting and told him he had been in the process of awarding a mining concession to Blaauw and asking if a way could be found to grant it. There is absolutely no evidence linking De Klerk to the illicit transactions surrounding the nuclear programme and sources close to the highest levels of government have told AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL that De Klerk got in and out of the ministry as quickly as possible. By the end of the 1980s, De Klerk was said to be unable "to come to terms philosophically" with the securocrats' plans to develop thermonuclear weapons whose primary target would be African civilians. However, De Klerk's apparent "road to Damascus" on the nuclear weapons programme still has not facilitated a full admission of the extent of the government's nuclear programme. This lack of frankness about the nuclear programme concerns senior officials in Western governments particularly at a time when South Africa is negotiating a delicate transition where the loyalties of some senior officials in the security forces appear uncertain. Blaauw's errand to secure tritium from Israel is significant: Tritium is a gas used to boost the power of nuclear weapons creating fusion or thermonuclear bombs. In information submitted to the IAEA, which monitors compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) for the United Nations, the government admitted that its weapons programme had involved lithium-6 separation, a means of producing tritium. So sensitive is this information that senior African National Congress (ANC) officials, some of whom will be holding ministerial office after the April elections, have been refused access to it. According to a September 1993 IAEA document obtained by AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, the programme had also progressed by the early 1980s to planning a 150 megawatt reactor capable of producing tritium and plutonium. The reactor, which was to have been built at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay, never got beyond the basic engineering preparations. But Pretoria continued to work on developing thermonuclear weapons until 1985 or l986, according to Wynand de Villiers of Pretoria's Atomic Energy Corporation and Roger Jardine, the ANC's science policy coordinator. Pretoria began dismantling its nuclear weapons programme in 1990, in preparation for signing the NPT the following year. In his 24 March 1993 speech De Klerk also insisted that "at no time did South Africa acquire nuclear technology from another country." Apart from United States intelligence reports attesting to Israeli-South African nuclear collaboration, additional information would have been available to De Klerk, during his tenure at the Mines Ministry, to indicate that tritium production is the result of a highly sophisticated technology, one which South Africa had not mastered. At his trial, Blaauw testified that he negotiated for the supply of 30 grammes of tritium from Israel in exchange for 600 tonnes of "yellowcake" (uranium oxide). The tritium-yellowcake exchange deal is described in some detail in a recent book by William E. Burrows and Robert Windrem. ("Critical Mass" by William Burrows and Robert Windrem (Simon and Schuster) 1994) They write that the sensitive arrangements were jointly overseen by South Africa's then intelligence agency, the Bureau of State Security (BOSS) and the Israeli intelligence division Lish Ka le-Kishrei [as published] (Lakam) which specialised in nuclear and technological procurement and came to public attention when it was linked to the Jonathan Jay Pollard spy scandal in the USA in 1985. Blaauw testified at the trial that he had established South Africa's Israeli connection through a South African who had emigrated to Israel. In this way Blaauw was able to make high-level military contacts in Israel. Initially the two men arranged the emergency supply of South African spare parts for Mirage aircraft, needed by Israel after the 1973 war. Then Blaauw arranged a deal with an Israeli front company in Wiesbaden, Germany, through which he obtained British tanks and Browning machine guns for South Africa, according to the trial documents. Finally, Blaauw said he was approached by one "Binyamin" of Lakam (almost certainly Binyamin Blumberg, chief of Lakam between 1957 and 1981), who asked if South Africa would sell Israel yellowcake which can be enriched to make fuel for nuclear weapons or power reactors. Through his service in South African military liaison during the Rhodesian war, in which he took part in many joint covert activities with Salisbury and helped set up a meeting between white leader Ian Smith, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and South African Prime Minister John Vorster, Blaauw became a confidant of General Hendrik van den Bergh, then head of the security police -- and subsequently the head of BOSS. He told the court that he then approached Van den Bergh with Lakam's request and Van den Bergh got the go-ahead for the deal from John Vorster. In April 1976 Vorster visited Israel and signed a comprehensive set of military and economic cooperation pacts. According to Burrows' and Windrem's book, Israeli and South African officials, including director of Lakam Binyamin Blumberg and then Information Ministry Secretary Eschel Rhoodie travelled as escorts on the twelve flights which brought the tritium -- 2.5 grams at a time -- to South Africa. Small as the quantity was, it would have been enough to make one bomb every six weeks. Piet Koornhof, Minister for Mines at the time the yellowcake deal was struck, was replaced by Fanie Botha in a Vorster reshuffle. Fanie Botha's interest in the Defence portfolio was known by Vorster: Blaauw testified that arrangements were made for Botha to tour secret Israeli military installations in preparation for his elevation to the defence portfolio. Blaauw said he handled the details of Botha's itinerary and accompanied him to Israel. Botha was a hit with the Israelis. "Look after Fanie Botha," Blaauw's contact in Israel told him. He explained to the court that Israel wanted to keep Botha at the Mines Ministry until the yellowcake shipments were complete. After that, they were eager for him to become Defence Minister, hoping that he would be more cooperative than Pieter W. Botha, who held the post at the time. Blaauw testified that he began diverting funds to Fanie Botha from a US$1 million "gift" he had received from Israel. The objective was not to sweeten Botha, Blaauw explained, but to keep his political career from being destroyed by mounting personal debt. Botha's trusted administrative secretary Frances Peter van Ravensway Whelpton, however, was an outright crook. He pocketed all but Rand [R] 110,000 ($34,000) of the R. 420,000 that Blaauw provided for Botha between 1977 and 1980. The funds were channelled through Whelpton so that Botha would not know the source and to distance him from the source, which was kickbacks from Pretoria's arms deals with Israel, according to Blaauw. Additionally, Blaauw admitted making small payments to Whelpton, who apparently conceived and facilitated the grant of mining concessions on state-owned land (Sea Areas 1 and 2 on the West Coast) to Blaauw's company Ondombo Beleggings which precipitated the fall out with Botha. Whelpton pleaded guilty to extortion and illicitly possessing state secrets and was sentenced to five years in prison. It was several months before Blaauw realised that Botha was slow to hand over the mining leases because those areas had already been promised to others. As an interesting sidenote, two senior officials from Anglo- American submitted testimony to the trial. According to the presiding judge's interpretation of the testimony of Harry Oppenheimer (Chairman of Anglo-American from 1957 to March 1983) was that Oppenheimer undertook to do what he could to assist Fanie Botha and in fact had an interview with Tertius Myburgh, the editor of the SUNDAY TIMES, as a result of which no information about Fanie Botha's financial position was published in that newspaper [sentence as published]. However, the judge's interpretation is at variance with Oppenheimer's recollection of his testimony. Oppenheimer told AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL on 2 February 1994 that although he had no control over what was published in the English press in South Africa he had "said he would pass on to Myburgh what Botha had told him. He subsequently told Myburgh the substance of his conversation with Botha, but he did not ask Myburgh whether he intended to publish any story relating to the Minister's affairs. Myburgh did say he was aware of rumours surrounding Minister Botha's affairs, and that these were being investigated by his reporters. Oppenheimer did not ask, nor did Myburgh undertake, not to publish any information regarding Botha's financial position." According to Oppenheimer. nothing was published about Botha at that time for fear of libel. The current Chairman of Anglo American, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, has given his version of the events surrounding the applications for the mining rights on Namaqualand sea areas l-5. Blaauw testified that he had disputed with Ogilvie Thompson about which concessions Anglo American should pursue. Ogilvie Thompson has told Africa Confidential that he first met Blaauw in June 1979 in Anglo American's offices where Blaauw "advised De Beers (Anglo American's sister company) of a change in the Namaqualand sea areas from discouraging to encouraging applications for rights to prospect for diamonds." De Beers subsequently applied for mining rights in sea areas 1-5 but the forms were mislaid. Ogilvie Thompson says that the last time he met Blaauw, who he says was trying to negotiate the concessions for himself, was in March 1980 at a rendezvous on the N1 highway, when he gave Blaauw a duplicate set of the mining rights applications which were to be delivered personally to the Minister. Ogilvie Thompson added: "No payment was asked for or made by De Beers to any person in connection with these applications." The Namaqualand sea areas 1-2 were awarded to State Alluvial Diggings and UK-based Selection Trust Company respectively, and sea area 3 to US-based Sedco. Areas 4 and 5 went to De Beers: Setrust, Sedco and De Beers have subsequently joined together in a joint venture. In 1981, after attempting to secure the promised leases by legal action, Blaauw joined by Whelpton began to pressure Botha, who in turn began lobbying the Van Winsen Committee which had begun reviewing the leases. According to the court documents, Blaauw and Whelpton also began threatening to expose how, during the power struggle sparked by John Vorster's fall in the 1978 information scandal, Fanie Botha, a weak contender for the succession, agreed that Blaauw should eavesdrop on the phones and conversations of some his rivals including Foreign Minister Pik Botha, De Klerk, I.S.J. Schoeman, A.J. Raubenheimer, and A. P. Treurnicht. Blaauw and Whelpton also planned to allege publicly that Fanie Botha plotted with them to implicate two National Party MPs in illegal diamond transactions, according to testimony in the case. Another alleged plan, to circulate stories in Parliament about a sex scandal involving Pik Botha, also made its way into the court record. More seriously and perhaps a harbinger of the corruption exposed in the 1990s, the court entered as evidence a document, which according to Blaauw testimony, contained a list of Swiss bank accounts opened by senior officials in the government. The document passed through the hands of Whelpton and Blaauw, although it is not clear for what purpose. When Blaauw threatened to release this information, Botha called in the police, who began taping telephone calls and meetings. Botha, who never flatly confirmed or denied that he had granted the concessions, later admitted to Judge G. Friedman that he had erased parts of the tape of his meetings with Blaauw. Friedman cleared Blaauw of extortion and appeared convinced that Fanie Botha had promised him the concessions in July 1979. It was proper for Blaauw to have the classified document concerning Koeberg's fuel requirements, ruled Friedman, because he was working closely with Wynand de Villiers, director of the Atomic Energy Corporation, to obtain enriched uranium for the reactor.
