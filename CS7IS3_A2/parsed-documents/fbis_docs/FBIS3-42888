"We decided to deal with the Communists with our own forces, and to switch to white terror." Valeriya Novodvorskaya, leader of the DS [Democratic Union], agreed to comment for MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS on the results of the party gathering of radicals. "To personally see to it that the newspaper ZAVTRA does not come out, that they do not conduct their rallies, and that communist and fascist symbols do not appear on the streets. To establish in Moscow detachments of White Guards, which already exist in the country--Kornilov detachments with very nice skulls on their sleeves. The Constitution and the president have no support other than self-defense and even attacks of the anti-Communists. Because it is stupid to defend ourselves from them with words." Well, then, does Valeriya intend to physically destroy the Reds? "Well, to start with, physically as well," says Miss Novodvorskaya. "We simply want them just to sit at home and be afraid to come out on the street." There are about 50 people now in the Moscow Democratic Union, but what kind! All those who had a "propensity for socialism or cowardice" were discharged from the Democratic Union back in March, according to Novodvorskaya. And now the Democratic Union "represents a potential combat organization, only not a social revolutionary one, but one that is completely White Guard."
