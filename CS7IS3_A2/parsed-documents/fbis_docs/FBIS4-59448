These conspiracies are led by the forces of apostasy and secession from among the leaders of the Socialist Party against unity and constitutional legitimacy and against the people and their will, as expressed on 27 April 1993. Defending this land is defending the honor and dignity of this homeland, its independence, sovereignty, and national, democratic regime. This is being done today by our Armed Forces, the forces that protect constitutional legitimacy and democracy, on all battlefields. This is also being done by the masses confronting the forces of apostasy, treason, and secession led by the leaders of the Socialist Party, who have for nine months -- since 19 August -- been maneuvering under various contradictory and misleading pretexts in the hope of buying more time to prepare for achieving their objective of secession, planned by the gang of apostasy and treason, led by the butcher 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Al-Bid has savored maneuvering. He also wants to satisfy his lust to serve the objectives of his masters, who plot against and betray the homeland to slaughter its unity. The best evidence of this is the firing of destructive Scud missiles against defenseless citizens in the cities of Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Rahidah, and other cities by the gang of criminality, apostasy, and secession. This claimed the lives of many victims, including women, children, and elderly people, and terrorized defenseless citizens in their homes and cities. The criminal, cowardly actions of the forces of apostasy and secession represent terrorist, savage, and brazen actions and reflect a vindictive Nazi [as heard] sentiment and destructive, adventurist mentality that has ignited the fire of sedition all over the homeland. Thus, they started firing missiles indiscriminately at cities and secure residential quarters in Sanaa, Ta'izz, and other Yemeni cities. The General Committee of the General People's Congress [GPC] shares with the masses of our people their pain over these inhuman, immoral crimes. The General Committee strongly denounces these criminal, savage acts that are carried out by the gang of apostasy, secession, and treason in the Socialist Party leadership. It appeals to public opinion, political forces, parties, and organizations and national unions, societies, and figures to adopt a clear, frank, and responsible position by denouncing these reckless, criminal acts carried out by the gang of destruction, death, treason, rebellion, and terrorism in the Socialist Party leadership. The General Committee of the GPC urges the sons of our people to stand firmly by the side of the Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy that are storming the dens of treason and apostasy and secession. It calls on the masses of our Yemeni people to demonstrate even greater unionist cohesion to face this secessionist gang and oppose its criminal actions and misleading propaganda. The General Committee of the GPC also urges the members of the Armed Forces, including officers and troops who were misled by the leadership of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party leadership, to side with legitimacy, defend unity and democracy, and respect the national principles of society. The General Committee also appeals to all unionist forces in political parties, organizations, unions and associations, particularly the unionist elements within the Yemeni Socialist Party, to spell out their position toward this gang and the destructive results of its actions on the homeland, society, and national unity. The homeland is paramount to everyone and is the property of all; the responsibility of protecting it from destruction and sabotage, along with its achievements and projects over three decades, is the responsibility of all citizens, regardless of their political persuasion. The reckless, criminal acts carried out by the spiteful, secessionist gang, as well as its hysterical, stupid, irresponsible acts, will only increase our people's determination to go ahead and make more achievements for unity and constitutional legitimacy and to provide security and stability all over the homeland. The General Committee reasserts what was said by the brother chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the GPC, in his speech yesterday: We are not against the Socialist Party but against the separatist, apostate elements within the Socialist Party leadership that are waging a losing war and shedding innocent blood. The unionists in the Socialist Party should spell out their position clearly toward this criminal gang and should rally around unity and constitutional legitimacy and reject the decisions of the secessionist gang that declared war. They should spell out their position for the sake of bridling war and ending more bloodshed. The General Committee of the GPC also stresses what was said by the brother chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the GPC: We reject war in all its aspects and forms and do not want to have a victor or vanquished. The war was imposed on us. We are fighting so that the will of the people for security, stability, and social peace will triumph and bring constitutional legitimacy. The General Committee of the GPC holds the criminal al-Bid and his treasonous gang that conspired against the homeland, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy fully responsible and asserts that the shelling of residential quarters in Sanaa, Ta'izz, al-Rahidah, and other cities will not go unpunished. Our people will take to task all those adventurers and traitors who have departed from the ranks of the people, its unionist will, and democracy. And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affair will take. [Koranic verse] Issued by the General Committee of the GPC
