In a rounded and well-composed report Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the lower chamber, voiced a largely positive opinion of the message and called for constructive work based on the president's proposals. He said that a number of points in the message "can and should be disputed," but there were obvious points with which he could not fail to agree. These included the reform of the Army or, to be more accurate, the deepening and completion of that reform. The report was also couched in such a way as to not cause tremendous dispute either in the center or on the flanks. Misunderstanding arose only over why the president needed another memorandum of accord in society when the Duma has already adopted such a memorandum. Ivan Rybkin explained that in this case an extra initiative was not an obstacle but an "added bonus." But it was visible from the reaction in the hall that the question of whose memorandum is "more valid" is nonetheless exercising some people in the Duma. Paradoxically enough Russia may yet see a war of "peace initiatives." Evidently foreseeing that danger, Ivan Rybkin came up with a global idea for reconciliation. He proposed convening an All-Russia congress of all political forces. The tone of conciliation and cooperation which Rybkin tried to set in his report seems to have gone unnoticed by many people. The debate on the president's message is scheduled to fill a whole working day for the Duma.
