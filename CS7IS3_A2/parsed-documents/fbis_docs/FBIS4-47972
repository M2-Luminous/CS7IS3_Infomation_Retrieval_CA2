Energy correspondent Antonia Amosu, who monitored the situation in Lagos today, reports that fuel is now available at virtually all filling stations. She, however, observes that in spite of this, the long queues at filling stations have not yet disappeared. The queues are only shorter. Deliveries of petrol to filling stations are proceeding uninterrupted. The traffic in Lagos is a confirmation of the improved petrol situation as the usual congestion is back and commuting from one end to another is taking longer hours compared to last week when the roads were free. Petroleum and Mineral Resources Minister Chief Don Etiebet was taken up by journalists on the issue of petroleum smuggling after inaugurating a five-member administering committee of the Petroleum Technology Development Fund today: [Begin Etiebet recording] [Words indistinct] and it has become, I must tell you, an occupation in the country. It has come an industry, institutionalized. So, it is going to take some time to disappear; and they are always looking to see whether you are relentless enough. We should continue with the fight. So, today they will stop and tomorrow they will start again. But I want to assure you, and members of the public, that government is going to be absolutely relentless in pursuing this course.
