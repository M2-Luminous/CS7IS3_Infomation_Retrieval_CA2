IU [United Left] leader Cesar Barrera and APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance] leader Abel Salinas have said the thought of Fujimori with privatization money has prompted the opposition to redesign its electoral strategy. While the details of this redefinition are not clear, we must recall that the opposition strategy was based on an insolvent Fujimori, abandoned by voters who are fed up with the bruises of five years of structural adjustment. But even Barrera and Salinas seem convinced that the situation of Peruvians can be improved with the $1.4 billion from the phone company privatization. They are right in that large sums of money always awaken hope and make imaginations fly. Even Barrera and Salinas are beginning to feel it, in their own way. Many believe -- if only subconsciously -- Fujimori was unable to improve the economic situation merely because he did not have the resources with which to do it. From the very beginning, however, Fujimori did have the funds for improving the people's situation, but he did not do anything. He preferred to repay the foreign debt at an unnecessarily high rate, which caused the productive sector to stagger. High interest rates, a low dollar rate, an open market, and low income are the trademarks of his economic program, which is still in foce. It is true that the main issue is now the April 94-April 95 electoral year. Specialists know that channeling money to the poor in this type of system is very difficult, if not impossible. Governments that achieved this objective had to have a radically changed identity. The announcement to construct 50,000 houses clearly depicts this situation. These houses are not for the homeless but for those who earn enough to contract a mortgage at market prices, or who want to move from a rented house to their own house. Many of these people, who have a monthly income of $300, could be longstanding Fujimori supporters. But the construction of these houses may all the same help to reactivate the economy. What is not totally clear is whether a reactivated economy can help the increasing number of people who are choosing to vote for the opposition. Among other reasons, they are doing this because the new part of the economy is progressively becoming an enclave to strengthen internal inequalities instead of soothing them. Rather than changing its strategy, the opposition must develop a strategy. We are sure Fujimori will not do anything to improve the situation of a vast majority because that would go against his very raison d'etre in the government. Fujimori will try to make his spending look as if it is for the benefit of the majority. The best antidote against this might be to read the figures, rather than the headlines, and look at the daily lifestyle of the majority.
