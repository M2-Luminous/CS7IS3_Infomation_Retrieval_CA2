In the Caribbean city of Cartagena de Indias, the minister said: "What we know is that the Cuban Government is maintaining its former position, previously stated to our ambassador in Cuba, meaning the guerrilla summit was not held there." Villegas emphasized: "We believe that as long as we do not have enough evidence proving otherwise, we obviously have to believe the Cuban Government." On Saturday, media sources reported that Cuban President Fidel Castro denied his government had sponsored a meeting of Colombian guerrilla leaders on the island. He reaffirmed his pledge to Colombia, in other words, to not interfere in its internal affairs. Castro ruled out the possibility various Colombian guerrilla leaders had participated in the Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting for People's Solidarity and Self-Determination, held late in January in Havana. The Colombian Government demanded an explanation from the Cuban Government on the alleged presence of Guerrilla Coordinating Board (CG) leaders in Cuba, and it warned that relations between the two countries would suffer a great setback if the rumor was confirmed. Castro talked with Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin over the telephone and said he had ordered an investigation, while adding that he had individually verified all the names of the people who attended the solidarity meeting so he could guarantee with certainty that there were no guerrilla members. On Thursday, Sanin said that based on information received from the Attorney General's Office, "we have serious evidence that Cuba possibly welcomed the guerrilla members, who apparently participated in a political summit."
