FBIS4-5693 "dreas071_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 North Korea Reunification Meeting Drafts Letter to South Reunification Meeting Drafts Letter to South National Conference Proposed SK1304112294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1113 GMT 13 Apr 94 SK1304112294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Our side had demanded that the South Korean side accept through Panmunjom the letter to the South Korean authorities, political parties, organisations and individual figures and overseas compatriots which was adopted at a joint meeting of the government, political parties and public organisations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on April 11. But, the letter had to be sent through radio today, since it could not be conveyed to the addressees due to the untenable act of the South side. The letter carries a proposal to convene a national conference in Pyongyang or Seoul around the August 15 National Liberation Day. If anyone denies the great unity of the nation, pushing into the foreground the differences in ideology, idea and political system even today when the danger of a war, a nuclear war, is hanging over the head of the nation, it would be a heinous crime against the nation in seeking confrontation, war and division, the letter says, and continues: Out of the desire to carry into practice at an early date "10- point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country," a common guideline and charter of the nation which would bring unity, peace and reunification to our nation, we courteously propose the convocation of a national conference in Pyongyang or Seoul around August 15, one year before the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the country. Representatives of the authorities, political parties and organisations and individual figures of the North and the South and representatives of overseas compatriots, who can represent the will of the whole nation, may participate in the conference with equal qualification, irrespective of differences in political view, religious belief, political affiliation and status, in conformity with its character and purport. An open-hearted discussion on the questions of peace and reunification of the country, including practical measures for promoting the great unity of the whole nation, may take place at the conference. If the national conference is convened, people of all strata and figures of various circles of the North and the South would open their hearts to each other and confirm that they are compatriots of the same blood and seek a short cut to reunification in the 90s by promoting great unity and pooling the will and wisdom of the nation, transcending differences in ideology, idea, political view and religious belief. We think it necessary to form a preparatory committee of the national conference with five delegates each from the North, the South and overseas, in order to ensure the success of the national conference. The preparatory committee may have its first meeting in Pyongyang or Seoul in May and decide on the date and place of the national conference and its mode and discuss other practical matters arising in the convocation and steering of the conference. We think it desirable to have bilateral or multilateral contacts between compatriots of the North, the South and overseas for coordinating each other's opinions before the convocation of the historical national conference. We express the hope that the compatriots in South Korea and overseas will actively respond to our proposal for the convocation of a national conference proceeding from a noble patriotic stand.
