Reaffirming this view from IFP National Chairman Frank Mdlalose on a radio interview, spokesman Ed Tillet said "we don't see any pressure on us". "I don't see the IFP observing that deadline at all. A national settlement is far more important than artificial dates. The first thing we have to do is secure a national settlement which will accommodate the aspirations of the vast majority. We'll draw up a candidate list only after attempts at international mediation, and providing those attempts are successful...We haven't worried about it at all," Mr Tillet said. The IFP spokesman said he was confident the IEC would allow flexibility on the issue of late registration. "There has to be room for flexibility on this; we're talking about a life or death situation here," he said. IEC spokesman Pieter Cronje said the party's registration would lapse if its candidate list was not submitted by 4.30PM on Wednesday. "If they have any difficulty they would need to talk to us. We'll try to be as helpful as we can," Mr Cronje said, adding he knew of no communication from the IFP on the matter by Monday afternoon. "It's difficult to say what plan can be made; it depends on the nature of the party's problem," he said in response to a suggestion that the deadline might be waived. Mr Tillet said it would be almost impossible to finalise the party's list by the deadline because the list would have to be caucused and then verified at a regional level.
