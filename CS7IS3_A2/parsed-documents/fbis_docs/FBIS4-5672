At a meeting Wednesday [13 April], Watanabe's faction agreed to lobby LDP members to endorse him as the successor to Hosokawa, who announced last Friday he would resign, faction sources said. Watanabe also rejected a request for face-to-face talks with LDP President Yohei Kono, who vowed Tuesday to seek the premiership to maintain party unity, the sources said. Watanabe emerged earlier this week as a prime candidate for the premiership after a feud within the ruling coalition threatened to split the government, weakening the chances of front-runner Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata being named to succeed Hosokawa. But on Tuesday, the ruling coalition, which was on the verge of collapse, moved to maintain the current framework of the government, once again strengthening Hata's hand. A senior member of Watanabe's faction said, however, there is still a glimmer of hope for Watanabe being named prime minister because the ruling coalition parties have failed to mend wounds within the shaky alliance and band together to support Hata. On Wednesday, new party Sakigake [Harbinger], a component of the coalition, voiced its opposition with the process of selecting a new premier and boycotted a crucial meeting, giving impetus once again to Watanabe's ambitions to lead a new government. Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, told a news conference that coalition parties should conclude discussion on possible realignment of political forces before choosing the next prime minister. Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, the coalition's two core forces that are at odds with Sakigake, have expressed interest in Watanabe as the next leader of a new coalition government due to his political savvy and influence, political sources said. They said Watanabe may form a new party if he rallies enough support from within the LDP. A senior LDP official said, "It is good if Watanabe runs in the election (as the LDP's unified candidate) and the LDP is able to regain power, but if he is a candidate within the party, it means Kono should resign as party president."
