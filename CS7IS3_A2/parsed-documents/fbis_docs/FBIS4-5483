Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's announcement of resignation Friday has raised concerns that some figures in the coalition may adopt a more conciliatory position toward Pyongyang, the SANKEI SHIMBUN reported from Washington in its evening edition. The SANKEI dispatch named Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and Shinseito's [Japan Renewal Party] senior member Hajime Ishii as having close links with North Korea. Hosokawa has so far expressed support for Washington's plans to seek economic sanctions against North Korea if Pyongyang continues to refuse thorough safeguard inspections of its nuclear program. Takemura, speaking at Tuesday's evening news conference, dismissed the concern as a "laughing matter." Government officials said they know that a number of politicians within the Japanese ruling coalition would likely support a political connection with North Korea, the SANKEI report said. The officials allowed that Takemura's and Ishii's connection with North Korea may be entirely legitimate, but added that they hope Tokyo will not dilute its attitude toward the North Korean nuclear problem, the report said. Takemura and Ishii appear to have been singled out by Washington because of their involvement in a trip to North Korea in September 1990 led by then-Liberal Democratic Party power broker Shin Kanemaru. "It is a laughing matter," Takemura told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday, commenting on his reported political links with Pyongyang. Takemura and Ishii are also members of the Japan-North Korea Parliamentarians League, but Takemura denied that this was any indication that he had a political connection with Pyongyang. Washington has spearheaded an international campaign since last March to persuade Pyongyang to accept full inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to ensure that its nuclear program is not being used to manufacture an atomic weapons arsenal. Pyongyang has denied allegations it is seeking to build a bomb, but its refusal to permit unfettered IAEA inspections has fueled suspicions that it may be diverting radioactive materials from its power plants to military purposes. Two rounds of high-level talks between Washington and Pyongyang last summer yielded an agreement for inspections that were held last month. The IAEA, however, was prevented from completing the inspections and the U.N. Security Council issued a presidential statement March 31 urging Pyongyang to permit completion of the checks.
