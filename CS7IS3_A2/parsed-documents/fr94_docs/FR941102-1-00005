FR941102-1-00005 FR941102-1-00001 Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This proposed rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). This rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of the paperwork requirements. Because the rule will relax existing information collection requirements, the public burden for this collection of information is expected to be reduced by approximately 10 hours per licensee. This reduction includes the time required for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the estimated burden reduction or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information and Records Management Branch (T&hyph;6 F33), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001; and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB&hyph;10202 (3150&hyph;0011, 3150&hyph;0018, 3150&hyph;0002), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. Regulatory Analysis The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposed regulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered by the Commission. The draft analysis is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the draft analysis may be obtained from Naiem S. Tanious, telephone (301) 415&hyph;6103. The Commission requests public comment on the draft regulatory analysis. Comments on the draft analysis may be submitted to the NRC as indicated under the ADDRESSES heading. Regulatory Flexibility Certification In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed rule affects the nuclear power reactors, research and test reactors, and some material licensees. The companies and organizations that own these plants do not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities'' set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act of the size standards established by the NRC (56 FR 56671; November 6, 1991). Backfit Analysis The NRC has determined that the backfit rule 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule because these amendments do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits on licensees as defined in ยง50.109(a)(1). Information collection and reporting requirements are not subject to the backfit rule; moreover, the changes proposed in this rulemaking relax existing requirements.
