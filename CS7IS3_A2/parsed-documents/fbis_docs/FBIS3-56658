In the meantime, Speaker-Elect of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin speaking late on Friday [14 January] described Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin as the only candidate professionally fit to take the post. Shokhin belongs to the Party of Russian Unity and Concord. At the same time, the Speaker called for committees to be formed on a proportional basis so that none of the factions remained unrepresented. The Russia's Choice Party [RC] will not allow extremists from the Zhirinovskiy-led faction to take control of the key committees, and above all, the foreign relations committee, RC spokesman Kirill Ignatyev told Interfax. He said Zhirinovskiy's chairmanship of the committee would mean instability and probably war to Russia. The faction will stick to its position in talks with other groups, Ignatyev said. Leaders of the parliamentary factions and Rybkin-led New Regional Policy group are due to meet at 14:00 on Saturday to discuss the sharing of committees among them.
