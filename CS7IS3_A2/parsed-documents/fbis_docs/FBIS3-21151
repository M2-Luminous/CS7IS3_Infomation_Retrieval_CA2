Just the job for shield tunneling equipment. However, there was a snag: the tunnel needed to curve, but it was passing under a crowded residential area where there was no room to dig a vertical shaft to grab in and redirect the cutting blades. The answer, thought up by Taisei Corp. engineer Toshihiko Bessho, was to redesign the shield machine so it could change cutting direction on its own. The world's first spherical shield tunneling machine is already at work digging the rainwater pipeline in Kawasaki near Tokyo. Taisei is the prime contractor and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. helped in developing the new tunneling machine. The biggest advantage of this new shield machine is that it can excavate in one direction and then turn 90 degrees to excavate in a new direction. A sphere housing an auxiliary shield is attached toward the front of the main shield. This sphere pivots 90 degrees, at which point the auxiliary shield can be separated from the main shield for further excavation work. Globular Thinking ``The construction of a shield that can turn 90 degrees has long been a dream of civil engineers,'' says Bessho, manager of the technology division in Taisei's Construction Technology Development Department. The idea came to Bessho one day while he was staring at a golf ball. He suddenly realized that a pivoting sphere could be used to freely change the course of excavation. Bessho knew that pivoting the front shield would be difficult. His answer was to house a second, smaller auxiliary shield on the sphere, and to use this auxiliary shield for excavation in the new direction. Of course, this results in a tunnel that suddenly changes diameter, ending up larger at one end than at the other. But while this would be a complication when designing, say, an underground train line, it is not a problem for water lines. For the Kawasaki project, Taisei is using a tunneling machine with a front shield diameter of 5.5 meters, and an auxiliary shield diameter of 3.6 meters. Using conventional shield tunneling equipment, there are two ways to excavate a curve. The usual solution is to gradually turn the shield, drawing a large arc. But to accomplish this, it is necessary to stabilize the ground, which significantly boosts construction costs. An alternative method is to excavate a vertical hole, lift the shield up with a crane and turn it 90 degrees. But vertical excavation is itself a major operation, with its own attendant difficulties. Taisei decided to use the spherical shield in the Kawasaki project because the tunnel needed to be dug in a densely populated residential area with narrow streets. At ¥600 million ($5.40 million), the spherical shield is much more expensive than conventional shields. However, it eliminates the need to stabilize the surrounding earth, which in the case of the Kawasaki project would have cost several hundred million yen. Moreover, Taisei figured that continuous excavation with the spherical shield would reduce construction time by as much as six months. Taisei's calculations indicated that the project would cost a total of ¥1.8 billion using conventional construction procedures, but only ¥1.5 billion with the spherical shield, for savings of 17%. Development of this spherical shield opens up a new era in tunnel construction. Taisei's goal is to develop a tunneling machine that can turn freely and be used in deep underground digging projects.
