FR940711-0-00035 FR940711-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;220&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8961; AD 94&hyph;14&hyph;09] Airworthiness Directives; Lockheed Model 382 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes, that requires a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual to require takeoff operation in accordance with revised performance data. This amendment is prompted by a report of a change that had been incorporated into the propeller governor of these airplanes during production, which altered the thrust decay characteristic of the propeller when operating in an engine failure scenario. The actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure that the airplane is operated at sufficient speeds to mitigate the problems associated with a faster thrust decay and to prevent the airplane from departing the side of the runway. DATES: Effective August 10, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Lockheed Western Export Company, 2251 Lake Park Drive, Smyrna, Georgia 30080. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Suite 210C, Atlanta, Georgia; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas Peters, Aerospace Engineer, Flight Test Branch, ACE&hyph;160A, FAA, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Suite 210C, Atlanta, Georgia 30349; telephone (404) 991&hyph;3915; fax (404) 991&hyph;3606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed Model 382 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on March 25, 1994 (59 FR 14124). That action proposed to require a revision to the FAA-approved AFM to require takeoff operation of the airplane in accordance with the revised performance data. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. The commenter supports the proposed rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. There are approximately 112 Model 382, 382E, and 382G series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 18 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the AFM change, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $990, or $55 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
