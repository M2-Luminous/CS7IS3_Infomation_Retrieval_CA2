"Much attention during the consultations was devoted to the presentation and comparison of the Russian and American national interests in the region. In spite of some understandable and inevitable differences, we are nevertheless guided by the belief that we have a common task to do -- to bring the peace process to a happy end, which will contribute decisively to stability in the Middle East," Posuvalyuk noted. "The consultations focused both on the Israeli-Palestinian talks on self-government in the Gaza Strip and in the Jericho area, now under way in Cairo, and on some other directions, particularly the Syrian-Israeli relations," he added. "The sides have agreed that we should not copy each other's course, but should make use of our own means in the pursuit of our common goal. We have traditional contacts with Damascus and a definite reserve of confidence, which we are striving to exploit in order to strengthen bilateral relations and promote the Syrian-Israeli dialogue." "Both co-chairmen of the Middle East process are interested in the early success of the Cairo talks. We expect them to be rounded off by the signing of an agreement already at the end of this month. It would have been premature to speak now about an early breakthrough in the Israeli-Syrian direction, which is the key and very difficult area. But this does not mean that we intend to sit on our hands. The visits of PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to Moscow, which are to begin on April 19 and 24, are among the most important events of the foreseeable future. In addition to bilateral relations, accent will be laid on the discussion of the situation at the Middle East talks, on Russia's role as co-chairman of the peace process," Posuvalyuk stated.
