Acceptance of Current Regime's Survival Will Cause Iraq To Lose Its Immunity"] [Text] Conflict over the fate of sanctions against Saddam's regime continues to rise. Sometimes it becomes confused and indistinct in its outlines; at other times its currents clash and fight each other; and this ever since the embargo was imposed on Saddam by international resolutions soon after the invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. After Kuwait was liberated, each of the parties involved in the embargo began acting on inspiration from its interests and according to the dictates of its own policy on the subject. This has became as clearly evident on the Arab scene as on the international scene. Exploiting this situation, the regime began to stir interests and ambitions this way and that among its friends in the pressure group in the major powers. Thus, for example, one sees France, which had been behind Security Council Resolution 688 to end the regime's repression of its people, concentrating on measures to ease the embargo and speed its lifting and on measures acceptable to Saddam's regime--implementing Section 22 of Resolution 687, for example, regarding the elimination of weapons of mass destruction--to justify ending the sanctions, regardless of other international resolutions. No sooner had France done this than Russia and China joined her. When the fraternal neighbor Kuwait moved to ask about the fate of the linkage between lifting sanctions and recognition of her borders and sovereignty, these countries were forced to talk with Saddam--they were also inspired by their interests--on the chance that he might agree to such recognition and the problem might end. Would that the matter had ended there, and that [another] fraternal neighbor had not proceeded in its own way! Suddenly Islamic Iran, claiming to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people, opened its borders to the Baghdad regime, so that it could obtain the goods and materials it desired to support its survival and enable it to regain its strength. Thus Iran forgot, or pretended to forget, Iraq's savage war of aggression against it; it forgot, or pretended to forget, the famous condition that Imam Khomeyni's voice proclaimed during that war: that war should continue until victory was achieved with the demise of Saddam and his regime forever; and it forgot, or pretended to forget, the imam's famous words spoken when he was asked to halt the firing: that he would rather drink poison than agree to what he was being asked to do. And now fraternal Jordan, that went out of its way to support Saddam and his regime despite all the aggression he had committed against his people and neighbors, has never flagged in its efforts to smuggle forbidden goods and materials to him under the cloak of alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people and reducing the losses resulting from the blockade of Aqaba. How one wishes that the government in Jordan would believe that alleviating or ending this suffering will not come by supplying Saddam's government with the means to survive and conquer its own people, but rather by depriving him of those means, so that they can escape his clutches and his suffocating hold on their necks! On that day, our brothers in Jordan will realize that the crushing suffering of the Iraqi people comes from the continuance of Saddam's government and from those who supply him with support and backing, and from nothing else. How great were the surprise and wonder of the Iraqi people when they saw fraternal Qatar normalize relations with Saddam's regime and when one country after another restored them under the same cover of "alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people and its tragic pains"! None of us could see how exchanging ambassadors with Saddam's regime or the Qatari ambassador's return to Baghdad alleviated suffering and pain. Did brotherhood and neighborliness not oblige the government leaders in fraternal Qatar to read the reality of Iraq attentively and fairly and scan the record of its present government before making their normalization decisions and going it alone among their fellow Gulf countries? They ought to have determined who it was who had devastated Iraq and brought down on it all these woes--the international community or Saddam's regime. They should have known with clear sight how this fraternal country might be saved and its people rescued from their suffering--whether by supporting and helping the root of the suffering or by liberating the people from him and releasing them from their fetters. Dealings with the Baghdad regime proceed selectively. Positions, measures, and arrangements are accepted or rejected according to how they accord with the interests of this or that party. As for the Iraqi people, they are absent, or rather have been made absent, from the stage of events. None of these parties wants to execute on Saddam and his aides the sentence of history that in times past was imposed on similar insolent tyrants, who received just retribution at Nuremberg and elsewhere. How is Saddam any different from Hitler and his cronies or from any of the world's great war criminals, that he should escape retribution and punishment to the present day? Has his aggression against his people entailed less than the aggression of those criminals? Was his aggression against a fraternal neighbor less hateful than what took place at their hands? These interests and ambitions, which are besieging the people of Iraq, thus leaving them easy prey to Saddam's repression and tyranny, are making Iraqis focus their attention on the region of their country that has liberated itself from him. They are tying their hopes to it for salvation from his evil scourge, with this region as the base from which the onslaught can proceed against those who sit in the centers of power and government in Baghdad. We can therefore imagine how much heartache and pain there were when Iraq's brother Kurds fought and made war on each other in this region and how much apprehension and anxiety for their destiny until the fighting and war ceased. There was universal rejoicing in Iraq and elsewhere when Iraqi Kurdistan freed itself from Baghdad's rule and when the democratic process began there about this time two years ago. As we witness the cessation of mutual fighting and war, we can but say to our dear brethren that peace among you and in your dwellings is the point on which Iraqis pin their hopes for liberation and freedom from slavery. The alliance between you and Iraq's Arabs embodied in the Iraqi National Congress is the life preserver from the regime and scourge of Saddam; for secession is not something you want, neither is it possible due to well-known regional and international objections and circumstances. Maintenance of the status quo for however long is nothing but a transitional, temporary solution. Therefore, the outcome will be either to remain in this alliance and strengthen it, or to return to Saddam's regime and leave the matter to God. It is in the interest of Iraq's Kurds and Arabs now to adhere to the federalism embodied in the government of Iraqi Kurdistan, on the one hand, and to the Iraqi National Congress, on the other hand, as a transitional, temporary central body to bring to the Iraqi people a government that the people elect in universal, direct, free, and honest elections after getting rid of Saddam's rule. Let us work together to strengthen the regional government and the central National Congress, that we may stand as a united Iraq in the face of Saddam's regime at home and abroad. However selectively the Security Council resolutions concerning Saddam's regime may be handled, and however far the attempts may go to obscure what he did to his people and in the region--attempts to erase the facts of his behavior--the regime's aggressiveness and violations of the laws of humanity are so enormous and dangerous that in order to remove the regime it will not suffice that its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction be removed, or that it recognize Kuwait's sovereignty and borders, or that it release Kuwaiti prisoners as mandated by international resolutions. No, all these resolutions with their provisions must be carried out effectively, but especially the provisions of Resolution 688, which calls for changing the nature of the current government in Baghdad. Only in this way can the people escape their present predicament, security return to the area, and the necessary standards for international dealings be followed. Certainly, none of this can be achieved or expected while Saddam with his aides and regime continues to rule. What we are saying and advocating is nothing new in the history of the world's tyrants and masters of injustice and oppression. The aggressiveness of Hitler and his aides, for example, caused the German state to be removed from the political map for about 40 years. When Germany was restored to political existence in 1949, it was divided between West and East, and remained so for 40 years, until it regained its unity and sovereignty in the fall of 1991. What is this punishment compared to the nature of Saddam's regime? See how he does as he pleases in the region and rides roughshod over the world, as he and his mouthpieces call for lifting the sanctions and normalizing relations with him; and this at a time when just retribution ought to be imposed on him and those who sided with him, as having been directly responsible for the invasion and the fearful war crimes that were committed, instead of these sanctions that have not affected his person, his sources of power, or his means of oppression to any significant extent. The survival and actions of the present Baghdad government have caused the state and people of Iraq to lose the immunity and esteem they had in the international community, thus encouraging infringement and trifling with the rights of Iraq. A sign of this are the recent statements by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali about Iraqi funds that have disappeared or been squandered by various financial and oil companies--as if they were loose funds and fair game, with no one having ownership or title to them. The situation reminds us of what used to be called "the Sick Man [of Europe]"--the end of the Ottoman Empire, when there was competition and fighting to divide and plunder his possessions. It is not unlikely, after the situation we are witnessing of Saddam with his people and the world, that his shameful rule in Iraq will lead to the same consequences as that "sick man's" rule. Now that Iraqi Kurdistan has freed itself from Saddam's rule, Iraq today lives in a state of real and effective division of government between the north, on the one hand, and the center and south, on the other. Thus there are two separate governments ruling Iraq, each independent of the other; indeed, each is fighting the other, so that one cannot expect Iraq to regain its unity as a people and state so long as the current government continues to exist in Baghdad. One is therefore led to wonder at those who hold that only Saddam's rule can guarantee Iraq's continued unity. Saddam is tireless and indefatigable in challenging the rights of the people of Iraq, the rights of neighbors, and the injunctions of the legitimate international authority. Whenever the time approaches for the periodic Security Council review of the sanctions against his regime, one sees him working energetically to get rid of them so as to survive and remain in power. Thus you see him today stirring up Turkey's regional fears, one the one hand, and its anxieties about its revenues, on the other, calling on Turkey to act against the entity existing in northern Iraq, with its secessionist possibilities whose consequences could affect Turkey's unity to the core. He is also calling Turkey to cease being silent about the billions of dollars it is losing as a result of the halt to Iraqi oil exports through Turkey. Turkey has therefore begun protesting to the United States and other coalition members about the continued embargo on Iraq and the survival of the liberated entity in the north. Indeed, the Turkish foreign minister, Hikmet Cetin, during his recent visit to New York at the end of April, was led to advocate a strange selectivity in applying the Security Council resolutions concerning Saddam's regime. He advocated lifting the embargo, on the ground that the regime had fulfilled all the relevant demands specified in Section 22 of Security Council Resolution 687 on the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. Disregarding the remaining provisions of international resolutions, especially those of Resolution 688, dealing with the rights of the Iraqi people vis-a-vis their present government, he said: "There is no relation between the Council's resolutions and the government in Iraq. It is not the business of the United Nations or any country to decide who shall administer and rule Iraq." He emphasized that Turkey "did not approve of introducing personal aspects into the terms of the oil embargo." He called on Iraqi Kurds to hold talks with Baghdad, describing the situation in their territory as "unstable." We do not understand how this minister could consider the Saddam regime's enormous violations of human rights and the laws of humanity in Iraq and his aggressive attack on Kuwait and other countries as "personal aspects." While making these pronouncements, should he not have remembered the positions he once took calling for a trial of Serbian war criminals? Is there any difference between what the latter did and what Saddam did? How can one consider what happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina war crimes, and what happened in Iraq and vicinity personal aspects and affairs? How could he deny a relation between the United Nations and Saddam's rule when every letter of the UN Charter is at variance with his claim? Should he not have read the principles of this international charter, especially Section 2, Paragraph 7, before making his pronouncement under the influence of the political principle that calls for changing one's position whenever one's interests change?--but not to such a length as caused his deputy minister, having ascertained that the United States had released the Iraqi oil stored in Turkey's pipeline, to wash his hands of his alliance with Iraq by saying, "We were treated as if we had made an alliance with Iraq to violate the embargo, but this unnecessary attempt was the result of misunderstanding." Efforts by Saddam and his regime to convince officials to follow a selective policy in implementing international resolutions concerning him were most successful with France, where there were friends and followers. Today we see France speak with pompous eloquence when Saddam's envoy Tariq 'Aziz arrives in New York, saying: "France urges Iraq to take a concrete step toward recognizing the state of Kuwait. We have told the Iraqis that this is the essence of the matter and that their taking such a step would set everything else in motion." Is what France says true? Is it true that the essential solution to the problems of the Saddam regime and to the world's difficulties with him lie in his recognizing Kuwait's sovereignty and borders? Saddam does not object to such recognition if it proves sufficient to lift the sanctions from his regime. He knows full well that no solemn recognition can ever stand in the way of his realizing his ambitions, dreams, and vision of glory as soon as he senses that he can cross the Kuwaiti and other borders. The problem with him in this respect is not so much the promises he makes or the oaths he swears as the availability of forces to do one thing or another. He has accustomed us to what he calls "phasing" in policy and military affairs. What this means is that in one phase he yields something difficult to yield, only to take it back and even more in another phase. The story of what he gave to Iran in Algiers in 1975 is well-known. Scarcely had he finished dividing sovereignty over the Shatt al-'Arab equally with Iran than he began plotting not only to regain the Shatt completely, but also to invade all of Iran; and so it came to pass on 22 September 1980. He did the same thing in his war against Iran. Scarcely had he finished with that war, which absorbed his and Iraq's effort and strength, than he began planning for his new war. At the time, people imagined that the man, exhausted by eight years of war, had no further desire for violence, aggression, and hostile adventures such as would cause him to embark on a new war; yet he attacked Kuwait on 2 August 1990. Thus, recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and even of its borders is not unacceptable to Saddam. All that remains before he grants it is the matter of arranging things to save face. Having bound himself and his regime with pledges and promises not to relinquish Iraq's right to the territory of Kuwait and to remain there even if it should require a hundred years of war, it is difficult for him to retreat from his pledges and promises so easily before the nations and the world. Perhaps Tariq 'Aziz's statement to the Austrian newspaper DER STANDARD on the eve of his trip to New York, confirms what we have said previously. He said: "The Kuwait issue now is finished for the Iraqi government, except that we cannot prevent the Iraqi people from thinking as they wish; however, historical facts cannot be ignored." Nevertheless, Saddam's man of sound judgment and chief of diplomacy thinks it possible that the people will join with their government. They support it "because they know that it is working for their welfare and that of Iraq"--if it is possible to overcome "the frustration the Iraqi people feel from seeing that although their country's government has carried out all the UN resolutions on Kuwait, this has not helped alleviate their suffering, but has even increased it." It would not be beside the truth or the facts for us to say in light of what we read in Tariq 'Aziz's statement or read in Saddam's actual attitude and precedents in this matter that Saddam and his regime are ready to implement all the Security Council resolutions concerning them, except one: Resolution 688, which calls for changing the nature of his government and giving the Iraqi people their say regarding it. This resolution is his first and last enemy, for he sees in its implementation his end and the collapse of his government. There is therefore no way to conclude a truce with him. One cannot hold one's peace regarding him or regarding what such countries as the United States and Britain call for implementing. The latest example to appear of his war against this resolution was what we read in the writings of some of his propagandists. They said that America's support of the resolution, as enunciated in Secretary of State Christopher's article in THE NEW YORK TIMES, did not reflect his country's real policy on the matter: there was a split in American circles regarding policy toward Saddam's regime, and it would be only a matter of months and days--time to prepare everything--until the hour of truth would strike and things would return to their normal course with America and other countries. We do not know whether this prophecy was made as a result of information possessed by its authors or whether it was a guess on their part. In any case, we assure them that stands on liberating Iraq from Saddam's regime from the direction of the United States are not based on the flowery words and promises that the Iraqi National Congress receives from time to time, sometimes from President Clinton and sometimes from his aides. Rather, these stands are based on calculations of interest that clearly indicate that the international community has no interest in the Baghdad regime's remaining in power, because there is need for a government that shall express the opinion and interests of the people, respect rights and peace in the region, and rebuild the world's trust in Iraq--things that Saddam can no longer accomplish. American and British insistence on linking the lifting of sanctions from Saddam's regime with implementation of Resolution 688 accords with the essential purpose for which the sanctions were imposed. They were not imposed only to expel his regime from Kuwait or to eliminate his weapons of mass destruction, as Saddam and his mouthpieces say; they were imposed to uproot and utterly eradicate aggressiveness. This gave the aforesaid resolution absolute priority in the invasion and liberation of Kuwait. Only this resolution, implemented with the required honesty and effectiveness, can change the nature of the current government in Baghdad and write a new history for it and the region. Only then will the measures and steps now required be rendered irrelevant. We therefore believe that the efforts of all parties on the Arab, regional, and international scene interested in the region's peace and security must work together to insist that Resolution 688 have precedence over other resolutions in the areas of respect and implementation. This they should do by working to move it into the scope of the provisions of Article 7 of the United Nations Charter. Ending sanctions against Saddam's regime should be made conditional on its execution and implementation. At the same time, an effort should be made to break the siege of the Iraqi people, especially in the liberated area, by rendering Security Council resolutions 706, 712, and 778 effective.
