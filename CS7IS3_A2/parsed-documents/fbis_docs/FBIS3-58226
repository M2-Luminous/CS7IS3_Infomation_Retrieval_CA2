The invitation and framework agreement is to serve as the basis for bilateral accords to be offered to Russia and its ex-satellites allowing cooperation in military planning, training and other activities. It also provides for consultations in a crisis, but stops short of giving security guarantees or promising full membership eagerly sought by countries such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. "We reaffirm that the alliance...remains open to the membership of other European states in a position to further the principles of the treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area," the document said. "We expect and would welcome NATO expansion that would reach to democratic states to our east, as part of an evolutionary process, taking into account political and security developments in the whole of Europe. "We therefore invite the other states participating in the NACC and other CSCE countries able and willing to contribute to this programme, to join with us in this partnership," it said, referring to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. The document sets out broad principles with which all members must comply -- including respect for democracy, and transparency in budget and defence policymaking. Individual countries can then negotiate bilateral accords with NATO on how and to what extent they will participate in the Partnership's activities. Participation can include joint military operations from next year, and sending permanent representatives to NATO headquarters here to take part in military planning. The document added: "Active participation in the Partnership for Peace will play an important role in the evolutionary process of the expansion of NATO."
