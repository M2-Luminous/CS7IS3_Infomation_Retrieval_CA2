FBIS4-68600 "jpusr052___94014" FBIS-USR-94-052 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 20 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS 20 April Economic Statistics Report 20 April Economic Statistics Report 944E0756A Moscow DELOVOY MIR in Russian 20 Apr 94 p 4 944E0756A Moscow DELOVOY MIR Russian CSO ["Survey Prepared From Data of the Russian State Committee on Statistics": "Production Output and Price Dynamics As of 12 April"] [Text] PRICES OF CONSUMER GOODS AND SERVICES. Over the 5-12 April 1994 period, consumer goods and services increased 2.7 percent, including 1.2 percent for food products, 2.4 percent for nonfood products, and 18.4 percent for paid services to the populace. Higher than the average observed across Russia was the increase in food product prices seen in cities of the Volga region and Northern Caucasus (2.2-2.3 percent). Virtually no change in food prices was seen in the Urals, Western Siberia, the Far East, and Kaliningrad Oblast. Nonfood products rose 9 percent in cities of the Far East, 2.0-2.5 percent in other regions. The most significant increases in rates for paid services to the populace were registered in cities of the Urals, Western Siberia, and Kaliningrad Oblast. The following table reflects price indexes for goods and services in the consumer market: Percentage of previous date 29 Mar 5 Apr 12 Apr Average daily price increase April March Consumer 101.8 102.2 102.7 0.36 0.27 goods and services including: food products 101.2 101.4 101.2 0.19 0.20 nonfood 102.6 101.9 102.4 0.29 0.34 products paid services 101.6 111.9 118.4 2.34 0.45 to the populace Since the beginning of the month, the overall increase in prices amounted to 4.5 percent, including an increase of 2.3 percent for food products, 3.5 percent for nonfood products, and 31.9 percent for paid services to the populace. FOODSTUFFS. Over the 5-12 April period, the growth of prices in nonorganized trade amounted to 2.5 percent, somewhat higher than in organized trade--0.9 percent. The following table shows the change in prices for basic product groups: Percentage of previous date Total Trade alone Organized Nonorganized All food products 101.2 100.9 102.5 including: Meat and meat 101.5 101.3 102.0 products Fish and fish 100.5 100.5 101.5 products Milk and dairy 101.0 101.1 100.3 products Eggs 99.4 99.5 97.9 Sugar 100.3 100.3 99.9 Bakery products 102.3 102.2 -- Cereals and 102.7 102.7 101.4 macaroni products Vodka 98.4 98.4 98.5 Potatoes and 105.1 105.0 105.3 vegetables In organized trade, as was the case the previous month, vegetable prices increased at accelerated rates. Onions, garlic, and beets increased 11-13 percent in price and fresh cabbage and carrots rose 4-5 percent. Rates of price increase greater than those in the ending weeks of March were observed for flour (2.1 percent), cereals and macaroni products (2.7 percent). Virtually no change was seen over the week in the prices of meat, butter, vegetable oil, sugar, eggs, and vodka. Prices rose 5-10 percent since the beginning of the month for macaroni products and cereals, salt, fruits, and vegetables. The price increase was 3.6 percent for milk and dairy products, 1.5 percent for meat and fish products. The average level of prices for sugar and eggs changed insignificantly. Vodka decreased by 2.2 percent. In nonorganized trade, as in organized trade, the greatest price increases were registered with respect to vegetable output: 17 percent for onions, 13 percent for fresh cabbage, 3-9 percent for garlic, beets, and carrots. The rate of growth of prices increased somewhat for meat products in April, comprising 2.0 percent for the past week. Prices of dairy products did not change; eggs decreased 2.1 percent. Cost of the selection of 19 basic food products rose 1.1 percent over the week, totalling R46,000 on a monthly basis as of 12 April. A 4.4-fold differentiation factor was registered between cities under observation. Maximum cost of the selection was recorded in Magadan (R125,400); minimum cost, in Ulyanovsk (R28,300). Moscow and St. Petersburg occupied 33d and 36th place, respectively, out of 132 cities under observation with respect to cost of the selection (R50,000 and R49,700, calculated on a monthly basis). NONFOOD PRODUCTS. As in March, the rate of price increase for nonfood products was somewhat higher than that for foodstuffs. The high rate of price increases for certain varieties of medicines--8 percent--was maintained. Prices of garments, knitted wear, and footwear rose two to three percent over the week. Cultural and household products increased 1.5 percent in price, tobacco products, 0.7 percent. The most significant price increases since the beginning of the month were seen with respect to medicines (18 percent). PAID SERVICES TO THE POPULACE. A significant increase in the rates of paid services to the populace was observed in April, continuing the trend seen since the beginning of the year. Over the week, the cost of travel on long-distance trains doubled in 70 percent of the cities under observation. In 13 cities and in Moscow Oblast, the cost of intercity and local phone utilization increased by a factor of 1.3-2.0. Housing costs rose 12 percent on the average across Russia. A more than 200-fold increase was observed in Perm, Krasnoyarsk, Sovetsk, Yaroslavl, and Kostroma. PRICES OF MATERIAL-TECHNICAL RESOURCES. The increase in acquisition costs of basic material-technical resources by industrial enterprises slowed down in March of this year, amounting to 10 percent of the February level (February compared with January--13 percent), including material-technical resources from suppliers in Russia--10 percent, resources acquired at the exchange--21 percent, resources acquired from countries of the far abroad--32 percent. Costs to producers also rose 10 percent over the past month. Since the beginning of the current year, costs to consumers have increased 47 percent (costs to the producers of industrial production--51 percent). The rise in the cost of building materials was more significant. Material acquisition costs to contractor organizations increased 13 percent over the month, 71 percent since the beginning of the year. The costs of building materials to producer enterprises increased 13 percent and 59 percent, respectively. The dynamics of acquisition costs this year for basic groups of resources is characterized as follows: As percentage of previous month March 1994 percentage of December 1993 January February March Electric power 118 109 111 143 Thermal energy 118 128 108 163 Fuel 125 113 111 157 Materials and raw 113 113 108 137 materials for heavy industry Materials and raw 106 115 119 145 materials for light industry and the food industry Construction 120 126 113 171 materials, parts and components The increase in prices of basic varieties of material-technical resources used by enterprises of the oil industry amounted to 29 percent in March as compared with February of this year; electric power, gas, and coal industry--12 percent; metallurgy enterprises--22 percent; chemical and petrochemical industry--13 percent; timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry--10 percent. The main reason for increased costs of resource acquisition was price hikes by the suppliers. Costs of acquisition of certain varieties of materials and raw materials differed depending on the suppliers. Thus, the costs of acquisition of energy-producing coal, oil, and synthetic textile fibers acquired from suppliers in the CIS countries were 15-20 percent higher than on the domestic market, while coking coal was 1.5 times more expensive. Fuel oil and synthetic fibers were acquired more cheaply outside Russia. The differentiation of prices for the same material resource acquired within Russia remains significant. Thus, the cost of iron ore purchased by metallurgy enterprises in March amounted to R38,000 per tonne in Volgograd Oblast and R57,000 in Bashkiria. Surveyed enterprises of the chemical and petrochemical industry in Novgorod and Moscow Oblasts acquired caustic soda at costs 1.6 times higher than did enterprises of Samara Oblast and Krasnoyarsk Kray. For enterprises of light industry, the acquisition of a tonne of single-thread cotton yarn in Yaroslavl Oblast cost R1.062 million, in Ivanovo Oblast--R1.747 million, in Vladimir Oblast--R1.815 million, and in Moscow Oblast--R3.297 million. Increased expenditures for the transportation of acquired material-technical resources exerted a definite influence on price dynamics. In March of this year, the proportion of transportation expenses in the cost of resource acquisition by industrial enterprises comprised 9 percent, by construction organizations--14 percent. Expenses to transport sand constituted more than half of its acquisition cost; crushed stone--about 40 percent; cement, asbestos-cement sheeting, keramzit gravel, roofing material, and wood-particle board--about 15 percent. COMMODITY STOCKS. As of 1 April of this year, current stocks of consumer commodities on hand in retail and wholesale trade and industry were valued at R11.1 trillion. More than 80 percent of commodity stocks (R9.0 trillion) were concentrated in retail trade enterprises. Trade turnover capacity of stocks in retail trade enterprises remained at the level of last year, as shown in the following table: Trillion rubles As percentage of Trade turnover 1 March 94 level rates in first (in comparable quarter 1994 prices) (number of turnovers) Total 9.045 103 2.7 including enterprises of the following forms of ownership: state 3.333 101 2.3 private 3.268 105 3.6 consumer 1.500 98 1.6 cooperatives other nonstate 0.944 118 3.1 forms The volume of commodity stocks in retail trade as of the beginning of April amounted to 44 days of trade (as of the same time in 1993--41 days). In enterprises of the state form of ownership, trade turnover stocks were on hand for 53 days of trade, in private enterprises--35 days, consumer cooperatives--56 days, and in other nonstate forms of enterprises--44 days of trade. MONETARY INCOME AND OUTLAYS OF THE POPULACE. Monetary income received by the populace in the first quarter of this year amounted to R53.8 trillion. Some R31.5 trillion of this figure was money taken into account as wages of workers at enterprises, institutions, and organizations; R8.5 trillion--pensions, allowances, stipends, and other social monetary transfers; R13.8 trillion--income to the populace for entrepreneurial activity, participation in the profits of enterprises and organizations, transactions involving real property, and other financial and credit transactions. The share of wages within the monetary income structure decreased, as compared with the same period of 1993, from 65 percent in the first quarter of 1993 to 59 percent in the first quarter of this year, while a corresponding increase was seen in the proportion of entrepreneurial income. The share of social transfers remained at approximately the same level--16 percent. Face-value monetary income of the populace in January-March of this year increased over January-March 1993 levels by a factor of 8.8. Its growth outpaced the rise in consumer market prices over this quarter by a factor of 8.0. Thus, real disposable monetary income (income after the withholding of mandatory payments and with index adjustment) increased by approximately 10 percent. In this regard, that portion of the population with the highest incomes saw an increase 1.2 times greater than did the populace with lowest incomes. As compared with the first quarter of 1992, real disposable monetary income of the populace increased by 25.5 percent. However, this growth did not replenish its decline seen during the first year of liberalization of prices. As compared with the first quarter of 1991, the level of this income was 40 percent lower. The population having income lower than the subsistence minimum numbered 25.2 million in first quarter of this year, or 17.0 percent, as opposed to 51.7 million (34.7 percent) in the first quarter of 1993. The role of hard-currency purchases and acquisition of securities continued to grow within the structure of use of monetary income of the populace, while expenditures for consumption purposes and cash on hand decreased. First quarter 1993 First quarter 1994 Trillion rubles Percentage of Trillion Percentage of total rubles total Monetary income 6.1 100.0 53.8 100.0 Monetary expenditures: Payments for 4.6 75.7 37.5 69.8 goods and services Mandatory 0.5 8.7 4.8 9.0 payments and fees Growth of savings 0.3 5.2 3.2 5.9 in deposits and securities including: securities 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.1 hard-currency 0.1 1.9 6.3 11.6 purchases increased cash on 0.5 8.5 2.0 3.7 hand In first quarter of this year, the population purchased hard currency amounting to R6.3 trillion, as opposed to R0.1 trillion in first quarter of 1993; purchases of securities totalled R54.6 and R1.4 billion, respectively; stock--R47.5 and R0.9 billion, respectively. DELINQUENT INDEBTEDNESS IN ISSUING FUNDS FOR WAGES AND OTHER PAYMENTS TO ENTERPRISE WORKERS. Delinquent indebtedness in the issue of funds for wages and other payments to the workers of industrial enterprises and organizations, construction and agricultural enterprises (not including funds transferred to the bank accounts of workers) increased by 20 percent in March. The following table reflects data on the numbers of enterprises having delinquent indebtedness with respect to wages and the volume of this indebtedness. As of 1 March As of 1 April As of 1 April 93 94 94 (reference) Number of enterprises 35,031 32,617 14,124 with indebtedness respecting issue of funds for consumption (units)--total including: in industry 8,275 6,995 3,587 in construction 7,409 6,230 3,304 in agriculture 19,347 19,392 7,233 Volume of delinquent indebtedness in the issue of consumption funds to enterprise workers (trillion rubles) total 1.9785 2.3741 0.0643 including: in industry 1.0442 1.3325 0.0348 in construction 0.3714 0.4171 0.0135 in agriculture 0.5629 0.6245 0.0160 Funds directed (credited) towards consumption for workers of enterprises and organizations over the accounting month (trillion rubles) total 1.6093 1.8347 0.1023 including: in industry 1.0205 1.2283 0.0614 in construction 0.2745 0.2891 0.0209 in agriculture 0.3143 0.3173 0.0200 Indebtedness of longer than one month in the issue of wage funds as of 1 April 1994 in the three sectors of the economy totalled R1.0847 trillion, or 46 percent of the total indebtedness volume, including R508.3 billion (38 percent) in industry, R195.7 billion (47 percent) in construction, and R380.7 billion (61 percent) in agriculture. The greatest amounts of funds not paid within the prescribed time frames are attributable to enterprises and organizations of industry, construction, and agriculture in Tyumen Oblast (R232.8 billion), Krasnoyarsk Kray (R131.5 billion), Kemerovo Oblast (R118.4 billion), Chelyabinsk Oblast (R87.7 billion), the Republic of Bashkiria (R67.6 billion), Rostov Oblast (R66.6 billion), Perm Oblast (R64.0 billion), the Komi Republic (R63.2 billion), Tatar Republic (R59.8 billion), Irkutsk Oblast (R57.9 billion), and Altay Kray (R52.3 billion). STATE OF PAYMENTS DISCIPLINE. The credit indebtedness of surveyed industrial and agricultural enterprises, construction and transportation organizations, amounted to R63 trillion as of 1 March of this year. Of this amount, R25 trillion, or 39 percent, constituted delinquent indebtedness (as of 1 February these figures were R54 trillion, R20 trillion, and 37 percent). The proportion of total delinquent credit indebtedness of these sectors that was owed to suppliers constituted 70 percent (R17 trillion), owed to the budget--17 percent (R4 trillion). The largest share of delinquent credit indebtedness was seen in the microbiology industry and ferrous metallurgy (46 percent), in the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry, chemical and petrochemical industry, and nonferrous metallurgy (47 percent), in the coal industry (48 percent), and gas industry (68 percent). The following table shows the dynamics of delinquent credit indebtedness for February: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1 March 94 percentage of 1 February 94| | | level | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rate of growth of delinquent credit i-|125.8 | |ndebtedness--total | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |industry |124.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |construction |135.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |agriculture |139.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |transportation |127.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A significant increase was seen in delinquent credit indebtedness in February 1994 at enterprises in the construction (36 percent), transportation (39 percent), ferrous metallurgy (36 percent), flour and cereal grinding, mixed fodders (38 percent), peat (46 percent), coal (50 percent), electric power (52 percent), and gas industries (82 percent). The share of enterprises having delinquent credit indebtedness as of 1 March 1994 amounted to 50.2 percent, as opposed to 46.6 percent as of 1 February 1994. As of 1 March of this year, the total amount of debts receivable reached R60 trillion, of which R26 trillion, or 43 percent, constituted delinquent debts (figures as of 1 February--R50 trillion, R21 trillion, 43 percent). In this regard, R23 trillion, or 90 percent of the total amount of such delinquent debt, was attributable to delinquent indebtedness for unloaded output, work performed, and services rendered. The largest portion of delinquent debts receivable was observed in the electric power industry, building materials industry, timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry (49 percent), ferrous metallurgy and the coal industry (53 percent), nonferrous metallurgy and the peat industry (54 percent), and the gas industry (71 percent). Nonpayments among enterprises are holding back revenue payments to the budget. Indebtedness to the budget on the part of enterprises and organizations of industry, construction, agriculture, and transportation amounted to R9 trillion, of which R4 trillion, or 46 percent, constituted delinquent indebtedness (these figures as of 1 February--R8 trillion, R3 trillion, 43 percent). A significant share of delinquent indebtedness to the budget was observed in the oil industry (56 percent), coal industry and ferrous metallurgy (61 percent), and in construction (52 percent). Due to shortages of their own funds, enterprises were forced to take out loans. The indebtedness from bank credits afforded enterprises and organizations of the sectors under examination amounted to R13 trillion, of which R2 trillion, or 12 percent, constituted delinquent indebtedness. The significant volume of nonpayments has exerted an influence on the financial stability of enterprises and organizations, on their solvency. The following table reflects the dynamics of the correlation between monetary assets and delinquent indebtedness to suppliers in industry and construction in 1993 and 1994 (solvency): Percentage as of the beginning of the month 1 January 93 1 1 1 1 1 July October January February March 93 93 94 94 94 Monetary assets 78.2 119.6 75.0 49.9 41.2 39.2 as percentage of delinquent indebtedness to suppliers--total including: industry 79.3 124.6 76.9 50.7 42.6 41.6 construction 67.2 67.4 55.4 41.7 21.4 17.6 During the first half of 1993, monetary assets exceeded delinquent indebtedness to suppliers. By the end of 1993 they covered half this amount, and by the end of first quarter 1994, to the level of just 39 percent. At enterprises of the flour and cereal grinding industry, mixed fodders, coal, microbiology, gas, chemical, and petrochemical industries, monetary assets covered delinquent indebtedness only to the extent of 11-16 percent. PRODUCTION OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. Gross domestic product (GDP), characterizing the cost of production, work, and services intended for final consumption, accumulation, and export, amounted to R96.9 trillion over the three months of this year. As compared with the same period of last year, the physical volume of GDP decreased 17 percent. The more significant reductions in this regard were seen in the sphere of commodity output: Gross added value Percentage of Change in for January-March total physical 1994, trillion volume rubles compared with the same period of last year, percent GDP produced, total 96.9 100 83.0 including: commodity production 42.8 44.2 79.4 including: commodities in 26.0 26.8 75.1 industry commodities in 6.2 6.4 76.0 construction commodities in 10.5 10.8 94.5 agriculture performance of 46.3 47.8 88.1 services including: market services 35.3 36.4 85.0 including: in transportation 23.3 24.0 75.9 in trade 3.4 3.5 101.2 nonmarket services 11.0 11.4 95.9 net taxes (minus 7.8 8.0 84.4 subsidies) on commodities and imports A sharp reduction was seen in the first quarter of this year (as compared with the same period of 1993) in the volume of industrial production output (25-percent drop) and construction work (24 percent). This led to a corresponding drop in value-added in these sectors, as well as in the net taxes on commodities (excise taxes, value-added tax) taken into account in the GDP. At the same time, the performance of services decreased at a significantly slower rate. In certain sectors, the volume of services performed even continues to rise. As a result, the share of services--primarily market services--in the GDP structure continued to increase, especially noticeably in those sectors engaged in intermediary and financial transactions. The percentage of value added in sectors performing services increased in the first quarter of 1994 to 47.8 percent of the GDP (including 36.4 percent attributable to market services, 11.4 percent to nonmarket services), as opposed to 34.8 percent of the GDP for the same period of 1993, where 25.1 percent were market and 9.7 percent nonmarket services. The increased share of GDP volume attributable to services is also related to a somewhat greater increase in prices and rates in these sectors. Thus in the first quarter of this year, the GDP deflation index was a factor of 7.5, while prices and rates for market and nonmarket services increased by a factor of 9-10. CONSTRUCTION OF RESIDENTIAL HOUSING FACILITIES. The volume of capital investments in nonproduction construction decreased 11 percent in the first quarter of 1994 from the level of the same period last year. The reduction in commissioning of main facilities is shown as follows: Commissioned in Percentage of January-March January-March 1994 1993 1990 Housing--square meters of 4.0 million 95 50 living space General education 9,000 48 39 schools--student spaces Preschool 2,600 40 14 institutions--spaces Hospitals--beds 1,700 80 99.2 Walk-in clinics--visits 2,000 37 19 per shift Some 59 percent of the total volume of housing was commissioned by enterprises and organizations of state and mixed Russian ownership, 16 percent--of municipal ownership. More than one-fourth of the housing, or a million square meters, was constructed by private owners. This is 9 percent greater than the level for the same period of last year. Of this amount, 668,000 square meters (27 percent more) was the effort of individual builders, their proportion of the total volume increasing from 13.3 percent in 1993 to 16.9 percent at the beginning of this year. Military servicemen and their family members obtained more than 5,500 apartments during the period since the beginning of the year, totalling 300,000 square meters of living space. It is expected these individuals will be afforded 60,000-100,000 apartments in 1994. STRIKES. The beginning of 1994 was characterized by increased strike activity on the part of laborers. In the first quarter, strikes took place at 288 enterprises, exceeding the number of enterprises at which strikes were conducted over the entire previous year by 24. More than 80 percent of the strikes took place in March. Enterprises cited delay in the payment of wages as the foremost reason behind the conduct of strikes in all sectors. The number of enterprises in industry failing to pay timely wages to their workers in March almost doubled as compared with the beginning of the year. Among the other reasons for conducting strikes enterprises cited failure to comply with wage-scale agreements, and budget indebtedness for the financing of scientific research and preventive repair work, provision of technical equipment, acquisition of medical and school equipment, etc. The following table provides data on strikes conducted in sectors of the economy in January-March 1993 and 1994: Number of Number of Losses in labor enterprises at participants time, man-days which strikes were conducted 1993 1994 1993 1994 1993 1994 Total 29 288 18,200 114,500 34,200 283,100 In industry 28 137 17,900 87,400 33,200 168,600 including: Fuel industry 27 135 17,500 87,000 30,300 167,100 Education -- 137 -- 24,700 -- 107,200 Construction -- 7 -- 1,300 -- 4,700 Transportation 1 4 300 700 1,000 2,000 and communications Other sectors -- 3 -- 400 -- 600 As a result of strikes over the period which transpired, enterprises estimate that production output totalling R8.8 billion overall was not produced. Of this amount, R8.2 billion was attributable to the fuel and energy complex. As a result of the deliberate cessation of operations, 88 enterprises of the country failed to receive production output deliveries according to contract in an amount totalling more than R3.5 billion. The greatest losses from the strikes were suffered by enterprises of the fuel and energy complex in the Komi Republic (R2.4 billion), Kemerovo Oblast (R2.3 billion), Rostov Oblast (R2.1 billion), and Tula Oblast (R0.2 billion). Strikes by coal miners in Perm and Chelyabinsk Oblasts are continuing.
