Zhou Wenhua, chairman of the provincial CPPCC Committee; Vice Governor Zhou Tienong; Huang Feng, Dai Moan, Fu Shiying, Chen Wenzhi, Tan Fangzhi, Zhao Shijie, Chen Zhanyuan, Wang Zhitian, Wu Dinghe, vice chairmen of the provincial CPPCC Committee; and Zhang Huanchen, secretary general of the provincial CPPCC Committee, joined the visit. Yue Qifeng said: The CPPCC system is the basic political system of our country. In the new situation, it is worthy of exploring and studying how to give better play to the role of the CPPCC. All democratic parties should act in line with the basic line centering on one central task and two basic points, give play to their own advantages, and promote reform, opening up, and economic development. He said: The CPPCC organizations and various democratic parties should also deeply study volume no. 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, clear up old ideas and concepts in line with reality, put forward and study issues with the market economic mode of thinking, and provide basis and reference for the provincial party committee and government to make scientific policy decisions. Yue Qifeng said: Heilongjiang has a fairly great number of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. This is our great wealth. While grasping this financial resource, we should also develop new ones, namely the development of nonstate economic sector, such as township enterprises. Yue Qifeng pointed out: The waste of trained personnel is the greatest waste. Large and medium-sized enterprises have a galaxy of trained personnel, however, their role cannot be given full play. If we release some trained personnel to run nongovernmental enterprises, great results will be achieved. Heilongjiang has a considerable number of colleges, universities, and scientific research centers and institutes with the advantage of trained personnel. We should give full play to this advantage, and use the rich natural resources of Heilongjiang to develop intensive processing industry as well as high-and new-technology enterprises. It is hoped that the CPPCC and various democratic parties will give play to their role in this aspect.
