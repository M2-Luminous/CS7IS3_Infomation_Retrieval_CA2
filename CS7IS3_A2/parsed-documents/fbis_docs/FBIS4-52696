Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata reacted strongly to Murayama's remark, saying: "The remark is problematic. If the next election should be held under the existing election system, why did we have to carry out political reform? Obviously, some people do not want political reform." On top of that, Hata stressed he has no intention of dissolving the lower house under the multiseat constituency system, and said "it is not time for dissolution of the lower house."
