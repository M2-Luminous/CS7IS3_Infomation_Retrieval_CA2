Some Legco members have therefore questioned this statement by the Hong Kong Government, which could mislead candidates and discourage them from viewing the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 as a fundamental change. The return of Hong Kong to China in 1997 will be a change which involves a transfer of sovereignty, which is substantially different from events such as a certain party's stepping down while another rises to power in the UK. Therefore, generally, a new legislative body will have to be formed in 1997. However, there are indications that even now the Hong Kong Government has no intention of changing its stand on the issue concerning the term of office for Legco members. Instead, it is insisting on the four-year term of office for members of the three-tier councils, as provided in Chris Patten's constitutional reform package. Legco member Chim Pui-chung maintains that the above provision is obviously based on wishful thinking and may mislead the candidates. According to the set election schedule, by 30 June 1997, newly elected district board members will have been in office for not more than 32 months, while Legco members will have been in office for only 22 months. For both categories, the terms of office will be less than 4 years. Therefore, some public figures have pointed out that now that the Sino-British talks on the constitutional system have broken off, the Chinese side will definitely perform its duty to "set up another kitchen" according to the Basic Law by 1997. The British Hong Kong authorities have no right to unilaterally set a four-year term of office for Legco members, because, if they do, they could be accused of disregarding China's sovereignty. Chim Pui-chung noted that the British Hong Kong authorities are juggling with words in order to extend their influence beyond 1997. This reflects the lack of frankness and sincerity on the part of the British Hong Kong authorities toward the Hong Kong people, a mentality which is absolutely harmful to their administration in Hong Kong before 1997. Chim urged the Hong Kong Government to face the reality squarely and give the electorate a reasonable and clear explanation on the term of office for council members.
