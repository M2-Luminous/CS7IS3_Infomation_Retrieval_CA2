FR940523-2-00015 FR940523-2-00007 DOC Position: Since the margin for this period is based on best information available, any questions as to which methodology would have been used have we been able to calculate a margin are moot. Furthermore, the failure of the PRC Embassy in the United States to respond to our inquiry regarding industry and market conditions in the PRC would, in any case, preclude us from determining that market conditions existed in the PRC for this industry. Comment 4 Separate Rates Under the Reseller Provision: Zunyi and Novachem urge the Department to reconsider the decision in its preliminary results of review that the Hong Kong resellers do not qualify for separate rates under the intermediate country reseller provisions. Section 353.47 of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.47) calls for a separate rate to be calculated for an intermediate country reseller if all of the following criteria are met: (1) A reseller in an intermediate country purchases the merchandise from the producer, (2) The producer does not know (at the time of the sale) the country to which the reseller intends to export the merchandise, (3) The merchandise enters the commerce of the intermediate country but is not substantially transformed in that country, and (4) The merchandise is subsequently exported to the United States. Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD(HK) argue that Hong Kong should be treated as the country from which the subject merchandise was exported and they should be given separate rates under this provision, which allows for qualifying intermediate country resellers to be assigned a margin based on a comparison between their above cost-of-production sales to the United States and a fair market value based on the reseller's sales in its home country or a third country, rather than the margin(s) of its supplier(s). With respect to the ``enters commerce'' prong, Yue Pak, He-Ro and ICD (HK) claim that since they filed import/export declarations and paid fees applicable only to imports and exports, the merchandise entered the commerce of Hong Kong, rather than merely being transshipped through Hong Kong. Furthermore, these parties note that it is uncontested that the merchandise was not transformed between its manufacture in the PRC and its shipment to the United States. In refuting arguments raised by petitioner, these resellers argue that (1) the length of time that merchandise remains in a third country should not be a basis for determining intermediate country reseller status, (2) the amount paid in import/export fees should not be a criterion, (3) the term ``transshipment'' as used by Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK) in the questionnaire responses does not refer to the statutory meaning of the term, and (4) the export provisions of the Tariff Act cited by petitioner are not relevant to the construction of the reseller provision. Yue Pak, He-Ro and ICD (HK) also argue that the Department's comparison of their sales and order-filling process to the practices described in the final determination in Sulfur Dyes, Including Sulfur Vat Dyes, From the People's Republic of China (Sulfur Dyes), 58 FR 7537 (February 8, 1993), is not appropriate because, ``unlike respondents herein, respondents in Sulfur Dyes had separate procedures for handling merchandise which was destined to the United States as opposed to merchandise that was sold in Hong Kong.'' With respect to the knowledge requirement, Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK) state that the producers from whom they purchased the subject merchandise had no knowledge of the ultimate destination of this merchandise. Producer Zunyi, on the other hand, states that it knew, at the time of sale, the destination of the potassium permanganate it sold during the period of review. Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK) also claim that, since in the PRC only import and export corporations had the legal capacity to enter into ``foreign economic contracts'' during the period of review, purchasing from these entities rather than from the producer/manufacturer should fulfill this requirement. Zunyi and Novachem also make this point. Finally, these parties note that export of the merchandise to the United States is not at issue. Petitioner argues that no reseller in this case meets the qualifications for a rate distinct from its producer(s) under 19 CFR 353.47. Petitioner also notes that since the intermediate country reseller provision constitutes an exception to the general rule that a reseller's rate is the rate of its supplier(s), the responding resellers have the burden to showing that each prong of the testy is fully met. With respect to the ``enters commerce'' prong, petitioners assert that the merchandise was merely transshipped through Hong Kong and did not enter commerce there, noting that the questionnaire responses of Yue Pak, He-Ro, and ICD (HK) describe circumstances involved in the sales of subject merchandise through the resellers which indicate that the merchandise was never intended to enter the commerce of Hong Kong. Petitioner also cites the appraisement provisions of the tariff laws to support its proposition that to ``enter commerce'' is a term of art that involves merchandise which (1) is intended to be diverted into the commerce of a third country and was in fact diverted; (2) is not passing through a third country enroute to a purchaser in a different country; (3) is not merely passing through a third country; (4) is intended for consumption in the third country; and (5) is sold or offered for sale in the third country. In petitioner's view, warehousing, and/or repackaging, and/or relabelling in a third country is not considered evidence that the merchandise has entered the commerce of a country, unless there are other supporting factors. In addition, petitioner contends that a decision as to whether merchandise ``enters the commerce'' of a country must include consideration of whether or not the producer country receives any undue benefit by shipping through a third country.
