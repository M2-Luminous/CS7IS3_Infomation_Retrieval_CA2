Even though 1994 will be very difficult, very trying, we trust that certain activities will improve during the year, added Lage--who is also a member of the Communist Party of Cuba Political Bureau--in statements to the national television news. He said the availability of resources is directly related to the 1992-1993 sugar harvest, when production was approximately two million metric tons less than estimated, resulting in lost revenues of more than $450 million. He admitted, however, that the Cuban economy has a very slim chance of protecting itself against the negative repercussions resulting from external factors, such as the reinforced U.S. economic, financial, and commercial blockade against the island. Lage's statements were made in the central eastern Province of Ciego de Avila, where he said the recovery of the sugar industry constitutes an indispensable condition to surpass the current Cuban economic crisis.
