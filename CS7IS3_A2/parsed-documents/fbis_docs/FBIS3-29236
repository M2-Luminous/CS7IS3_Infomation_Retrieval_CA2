The U.S. has notified the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that it will retract a 60 to 70 percent cut in tariffs on electronic parts as proposed under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, the officials said. Washington is frustrated over Tokyo's failure to meet repeated U.S. calls for removal of wood product tariffs in Japan, the officials said. The latest U.S. action prompted rescheduling from the originally set deadline of Tuesday for each GATT member country to show an item-by-item plan for reducing tariff rates, the officials said. In the Uruguay Round talks concluded last December, Japan agreed to halve lumber tariffs. But the step did not fully satisfy the U.S., which called for total abolition in order to improve American access to Japan's lumber market. The latest move is apparently targeted at Japanese exports as part of trade sanctions following the collapse of trade framework talks last week. The U.S. is likely to exclude from the tariff cut plan electronic components which serve as Japan's mainstay export items, the officials said. The Japanese side, dismissing the U.S. move as against the GATT accord, is expected to form an alliance with South Korea and other Asian countries in seeking the tariff reductions on electronic parts, the officials said.
