It has not been a topic in which I have blindly been determined to sign the peace agreement as my predecessor unfortunately did. We do not want to give false expectations to the population and encourage the guerrillas. That is what we did in the past. I believe international positions support us, and the government's peace plan is very clear in its objectives, especially in the development of the process. It is not that we are not in a hurry but, rather, we are not going to play to the tune of the guerrillas, who want to stand out before the international community. We believe, however, that the current conditions, especially the unfortunate situation in Mexico, have come to absolutely favor the situation in Guatemala. I am going to travel to Mexico, possibly next month, because I have received an invitation from President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. I am taking advantage of this opportunity to tell you that I expect all the support and cooperation from you because we are going to [words indistinct]. In terms of economic issues, I expect to bring a delegation that is totally prepared to negotiate. Therefore, I expect support from you to enable us to take a delegation that can negotiate and prepare the economic future of this country with Mexico. The other goal is political. Within this general goal we would like to talk about the subversives in Mexico through the [words indistinct] and the signature of the peace agreements, at least the conclusion of the armed confrontation. I am taking advantage of the fact that the most important goal is not the conclusion of the armed confrontation but the fight against poverty and the need to provide solutions to economic and social demands. We have to provide solutions now, at this time, as we are doing now through our participation and through decentralization, not only by providing potable water and electricity but by bringing hope because the people have lost hope. This is why I have begun visiting the poorest and most remote regions of the country. The president and the government has to give hope to the country's productive sectors. They must know that there is hope. Otherwise, we could face the problems faced by Mexico, such as poverty and extreme poverty. The demands made by the subversives and the groups in southern Mexico should be resolved before it is too late. I was telling you about how the government will conduct its activities. But before this, I forgot to mention the other objective, which is that of reconciliation and the fostering of peace here in Guatemala. I have said it often in the interior of the Republic. We are the only ones who can revolutionize Guatemala, but it will be a moral and peaceful revolution. Those who have remained here and those who have suffered the effects of violence, poverty, extreme poverty, lack of security, and its consequences have to work for a reconciliation, the reconstruction of Guatemala, and the engendering of peace. This is what I told you -- that we are determined to work for a national peace plan as part of a process -- a process we hope can be completed as soon as possible from a humanitarian point of view. Nevertheless, from a strategic point of view, we are in no hurry if it is to become an advantage for the subversives. I told you that the five points I have mentioned will be to consolidate democracy and the state of law, fight poverty, increase production, protect the environment, and institutionalize modernization through austerity, honesty, and social participation. As for the first topic -- the consolidation of democracy and the state of law -- I can mention the modernization of institutions, freedom of speech, free elections, balance of powers, and the subordination of the Armed Forces to civilian rule. These are things we can plainly mention. I say these things in front of the Armed Forces, in front of the Guatemalan Army. It is something that is understood, because there is a clear concept that this is most advisable for the Army. [words indistinct] for that institution and, therefore, for the government and the Guatemalan nation. That is why we speak about the subordination of the military to civilian rule, which is a slow process, but a process that has already begun. As for the fight against poverty, it includes access to opportunities, the participation of the poor in social life, the participation of the poor in political life, improvement of markets, prevention of the creation of monopolies, protection for workers, consumer protection, and better organization of businesses. As for the preservation of the environment, we are going to combine environmental policies with technology and use resources to decrease poverty. As for modernization, we are going to improve the state's management capabilities, and we are going to work for efficient macroeconomic management, encouragement of private investment, promotion of foreign investment, and the country's advance into international markets. I will not go into detail because I would be speaking for too long. Nevertheless, I would like to give a few examples. For instance, in the field of government social policies, the improvement of the government's working capacity, the decentralization of public services, and the strengthening of local governments will be priority concerns. The management of hospitals by a board of trustees is a fact. This is a decision made by this government. The state does not have enough funds to efficiently run hospitals. Hospitals are poorly run and there is corruption in the handling of hospitals. The solution is to have a board of trustees run hospitals and oversee privatizations. As for privatizations, fortunately this government has no problems in preventing monopolies. Privatizations are needed to make government enterprises more efficient. It is a way to reduce the state's debt. This is how I see it.
