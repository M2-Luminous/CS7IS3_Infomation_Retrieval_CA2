KYODO news service reported from New York that the North Korean official indicated his government would allow additional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if the United States came to the negotiating table. The official offered neither a confirmation nor a denial when asked if North Korea and the United States had been in contact since the nuclear issue was referred to the UN Security Council. "No comment," he was quoted as saying. Washington canceled its scheduled March 21 high-level talks with Pyongyang after the stalinist state refused to allow full nuclear inspections by the IAEA. The agency has referred the matter to the Security Council, which is preparing a resolution on North Korea for next week. Seoul and Washington, meanwhile, are seriously considering resumption of their joint military exercises "Team Spirit" this year. The North Korean official expressed high hopes on the stance of Beijing, which has openly declared its opposition to any harsh action against Pyongyang such as sanctions. "We have maintained friendly relations for over 40 years since the Korean war," KYODO quoted him as saying. "We will continue to strengthen these relations."
