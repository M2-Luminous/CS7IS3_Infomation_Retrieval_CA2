FR940728-2-00064 FR940728-2-00047 Maine In the State of Maine, there are 271 industrial applicants or permittees. It is estimated that 13 of the industries that have direct discharges to the waters of the State are strictly water treatment facilities. New Hampshire In the State of New Hampshire, there are 171 estimated industrial applications or permittees. It is estimated that 2 or more of the industries that have the direct discharges to the waters of the State are strictly water treatment facilities. Massachusetts In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, there are 651 industrial applicants or permittees. It is estimated that 33 of the industries that have direct discharges to the waters of the State are strictly water treatment facilities. II. Conditions of the Draft General NPDES Permit A. Geographic Areas Maine (Permit No. MEG640000) All of the discharges to be authorized by the general NPDES permit for the State of Maine from dischargers are limited to Class B, C, SB and SC waters of the State, except lakes. The drainage areas must be more than 10 square miles. Massachusetts (Permit No. MAG640000) All of the discharges to be authorized by the general NPDES permit for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts dischargers are into all waters in Water Quality Classifications B, C, SB and SC as designated in Massachusetts Water Quality Standards, 314 CMR 4.00 et seq . New Hampshire (Permit No. NHG640000) All of the discharges to be authorized by the general NPDES permit for the State of New Hampshire dischargers are into all waters of the State of New Hampshire unless otherwise restricted by the State Water Quality Standards, New Hampshire RSA 485&hyph;A:8. B. Notification by Permittees Operators of facilities whose discharge, or discharges, are described in Part IB and whose facilities are located in the geographic areas described in Part II. A. above may submit to the Regional Administrator, Region I, a notice of intent to be covered by the appropriate general permit. This written notification must include the owner's or operator's legal name and address, the number and type of facilities to be covered, the facility locations, the names of the receiving waters into which discharge will occur. The facilities authorized to discharge under a final general permit will receive written notification from EPA, Region I, within 30 days of permit coverage. Failure to submit to EPA, Region I, a notice of intent to be covered or failure to receive from EPA written notification of permit coverage means that the facility is not authorized to discharge. C. Effluent Limitations 1. Statutory Requirements The Clean Water Act requires all dischargers to meet effluent limitations based on the technological capability of dischargers to control the discharge of the pollutants. Section 301(b)(1)(A) requires the application of ``Best Practicable Control Technology Currently Available'' (BPT). Section 301(b)(2) (A), (C), (D), and (F) requires the application of ``Best Available Technology Economically Available'' (BAT) by July 1, 1984, for all toxic pollutants referred to in Table 1 of Committee Print Numbered 95&hyph;30 of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives and not later than three years after the date any limitations are established for toxic pollutants listed under paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of Section 307 of the Act which are not referred to in subparagraph (C) of Section 301(b)(2). Section 301(b)(2)(A) and (F) requires ``Best Available Treatment Technology Economically Achievable'' (BAT) for nonconventional pollution by July 1, 1984, and Section 301(b)(2)(E) requires the application of the Best Conventional Pollutant Control Technology (BCT) for conventional pollutants by July 1, 1984. The effluent limitations in the general permit are consistent with these statutory requirements. 2. Technology-based Effluent Limitations The Environmental Protection Agency has not developed effluent guidelines for water treatment facilities. In the absence of national standards, effluent limitations for the TSS limitations are based upon best professional judgement pursuant to Section 401(a)(1) of the CWA. The ``Maximum Daily'' TSS limitation and the limitations for settleable solids and pH are based upon state certification requirements under Section 401(a)(1) of the CWA, 40 CFR 124.53 and 124.55, and water quality considerations. 3. Water Quality Standards The effluent from the water treatment facility may contain toxic pollutants due to use of chemicals and chlorine. However, they do not contain hazardous pollutants or oil and grease. Therefore, water quality criteria established for oil and grease and hazardous pollutants do not apply to these discharges. Water Quality Standards applicable to these discharges are limited to pH, seettleable solids, and TSS. In addition testing requirements are necessary for aluminum, chlorine and LC50, C&hyph;NOEC. The limits of total residual chlorine and aluminum for the state of Maine are based upon state certification requirements. 4. Antidegradation Provisions The conditions of the permit reflect the goal of the CWA and EPA to achieve and maintain water quality standards. The environmental regulations pertaining to the State Antidegradation Policies which protect the State's surface waters from falling below State standards for water quality are found in the following provisions: Maine Title 38, Article 4&hyph;A, Section 464.4.F.; Massachusetts Water Quality Standards 314 CMR 4.04 Antidegradation Provisions; and New Hampshire policy RSA 485&hyph;A:8, VI Part Env-Ws 437.01 and Env-Ws 437.02. This general permit will not apply to any new or increased discharge unless it can be determined that such discharges will result in insignificant effects to the receiving waters. This determination shall be made in accordance with the appropriate State Antidegradation Policies. 5. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements Effluent limitations and monitoring requirements are included in the general permit describing requirements to be imposed on facilities to be covered. Facilities covered by the final general permits will be required to submit to EPA, Region I, and the appropriate State a Discharge Monitoring Report containing effluent data on a semi-annual basis. The monitoring requirements have been established to yield data representative of the discharge under authority of Section 308(a) of the Act and 40 CFR 122.41(j), 122.44(i) and 122.48, and as certified by the State. III. Other Requirements The remaining conditions of the permit are based on the NPDES regulations 40 CFR parts 122 through 125 and consist primarily of management requirements common to all permits.
