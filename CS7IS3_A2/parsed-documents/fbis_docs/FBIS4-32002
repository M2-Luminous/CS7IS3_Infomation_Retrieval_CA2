The present status makes it impossible for the Polish delegation to cast votes, participate in committees' work and forward amendments to reports. Speaking to journalists Pastusiak said that Poland's full integration with WEU, which under the Maastricht Treaty is to become an armed organization of the European Union, remains one of the priorities of the Polish policy. In his opinion, odds are that efforts of Polish delegation to attain this goal will bring results during the December session of the WEU Parliamentary Assembly.
