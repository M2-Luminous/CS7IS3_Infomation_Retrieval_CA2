[applause] In greeting the New Year, I extend warm congratulations and warm greetings to all the people, including our working class, cooperative peasants, intellectuals, and People's Army officers and men, who, with boundless loyalty to the party and the leader [suryong], are devotedly waging the struggle for the chuche-oriented socialist cause. [applause] I extend warm congratulations and compatriotic greetings to brothers and sisters in South Korea and Korean residents in Japan and all the other compatriots overseas who are positively waging the struggle to peacefully reunify the fatherland. [applause] I extend New Year greetings to the progressive peoples and friends on the five continents who treasure justice and peace and aspire for an independent new world. [applause] The year 1993 was a historic year when the justness of our party's independent revolutionary lines and the might of chuche Korea were displayed powerfully. [applause] Last year, the imperialists and reactionaries more viciously than ever maneuvered to isolate and stifle [korip chilsik] our Republic and obliterate [malsal] our socialist cause. As a result, the situation in our country has become very tense. When a stern trial faced the fatherland and revolution, our party, in response to the prevailing situation, took the bold self-defensive measure of declaring a state of semi-war in the entire country, all the people, and the entire Army and called on all the people to break through head-on [matpadanagamyo] the enemy's challenge with the revolutionary spirit and militant spirit -- which was displayed during the period of the stern fatherland liberation war -- and score great upsurges in socialist construction. Our heroic People's Army officers and men and all the people, who accepted the party's militant call with their hearts, rose up like one in the struggle to defend national independence and the revolutionary feats with confidence in a sure victory and soaring spirits, crushed the enemy's challenge and aggression maneuvers, and honorably defended the dignity and safety of the socialist fatherland, thus fully displaying the indomitable spirit of chuche Korea. [applause] This is the victory of our party's revolutionary lines and the great victory of single-minded unity among the leader [suryong], party, and masses. [applause] Last year our people, under the leadership of the party, attained successive victories in the political and military confrontation with the enemies. With high revolutionary zeal, they vigorously accelerated the socialist economic construction and brilliantly concluded the final year of the Third Seven-Year Plan. [applause] During the Third Seven-Year Plan period, we came up against considerable difficulty and obstacle in the economic construction owing to the unexpected international events and the acute situation created in the country, but we have made great progress in all fields of socialist economic construction. Our independent industry made significant expansion in the overall production capacity, the standard of its technology and equipment was enhanced much, and its structure by sectors further reinforced, thereby its self-reliance and might was further strengthened. In the rural economic sector, the great nature-remaking project of completing irrigation at a higher level was victoriously conducted and an upturn was brought forth in mechanization and scientization. With the further development of agricultural science and technology in conformity with the chuche agricultural method, we built a solid revolutionary agricultural foundation ensuring a continuous bumper crop. According to our party's idea of capital construction, the magnificent and splendid Kwangbok Street, Tongil Street, the Fatherland Liberation War Victory Monument, the Three Revolutions Exhibition Center, the May Day Stadium, and numerous other monumental creations were built during the Third Seven-Year Plan period. This intensively demonstrates the might of the inexhaustible creativity and our country's self-reliant national economy. It clearly symbolizes the heroic spirit of socialist Korea which victoriously advances undisturbed by the worldwide economic recession. [applause] Despite today's complicated situation, our people are all enjoying rewarding, happy lives free from social and political unrest or worries about livelihood under the popular mass-centered socialist system of our country. The communist virtues, in which the people help and encourage each other--one for all and all for one--sharing joy and sorrow, prevail more beautifully in the entire society. Through a stern trial and struggle in recent times, we strongly demonstrated once again that our party is a great party of iron-will and tested guidance, that our people are a heroic people of firm revolutionary faith and indomitable struggle spirit, and that our-style socialism embodying the chuche idea is an indestructible socialism taking root deep among the popular masses. [applause] I warmly thank all the people--including our workers, farmers, intellectuals, and the soldiers of the People's Army--for the shining exploits they have accomplished in the revolution and construction last year under the party's leadership. [applause] The New Year of 1994 is a year of revolutionary upturn when our country's socialist construction enters a new developmental stage and a year of rewarding struggle when the entire party membership, the entire country, and all the people should be totally mobilized to effect revolutionary upsurge in all fronts. The situation at home and abroad of our revolution is still complicated and strained, and we are building socialism in acute confrontation with the enemies. In conformity with today's situation and the demand of our revolution's development, we must thoroughly implement the independent, self-reliant, and self-defending revolutionary line and vigorously conduct the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--so that we may further strengthen the country's political, economic, and military might. We must solidify and develop the successes we have already attained in socialist construction and win new greater victories so that we may add luster to the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style and hold further aloft the chuche socialist banner. [applause] We should consider the next three years to be an adjustment period for the socialist economic construction as decided at the 21st plenary session of the sixth party Central Committee. We should thoroughly implement a policy of top priority for agriculture, light industry, and trade during this period. Along with this, we should firmly give priority to developing the coal and electric power industries and railway transportation, which are primary sectors in the national economy. We should constantly develop the metal industry. By thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary strategies during the adjustment period for the socialist econonomic construction, we should consolidate as firm as a rock the self-reliant economic foundation of the country, should more smoothly ensure the people's lives in keeping with the socialist demand, and should secure a new position of attack to reach a higher target of socialism. [applause] This year, we should concentrate our strength on developing agriculture, the light industry, and foreign trade. This year is a significant year. It marks the 30th anniversary of the publication of the socialist rural theses. We should effect a new turn in developing the rural economy by vigorously struggling to implement the historic task of the rural theses. We should further develop all fields of agricultural production, including the production of grains, by consolidating the successes of irrigation and electrification in the rural areas, realizing the mechanization and widespread use of chemicals at a higher level, and by thoroughly carrying out the chuche-oriented farming method in the rural areas. Our working class should produce more tractors, automobiles, modern agricultural farming instruments, chemical fertilizers, and farming medicines, and send them to rural villages. With the attitude befitting the masters responsible for the national granary, the people working in agricultural cooperatives and all the people working in agriculture should conduct all farming work carefully and frugally and realize the high target of grain production provided by the party. [applause] We should make a great innovation in producing people's consumer goods by vigorously accelerating the light industry revolution. We should repair, supplement, and modernize light industry plants. We should take a positive measure to strengthen the production of light industry raw materials, such as chemical fibers and plastics. By so doing, we should operate all light industry plants at full capacity and normalize production at a higher level. Ranging the large-scale central light industry from small- and medium-sized local industries and the production of 3 August people's consumer goods, all units and domains should fully produce various people's consumer goods. By so doing, we should increase the types of consumer goods and actually improve their quality. We should positively pioneer foreign markets and thoroughly win our reputation in developing foreign trade in keeping with the changing circumstances. Various domains of the national economy should thoroughly strengthen the production bases for export goods, increase production of export goods, and improve their quality. All domains and all locals should further increase export by positively finding and mobilizing the sources of export. They should also develop the processing trade. We should put efforts into the coal, electrict power, and metal industries in a bid to develop agriculture and the light industry and vigorously accelerate the overall economic construction of the country. We should more smoothly resolve the railway transportation issue. The fields of coal and electric power industries should effectively use existing production foundations and further develop the production capacity. They thereby should decisively increase the production of coal and electricity. We should smoothly meet the daily-increasing demand for transportation of the national economy by strengthening the railroad's material and technological foundation, setting up a policy for transportation, commanding the transportation organization, and actively making the railways strong. All units and domains of the national economy should vigorously launch the campaign for the struggle for production and conservation as an all-people movement. By so doing, they should effectively use existing labor, facilities, and equipment, and should fully mobilize inner reserves and increase production. All the economic guidance officials must carry out economic organizational work and production management to comply with the party's economic strategies, have the popular masses display their revolutionary enthusiasm and positive creativity, and, thus overfull the people's economic plan for this year. Contributing to socialist construction with scientific knowledge and technology is our intellectuals' honorable duty. In hearty response to the party's policy on cultural revolution, intellectuals must devotedly wage the struggle to achieve new development in science, education, culture and arts, public health, and all other fields of socialist cultural construction. This year we must also cope with the enemy's war provocation maneuvers and make proper efforts to strengthen the country's defense capability. We must firmly prepare ourselves politically, ideologically, militarily, and materially so that we may confidently cope with any unexpected development, and thoroughly establish the environment in the entire society of regarding military affairs [kunsa] as important and actively assisting the People's Army. [applause] To vigorously push ahead with revolution and construction under today's circumstances, we must strongly adhere to our party's policy on ideological revolution, further strengthen single-minded unity in the revolutionary ranks, and highly demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. Single-minded unity and self-reliance are the immortal, honorable traditions of our revolution and the banners of victory. [applause] We have opened the road of brilliant victory after overcoming stern trials with the might of single-minded unity and made great progress in revolution and construction while overcoming all difficulties with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. When all the people fight vigorously by being single-mindedly united around the party and the leader [suryong] and highly demonstrating the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle, can we defend and maintain the socialism of our own style and boundlessly glorify it and victoriously complete the chuche-oriented socialist cause no matter the trial we may face. [applause] We must defend single-minded unity in our revolutionary ranks, which has been consolidated like a rock under our party's leadership, as the most precious and further consolidate and develop it. We must break through difficulties at hand and score new upsurges in socialist construction by more highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle. "Let us vigorously accelerate the grand socialist onward march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle!" This is the call of our party today and a militant slogan that our people must uphold. [applause] In hearty response to the party's militant call, all the officials, party members, and workers must continue their innovation and advance in the spirit of Chollima spurred on by the speed of the nineties and, thus, make the New Year, 1994, a historic year of turns in revolution and construction in our country. [applause] The fatherland's reunification is a foremost national task to our people that cannot be delayed even for a moment. We must achieve the cause of the fatherland's reunification at the earliest possible date, and thus, fulfill all the fellow countrymen's unanimous earnest desire and hand the reunified fatherland over to the posterity. [applause] Our party and the Republic Government put forward the 10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for reunification of the country in a bid to lay a foundation for national reunification through the united national strength last year and has made all efforts to realize the 10-point program. Our 10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for reunification of the country reflects the 70 million fellow countrymen's noble desire to firmly unite all people as one by transcending the difference in ideology, ideas, and systems and to achieve the reunification and prosperity of our nation who has the long history of half a century. We wanted the South Korean authorities to come out to the road of reconciliation and cooperation by responding to our 10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for reunification of the country. We also took the important measure for exchanging special envoys of the two sides' top leaders. However, the South Korean authorities have ignored our magnanimous proposals and all the people's desire for reunification. They have taken the road of depending upon foreign forces, not the road of national independence; they have taken the road to the North-South confrontation, not the road to national unity. While frequently conducting large-scale military exercises against our Republic, in collusion with outside forces and talking about military countermeasures [kunsajok taeung] or an international cooperation system under the pretext of our nuclear issue, the South Korean authorities are leading North-South relations to a dangerous phase. The so-called South Korean civilian regime is only so in appearance [houl ppunida], and is actually not different from the preceding military dictatorial regime. Anticommunist and fascist evil laws have remained as they are in South Korea. The South Korean people's desire for independence, democracy, and national reunification have not been realized. The South Korean people and figures of all strata are saying that they no longer have any further expectations of the current South Korean regime. This is natural. If I speak of our nuclear issue, which the United States and its followers are babbling about, it is because of the antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuver which the United States has persistently sought. It is the United States that raised the nonexistent nuclear issue and brought the nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula in actuality, thus threatening us. Therefore, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be resolved through DPRK-U.S. talks. Pressure and threat cannot work on us. If the United States adheres to such methods, it cannot resolve the issue and may drive the situation to a catastrophe [paguk]. The United States should look straight at all facts and act with discretion. Under the circumstances in which the DPRK-U.S. joint statement was adopted, if the two sides abide by and implement the principles which were already reached, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can be impartially resolved. There is no change in the principle and line of our party and the Republic Government for national reunification. We will make all efforts to achieve the national reunification by means of a confederation based on one nation, one state, two systems, and two governments according to the three-point principles of independence, peaceful reunification, and the great national unity. The destiny of the fatherland is the destiny of the nation and the destiny of all our compatriots at home and abroad. All the Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas should be united and wage a pannational struggle under the banner of great unity of the whole nation in order to open a new phase for national reunification this year. [applause] Although the imperialists are raving about the end of socialism in the international arena, indulging in bravado and bluster, they cannot block the people's aspiration for independence and socialism, nor can they reverse the trend of history. If the world's progressive people strengthen unity and solidarity under the anti-imperialist banner for independence and actively push forward the trend of history, they will certainly expedite mankind's bright future. [applause] Our party and the government of the Republic will consistently implement the external policy of independence, peace, and friendship in conformity with the demand of the present situation. We will make active efforts to maintain unity with socialist and nonaligned countries on the principle of independence. We will also develop good neighborly and friendly relations with capitalist countries which respect our country's sovereignty. [applause] The government of our Republic will destroy the old international political and economic order of domination and subjugation, establish new international political and economic order based on equality, justice, and fairness, and make active efforts to develop South-South cooperation on the principle of collective self-reliance. Our people's struggle today is arduous, but it is an honorable and sacred struggle for the growth and prosperity of our fatherland and for the future of mankind. Ever-victorious are our people who struggle for the just cause under the great party's leadership. [applause] Let us all firmly unite around the party Central Committee under the banner of the chuche idea and wage a vigorous struggle to win new victory in socialist construction and to expedite the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. [applause]
