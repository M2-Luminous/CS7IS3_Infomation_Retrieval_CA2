FBIS TRENDS-22APR94-PALESTINIANS PLO, Fundamentalists Hint At Agreement PLO, Fundamentalists Hint At Agreement SUMMARY Recent statements from both mainstream Palestinian sources and representatives of Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist organizations opposed to the peace process suggest that the PLO and at least some fundamentalist groups in the occupied territories have reached an understanding on their future relations under the proposed Palestinian authority to be established according to the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles (DOP). Both the details of their agreement and how widely accepted it will be among fundamentalists remain unclear. However, any reported cooperation between the PLO and fundamentalist groups associated with terrorism--especially in the aftermath of recent Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israelis--is bound to heighten Israeli doubts about the PLO's willingness and ability to control potential terrorist activities once an autonomy regime is in place. END SUMMARY Mainstream Palestinian sources have all but explicitly acknowledged that some sort of PLO-fundamentalist agreement has been reached. For example: --Orient House in Jerusalem, the de facto mainstream Palestinian headquarters in the occupied territories, released a statement on 18 April rejecting Israeli admonitions about reported contacts between the PLO and Palestinian fundamentalists. Israeli warnings "relating to coordination between Palestinians who support and oppose the peace process," the statement said, "are considered Israeli interference in Palestinian internal affairs." The statement added that the PLO "has every right to strengthen and enhance relations and ties between various sectors of the Palestinian people regardless of their political and religious affiliations" (Jerusalem Al-Quds, 19 April). --The daily Al-Quds on 18 April cited Dhiyab al-Lawh, identified as head of the Fatah media and educational department in Gaza, as saying that the relationship between Fatah and Hamas is "strategic and crucial." The paper also quoted al-Lawh as dismissing Israeli warnings against PLO-fundamentalist coordination, saying that "when we coordinate with Hamas we do not take into account what the Israelis say." For their part, fundamentalist sources have been more ambiguous and in some instances have even denied the existence of any PLO- fundamentalist agreement. Even the denials, however, have implicitly indicated the conclusion of at least an informal understanding. For example: --Al-Quds on 18 April cited Hamas official Mahmud al-Zahhar as denying that any agreement had been signed between Fatah and Hamas. Nonetheless, al-Zahhar reportedly added that relations between the two organizations are "normal" and that "the meetings between the two sides are merely aimed at resolving some outstanding problems." --The Jordanian daily Al-Ra'y on 15 April cited a previous statement by al-Zahhar calling for a "comprehensive dialogue among the Palestinian forces in order to prevent internal conflict." As reported by Al-Ra'y, al-Zahhar denied that "coordination between Hamas and the PLO leadership had begun" but added cryptically that "some parties to the Oslo agreement" are "trying to give the impression through press statements on these meetings that there was some sort of political flirtation going on between parties that support and parties that oppose the present settlement." A further hint of a PLO-fundamentalist understanding came in an unusual report by the mainstream PLO radio Voice of Palestine (VOP) in Algiers on 14 April. The report cited a statement by Abu-'Abdallah Fa'iz al-'Aswad, identified as a spokesman for the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine--Al-Aqsa battalions, one of several shadowy fundamentalist factions in the territories and thus heretofore presumably opposed to the DOP. As reported by VOP, al-'Aswad made no reference to an agreement with the PLO but adopted current PLO rhetoric on the peace process, vehemently denouncing Israel but also implicitly lining up behind the DOP. The statement charged that "Israel's prevarication and refusal . . . to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho" by 13 April constitutes "a blatant breach and a scandalous, open violation of the bases of the DOP." VOP went on to quote al-'Aswad as adding that "the Rabin government will be responsible for the developments which will result from the non- implementation of the mechanisms of the DOP." What Kind of Agreement? If, indeed, representatives of the PLO and some fundamentalist organizations have reached an agreement, they have not given any direct account of its content. Nonetheless, recent statements from both sides suggest an arrangement by which fundamentalists will refrain from direct challenges to the anticipated Palestinian autonomy regime in Gaza and Jericho while the PLO will tacitly acquiesce in fundamentalist-inspired violence against Israeli targets outside the territorial authority of the autonomy regime. Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah repudiated Yasir 'Arafat's cautious condemnation of recent terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians, for which Hamas has claimed credit, but also indicated that Hamas might be willing to limit its future anti-Israeli operations. Hamas, he said, believes in the principle of "reciprocal treatment," and he specified that if Israel "stops killing [Palestinian] women and children . . . Hamas will then commit itself to attacking only soldiers and settlers" (London Al-Hayah, 14 April). Two items appearing in the 19-25 April issue of Al-Sabil, a new Jordanian weekly apparently having close ties to Islamist circles in Jordan, went further in implying a willingness by Hamas to accept limited cooperation with the PLO and, in principle, an eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. --Referring to the current peace process, Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the Hamas political bureau, said in an interview that "part of the Palestinian people chose another path for reasons with which we differ," but pledged that internal Palestinian disagreements "will not affect the Palestinian people's resistance of occupation." Predicting failure for the current Israel-PLO negotiations, he vowed that Hamas "will continue its jihad [against Israel] but that "we will not transfer the conflict to the Palestinian arena and will continue to deal with this conflict as sons of the Palestinian people regardless of differences of opinion." Asked about Hamas' attitude toward the proposed autonomy regime in Gaza and Jericho, Abu-Marzuq answered that Hamas "will certainly not deal . . . positively" with the regime and "will not participate in building institutions that do not serve the Palestinian people," but he also said that "we will . . . continue to be an active element in all areas of life, including education, economy, and services, whether inside or outside the framework of autonomy." --A statement by the Hamas political bureau lavishly praised recent terrorist attacks against Israeli targets and also denounced "disgraceful PLO concessions" and the "humiliating surrender by the PLO leadership and capitulation to the Zionist and American terms." Nonetheless, the statement also clearly implied a willingness in principle to limit future attacks and to accept Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Recent attacks in Israel, the statement said, are not "a constant policy" of Hamas but rather "an exception dictated by the enemy government," that is, by Israeli attacks against Palestinians. Hamas, the statement went on, "is prepared to reconsider this exception," provided that Israel "stops killing unarmed civilians." The statement explicitly rejected the DOP but said that "Hamas is not averse to the principle of peace," and specified that a peaceful settlement is possible based upon "a full Zionist withdrawal from our Palestinian land and the dismantlement and removal of the settlements," as well as "free and fair general elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in which our people would choose their representatives and leaders," a position consistent with current declared PLO demands. Predictably, mainstream PLO sources have denied any intention to condone terrorism, but at least one recent PLO radio commentary raised doubts about the extent of the PLO's commitment. --In an interview with Qol Yisra'el radio, Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, identified as a Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip, acknowledged "serious differences" between Fatah and Hamas but said that "both parties are not interested in a head-on collision between the two on the ground." Anticipating the establishment of the Palestinian autonomy regime, Abu-Zayidah said that fundamentalists "know they will have to go along with the new situation, and discuss their incorporation in it," and vowed that Palestinian autonomy authorities will not allow terrorist operations to be mounted from within their jurisdiction. "We will have our laws," he said, "and it is clear that Hamas and PLO members will be arrested if they violate them." Specifically, he said "there is no cooperation on terror" between mainstream PLO leaders and Hamas and he denied that the PLO had agreed to continued Hamas attacks inside Israel following the establishment of autonomy (17 April). --A commentary broadcast by VOP on 14 April, however, denounced the continued presence of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and, without referring explicitly to recent Hamas attacks in Israel, said that "the violence that is now continuing is natural and will remain so" due to "official Israeli violence" and "the violence of the settlers towards the West Bank and the Gaza Strip." VOP added that "nobody supports terrorism" but that it is "unacceptable" for Palestinians to "remain subjected to terrorism and the experiments of violence and racism carried out against them." It is also "unacceptable," VOP argued, "to expect [Palestinians] to remain silent and calm," and the commentary asserted that "our people have the right to resist." Background: PLO-Fundamentalist Relations Since the DOP The apparent understanding between the PLO and some fundamentalist elements appears to go beyond a previous agreement between Fatah and Hamas at the time of the DOP in September 1993, in which the two sides reportedly agreed not to engage in violent clashes notwithstanding their disagreement over negotiations with Israel. Statements by fundamentalist leaders since that time had generally reaffirmed a commitment to avoid intra-Palestinian violence but given little indication of any flexibility concerning negotiations with Israel or the DOP. --Interviewed by the Tehran daily Jomhuri-Ye Eslami during the visit to Iran by a Hamas delegation in late 1993, Abu-Marzuq indicated continued refusal to accept the existence of Israel and implicitly accused 'Arafat of treason. "Our struggles will continue," he said, "until Palestine is liberated," and he voiced hope that the DOP would collapse and "that unity will be achieved among all the mujahidin, and that the plan to liberate Palestine will materialize." Referring to 'Arafat, Abu-Marzuq said that "someone who implements the enemy's plans is himself an enemy" (4 December 1993). --Discussing the same visit, Ghawshah said in an interview that Iran and Hamas held similar views on "the plot of the Gaza- Jericho accord and the plot of peace and normalization which the Zionists and the Americans are trying to impose on our nation." While reiterating that Hamas "rejected intra-Palestinian fighting" and affirming in principle that anti-Israeli violence could cease, he did so in a manner that seemed to imply that Hamas would accept nothing less than the dissolution of the State of Israel. As an example, Ghawshah said that "if the Jews withdraw completely from the Gaza Strip, the intifadah operations in the Strip will completely cease," but he added that "jihad operations [elsewhere] will not cease because the Jews would then continue to exist in other parts of Palestine" (Amman Sawt Al- Sha'b, 21 December 1993). For their part, while mainstream PLO sources have occasionally referred favorably to fundamentalist factions in the context of appeals for Palestinian unity, their general approach to both fundamentalist and other rejectionist factions since the DOP had been characterized by a mixture of ridicule and exhortations to support the mainstream leadership. For example: --A commentary broadcast by VOP in Yemen on 13 January ridiculed rejectionist factions, including Hamas by name, in reference to a rejectionist statement condemning the DOP. Calling the statement "ridiculous," "pathetic," "a farce," and "a disaster," VOP said that it has "nothing to do with the age in which we are living" and that "it is anybody's guess from which wornout, exhausted political literature the words of this statement have been dug." --Addressing "opposition factions," including Hamas, a VOP Yemen commentary on 25 January said that "by now, the Palestinian opposition factions must have realized . . . that the PLO-Israel DOP is an established fact." "Speaking about foiling the agreement," the commentary argued, "is no more than talk meant to justify avoiding the battle waged by the Palestinian people now to establish their national entity." The Palestinian public, the commentary asserted, "wants the [opposition] factions to gear their national resistance capabilities toward development by adopting a practical approach for action, and not by escape." While embracing rejectionists as "part of our national struggle and entity," the commentary warned that they should not "establish their existence on an illusory island." --On 5 March, Voice of the PLO (VPLO) in Baghdad criticized the rejectionist reaction to the Hebron massacre. Apparently alluding in particular to fundamentalist groups by adopting Islamic phraseology, VPLO said that "they are vowing three times to divorce the peace option" but that "they are solidifying like fossils inside [their] slogans." Such factions, VPLO charged, cannot stand the peace option" but "they have no alternative." Claiming that "the Palestinian people have never abandoned their unity under the PLO banner," the commentary called on "the short- sighted ones" to "understand and desist." Israeli Warnings Clearly alarmed by reports of a PLO-Hamas agreement, Israeli leaders have warned that any such arrangement that included approval of terrorist attacks against Israel would scuttle the DOP. For example, in a speech to the Knesset on 18 April, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that "any agreement or understanding between the PLO and Hamas on continued Hamas terror with the PLO's approval will preclude any possibility of agreement between Israel and the PLO (Israel TV). Moreover, while the action may not be directly related to the reported agreement, Israeli authorities have in the last several days launched a major new crackdown against Hamas, including the detention of 362 alleged Hamas supporters in the Gaza Strip through 19 April (Qol Yisra'el radio, 20 April). Referring to the operation, Rabin vowed that "we will fight those who continue terror with all the means that are available to us," subject only to limitations imposed by law (Qol Yisra'el radio, 19 April). Implications The apparent agreement between the PLO and some fundamentalist elements, even if it holds up, does not mark an end to their rivalry, but rather a calculation on the part of both sides as to where their respective immediate interests lie as implementation of the Gaza-Jericho formula approaches. For the PLO, the arrangement allows the organization to pursue its primary agenda, that is, establishing its authority in the territories under the DOP, while fending off both Israeli and U.S. pressure to categorically renounce terrorism on the one hand and popular Palestinian anger over the recent escalation of Israeli- Palestinian violence on the other. For fundamentalists, the accord presumably reflects a conclusion that the establishment of a PLO-dominated autonomy regime is inevitable and that fundamentalists will have to reach a modus vivendi with it or risk losing influence among the broader Palestinian public. PLO leaders may regard the continuation of some anti-Israel violence outside their immediate territorial jurisdiction as working to their advantage, providing they cannot be directly linked to it. Should it be able to maintain order within the Gaza-Jericho region, the PLO would doubtless point to the contrast between tranquility under its authority and turmoil in remaining Israeli-administered areas as evidence supporting its demand for full Israeli withdrawal from the territories. Moreover, PLO leaders would probably be privately content to see militant fundamentalists on the receiving end of harsh Israeli countermeasures and therefore unable to oppose the PLO as effectively. Were the PLO to openly endorse fundamentalist terror attacks, Prime Minister Rabin would probably have no choice but to make good on his threat to abandon negotiations. However, given that the PLO is unlikely to renounce its official rejection of terrorism, Rabin seems more likely to continue on his current course of pursuing negotiations under the DOP while exerting maximum pressure on violent rejectionist factions.
