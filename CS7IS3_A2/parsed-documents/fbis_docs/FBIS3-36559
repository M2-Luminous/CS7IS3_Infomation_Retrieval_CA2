His fate is still unknown -- this is the beginning of the appeal by Ukraine's People's Rukh to citizens. The steady political pressure exerted upon Rukh, the information blockade imposed by the authorities, the pogroms in the buildings of local Rukh organizations, and the use of force against its activists during the election campaign have become systematic. As is known, the activity of political parties and public organizations has no financial backing from the state. The law "On Associations of Citizens" prevents political organizations from engaging in political activity. Nor do they have the right to receive material support from their foreign supporters. Therefore, the parties may only act effectively if they get assistance from collective or individual sponsors in Ukraine, those who want to support a political force that will defend their interests. The offensive against those who have rendered assistance, no matter how small, to Rukh, is an attempt to deprive our organization of support during the election campaign. People's Rukh consistently pursues a policy of building a democracy in the independent Ukrainian state and of reforms that will guarantee the well-being of the people. It actively opposes the present corrupt authorities and promotes equality of all citizens before the law. If we win the elections, we will form a government that will enjoy the confidence of the people. We are ready to take upon ourselves the responsibility for the fate of our state. This is what our opponents in the party in power particularly fear. They have decided to leave Ukraine's People's Rukh without means of subsistence. We appeal to you, dear friends, to support Ukraine's People's Rukh. We appeal to all those who strive for effective reforms in the economy, want positive changes in society, and associate these hopes with the People's Rukh. Your support is the pledge of our common victory.
