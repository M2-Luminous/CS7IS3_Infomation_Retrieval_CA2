He addressed a session of the NATO Council devoted to the adoption of documents regulating relations between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance. Kozyrev pointed out that the preparation of a programme of broad cooperation between NATO and Russia has begun on the basis of proposals earlier submitted by Russia. A special protocol says that this will be a programme, meeting the dimensions and significance of Russia's potential. "An agreement has been reached on a broad, deep dialogue and cooperation in areas where Russia is capable of making a unique and important contribution which conforms to Russia's prestige and responsibility as the biggest European, world and nuclear state," Kozyrev said. Accepting NATO's proposals, Russia is officially joining the Partnership for Peace initiative. Taking part in its realisation as equal partners are both states which were adversaries in the period of cold war, or neutral countries balancing between the two blocs. Such broad participation creates prerequisites for further evolution of the European situation in the direction of strengthening mutual understanding and ensuring an equal level of security for all countries. For all its importance, "the Partnership for Peace" is only one direction for establishing military-political interaction, Kozyrev said. Another direction includes activities along the lines of the Council for North Atlantic Cooperation (NACC), whose potential, in Russia's opinion, should be more actively used, in particular, in its peace-keeping activities. The third direction is the development of a system of bilateral contacts between Russia, NATO and NACC, which will include peace- keeping activities, joint maneuvers, cooperation in conversion. These directions "fit the framework of the common choice in favour of cooperation and the formation of a really single space of security from Vancouver to Vladivostok," Kozyrev said. In conclusion, the Russian foreign minister pointed out that all efforts should pursue a priority goal -- the creation of single Europe. "The key role on the continent is being played and will be played by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). This is where Russia's opinion and the alliance' assessments coincide," Kozyrev said.
