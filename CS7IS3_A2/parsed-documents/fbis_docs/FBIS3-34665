No to Normalization."] [Excerpts] Talk has recently intensified about normalizing ties with the Zionist enemy and ending the Arab boycott. This has happened since the Gaza-Jericho agreement, as if this agreement has abolished all barriers and the Zionist enemy has become an Arab country with which one can deal without restrictions or inhibitions. Some Arab countries might even be eager to deal with the Zionist enemy even though their relations with other Arab countries are not quite all right or are even hostile. We all remember that when President al-Sadat concluded the Camp David Accord with the enemy, this aroused the anger of the other Arab countries and prompted them boycott Egypt, declaring that Camp David was a catastrophe in the full sense of the word because it prevented Egypt from confronting and fighting the enemy and at the same time rendered the remaining Arab countries unable, even combined, to fight the enemy without Egypt. [passage omitted] What has befallen some Arab countries to make them now alter their attitude? We now see some of them preparing to abolish the boycott and normalize ties with the Zionist enemy, although the latter has not changed its hostile designs, particularly its goal of establishing an Israel extending from the Nile to the Euphrates. Neither has the enemy stopped oppressing the Palestinians -- killing them, driving them from their country, demolishing their homes, and usurping their land. We also see the U.S. commerce secretary visiting several Arab countries, hinting that the boycott has begun to unravel, and calling for its abolition while claiming untruthfully that this will serve the interests of the Arabs. We know that there are three levels of boycott: boycotting the enemy's companies and its products, boycotting foreign companies that have partnerships with the enemy, and finally boycotting foreign companies that deal with the enemy. The current talk is about abolishing the third kind, followed by the second, and finally the first. I hereby declare: We have prior experience of dealing with the Jews. We saw how they were planning to control our trade and economy, how they had a monopoly over several basic commodities, and how they manipulated prices to serve their interests at the public's expense. The Jews have not changed. Shall we now give them another opportunity to control the Arab economies as a prelude to their political and, eventually, military hegemony over us? [passage omitted] The United States is calling for an end to the boycott against its companies that deal with the Zionist enemy because it wants to turn the Arab world into a big market for its products while at the same time ensuring the Zionist enemy remains an industrial base equipped with technological know-how and a sophisticated infrastructure. We see the United States, and the Zionist enemy behind it, claiming that the boycott threatens the prospects of peace. They pretend to forget that the boycott decision was unanimously adopted by the Arab countries in 1950 as an expression of the rightful Arab claim to Palestine and to protect the Arab economy from being infiltrated by the enemy, who opposes Arab economic and industrial progress. The United States pursues its own financial gain, even at the expense of other nations. By assisting the Zionist enemy, it is ignoring the Palestinians' rights, including their right to their land. This causes it to be the target of the hate and hostility of the Islamic nations, because the Palestinian cause is the cause of all Muslims which they will never abandon no matter how long the issue lasts or how many sacrifices are needed. Despite the current cruel pressures and the tyranny of the greedy, U.S. and Zionist hegemony will not last. We tell the Arab countries: Do not abandon the boycott. Do not respond to the pressures. The boycott is a political and economic tool to boost the Arab world's economic growth and protect Arab investment and workers. This boycott has its roots in the depths of Arab patriotic and religious sentiments. It must remain rigidly airtight, impervious to any attempts to smuggle Zionist goods to Arab markets via third countries after changing the labels that attribute them to the Zionist enemy. O Arabs, do not bear the onus of terminating the boycott and the disastrous consequences it will bring to future generations, who will undoubtedly curse you for it. [passage omitted] When he concluded the Camp David Accord, al-Sadat said he wanted to eliminate the hostility and thaw the icy barriers between Egyptians and Jews. However, the Muslim Egyptian people who were angered by the usurpation of Palestine's blessed land rejected this normalization despite the government's attempt to impose it on them in various spheres of activity. Only a few biased opportunists, disloyal to their nation and religion, went along with it. Furthermore the attempted normalization has had several adverse effects: Some Jews have been involved in narcotics and counterfeit currency cases and have attempted to spread AIDS or sow sedition between Muslims and Christians. We ask those who advocate normalization: What will its benefits be? It will bring no benefits; it is entirely bad. Our Arab countries must protect themselves from this evil, which will corrupt our young people, ruin our economy, and spoil all spheres of life. The creed followed by our Muslim people imposes a duty on us: to evict these gangs from Palestine. We must learn that appeasement will enable them to occupy our countries and pursue their quest for a greater Israel extending from the Nile to the Euphrates, and indeed as far as the city of the Prophet [Medina], may God's peace and prayer be with him. Current events increase our pain. The United States, Rabin, and others are putting pressure on Yasir 'Arafat to accept the enemy's conditions to complete this humiliating agreement. 'Arafat believes it will lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Rabin, on the other hand, wants it to be a Jewish colony where Palestinians run the service sector. We recently even heard Yasir 'Arafat saying that he does not want a Palestinian state-- thereby arousing the anger of many around him--but a confederation with Jordan. Additionally, it is not in the Jews' nature to keep promises or covenants. They break them if that is to their benefit. Arabs and Muslims, you must abide by this principle: "Yes to the boycott, no to normalization." You must then work and carry on a jihad to liberate all Palestine from the river to the sea. God will give succor and victory comes only from him. "No" to those who say that the boycott can be ended after peace is attained, for there will be no peace, but surrender and subservience. The Muslims will not submit to the enemies of God and humanity.
