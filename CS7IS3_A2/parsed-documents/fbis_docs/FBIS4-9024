The poll of 1,544 respondents with the right to vote revealed that 37 percent of the electorate were certain they would vote, 34 percent said they probably would, and eight percent said "probably not." Ten percent of those surveyed replied with a "resolute no" and 11 percent had not decided. The higher the level of education, the less frequent was the answer "I do not know" and more frequent the intention to go to the polls, the survey showed. Twenty-eight percent of the electorate would vote Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS), 12 percent Milos Zeman's Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), and 11 percent Deputy Premier Jan Kalvoda's Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA). More than five percent of those polled supported the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) and the Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC). Four percent were in favor of the government coalition Christian Democratic Union- Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL). The Left Bloc (LB), former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier's Free Democrats (SD), the Green Party (SZ), the Farmers' Party (ZS), the government coalition Christian Democratic Party (KDS), and the Czech-Moravian Center Party (CMSS) all received less than four percent. Twenty-three percent of the voters did not know which party they would support. Compared with last month's figures, the ODS has dropped in popularity and the CSSD, the KSCM, and the SPR-RSC strengthened their positions.
