[Aguirre] The United States has given top priority to the drug problem. We need a precise diagnosis of drug trafficking in Paraguay. There is a problem and we need to know how bad it is to be able to implement the appropriate corrective measures. I believe that at present we do not have the diagnosis of the situation that we need. As to the request to allow U.S. troops into Paraguay, I do not believe it has anything to do with drug trafficking. I do not believe the U.S. military is coming to fight drug trafficking in Paraguay. As far as I am concerned, the two issues are not connected because we handle drug trafficking at another level, working with the United States through the National Antidrug Secretariat (Senad). [Cardozo] Then what would be the point of these troops coming to Paraguay? [Aguirre] I believe the United States looks for friendly, safe countries to train their troops. If we bear in mind the role the United States plays in the world, where they deploy and use their Armed Forces to resolve problems, we will realize that there are few places in the world where they can send their soldiers without fear that they might be attacked. [Cardozo] Would our country benefit from the presence of these soldiers? [Aguirre] In addition to what they are promising to build, we also would benefit from being able to watch the deployment of the world's most advanced military technology.
