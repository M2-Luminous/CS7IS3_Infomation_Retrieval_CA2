However, the cabinet must submit the bill to parliament by June 30, Kocarnik added. He said the government had thoroughly discussed the document which anticipated the creation of 13 units which would include units formed on the basis of administrative centers of the former regions (Brno is a chief city of the former South Moravian region) and new districts of Karlovy Vary, Liberec, Pardubice, Jihlava, Olomouc and Zlin. According to the bill, Prague and Central Bohemia would form one unit. There were initially seven regions (five Czech and two Moravian) - Central Bohemia with Prague as a chief city, South Bohemia - Pardubice, West Bohemia - Plzen, North Bohemia - Usti nad Labem, East Bohemia - Hradec Kralove, South Moravia - Brno and North Moravia - Ostrava. The city of Prague was also a region. These regions were abolished in 1991, and 72 districts came into existence instead.
