The source said that, in addition to Syria's criticism of Israel, Damascus blames Washington for its stands. which contradict peace, contrary to what was agreed on during al-Asad-Clinton summit in Geneva last January. The Geneva summit revived hopes for promoting the Middle East peace process but no progress has been realized because of Israel's intransigence and the Zionist lobby's moves in the United States to hamper any effective and pressuring U.S. role. Syria is also of the opinion that the Syrian-Israeli negotiations in Washington last January and February on the level of delegation heads ended without any results worth mentioning because Washington did not bring pressure to bear on Israel. Syria also blames Washington for its failure to denounce Israel after the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, for preventing the Security Council from adopting a resolution on this issue for three weeks, and for the reported pledge by President Clinton to the Zionist organizations upholding unified Jerusalem as capital of the Hebrew state, contrary to UN Security Council Resolution 242 and the policies of the previous U.S. administrations, which refused to recognize the annexation of Arab Jerusalem and insisted on considering it part of the occupied territories. Damascus is equally displeased with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's announcement on his readiness to visit the region but without exercising any pressure on Israel. Moreover, the United States insisted on keeping Syria on the list of states that did not cooperate with it in the field of combating drugs. Asserting that, with all these moves, the U.S. Administration aims to deny Syria any Economic assistance, the Syrian information source reiterated that his country had neither asked nor obtained any such assistance in the past, and that it joined the peace process hoping that Washington would fulfill its pledges and play the role of a full, fair, and just partner. This role has not materialized, however, into tangible results yet, the source said.
