FR940405-2-00046 FR940405-2-00022 [Docket No. CP89&hyph;471&hyph;008] Mobile Bay Pipeline Co.; Petition To Amend March 30, 1994. Take notice that on March 24, 1994, Mobile Bay Pipeline Company (Mobile Bay), 600 Travis Street, P.O. Box 1478, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1478, filed in Docket No. CP89&hyph;471&hyph;008 a petition to amend the orders issued June 25, 1991 and July 23, 1991, as amended, 1 pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act a request to increase the operating pressure of Mobile Bay's pipeline facilities located in the vicinity of Mobile Bay, Alabama, all as more fully set forth in the petition to amend which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 1 Mobile Bay was formerly Gateway Pipeline Company; See 55 FERC ¶61,488 (1991) and 56 FERC ¶61,109 (1991). Mobile Bay requests authority to increase the operating pressure of its system from 800 to 892 psig. Mobile Bay states that this increase in operating pressure will not result in an increase of the pipeline's design capacity. Mobile Bay states that its maximum operating pressure (MOP) was originally based on the assumption that the maximum pressure delivered into Koch Gateway Pipeline Company's (Koch Gateway) system would be 700 psig. Mobile Bay states that, at this time, the MOP of Koch Gateway's transmission line at the Mobile Bay interconnect is 780 psig and that it is necessary for Koch Gateway to operate at 780 psig in order to move the Mobile Bay volumes out of the area. Mobile Bay states that utilizing this pressure as the downstream pressure on Mobile Bay, pressure drop calculations result in 892 psig as the MOP necessary to move Mobile Bay's design capacity of 600 Mmcf of natural gas per day. Mobile Bay states that it is incapable of creating additional pressure above that provided by its sources, that it has no compression facilities on its system and that this filing does not propose to add any facilities. Mobile Bay states that the pressure on the system is dependent upon the discharge pressures of the three processing plants and other connected supply facilities and that it can only restrict, by use of regulation, operating pressure to something less than that provided by its sources. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition to amend should on or before April 20, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Lois D.
