These were spent nuclear fuel components which were being stored in special containers. An inquiry is under way. Unfortunately, neither the command nor naval experts have commented on this. The navy has failed to deal with the issue of building new nuclear waste stores for decades, and the existng stores are already more than full. Nobody in the navy conceals this problem, but the navy is unable to deal with it successfully by itself. This is what our correspondent Vladimir Makarovich was told by Rear-Admiral (Nikolay Irasov), admiral-inspector and head of the nuclear safety inspectorate for nuclear installations of Russia's Ministry of Defense: [Begin recording] Irasov: The main problem is the removal of spent nuclear fuel, because all the spent nuclear fuel stores are virtually crammed full. Stores for fresh nuclear fuel do not meet nuclear safety requirements and there is the problem of ships taken out of combat service, that is, the unloading of active areas. Makarovich: What are the implications of not resolving these matters, not only for the navy, but for the ecological situation in this region? Irasov: There are serious implications, radio-ecological ones, because ships which are left for a long time with radioactive areas not removed could sink. [end recording]
