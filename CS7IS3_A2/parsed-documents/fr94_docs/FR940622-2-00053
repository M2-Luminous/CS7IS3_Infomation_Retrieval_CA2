FR940622-2-00053 FR940622-2-00039 SF 83 Supporting Statement for Requests for OMB Approval Under the Paperwork Reduction Act and 5 CFR 1320 A. Justification 1. Explain the circumstances that make the collection of information necessary. Include the identification of any legal or administrative requirements that necessitate the collection. Congress has appropriated six million dollars for Fiscal Year 1994 for special adjustments to cover the costs of drug-related security measures at selected Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation projects. The statutory authority for special adjustments to Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Contract Rents is in Section 8(c)(2)(B) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 as amended by the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 at Section 542. Section 8(c)(2)(B) states the following: ``Where the Secretary determines that a project assisted under this section is located in a community where drug-related criminal activity is generally prevalent and the project's operating, maintenance, and capital repair expenses have been substantially increased primarily as a result of the prevalence of such drug-related activity, the Secretary may (at the discretion of the Secretary and subject to the availability of appropriations for contract amendments for this purpose), on a project-by-project basis, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly rents, to a level no greater than 120 percent of the project rents, to cover the costs of maintenance, security, capital repairs, and reserves required for the owner to carry out a strategy acceptable to the Secretary for addressing the problem of drug-related criminal activity.'' Form HUD&hyph;52662, Owner Application, Funds for Special Adjustment for Drug-Related Security Retrofitting, Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program, provides for owners of Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation projects to apply for Fiscal Year 1994 funds for special rent adjustments for security. Owner application is voluntary. 2. Indicate how, by whom, and for what purpose the information is to be used and the consequence to Federal program or policy activities if the collection of information was not conducted. The information collected on Form HUD&hyph;52662 is to be used by Housing Agencies administering Moderate Rehabilitation Programs and HUD Field Office staff to evaluate the eligibility and need of project owners applying for the funds for special adjustments for security, and as a basis for assigning funds. If this collection of information was not conducted, the Department would be unable to assign Fiscal Year 1994 funds for special adjustments for security for Moderate Rehabilitation projects. 3. Describe any consideration of the use of improved information technology to reduce burden and any technical or legal obstacles to reducing burden. Form HUD&hyph;52662 will collect information by Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contract Number. Field Office staff will be able to check information on the incoming HUD&hyph;52662 by using the newly available Control Files System (CFS) containing Moderate Rehabilitation HAP Contract information. CFS will reduce the burden to Field Office staff in evaluating the information in the HUD&hyph;52662. 4. Describe efforts to identify duplication. The Department is not collecting this data through any other information collection mechanism. Owners are not asked to provide data of Form HUD&hyph;52662. Owners are not asked to provide data of Form HUD&hyph;52662 that can be obtained from other HUD computerized files. 5. Show specifically why any similar information already available cannot be used or modified for use for the purpose(2) described in # 2. Similar information (description of criminal activity in the neighborhood of the Moderate Rehabilitation project; impact of the drug-related criminal activity on the project's operating, maintenance and capital repair expenses; owner's strategy to address the problem of drug-related criminal activity; and security items needed) is not already available from other sources. 6. If the collection of information involves small businesses or other small entities, describe the methods used to minimize burden. The collection of information may involve small businesses of other small entities that own Moderate Rehabilitation projects. These entities are under no obligation to complete the application, and will do so on a voluntary basis if they believe they can benefit from the funds. Form HUD&hyph;52662 takes no more than three hours for an owner to complete. 7. Describe the consequence to Federal program or policy activities if the collection were conducted less frequently.
