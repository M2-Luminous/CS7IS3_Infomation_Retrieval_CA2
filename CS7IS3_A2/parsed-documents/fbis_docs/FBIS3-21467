Do labor tensions really need ratcheting up another notch? It is very possible our readers will not find their newspaper in the kiosks this Tuesday, and no one knows how long the strike at SIA [Algiers Printing Company], which prints LIBERTE and other dailies, will last. Beginning tonight at midnight, service-station franchise operators are also going to shut down for a week, and smart motorists will fill up their tanks before noon. First no gasoline, now no newspapers, unless something can be worked out today. In short, the labor situation is deteriorating, if not quite yet calamitous. The issue at SIA is not really new. The bone of contention is implementation of a new wage schedule approved by the company's board of directors but apparently blocked by high-level intervention, probably by the Labor Ministry. SIA's management is trying to work things out, but the SIA union local is determined to follow through on its threat to strike, which it temporarily suspended on 16 February. The accord reached by labor and management was reviewed by the ministry on 17 January and seemed well on its way to implementation, since it took into account among other things the financial condition of the enterprise (which was good) and the sound measures enacted by SIA management. Unless the authorities concerned take dramatic action, the presses may quit rolling, as of tomorrow. The other dispute, involving service-station franchise operators, actually erupted several months ago. It hinges basically on the low-profit margins forced on them by current fuel prices. The franchise operators, affiliates of the National Union of Merchants (UGCAA), are incensed not only at the refusal of the relevant authorities--in this instance, NAFTAL [National Enterprise for Refining and Distributing Petroleum Products]--to seriously discuss the issue, but also concerned about a much more fundamental problem. The operators have long demanded the right to run their businesses freely to maximize profit, something NAFTAL does not want to hear. An employers' organization, the CNPA [National Confederation of Algerian Patronat], has just thrown its support to the strike, which could seriously inflame labor tensions already aggravated by the unprecedented high cost of living. Labor tension can also be found in other sectors. Our colleagues in the Photographic Agency (API), who have not been paid in months, yesterday went on an indefinite hunger strike, imploring the tutelary ministry to pay some attention to their plight and that of their families. Finally, talks have broken down between labor and management at the state-owned Major Petroleum Projects Enterprise (GTP). A meeting scheduled for today is expected to determine whether the strike will be postponed, or possibly canceled if the essential demands of workers in this important oil company are met. The basic thread that runs through all these conflicts is always the same--to wit, that people are no longer as easily bought off with "promises" as they were in the bygone era of the one-party state. Even more important, the terms "dialogue" and "concertation" have become so debased that they now sound hollow and no longer seem to mean anything to the decisionmakers. It is a pity! Franchise Operators Tomorrow's service-station strike, announced Saturday by the General Union of Algerian Merchants and Artisans (UGCAA), will not be observed by service-station franchise operators, Mr. Omar Gaya, president of the Association of Service Station Franchise Operators, told APS. "In principle, we are not against the strike," said Mr. Gaya, noting however that, "this is hardly the time to launch such a strike" before adding that, "we have not been involved in this decision to stage a 7-day strike."
