The Australian Foreign Ministry is paying attention to the fact that North Korea has contacted Australia while the DPRK's discussions with the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are coming to their final stages. Australia and North Korea established diplomatic ties in 1974. Relations between the two countries were ruptured because North Korea had one-sidedly closed its embassy in Australia and deported Australian diplomats from North Korea. According to an Australian Foreign Ministry spokesman and diplomatic sources in Australia, North Korea took the initiative in contacting Australia and high-level diplomats of both countries held meetings at Australian embassies in Bangkok and Jakarta between late last month and early this month. In the meetings, it is said that North Korea called for normalization of diplomatic ties and that Australia, as a condition for normalizing diplomatic ties, demanded that North Korea accept nuclear inspections by an international organization and that it promote discussions with the United States and the ROK. Australia says it informed Japan, the United States and the ROK about details of the meetings. In the past, Australia and North Korea promoted partial diplomatic exchanges in Beijing and other places.
