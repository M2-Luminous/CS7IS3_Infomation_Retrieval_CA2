Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that Minister Peres in his talks with Yasir 'Arafat in Romania received the impression that if the agreement is not signed within two weeks, then, in his words, the whole thing will be a dead letter. Mr. Peres believes that the detailed negotiations on security should be finalized, the agreement signed, and the remaining issues worked out later. Mr. Rabin, on the other hand, believes that before the agreement is signed, issues touching on sovereignty, such as currency, stamps, and telephone dialing areas, should also be worked out. Environment Minister Yosi Sarid said there is no dispute between Rabin and Peres. Minister Tzaban said the differences refer to the niceties, and Police Minister Shahal believes that the issue is a matter of different perspectives. He believes the full cabinet must be involved in the deliberations. Under the draft agreement Peres brought back from Romania, there will be a Peres-'Arafat meeting in Cairo on Thursday [28 April] in order to prepare a meeting between the Prime Minister Rabin and 'Arafat next week. The only issues which will remain unresolved at the Rabin-'Arafat will be the size of the Jericho area and the location of the Palestinian policeman deployed on the Jordan River bridge.
