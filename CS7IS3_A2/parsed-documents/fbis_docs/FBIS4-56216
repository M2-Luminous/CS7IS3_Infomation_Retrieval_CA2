FBIS4-56216 "drlat084_a_94020" FBIS-LAT-94-084 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Callers Criticize Attacks Callers Criticize Attacks FL2904143194 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1155 GMT 29 Apr 94 FL2904143194 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Radio Rebelde answering machine calls with host Roberto Cavada -- passages within quotation marks are recorded] [Text] [Cavada] I have a caller in connection with the Miami far right attacks against Lawyer Magda Montiel. Good morning. [First unidentified speaker] Good morning, Cavada. I wish the Miami people were listening to Radio Rebelde right now to tell them that the Cuban people are very proud to have welcomed Mrs. Montiel to Cuba. She is an honorable woman and she is demonstrating right now the character of Cuban women such as Mariana Grajales. She is righteous, and will not let anyone intimidate her. Something else. I want to tell [Tomas Garcia] Fuste and that fat, bald, and blabber-mouth Angelito [Martin] guy, both of whom had Fidel dead and buried, that even if that were to happen and if our commander in chief was dead, we would be the first ones who would not let the likes of them set foot in Cuba. They are fascists, and so filled with hate that they will never be able to live side by side with the Cuban people. We seek love. We do not seek the hate that permeates them. They even say obscenities and insult people on the radio. They are a bunch of old bags that ought to keep quiet and yet they babble a lot. The Cuban people have to support Magda Montiel, have to support her so as to let the Miami lot know that we support all those who came here seeking peace and love among Cubans. That ought to be stressed day in and day out, Cubans ought to call the radio so they can see that we are not the bad guys, they are. [Cavada] Thank you very much. Next, I have several more calls to the answering machine. Good morning. [Second unidentified speaker] "Good morning and thank you very much for this opportunity. Why does this Cuban lawyer there -- where human rights, liberty, and freedom of the press, speech, and movement are so touted -- not present a report to the Human Rights Commission explaining this problem? They say that here we violate every human right, yet: What are they doing right now? Do they not say that there is a lot of freedom, and that everything is free there. Well, they should also go before those dubious human rights commissions." [Perez] "Good morning. My name is Ana Perez from Cerro Boulevard. I want to give my opinion regarding the interview with the journalist [as heard] who visited Cuba. I believe that those who are doing this in Miami are not even Cubans. I have relatives in Miami. And I believe that my relatives's dearest hope is to be able to come to Cuba and live together with us again. I do not believe these people are even Cubans, but two-bit politicians that want to live off politics and corruption. I have visited Miami and seen it on the television. I believe these people are not even Cubans nor love Cuba. They are shameless people. There is no need to be attacking anyone there, in addition to everything they do everyday. I think that what they are doing is abhorrent. Coming to Cuba is no crime."
