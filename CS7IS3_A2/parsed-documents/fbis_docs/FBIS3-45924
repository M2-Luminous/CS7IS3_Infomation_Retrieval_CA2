"That is, from swelling in numbers and scale, to emphasis on quality and efficiency," Yu Youxian, director of the State Press and Publications Administration, told a national meeting which opened here today. In the past 10-odd years, he said, the number of newspapers and magazines has grown from 1,000 to more than 10,000, and that of publishing houses has exceeded 800. "The speed has exceeded the country's capacity to support them," he said. The situation has caused concern among the public, he said. And the up-coming change will be in line with the emphasis on efficiency in the national economy. He called for insisting on a correct political line in media and publications work. Meanwhile, administrative mandates should be reduced to a minimum and replaced by legal measures. In addition, he said, the sector will be mainly run as an enterprise instead of a government department. Meanwhile, the draft of a press law, China's first, is expected to be speeded up this year, he revealed. And the country will continue its campaign to crack down on illegal publications, including pornographic ones, he said.
