FR940426-1-00003 FR940426-1-00001 In the past year, however, many exporters have begun to move animals by air or sea from the United States to Mexico or Canada. This practice has raised a concern that animals could be moved directly into the interior of these two countries without a final veterinary inspection prior to that movement, thus circumventing the inspection system that helps prevent the exportation of diseased animals or animals that may have been exposed to disease. To determine the disease status of any animals that are moved from the United States other than by land to Mexico or Canada, we are proposing that animals intended for exportation by air or sea to either of these two countries meet the same requirements as animals exported to other foreign countries under §§91.3(a) and (b), 91.14(a), and 91.15(a). We, therefore, are proposing to amend the regulations to limit the exception for animals exported to Mexico or Canada to those animals intended for export to those countries by land. Such exportations would not have to meet the requirements in the above-cited regulations for the reasons already discussed. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This proposed rule would require a final inspection at an export inspection facility at a designated port of embarkation for all animals intended for export to Mexico and Canada by air or sea. Animals intended for export to Mexico and Canada by air or sea would first be inspected by an APHIS representative or an accredited veterinarian in the State of origin. The APHIS representative or an accredited veterinarian would issue an origin health certificate, which an authorized APHIS veterinarian in the State of origin would endorse. At the port of embarkation, the animals would receive a final inspection by an APHIS veterinarian before they would be allowed to leave the United States. The exporter would be charged a user fee ($33.50 an hour plus reimbursable overtime when applicable) for the final inspection as provided in 9 CFR part 130. This inspection could require 6 to 8 hours of work for one or two veterinarians. The total cost of inspection for an air shipment from Miami ranges from about $200 to $600 a shipment. The total cost of inspection for a sea shipment from Hawaii ranges from $1,000 to $2,000 a shipment. These costs are very small compared to the value of the animals being shipped. For example, gilts (young, female pigs or immature sows) may be valued at $500 to $1,000 or more a head, depending upon breed. Heifers (young cows that have not borne calves) may be worth $2,000 a head. One air shipment may contain as many as 240 gilts or 80 heifers. One sea shipment from Hawaii may contain 1,000 to 2,000 heifers. Clearly, the costs of inspection are relatively minor. Moreover, the exporting entities involved generally are not small (defined as having 100 or fewer employees). They are large companies, often with worldwide operations that handle large volumes of traded animals. For example, about 14,000 swine were exported by air from Miami last year, all by a few large companies. There are now only two exporting companies operating out of Hawaii, one of which is a ``small'' entity. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to the Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; (2) No retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) Administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this proposed rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and there are no new requirements. The assigned OMB control number is 0579&hyph;0069. List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 91 Animal diseases, Animal welfare, Exports, Livestock, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation. Accordingly, 9 CFR part 91 would be amended as follows: PART 91_INSPECTION AND HANDLING OF LIVESTOCK FOR EXPORTATION
