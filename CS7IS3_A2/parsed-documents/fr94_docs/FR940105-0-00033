FR940105-0-00033 FR940105-0-00007 As discussed earlier, NGSA suggested pipelines be required to make compliance filings and it submits that these filings include information on the locations at which operationally available information will be provided, the manner of display, and the timeliness of the data. WEV suggests generally that the information provided under the data sets be as current as the pipeline can provide. While pipelines will not be required to make compliance filings to implement this rule, they should provide users with adequate information about the locations at which they are reporting the information and the timeliness of the information, which should be as current as is possible. Since the Commission will have access to the pipelines' EBBs, it can monitor the adequacy of the information pipelines provide. 4. Disclosure of Minimum Conditions Hadson contends the Commission should eliminate the field providing for disclosure of minimum price terms (Data Set I.1, lines 23 and 24). It contends disclosure of this information while the market is open facilitates collusion among releasing shippers to maintain higher prices in a falling market. The Commission will not eliminate this field because it comports with the Commission's policy of providing releasing shippers with the option of having their minimum conditions posted on the EBB. 31 This technical proceeding is not the proper forum to reexamine the Commission's policy in this regard. The Commission notes, however, that, in a free market, sellers can choose to disclose minimum price conditions if they find such disclosure beneficial. For example, stating a minimum price protects against the possibility a deal will fail simply because a buyer submits a bid lower than the minimum price even though it is willing to pay the minimum price if it had known this condition. Moreover, since minimum price terms are public, the Commission can monitor the situation, and eliminate this field, if experience shows it does facilitate collusion. 31 See El Paso Natural Gas Company, 62 FERC Â¶61,311 at 62,999&hyph;4 (1993). Releasing shippers choosing not to post their minimum conditions disclose those conditions only to the pipeline which then uses those conditions in evaluating bids. B. Communication Protocols 1. Electronic Data Interchange The Commission proposed to adopt the recommendation of Working Group 4 by requiring EBB operators 32 to provide for electronic file downloading of the standardized data sets in compliance with ASC X12 EDI standards and an implementation guide to be developed by the Gas*Flow group. 33 ASC X12 standards provides an electronic data submission capability that allows computers to exchange information over communication lines using standardized formats. To facilitate these transfers, the ASC X12 standards provide standardized transaction sets for different types of transactions, such as requests for quotations and responses to such requests. 34 Since the ASC X12 transaction sets provide generic data groups applicable to a range of potential applications, the transaction sets must be customized to individual applications by correlating or ``mapping'' the specific information to an ASC X12 transaction set through an implementation guide. 32 The Commission is adopting Working Group 4's use of the phrase ``EBB operator'' in the protocols. An EBB operator is either a pipeline or a third-party vendor providing EBB services for a pipeline, and pipelines relying on third-party vendors must ensure they comply with these standards. 33 Gas*Flow was organized to promote the acceptance of ASC X12 EDI in the gas industry. It is composed of representatives from the gas industry, including local distribution companies, marketers, producers, shippers, and pipelines, and operates under guidance from the Natural Gas Review Committee. 34 Because the ASC X12 transaction sets have been standardized, commercial software and consulting services are available to assist users in translating data from standard program files to the standardized ASC X12 formats and vice versa. The Commission anticipated Gas*Flow would be able to receive industry input and submit a final implementation guide to the Commission within a month after promulgation of the final data sets. The Commission also proposed to require file downloads in a flat ASCII format in accordance with documentation developed by Gas*Flow, but requested comments on whether requiring downloads in ASCII format was needed to supplement the downloads in ASC X12 format. 35 35 The flat ASCII files also could be transmitted electronically over communication lines. a. ASC X12. A few comments address the proposed implementation date for ASC X12. Tenneco asserts the April 1, 1994 implementation date should not include EDI compliance, because EDI should be implemented only when trading partners agree. AER/MRT suggest the date is too ambitious for ASC X12 implementation. PEC Pipeline Group maintains ANSI must approve the implementation guide developed by Gas*Flow and asserts obtaining this approval could affect the timing of ASC X12 implementation as well as the commitment of ASC X12 software vendors to guarantee the use of their software with these data sets. Despite these concerns, PEC Pipeline Group is willing to go forward and implement ASC X12 based on Gas*Flow's recommendations.
