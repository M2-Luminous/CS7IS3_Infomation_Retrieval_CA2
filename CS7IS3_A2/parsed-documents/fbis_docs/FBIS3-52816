Musa said the Damascus Declaration foreign ministers will discuss the situation in the Middle East in light of developments in the peace process and the tense situation in other areas of the region. The conferees will also discuss economic cooperation in the Middle East, follow up on the declaration's contents, and hold consultations on various issues in the region. Commenting on the Syrian-U.S. summit scheduled to be held in Geneva in mid-January, Musa said that Egypt believes that this summit is especially important because it concerns the Syrian-Israeli track, a primary track in the peace process. He added that the issue of land for peace will be discussed specifically and decisively at this summit, noting that the land in question is the Golan Heights, which was occupied in 1967. The summit will also include a discussion on the concept of peace, making the meeting an important landmark in the peace process. Musa noted that the U.S. role is fundamental because the United States is the main sponsor of the peace process, which it launched in Madrid. He said that this process is based on several guarantees and rules governed by the principle of land for peace, and therefore the U.S. role is fundamental. Musa said Egypt attaches special importance to this summit and fully supports it. He added that President Husni Mubarak discussed this summit during his contacts with the various parties involved in the peace process.
