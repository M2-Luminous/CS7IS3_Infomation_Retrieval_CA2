FR941130-0-00036 FR941130-0-00003 A few commenters thought that depositors should be able to vote on whether a stand-alone or merger conversion would be in the best interest of the association. Several commenters stated that the board of directors should decide whether to undertake a merger conversion based on their business judgment. Two commenters thought that for a merger conversion to be approved, an institution would have to document specific business, economic and fiscal reasons and be required to demonstrate that the transaction would provide opportunities for customers and depositors to participate in the institution's value. Another commenter stated that the prohibition punishes forward-thinking thrift managers and further endangers the health of the industry by closing off avenues for generating capital. Another commenter stated that the institution should be free to negotiate the terms of a merger conversion, including reasonable compensation arrangements and purchase discount percentages. Some suggestions regarding the windfall gains and other problems and the valuation issue included: allow subscribers to subscribe to the stock of the acquiring association at a 15% to 20% discount, based on the stock price either at the time of acquisition or at the time the transaction is announced; require the acquiring entity to pay a control premium; assure that value is made available to appropriate constituencies through community foundations, special interest payments on deposits, and/or a special class of preferred stock made available to depositors without cost; make bonus interest payments equal to a certain percentage of principal on all eligible account holder deposits maintained at resulting institution for a specific time period after the acquisition is consummated 20 ; require the acquiror to hold the thrift as a separate subsidiary or be an OTS-regulated institution itself; require all net conversion proceeds to go to the association; allow compensation only to the extent allowed in stand alone conversions; or require a CRA rating of outstanding or satisfactory. 20 The OTS notes that a fundamental premise of the conversion regulations prohibits free distribution schemes in connection with a conversion. See 39 FR 9142 (March 7, 1974). One commenter recommended using a two-step approach, allowing the mutual to enter into a definitive merger conversion agreement prior to doing a stand-alone conversion, disclosing the intended transaction in the stand-alone conversion, and then requiring a 90-day period between completion of the stand-alone conversion and consummation of the merger. Of the approximately ten commenters that supported the prohibition against merger conversions, two did so only until guidelines can be drawn to protect the rights of members of the disappearing association and to prevent insider abuse. One of the ten stated that merger conversions should be prohibited except in cases of undercapitalized institutions or at the discretion of the regulators on a case by case basis. A fourth supporter noted that what is beneficial to the board of directors and insiders may not always be in the best interest of the institution or the community it serves. A fifth supporter stated that depositors are best served by forcing acquiring entities to bid for a converted institution's stock in the open market. A sixth commenter supported the prohibition because of the windfall and valuation problems. Upon review of the comments, the OTS has determined to continue to generally limit merger conversions to cases involving financially weak institutions. Although several commenters made suggestions that attempted to address the concerns raised in the interim final rule, including the valuation problem and accrual of ``windfall gains'' by the acquiror, the OTS remains concerned with the problems raised by merger conversions of healthy institutions.
