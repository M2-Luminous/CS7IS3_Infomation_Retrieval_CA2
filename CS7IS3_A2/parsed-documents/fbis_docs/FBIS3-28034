It fully reveals the wild ambition of the U.S. to expand its sphere of domination in the Asia-Pacific region, says the paper. The Korean people bitterly denounce the U.S. scheme to start the broadcasting and demand its immediate cancellation, the news analyst says, and goes on: The United States is making a gross mistake. It seems to have profited by its false propaganda offensive in disintegrating the socialist countries in East Europe and bringing them back to capitalism. But such propaganda cannot work on Korean-style socialism in which the leader, the party and the masses are united in one mind. The Korean people who are closely united behind the illustrious leader are not shaken by any war provocation manoeuvres, threat, blackmail and pressure nor by any yellow wind. The United States must stop its foolish acts to corrupt and degenerate the Korean people and other people of Asia by base false propaganda and act with discretion.
