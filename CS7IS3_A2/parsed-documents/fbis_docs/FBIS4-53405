Speaking at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on May 16, he said "calls for Japan to play its role in the new era have come from the United Nations." His remarks are a mockery of the unbiased opinion of the international community which has consistently opposed Japan's shameless attempt to obtain a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. Now, Japan is scheming to call back the militarist spectre of the past, crudely violating the UN Charter. All the more grave is the fact that Japan is stepping up its nuclear armament and its conversion into a military power in an effort to carry this criminal scheme into effect. It is only too clear that a war criminal, a nuclear criminal, cannot become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. As the international community opines fairly, Japan has neither justification nor elementary qualification to hold a responsible position in the UN. Japan, a criminal state which unleashed the Second World War, has yet to cleanse her dishonour as an "enemy state" stipulated in the UN charter, and yet to apologize for the crimes it committed against the Korean and other Asian nations in the past and make compensations for the damages. Japan must clearly liquidate her crime-woven past and stop her nuclear armament and moves to become a military power for domination over Asia, instead of impudently coveting for a responsible position in the UN.
