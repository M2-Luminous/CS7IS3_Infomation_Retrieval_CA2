Rexhepi: "Why Lambast Hogg?"] [Text] As we know, Douglas Hogg, secretary of state and the British Foreign Office's number two, paid an official visit to Kosova last week. As the public has been informed at length, he talked here with both the Albanian and Serbian sides about solving the problem of Kosova. Regardless of how this visit was reported and judged, diplomatic circles appreciated it as an important effort by British diplomacy toward solving the serious crisis in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, testing the pulse for possible Albanian-Serbian dialogue for the solution to the question of Kosova, to which international bodies are increasingly committed. However, in spite of this and regardless of the exceptionally serious and complicated nature of the subject under discussion, Serbian propaganda has not even spared this British diplomat abuse and distortion of his statements, for the sake of Serbian policy toward Kosova and the Albanians. This does not surprise anybody, because this is standard practice in the controlled Serbian media. Anti-Albanianism and hatred of Albanian culture and history have become a proof of "professional" standards in the hysterical anti-Albanian competition. As always, the Serbian rulers installed in Kosova have not lagged behind. Simovic, the "local sheriff" [nacallniku i okrugut], warned two days ago that he would call a halt to the activities of what he called "Rugova's party," meaning the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK]. According to him, the reason for this lies in the fact that this party is not registered in Serbia (!). In order to back up this threat that has long been trumpeted by assorted sections of the Serbian establishment, he even misused the high-level British diplomat Douglas Hogg, ascribing to him amazement over "why the LDK is not registered in Serbia and how it can operate without this." How far this canard will run Simovic alone knows. However, regarding the aim of such a threat, the Albanian and international public know very well and have heard many times that it is the Serbian police and judicial system that are doing most to obstruct the work of the LDK, the largest and most influential party in Kosova, and have done since its foundation. The fact that not a day goes by without maltreatment of this party's activists, many of whom are being held in prison, are detained for what are called informative discussions, and are obstructed in their legal political work shows that the LDK is a thorn in the flesh of Great-Serbian circles in Kosova and Serbia. It is for this reason that both the ruling Socialists and the ultranationalists of the Arkan and Seselj kind hold forth against it with the same enthusiasm. Both sides accumulate points among their own electorates with their stands against Kosova and the Albanians and threats toward the LDK, the president of the Republic of Kosova, and the republic's other legitimate representatives. Viewed from this angle, Simovic's statement contains nothing new and would not deserve comment. However, that fact that it was made after the discussions that Hogg held in Kosova once again exposes the reality that the Serbian establishment does not wish to involve the real political forces and the legitimate authorities of the Albanian people in Kosova, led by Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic, in the inevitable Albanian-Serbian talks. For this reason, it is these forces that are most attacked and threatened both by ruling Serbian circles and those who support and assist these circles in the anti-Albanian hysteria. However, despite such a savage campaign against the legitimate representatives of the Albanians in Kosova, Serbian circles have been informed umpteen times, not only by the LDK and the president of Kosova, but by other Albanian political parties in Kosova, that only Kosova's legitimate representatives can decide Kosova's destiny. As we know, this legitimacy was achieved by the will of the people in the first multiparty elections in Kosova two years ago. Thus, beyond this legitimacy and the political will of the people expressed in the referendum of September 1991, nobody has a mandate to decide on Kosova, as Kosova's political parties and legitimate representatives have said many times. However, it seems that from now on this must be said more often and with more insistence.
