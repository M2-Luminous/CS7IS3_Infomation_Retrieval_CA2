FBIS3-48335 "dreas016_a_94040" FBIS-EAS-94-016 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Hitachi, Mitsubishi Agree To Develop Chips OW1901092694 Tokyo KYODO in English 0847 GMT 19 Jan 94 OW1901092694 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said Wednesday [19 January] they have agreed to join forces to develop flash memory chips, tipped as one of the boom semiconductor products of the 1990s. The two Japanese electronics concerns said they will jointly develop a 16-megabit flash memory chip based on Mitsubishi's own technology and a 64-megabit flash memory chip based on Hitachi's own technology. Hitachi and Mitsubishi said SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, the Franco-Italian concern and Europe's second-largest chip producer, is considering joining the Hitachi-Mitsubishi alliance. Mitsubishi now has a business alliance with SGS-Thomson for development of flash memory chips. Unlike many other memory chips, flash memory chips can retain data even when power is shut off and can be erased and reprogrammed in a "flash" with electric charges. Flash memory chips are seen as the key to realizing a new generation of portable products ranging from small computers to digital cameras and faxes. Hitachi and Mitsubishi said their agreement also calls for consolidating their flash memory product lines with a view to taking the lead in setting industry standards as required by users. Company officials said the deal is aimed at sharing the risks and costs involved in the development of a new chip. "The scale of investment needed to match the growth of the semiconductor business and the rapid pace of innovation has become too large for any one company to bear in view of the risks and costs involved," said Shoji Hirabayashi, managing director at Mitsubishi Electric. "This partnership between Hitachi and Mitsubishi in the field of flash memories involves a sharing of resources in the areas of research and development as well as production, and as such is an undertaking of great significance to the future progress and development of each company," said Tsugio Makimoto, executive managing director at Hitachi. The semiconductor industry so far has provided the market with flash memory chips that use two types of cell structure -- nor and nand. Nor-based chips are now the market mainstream and used both by Hitachi and Mitsubishi for their products. The latest agreement covers new types of flash memory technologies -- dinor-type chips developed by Mitsubishi and nand-type ones developed by Hitachi. The dinor flash memory chip is an advanced version of the existing nor-type chip, providing higher integration and single power-source operation at lower voltage as week as shorter access time. [as received] The and flash memory chip has a new cell structure that incorporates the features of nand and dor structures, providing higher integration and single power-source operation at lower voltage as well as small block erasability in units of 512 bytes. Hitachi and Mitsubishi said the dinor and nand chips are expected to become the mainstream technologies for flash memory chips of 16-megabit and largest capacity.
