Those responsible for conducting the investigations will be the National Council for the Control of Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances [CONSEP] and the National Police. Based on these new measures, when the National Police have well-founded records showing that an individual or corporate body is using any entity in the financial system subject to control and surveillance by the Superintendency of Banks to convert or transfer assets from the drug trade, they will request, through the national director of narcotics investigations and Interpol, that the CONSEP executive secretary demand of the financial institution that is apparently being used any data and information required for the investigation. These investigative processes are to be carried out jointly with representatives of the police, the Superintendency of Banks, the National Council for the Control of Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances, and the banking institution, as the case may be. Such inspections will be confidential in nature, and their results must be turned over directly by authorized personnel from the National Directorate of Narcotics Investigations and Interpol to the CONSEP executive secretary or, in his absence, to the legal counsel office director. No other unauthorized person may participate. If the CONSEP executive secretary deems the request made by the national director of narcotics investigations and Interpol for inspections in any bank to be in order, he will officially notify the financial institution's legal representative. The latter will be required to submit directly the data and information detailed in the request prepared by the police. The enjoined institution's legal representative must send the data and information requested by the CONSEP executive secretary directly to that official within a 10-day period. This interval may be extended at the request of the financial entity. The data and information submitted will be confidential in nature. Immediately after the CONSEP executive secretary receives the requested information, he will make it known to the national director of narcotics investigations and Interpol, or to the person authorized by the latter. Final Report The National Directorate of Narcotics Investigations and Interpol will be obliged to send to the CONSEP executive secretary's office and to the Superintendency of Banks a copy of the final report on the investigations conducted. In instances wherein the presence of members of the National Directorate of Narcotics Investigations and Interpol is required in the institution in which the investigation sought by the CONSEP executive secretary is to be made, this fact will be announced to the enjoined institution's legal representative. It will be stated in a message informing him that the investigation is to be conducted and will include the list of personnel who will be visiting the institution. If, at the request of the CONSEP secretary, an agent from the Superintendency of Banks is to participate, that person will attend with written authorization from the superintendent. The data and information obtained by members of the National Directorate of Narcotics Investigations and Interpol will be reported directly to the national director of narcotics investigations and Interpol. They will notify the CONSEP executive secretary that the procedure has been implemented. If one of the institutions subject to control and surveillance by the Superintendency of Banks is suspected of making conversions or transfers of funds to the financial system, the Superintendency of Banks, at its own initiative or at the request of the CONSEP executive secretary, will conduct the pertinent examinations in cooperation with the National Police. They will be based on the parameters stipulated in the General Law on Banks and the other laws governing the subject. The message in which the CONSEP executive secretary notifies the superintendent of banks of the aforementioned suspicion will contain suitable grounds, and must specify the causes and records that have prompted those suspicions. Once the examination has been made, if there is evidence that the institution under investigation has converted or transferred money, securities, freely convertible instruments, and those of legal tender originating in the drug traffic or its related activities to the financial system, the Superintendency of Banks will make the report on the examination known to the competent authorities. This measure also will be in order when the Superintendency of Banks, upon making a routine examination of the institutions subject to its control and surveillance, detects a possible participation by the examined institution in the crimes of conversion, concealment, or transfer of assets classified and penalized in the Law on Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances. This includes the institution's financing for the commission of the crimes specified in that law.
