The two sides held four sessions mostly devoted to the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Addressing a news conference in Islamabad today, Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan said that no progress was made on the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir at the foreign secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan, as the two sides have basic divergences. He said that for the first time, most of the time was devoted to the discussion of the Kashmir issue during all four sessions. Pakistan maintained its principled position that a solution to the Kashmir issue lay in a plebiscite on the basis of the UN resolutions. The Pakistan side rejected the Indian view that the UN resolutions are no longer relevant, and it was made clear that these resolutions are as relevant today as they were in 1948. Khan said Pakistan is willing to hold talks on the format for implementing the UN resolutions, and there is no change in Pakistan's principled stand in this connection. He said for Pakistan, the people of Kashmir are the central players, because it is they who must determine their future. He said the Kashmiri people should be consulted first on this issue. The foreign secretary said Pakistan's first demand with regard to visible steps in Kashmir was reducing the repression and tension and releasing the jailed Kashmiri leaders. He said Pakistan wants the Kashmiri people to have free and unrestricted access to the international media, human rights organizations, members of parliament, and diplomats. He said that during the talks both sides paid maximum attention to the Kashmir issue, but difference of opinion persist at the same level as in the past. He said Pakistan remains committed to continued dialogue for the peaceful resolution of Kashmir and other issues, but in view of the fact that the repression in Kashmir is at its height and human rights continue to be violated there, Pakistan will not schedule any talks at the foreign secretary level or any other level until there is visible improvement in the occupied Kashmir situation. Khan said it is untrue that Pakistan is assisting the freedom fighters. He said Pakistan has proposed a neutral monitor of the Line of Control to ensure and to let people see what is the real situation on the ground. He said India did not accept this proposal and maintained that it will monitor the situation itself. Khan said various other bilateral matters also were discussed. The Indian delegation told Pakistan that they will be ready to present their detailed viewpoint on issues such as Siachen, Sir Creek, and the Wullar Barrage within the next two weeks. Answering questions from the press, Indian Foreign Secretary J.N. Dixit said he held preliminary discussions on some suggestions which have to be considered by both sides, and that we will see how to proceed on these suggestions. He said despite basic divergences in views on the situation, we have agreed to search for ways and means to solve this [Kashmir] issue. In the presence of Dixit Khan read a joint statement, which says both sides recognized that there are basic divergences on the Kashmir issue. The talks addressed all aspects of the Jammu and Kashmir issue and it was agreed that sincere efforts will be made to resolve it. Both sides stressed the need to engage in a meaningful dialogue with a view to solving all outstanding issues. The statement adds that the two sides will consult each other on the question of further talks at the foreign secretary level or any other level.
