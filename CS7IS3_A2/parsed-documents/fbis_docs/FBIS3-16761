Rutskoy is likely to run in the next presidential race. Ignatyev told Interfax that it was significant that the appeal to Russia's citizens which declared the setting up of the movement had not been signed by the Liberal Democratic Party whose leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will "beyond any doubt" run for presidency. Ignatyev took note of the fact that the appeal had not been signed by opposition figures such as Viktor Anpilov and Viktor Tyulkin, the leader of the Russian Communist Party, a rival of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, headed by Gennady Zyuganov, who did join the Accord in the Name of Russia. Ignatyev thought that the setting up of a new movement reflected a deep split among counter-reformists and the tendency to build up various groups around presidential candidates. He admitted, however, that "even though just a small number of counter-reformists rallied around the Accord, we must understand that the setting up of the so-called Rutskoy's party compels the democrats to consolidate." Russia's Choice would step up work on the setting up of its own party, he said.
