After arriving in Japan on 1 February, he met with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, and other officials and tried to seek a way out of the deadlocked economic talks by means of a "political decision." However, no progress was made and it seems that the remarks Kantor made while he was in Japan made Japanese officials distrustful of him. At the 2 February meeting with Foreign Minister Hata, Kantor touched on the issue of objective criteria and repeatedly said seven or eight times that "the United States will review its ties with Japan if Japan does not accept (the U.S. demands)." In response, Foreign Minister Hata said that "we cannot negotiate under this kind of threat." Reportedly, sharp words were exchanged between them. Because of this, some officials say that "USTR Kantor achieved nothing but fueled the confrontation between the two countries," (according to a senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry).
