Greens Spokesman Peter Pilz, and also the Viennese organization of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] headed by Bernhard Goerg, had protested the planned signing of the Golden Book, announcing that they would boycott this act. The Liberal Forum considers contact necessary, but says that "especially polite gestures" are inappropriate for the one responsible for the massacre in Tiananmen Square. Pilz called the guest a "mass murderer of the worst kind." Several human rights organizations have announced that they will hold vigils and demonstrations. A vigil in front of the Federal Chancellery has, however, been banned by the authorities. [passage omitted] Austria's industry is confident that Li Peng's five-day visit will result in orders from China. Besides ministers and state secretaries, the 270-strong delegation accompanying Li Peng will include 150 businessmen. Prior to the visit, the Chinese said that there is great demand for hydraulic power (turbines) and an interest in steel and railroad systems. A railroad agreement is to be signed. In addition to Vienna, the Chinese delegation will visit Linz (the nationalized Voest Alpine works) and Salzburg. According to the Chinese Embassy, trade with China increased from 1.5 billion schillings in 1980 to 11.5 billion last year (imports: 7.8 billion). The return visit to Chancellor Vranitzky's trip to China is the first visit to Austria by a Chinese premier.
