Fay was caned four times on Thursday for vandalism. In a statement today, the Prisons Department said Fay walked back on his own to his cell after the caning, saying that he wanted to act like a man. He shook the caner's hand and smiled when he went back to his cell. The department gave this account in response to allegations made by Fay's father and lawyer reported by REUTERS News Agency. Both George Fay and the lawyer, Theodore Simon, created an account given to them by a U.S. consular official who visited Michael Fay at Queenstown Remand Prison yesterday. Mr. Fay was quoted as saying that his son stood throughout the 45 minutes meeting, and an official removed his bandages. Mr. Simon said that during the caning, blood ran down Fay's legs. He said Fay was in the prison hospital ward. But the Prisons Department said blood did not run down his legs although there were a few drops on his buttocks during the caning. Fay has also been in his prison cell throughout. He was not bandaged and during the meeting he lifted a dressing [Word indistinct] himself. Fay told the consular official that although the caning cut his skin, it was not as bad and horrifying as described in the press. He asked the official to tell his mother not to worry that he is fine and would not do stupid things to himself. Fay also asked the official to tell his father to "shut up". He repeated this request towards the end of the meeting during which he was quite cheerful and in good spirits. The Amercian official, Mr. John Coe, who met Michael Fay yesterday could not be reached for comment. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman also confirmed that the ministry had summoned the U.S. counselor, Mr. Ralph Boyce and consular official Mr. John Coe to express Singapore's displeasure over the false report carried by REUTERS News Agency quoting a U.S. diplomat and U.S. consular official.
