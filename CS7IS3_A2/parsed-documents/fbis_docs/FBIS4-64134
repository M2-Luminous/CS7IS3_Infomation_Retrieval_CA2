Shumeyko and Yegorov Get a Supervisor"] [Text] Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party for Russian Unity and Accord, is expected to meet with Moscow State University students today; tomorrow he will attend a seminar at the "Lesnyye Dali" guest house outside Moscow designed to help draw up a nationalities policy concept. Sergey Shakhray will emerge before the audience as a victor: The president did not accept his resignation from the post of deputy prime minister. Boris Yeltsin, pointing a week ago through his press secretary to Sergey Shakhray's "capriciousness," was nonetheless forced to indulge the unsinkable politician's whims. On Wednesday evening he told Sergey Shakhray during a private meeting that he would not accept his resignation from the post of deputy prime minister. Sergey Shakhray managed to show yet again how much he matters for the Russian authorities and to prove that his opponents' seemingly final victories are never final. By some accounts, it was representatives of the "Siberian Accord" interregional association and some regional leaders -- evidently very far from the south from which the new minister, Nikolay Yegorov, arrived in Moscow -- who threw their weight behind Shakhray in the Kremlin. Mintimer Shaymiyev, together with whom Shakhray made a proposal the other day on the Crimea problem settlement, might be one of them. As a matter of fact, during the meeting with the president, they discussed the implementation of the treaty between Moscow and Kazan and the preparation of a similar treaty with Kaliningrad. According to the press service of Shakhray's party, he promised to the president that he "will work" to ensure coordination between the government, the Federal Assembly, and the future Constitutional Court, to supervise the mass media, and to continue to oversee regional and nationalities policy. The latter obviously bodes no good to the Krasnodar team of Shumeyko-Yegorov, which could have been almost fully in control of relations between Moscow and the regions if Shakhray had finally left the government. While under them a speedy start of talks between Moscow and Groznyy has become a fairly realistic possibility, now Shakhray looks certain to continue his relations with the Chechen opposition along parallel lines.
