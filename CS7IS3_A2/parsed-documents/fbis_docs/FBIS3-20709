She said that there is no doubt about who is responsible for the war in Bosnia, that weapons and ammunition are manufactured in Serbia, and that everything began because certain people wanted to grab power. The accusations are directed at Radovan Karadzic and his associates. Danica Draskovic asks what were the reasons for the war, since nobody had persecuted Serbs. She compares this situation to Germany in 1945. At that time too, many Germans insisted that they had no knowledge about camps and graves. She believes that many Serbs will maintain the same after a year or two when everything will be over. Danica Draskovic also accuses the Serbian Red Cross of arbitrarily distributing foreign humanitarian aid. This cannot be concealed, she adds, since even the most progovernment media admit that 75 percent disappears without a trace. She promises to inform all humanitarian organizations that the aid meant for the poorest and most suffering people ends up on the black market controlled by the Serbian authorities.
