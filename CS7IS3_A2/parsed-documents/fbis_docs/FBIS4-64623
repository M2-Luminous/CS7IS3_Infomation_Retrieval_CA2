What will relations among the Kurds, Turks, and other people be in the long term? [Ocalan] I liken the situation to the Byzantine period. Just the way Turkification started and developed soon after the Turks' penetrated Anatolia, a Kurdish invasion has now started from the East. The Kurds' inventiveness and poverty might exhaust the west of the country, that is, they might become a majority in the west. This won't be a good solution. [OZGUR GUNDEM] Considering that we might become the majority in the country, what is the situation regarding the expression of the identity, language, and culture by other non-Kurdish peoples? Are you thinking of guaranteeing these rights to them? [Ocalan] We are aware of this situation. Specifically, there are influential cultures: the Assyrian and Syriac. There are also the Armenians. [OZGUR GUNDEM] There are Zazas, are there not? [Ocalan] The Zaza culture is the oldest Kurdish culture. I do not consider it something separate from the Kurds. The other cultures must be regarded as different species. We can go as far as to grant them political autonomy. Let them freely express their own identity and culture. A democratic culture must be created in Turkey. It might make sense to be authoritarian in politics but strangulation of a culture is meaningless! You can only wish that even the smallest communities, such as the Turkmens, Lazes and Circassians, could also open up like flowers. Some synthesis of these cultures could be developed. There is a need to be open to various formations, ranging from a federation to confederation. It is vital that the multiplicity of opinions and cultures should not be destroyed with the argument that "we are being divided." Turkey's destruction of culture caused the peoples enormous spiritual and linguistic poverty. It is time to halt this trend! Yes, we understand the aims behind the political centralization but what should we make of this strangulation of cultures? This is the extremist form of Kemalism. I firmly believe this is not enriching Turkey. There is a mentality that favors forging national unity by force. Let us say that Turkey's population is 40 million. But they are bragging by saying: "We are 60 million." Suppose you are 200 million or even 1 billion. What is the purpose behind this? They might be thinking of swallowing the entire world. Let us suppose that you swallowed the world. By the way, Hitler too was thinking along these lines. Let us suppose that you Turkified the entire world. This would mean the end, the desertification of the world. But the existence of many cultures and languages is life's blessing. Is it not? Be content with a 40-million population and beautify its language, culture, economy, and spiritual life so as to lead to a better life. Then your neighbors and cultures within your common borders will be a source of pleasure and enrichment. I think that people nowadays are music fans. Let them also listen to Kurdish music. Allow every other culture freedom. Besides, you are acting with duplicity when it comes to exploiting cultures. You should appear before the world with your own identity to help forge better human relations. I liken the situation of Kurds to that of a woman who gets bedded and nothing more. She is always told: "Let us live together." But she is not allowed to speak and is asked to "Look at me with rapture and say how great I am." Meanwhile, you have severed her tongue and gouged out her eyes. This is a tragedy. So any move toward a solution would entail a broad democratization and decentralization. The centralization will be to a degree that the peoples want. We will not accept centralization simply because some army generals and bureaucrats want it for their own interests. For me the so-called national unity of Turkey is not to the benefit of the Turkish people. It reflects the interests of some army generals, bureaucrats, and a political elite. It does not reflect the interest of the Turkish people. The soldiers are nervous. Why? Because the position of the army generals is under threat. If they lose the war [against the PKK] the army generals will lose their privileges. They are waging a war for their own positions; they are not waging the war of the Turkish people. These things should be known well. I believe in the democratic alternative. A Turkey sunk deeply in Kurdistan is an asphyxiated Turkey. A Turkey bent on annihilating the Kurds is a Turkey chased out of Anatolia. This is not the path of reason. In old times the Turkish revolutionaries wanted to get rid of such leaders. I think this possibility should be considered. We must raise the issue of how much longer these people who commit crimes against the peoples can stay on the land. They will go but peoples will remain and develop their own democratic alternatives. [OZGUR GUNDEM] You are talking like Turkey's revolutionaries. [Ocalan] In this regard we are not working merely as Kurdish revolutionaries. Our function rests in being Turkey's revolutionaries. It might sound paradoxical but, as in times past, when it was stated that "any political party in Turkey is also a Kurdish party," now we are saying: "A Kurdish party is also a party of Turkey." I was told that Mahir Kaynak [a Turkish leftist] was amazed that "there is no enmity against Turks within the PKK." Why should there be such enmity? It simply cannot be. Our enmity is against the oppression of the peoples. There are many Turkish boys and girls fighting with us. We live together every day. There is unbelievable, harmonious unity among them. They don't feel that "These are Kurds; we should be scared of them." We have no enmity or hostility against the Turks. Ours is a great fraternal and internationalist expression. There is no reason we should ignore this aspect of relations and harp on about what they did "to other Turks, Armenians, and Greeks or say they are the extension of various foreign forces." Those who say such things are the stooges of foreign forces. [OZGUR GUNDEM] While we are at it, there are reports that permanent missions of the PKK or ERNK [National Liberation Front of Kurdistan] will be opened in the Greek capital of Athens and the Russian capital of Moscow. What is the diplomatic importance of opening these missions in Russia and Greece, which are considered the traditional "enemies" of the Turks and with which you do not have traditional ties? [Ocalan] The opening of our missions in these countries undoubtedly is linked with Turkey's traditional enmity against the Kurds and Greece. There might be historic reasons for these countries' interest in us but we are not thinking of "surrounding the Turks with enemies or retaliating by imposing a suffocating ring around her." Such thinking comes from Turkes [leader of the Nationalist Movement Party], who is frightening the public by claiming: "They [the Kurds] want to throw us out of Anatolia." It will be senseless for us to follow such a policy, knowing full well that eliminating Turks in such a conflict would also mean the elimination of the Kurds. The Kurds will not be eliminated in this manner. [OZGUR GUNDEM] What then? [Ocalan] The Turks can no longer impose on us a policy that is against the interests of the Kurds and has reached the stage of destroying the identity of the Kurds. The Kurds can't be suppressed as in the past; this is obvious. Millions of Kurds -- here we should add all the Kurds in other sundered areas -- have reached a consensus on this. Some 40 million Turks will be confronted by 40 million Kurds. If we launch a century-long war, nothing will remain of the Turks. The way to forestall this is for the farsighted people who want to stave off the danger to take charge of the situation. But this cannot be done by attracting a few Kurdish collaborators to the government. This problem cannot be solved by saying: Let us suppress and destroy the Kurds and "then we can give them something." [OZGUR GUNDEM] Well, where does the solution rest then? [Ocalan] In a free democratic atmosphere! There should be an opportunity for the free exchange of views and political choice by removing the shadow of coercion. What I really mean is using the right of engaging in secure politics. If you guarantee this security throughout Turkey, I will have no other demands concerning the Kurdish problem. I want to engage in politics in an atmosphere in which arms are silent. This is a reasonable right. If you give the guarantee, then I will go in among the Kurds and Turks and engage in politics. If there is a real desire to end this war, I am all for it, really. And I will propose no preconditions regarding the Kurds' demands. Let the use of force be removed. Yes, to engage in free politics... [OZGUR GUNDEM] I am pleased to hear this. I have an actor friend who knows nothing beyond the propaganda in the press. When I told him that "Apo [alias for Abdullah Ocalan] might be satisfied with entering the parliament as a deputy from Diyarbakir or might be satisfied only with forming his own party," he replied: "Is that all?" I just wanted to mention this. [Ocalan] Of course. This will require some negotiation. What I am saying is: Let us smooth these problems over. The use of political rights depends on particular guarantees. If I go there today, they will detain me and hang me tomorrow. The DEP [Democracy Party] was ostensibly given the right to engage in politics but now its members are facing execution on charges of being "traitors to the country." But I would want to engage in secure politics. I will seek security in the Constitution and the law. Not satisfied with that, I will ask for particular institutional measures. Being a democrat, I believe in a Kurdish identity. I will address the people with this identity of mine. This should have a place in the law. Let us make the necessary changes. Why should you [the Turks] impose your own arrangements on me by unilaterally denying everything that defines me? Will anything remain of democracy if you act like that? In the context of democracy there should be Kurdish parties and social and political institutions. There are lots of local problems to be tackled. So there will be local administrations. There will be local parliaments. But there are also things to be tackled together with the Turks. We will carry out joint government and parliamentary work. Some do not want to understand this. Let them come to me. I will explain all this in one go. I did not attend the law faculty but I can show them how to do what. I am looking for a counterpart. Let anyone with confidence in himself come here so that we can rearrange all these things within the context of Turkey's unity and territorial integrity. [OZGUR GUNDEM] Who do you want? Who will we bring to you? [Ocalan] Anyone. I am even ready for an ordinary civil servant. Let him come so that heeding the people's voice, we can stop this conflict and usher in freedom of thought and particular political choices away from the shadow of arms. No one is avoiding this. I am ready to open a debate about particular and very modest democratic demands. I am asking you: Do you have such a counterpart for me? [OZGUR GUNDEM] They do not respect me, otherwise I would have come to the talks. I do not know if those higher up would. But what clear-cut communal and political projects is the PKK offering for the meaningful, democratic, free, peaceful, and stable solution of this problem? [Ocalan] We want to reorganize the historic Turkish-Kurdish relations. History shows these relations. They began under Sultan Selcuk and peaked under Sultan Yavuz. They also form the foundation of the Republic established by Mustafa Kemal. These relations must be admitted first. We want to surmount the blind policy of violence, which is against the interests of the Kurdish people and goes as far as to deny all its national democratic demands and identity and even annihilates it. The following are some of the fundamental principles needed to surmount the current policy: (1) The recognition of Kurdish-Turkish relations. (2) The suspension of the policy of violence against and the assimilation of the Kurds, that is, the erosion of the Kurdish identity. (3) I am saying that alongside the institutions suitable for each people's national identity, there is a need to make a transition to a system of federal parliament and government based on partnership institutions, that is, to put it more concretely, based on local, or perhaps federal, parliaments and governments. This is the most concrete path to a solution that we could advance: the revision of all relations and the recognition of the need for reorganization, not under the shadow of arms or pressure, but based on complete free will. If this is accepted, then there could be an easy movement toward reorganization within Turkey's existing borders and based on the genuine free will of the two peoples, which would forge a stronger fraternity than the current one. This is possible without too much fighting. I believe in this but I have no counterpart. [OZGUR GUNDEM] You spoke against the use of force, assimilation, and the threat of arms but primarily the General Staff and an important section of the public accuse you and your party of using violence and of committing savagery and massacres. So while you declare your opposition to violence, your party is being accused of practicing such things. Is there not a contradiction here? [Ocalan] Before asking me that, you should have read this [not further specified; however, Ocalan appears to be referring to a paper in his hand]. Do I have to read it for you? We announced the names of those killed during the shelling of Gabar, Sirnak, and Soke. Their birthplaces were also given. Some 16 people were listed. We also obtained the names and dates of birth of the villagers killed in the village of Ziver in the district of Eruh during the shelling. The number killed here was 23. Over 50 villagers were killed in shelling on election day alone. Their names are known. I am not exaggerating their number. The press did not mention these facts. So who is committing the savagery? Don't they claim that children are being killed? Go and check their age. You should be realistic. When women and children get killed and it is beyond our control, when angry young people place bombs here and there, you cannot describe this as PKK tactics. We are trying to prevent such action. If we do not prevent such action the streets might turn into a hell. We are very attached to the principles of humanism and war conventions. It is the General Staff that is not doing what is needed on this issue. [OZGUR GUNDEM] When do you hope to see the realization of your ideal of the "recognition of the Kurds' political, cultural, and historic rights and of your return to Turkey to represent your people on a legal platform?" [Ocalan] I have spent 15 long and important years of my life in the Middle East, which is a place of contradictions. I have not done this out of devotion to the place. I have put up with it out of very difficult but very fundamental historic, political, and humanistic considerations. It is my ideal to be engaged in politics amid my people, even in Turkey. I am not devoted to conducting a policy with the use of arms. I have no intention of putting my neck out like a sheep if I am given no alternative but execution. I will defend myself to the end with whatever means I can find in any corner of the world. It is obvious that the defense of my own person is linked with the defense of my own people and party. Why am I doing all these things? I am doing them so as to engage in politics. I have no desire for violence for the sake of it. We have political goals and national and democratic demands and I want to put them into practice. It is the Turkish regime that does not grasp this. Let this regime express a bit of goodwill to solve the problems. Let it assign a counterpart to talks with us. Here my presence is not a condition. Let those counterparts who could solve this problem come together. Let us both [PKK and Turkish Government] support them. What is needed is for both sides to display goodwill. I reiterate: I am ready to display my goodwill to the end. But at the same time I will never allow the suppression, certainly not the denial, of a people's national democratic demands. If need be I can use ruthless violence for this purpose or act like the most democratic politician to fulfill these same duties.
