FBIS4-68398 "jpusr047___94060" FBIS-USR-94-047 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 8 April 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Financial Planning Center To Promote Foreign Investment Financial Planning Center To Promote Foreign Investment 944Q0311B Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY in Russian 8 Apr 94 p 2 944Q0311B Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY Russian CSO [Article by Vadim Bar[surname partially illegible]: "Agency for Supporting Investments Established"] [Text] In accordance with a government decree "On the Organization of Work With Foreign Investments and on Consulting and Technical Assistance," which was received yesterday for official distribution, a federal project financing center is being established under the Ministry of Economics. Thus, there is now a federal agency that will assume the functions of translating Russian projects for attracting foreign investments into a language understandable to Western financiers. Foreign investments are not enjoying good fortune in Russia. First of all, they entail very considerable political risk: events last September and October, the results of the 12 December elections, and the reversals associated with the recent amnesty act are all things that do not dispose people to invest money in a "base" that has a "superstructure" of that sort. Second, Russian inflation and taxes are ardently competing with one another in rendering any investment activity altogether meaningless. Third, the country is not following any purposeful policy for attracting foreign investments, the lack of which is reflected in the absence of any economically backed priorities for attracting them, and of an appropriate organizational basis for doing so. It is no surprise that, according to data on the Russian balance of payments, the amount of direct foreign investments dropped from $800 million in 1992 to $600 million in 1993. For all practical purposes, the new federal center has been established in place of the Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development (RAMSIR). For all the importance of pre-investment research and the expert review of proposed financing arrangements, the replacement is plainly not an equal one. Technically, RAMSIR has not been abolished, and no one has removed Aleksandr Shokhin, who has again become a vice-premier, from the office of the agency's chairman. In essence, the division of RAMSIR between the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and the Ministry of Economics has been completed: the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations has formed a chief administration that is concerned with investment cooperation, i.e., with the construction of facilities in Russia (and that has no direct relation to foreign investments), while the Ministry of Economics has formed the federal center. And the investors themselves, while acquiring an agency for the "provision of expert consulting support for investment projects," have lost an official defender of their interests in the Russian government. The establishment of the center also indicates that, under conditions in which the attraction of direct foreign investments has not been crowned with success, reliance can be placed on investment credits. If that is the case, the center possesses certain weaknesses, since it acts only as a state middleman in bringing investment projects up to the stage of implementation. But those same functions, in principle, should be performed by banks that undertake the financing of projects. In this connection, one may recall the postponed project for establishing a specialized project financing bank with a network of branches throughout Russia. [Begin box] Government Agencies Specializing in Foreign Investments: End of 1992--Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development (RAMSIR), as an agency for the development and implementation of a policy for attracting foreign investments, headed by Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin (the statute on it was confirmed by a 12 December 1992 government decree). January 1994--RAMSIR, with the clearly reduced but little-understood status of a "state institution," is transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations (the 10 January 1994 presidential edict "On the Structure of Federal Agencies"). March--the functions of attracting foreign investments, including pre-project studies, are assigned to the Ministry of Economics (a 28 March 1994 government decree). April--the Project Financing Center is established under the Ministry of Economics (4 April 1994 government decree "On the Organization of Work With Foreign Investments and on Consulting and Technical Assistance").
