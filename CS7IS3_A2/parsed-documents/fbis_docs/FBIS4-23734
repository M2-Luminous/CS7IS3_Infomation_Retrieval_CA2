Speaking at a press conference in Cape Town, where he is attending the World Economic Forum Southern Africa summit, he said former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith could carry on farming as his land was not needed for resettlement purposes. Mr Mugabe said there were 10.5 million Zimbabweans, most of them rural people who because of a land shortage had to lead a subsistence existence. Most arable land was in the hands of a mere 4,500 people. "Naturally we have to correct this position. What morality would we find more impelling than that which demands that the few, 4,500 people, must surrender it to the ten million people?" Some land had to remain in the hands of the commmercial farming sector, and agro-industrial sugar, citrus, timber and wattle plantations would not be interfered with. "But ordinary 2,000, 4,000 hectare pieces of land, some of these we say must come to the communal sector. Not all of it. We are not depriving all the farmers of their land. Mr Ian Smith's farm is not in question just now, because we regard it as not lying in a region where land must be acquired for resettlement purposes." Mr Smith was "free to continue farming on his land whatever his politics might have been in the past or still might be at present". Mr Mugabe said his government did not care about the political thinking of an individual. "But we care about the human question, the humanitarian question, the moral question of doing justice. Justice will have to be done."
