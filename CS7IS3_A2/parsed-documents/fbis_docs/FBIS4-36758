Rabin said he answered the letters, but refused to divulge details. Prime Minister Rabin told our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling that Teddy Kollek presented him with the idea of inviting King Husayn for prayers in Jerusalem, adding that Rabin answered that if Kollek wanted to send the king a personal invitation that was okay with him, but that he does not know if the king would come. Our correspondent adds Rabin confirmed that Jacques Neriya, his political adviser, has decided to accept Hayim Ramon's offer and take a post in the Histadrut labor federation. Rabin expressed regret, but added that Neriya's resignation will not have an adverse effect on the efficient operation of the prime minister's bureau, just as the resignation of other advisers has had no such effect. Yitzhaq Rabin admitted his working method is military in nature, with channels of command and analysis directing activities, and one adviser more or less makes no difference. Regarding another issue the prime minister said that the government will no longer subsidize inefficient industries, and henceforth those elements that wish to stand on their own two feet -- whether a factory or a local authority -- will have to become more efficient and finance themselves. The government will not aid the local authorities any longer and they will have to bear full responsibility for their budgets, according to the prime minister. The prime minister made these remarks during a meeting with northern mayors.
