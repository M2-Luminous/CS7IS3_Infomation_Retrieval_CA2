The Abkhazian side, with the participation of U.N. inspectors, guarantees the lives and safety of the Georgian groups withdrawn from the area. Otherwise, the government of Abkhazia will take measures to neutralise "the armed gangs", says a statement released by the Abkhazian government today. ITAR-TASS has learned from officials of the press service of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet that this statement was released due to the recently increased activity of Georgian armed gangs in the Kodor Gorge and in some villages of the Gali district. Abkhazian sources report on mortar attacks on the village of Lata and raids of armed gangs on the village of Ganakhleba, Gali district, which claimed the lives of four men. Several people were abducted and their whereabouts are unknown. The Abkhazian side believes that such provocations are a violation of the Moscow agreements on political measures to settle the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, that they seriously destabilise the situation and are intended to torpedo the peaceful negotiations and preparations for the repatriation of refugees. The Abkhazian government has announced its readiness to ensure the safe evacuation of these groups from the territory of the republic if they laid down their arms. In light of the latest developments, the parliament of the Abkhazian Republic requested the Russian president and the State Duma on Friday not to ratify the Russo-Georgian treaty until the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict is fully settled.
