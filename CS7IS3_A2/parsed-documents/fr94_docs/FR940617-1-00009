FR940617-1-00009 FR940617-1-00002 AEB Recommendation At the March 17, 1994, Board meeting in Chicago, Illinois, AEB members voted unanimously to recommend that the assessment rate be increased from 5 cents to 10 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. Their decision was based on the marketing analysis as well as an overall sense from producers nationwide that more funds are necessary to help improve the position of the industry's products in the marketplace through strengthened advertising and research programs. AEB further requested that a referendum on this increase be held as soon as possible. Referendum After an opportunity for public comment, a referendum will be held among egg producers not exempt from the Act. Producers engaged in the production of commercial eggs during a representative period determined by the Secretary will be eligible to vote on the assessment rate change proposed by AEB. All known eligible egg producers will receive information in the mail regarding the referendum. It is anticipated that the 75,000-hen exemption level will be in place before the referendum. The increase in the assessment rate shall become effective if the change is approved or favored by not less than two-thirds of the producers voting in the referendum, or a majority of such producers if they represent not less than two-thirds of the commercial eggs produced by those voting.
