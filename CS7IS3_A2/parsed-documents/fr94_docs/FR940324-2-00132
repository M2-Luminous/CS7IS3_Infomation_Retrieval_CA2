SUMMARY: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted by Winnebago County under the provisions of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;193) and 14 CFR part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description of federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1980). On August 18, 1993 the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by Winnebago County under part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements. On February 14, 1994, the Administrator approved the Wittman Regional Airport noise compatibility program. All of the recommendations of the program were approved. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of the FAA's approval of the Wittman Regional Airport noise compatibility program is February 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William J.

Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150 is a local program, not a federal program.
