The meeting profoundly implemented the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Municipal Party Committee and arranged for the urban collective economic work for this year in line with the demands set by the municipal economic work conference. Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, made an important speech at the meeting. Vice Mayor Zhang Haosheng made a work report. Gao Dezhan pointed out in his speech: We should further enhance our ideological understanding and strengthen the sense of urgency and the sense of responsibility for accelerating the development of the collective sector of the economy. Going all out to develop an urban collective economy constitutes not only an important move to accelerate China's economic development, but also plays a positive role in promoting the development of the socialist market economy. Since the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, particularly over the past several years, Tianjin's collective economy has developed greatly, and the economic strength of districts and neighborhoods has been enhanced. Practice shows that urban collective economy has already become an important component part of Tianjin's national economy. It should be noted, however, that the development of Tianjin's urban collective economy is not good enough. We should keep sober-minded, further enhance our sense of urgency and our sense of responsibility, pioneer new ideological trains, and adopt energetic measures and every possible means to create a new situation in urban collective economy. We should fully understand the importance of accelerating urban collective economy under the new situation. First, urban collective economy constitutes the major force of Tianjin's national economy, plays an irreplaceable role in invigorating the economy and accelerating the development, and has already become one of the new important economic growth points of the municipality. Second, accelerating the development of the urban collective economy is conducive to improving the living standards of urban residents. Third, accelerating the development of the urban collective economy may greatly increase the financial revenues of districts and neighborhoods. Gao Dezhan said: This year is critical to accelerating the reform, opening up, and modernization drive of the municipality. As a new important growth point to accelerate the municipal economic development, the urban collective economy must develop rapidly. In the course of efficiently running state-owned enterprises, we should allow the people to freely develop township enterprises, foreign- invested enterprises of the three types, urban collective economy, individual economy, and private economy, and should allow the simultaneous development of these enterprises and these sectors of the economy. In developing urban collective economy, we must further emancipate our mind, open up our train of thought, and go all out to accelerate the pace of development. Those that have a good market and efficiency may develop actively. Gao Dezhan stressed: We must foster the idea of depending on reform to accelerate development in order to expedite development with reform. The general guiding ideology for the reform of collective enterprises is to emancipate the mind in a way more vigorous than that of state-owned enterprises and to carry out reform in an even more flexible and energetic manner. The reform programs of collective enterprises may include diverse forms based on free choice in line with their respective conditions, such as the shareholding cooperative system, the system of being owned by the state but run by the people, the system of being owned publicly but run privately, partnership management, management on a leasing basis, and management on a contract basis. Enterprises should adopt what most conforms to the conditions of enterprises; what is most conducive to liberating productive forces, to increasing the accumulation of the state, to increasing the momentum for development of enterprises, and to improving the living standards of workers and staff. Enterprises should continue to increase the income of workers and staff members on the premise of developing production, improving management, and increasing economic returns. Gao Dezhan stressed in conclusion: We should actually strengthen leadership over the work concerning urban collective economy, list the work as an important item on the daily agenda, and conscientiously study how to solve the problems in reform and development. The government should actually transform functions and further lift restrictions on collective enterprises in an effort to administer enterprises as little as possible and do as many tangible things as possible for enterprises. All the districts, bureaus, and units that undertake the function of managing the urban collective economy should exert great efforts and adopt bold measures to accelerate the development of the collective economy. The urban collective economic office under the municipal government should strengthen guidance, coordination, and service to the development of the collective economy in order to create favorable conditions for developing this economy. Tianjin has a great potential and bright prospects in developing the urban collective economy. Thus, Tianjin should make great efforts to overcome difficulties with a view to developing the urban collective economy in an even better and faster way and making new contributions to invigorating the economy. Vice Mayor Zhang Haosheng summarized, in his speech, the municipality's urban collective economic work in 1993 and made arrangements for this year's work. [passage omitted]
