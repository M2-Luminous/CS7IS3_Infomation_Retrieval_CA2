According to the source, the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], government ruling party since 1929, hired Sanchez Vega in Tijuana to assist in "crowd control" the same day Colosio was shot. Sanchez Vega was one of many men hired by the party to work as assistants in Colosio's campaign event in Tijuana, a city on the border with the United States. This hiring is done everywhere the party candidates hold events as part of their campaigns. The source said also that Sanchez Garcia [name as received] does not work directly with nor is related to General Domiro Garcia Reyes, who had been charged by the presidential staff with Colosio's protection. The source said the PRI candidate's assassination was not the result of a plot, as determined by the investigations thus far. The attorney general is still studying the episode and the available videotapes of the murder. Today, the Mexican newspaper EL UNIVERSAL said Colosio could have been the victim of a plot by some of his security members. The paper points to Sanchez Vega as one of the murderers' accomplices because in several videotapes available Sanchez Vega is seen clearing a path for the murderer. The investigations point to Mario Aburto Martinez as Colosio's confessed murderer and so far do not support the participation of other people in the assassination.
