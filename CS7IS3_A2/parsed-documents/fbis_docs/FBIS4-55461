In this context, we asked P. Csaky to discuss the Stability Pact and assess the views being expressed about it. [Csaky] The Stability Pact is being formulated at the level of the EU and the East European states, and its initiator is French Prime Minister Balladur. I understand some of the approaches adopted by Slovak politicians who want to savor the decisionmaking on the Slovak Republic's political orientation. The Stability Pact is intended to prevent possible conflicts in our region. It is not oriented against the sovereignty of any state. If the status of the minorities is also to be discussed in association with it, we would like to put forward our point of view. However, at the moment, it looks as though the minorities will not participate directly in the negotiations. [Pankovcinova] Opinions are being expressed by the current opposition that the Stability Pact could also mean a certain revision of the borders in Europe.... [Csaky] I can reject this unequivocally. I know in detail the text of the Stability Pact and the European Union's proposals. Nothing is said there about any such eventuality. This is merely an old formula for defining the Slovak Republic's enemies. The EU is becoming unified, it has accepted another four members, and it has expressed its interest in further unification. We are also declaring our endeavor to enter Europe and come closer to the EU. If this is really the case, there is no point in just talking about it; we have to adopt specific measures, take part in the negotiations on the Stability Pact, and sign it. Thus, we would be making a specific commitment toward a united Europe.
