The tabled amendments confirm earlier versions of the constitutional concessions announced last week. The proposals include concessions on self-determination to address right-wing demands for a volkstaat [homeland]. These are supplemented by a proposal that a volkstaat council be established by members of Parliament to pursue the concept of a volkstaat after the election. No members of the Freedom Alliance attended this morning's meeting of the negotiating council. The concessions will also allow provinces to write their own constitutions and to create their own legislative and executive structures. A two-ballot system is also proposed.
