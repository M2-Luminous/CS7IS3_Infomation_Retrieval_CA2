The official welcoming ceremony with all state honors was held at the "Hall 1" of the residence "Boyana." After the intonation of the hymns of both countries, President Gligorov addressed the honorary guard. Immediately following this, the talks between the two presidents, in four eyes [as published], began. That same afternoon, the talks between the two delegations also began. After the talks, the two presidents gave short statements for the press: "I feel that what was written in the press, that a historic meeting should not be expected, was not confirmed. I believe that this meeting is of historic character," Bulgarian President Zhelev said. "Not only because this is the first official visit of President Gligorov, but also because this visit opens a new era in the development of relations between the two countries." The Bulgarian President assessed the talks as fruitful, as "there literally is not one field in which the two countries cannot cooperate." Reminding that there is excellent cooperation in the sphere of economy, Zhelev said: "If we sign an agreement on mutual cultural cooperation, it will be even better." On the same note as President Zhelev, President Gligorov said: "We also discussed many other questions of bilateral character, for example, the linking of the energetic systems, the gas line, etc." Gligorov informed that military issues, that is, military cooperation was also included in the talks, adding that the two defense ministries might soon sign an agreement. They also discussed the connection in the processes of European integration and initiative, the NATO "Partnership for Peace" project, for which Macedonia is showing particular interest, and the two sides exchanged views on issues of international character, particularly the Balkans and the Bosnian crisis. President Gligorov insisted on the definition of the principles of good neighborly relations, as, according to his estimation "Macedonia's independence is connected with the identity of the people." The two statesmen also talked about the problem that developed with the failure to reach the agreement on scientific cooperation between the two countries. According to reports, the Bulgarian side says that it was emphasized during the talks that conditions for a bilateral agreement had been created. It was even proposed for this agreement to be expanded and to encircle certain open questions, which would finally be solved. The Macedonian side accepted this idea. However, no details were mentioned in the talks. According to protocol, today morning President Gligorov is expected to meet with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. However, as it has been found out, due to the health condition of the prime minister, Gligorov will most probably be received by his deputy Evgeni Matinchev.
