Please listen to the tape sent to us by our Sakhalin journalist Lyudmila Fillipova. [Begin recording] The critical situation in the oblast fishing industry is the center of attention of the industry council of trade unions. The council notes that the ill-conceived social and economic reform policies, the extortionate taxes, and the disparity between prices for primary products and energy resources has led to the ruination of the fishing industry, the sharp decline in the volume of production, the halt of a number of enterprises, and a huge wage debt. To avert the final collapse of the industry, the council of trade unions has sent State Duma deputies a number of proposals, for example: review the tax policy in respect to the Russian fishing industry; equate it to the advantages given to the agricultural industry as food producers; free the fishing industry from customs duties on import, export, and barter operations which would ensure a significant additional flow of supplies of fish products onto the domestic market; and a number of other proposals. Hoping to find understanding in the State Duma, the industry council of trade unions has appealed to fishermen, fish processors, and leaders of economic and trade union organizations of the Far East fishing industry to show solidarity and support the above named demands. In connection with this appeal, the industry council of trade unions sent a letter to the Russian president, the prime minister, the government of Russia, and the chairman of the State Duma, which supports the demands stated in the decree of the 5th central committee plenum of the Russian fishing industry workers' trade union. Incidentally, the letter emphasizes that if the demands are not met, the trade union will be forced to take collective action. I want to add that the Yuzhno-Kurilsk fishermen have already begun their strike. [end recording]
