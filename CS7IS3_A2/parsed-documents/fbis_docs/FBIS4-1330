This was part of the "overwhelming support" the FF and its leader General Constand Viljoen were attracting countrywide from CP and National Party [NP] members, he said in a statement. Over the weekend two senior CP MPs, Tom Langley and Dries Bruwer, defected to the FF. Mr Bruwer is also president of the Transvaal Agricultural Union. Last week 11 CP-controlled town councils pledged support for Gen Viljoen. In a seperate statement Mr Maninger dismissed as "devoid of all truth" rumours that the FF was considering forming a coalition with the NP. The policies of the FF and the NP were "world's apart" and such a coalition could never happen because the NP was already in a de facto alliance with the African National Congress, he said. The rumours had originated from the rightwing broadcaster Radio Pretoria, Mr Maninger said. Critising the radio station, Mr Maninger said Radio Pretoria had in the past broadcast the opinions of individuals as facts. He accused the radio station of biased reporting, saying that the broadcaster did not "even tolerate differing views anymore".
