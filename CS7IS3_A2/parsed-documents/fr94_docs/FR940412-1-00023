FR940412-1-00023 FR940412-1-00006 For the reasons set out in the preamble, 38 CFR part 4, subpart B, is proposed to be amended as set forth below: PART 4_SCHEDULE FOR RATING DISABILITIES Subpart B_Disability Ratings 1. The authority citation for part 4 continues to read as follows: Authority: 72 Stat. 1125; 38 U.S.C. 1155. 2. Section 4.85 is revised to read as follows: §4.85 Evaluation of hearing impairment. (a) Examinations will be conducted using a controlled speech discrimination test together with a puretone audiometry test. The horizontal rows in Table VI represent levels of speech discrimination determined from the controlled speech discrimination test. The vertical columns in Table VI represent levels of puretone decibel loss determined from the puretone audiometry test. The Roman numeral designation of impaired efficiency (I through XI) is determined at the point where the horizontal row (percentage of speech discrimination) and the vertical column (puretone decibel loss) intersect. For example, with 70 percent speech discrimination and average puretone decibel hearing loss of 64, the Roman numeral designation is V. Each ear will be evaluated separately. (b) The percentage evaluation will be determined from Table VII. The horizontal row of Roman numeral designations represents the ear having the better hearing and the vertical column the Roman numeral designations for the ear having the poorer hearing. The percentage of disability and the diagnostic code are located at the point where the row and column intersect. For example, if the better ear (horizontal row) has a Roman numeral designation of ``V'' and the poorer ear (vertical column) has a Roman numeral designation of ``VII,'' the row and column intersect where the percentage evaluation is 30 percent and the diagnostic code is 6103. (c) Table VIa provides Roman numeral designations based solely on puretone decibel hearing loss averages. It is for application when the Chief of the Audiology Clinic certifies that language difficulties or inconsistent speech discrimination scores make the combined use of puretone decibel hearing loss and speech discrimination inappropriate. (d) When puretone thresholds in any four of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz, are 55 decibels hearing loss or more, the rating specialist will select the Roman numeral designation from either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever permits the higher Roman numeral designation. Each ear will be evaluated separately. (e) When puretone thresholds are 30 decibels hearing loss or less at frequencies of 1000 Hertz and below, and are 70 decibels hearing loss or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will select the higher Roman numeral designation from either Table VI or Table VIa, and then elevate the Roman numeral designation selected to the next higher Roman numeral. Each ear will be evaluated separately. Note: When evaluating any claim for impaired hearing, refer to §3.350 of this chapter to determine whether the veteran may be entitled to special monthly compensation due either to deafness itself, or deafness or partial deafness in combination with other specified disabilities. 3. Section 4.86 is revised to read as follows: §4.86 Auditory acuity, hearing aids, and evidence other than puretone audiometry and controlled speech. (a) For Department of Veterans Affairs purposes, ``impairment of auditory acuity'' means the organic loss of the ability to hear speech. (b) The evaluations derived from this schedule are designed to measure the best residual uncorrected hearing. Examinations comparing hearing with and without hearing aids are unnecessary. (c) When the medical evidence necessary to establish service-connection for hearing loss predates the use of puretone audiometry and controlled speech, service-connection will be determined under the provisions of §§4.85 through 4.87 of this part as in effect on December 17, 1987.
