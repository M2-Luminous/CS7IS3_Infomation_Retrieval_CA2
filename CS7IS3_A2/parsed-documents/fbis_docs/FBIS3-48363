The secretary general said in his letter: The meeting with you, and the luncheon that you hosted afterwards were the highlight of my stay in Pyongyang. It was useful to review matters of mutual concern, including your proposals for the reunification of Korea and, more generally, the need for peace, security and development on the Korean peninsula. I fully share your view that the armistice agreement, which is nearly forty years old, must be replaced by a permanent peace treaty. One of my objectives in visiting the Korean peninsula was to help, if at all possible, in defusing the tension, he noted, and said: I wish to reiterate my thanks for an excellent visit, which has helped to strengthen relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United Nations.
