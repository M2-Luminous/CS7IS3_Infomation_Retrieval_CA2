The question to whom belonged the aircraft that NATO circles initially identified as Super-Galebs, that is to say, G-4's, and subsequently informed that they were actually Jastrebs, that is to say, J-1 aircraft, is the key element of the entire story. According to some information from NATO, the downed aircraft allegedly bore old Yugoslav markings, which is peculiar bearing in mind that aircraft on the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia no longer carry such markings. One thing is perfectly obvious, namely, that the downed aircraft definitely did not take off for Bosnia from the FRY territories, and there are no uncertainties about this. The air force of the Serbian Republic possesses 42 Orao aircraft and only one G-4 Super-Galeb, according to present information. Because UN observers who register each take-off are deployed at the Banja Luka airport, there is also a question of whether the aircraft could have taken off from this airport at all. True enough, G-4 can take off from grass runways, that is to say, from provisional war airports, but the UN observers are probably also supervising the localities where the aircraft of the Serbian Republic are stationed. Clash of "a Yugo car" and a Train Did the two or four U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcons in the air meet with a group of six G-4's or six Jastrebs that were returning from a bombing raid on the artillery arms factory in Novi Travnik and a factory near Bugojno, which is in Muslim hands, and by firing altogether six air-to-air (Sidewinder) and (AMRAAM) missiles at them down four aircraft on that occasion? There are several versions about what happened in the sky above former Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to NATO sources, the U.S. fighters asked the unknown aircraft to land but, allegedly, there was no reply and for this reason the F-16's fired air-to-air missiles. Four aircraft were hit and downed, while two aircraft in a low fight quickly disappeared from the scene of the clash in the direction of the Adriatic Sea. According to some other sources, one aircraft each fell in the vicinity of Kljuc, Sipovo, and Petrovac, and three pilots allegedly died while one saved himself by ejecting. According to the same source, one U.S. F-16 was shot down with a missile from the ground, even though NATO has not confirmed this. Did the G-4's or perhaps Jastrebs stand any chance at all in the air duel with the U.S. F-16? The reply is negative, as these are two entirely different categories of aircraft. The U.S. aircraft are faster, more mobile in the air, have better electronics, are better armed, and on top of all this are receiving help from AWACS so that the pilots in G-4's or Jastrebs stood absolutely no chance in such an unequal duel. This was actually a meeting resembling a crash between "a Yugo car" and a train. Libyan Jastrebs Is there a possibility that these were aircraft of the Republic of Croatia? Croatia does not own G-4 aircraft nor Jastrebs, unless somebody has sold them to it in the meantime. Some Arab countries (Libya) namely possess Galeb and Jastreb aircraft, and the possibility of such a transfer is, therefore, not completely out of the question, as the arms channels are very twisted indeed. Croatian pilots are trained on Galeb and Jastreb aircraft and the NATO information that two from the group of six aircraft flew toward the Adriatic coast is very indicative. NATO should have released information obtained from AWACS as to where these aircraft landed. It is possible that these were aircraft from the fleet of the republic of Serbian Krajina which has several aircraft of this type at Udbina airport. In any case, a group of six aircraft simultaneously in the air suggests an action of a more important nature, and the assumptions about the bombing of factories in Novi Travnik and near Bugojno have some substance. However, the Croats currently have more motives for attacking these factories than the Bosnian Serbs do.
