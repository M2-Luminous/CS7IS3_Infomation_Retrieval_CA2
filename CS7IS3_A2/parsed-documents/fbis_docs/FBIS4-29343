The association at its general assembly adopted a resolution urging Japan to open the way for political participation of Korean residents at the regional level and to expand the employment of ethnic Koreans in public administration. "Korean residents of Japan are now second, third, and fourth generations and have adopted the lifestyle of permanently residing in Japan," Shin Yon-sang, head of the pro-Seoul Korean Residents Union in Japan (Mindan), told the assembly. "As local residents of Japanese society, I hope they will contribute to the development of the regions. We intend to proceed with our efforts to gain political participation rights on the local level," Shin said. The campaign for granting voting rights and the right to run for political office at the local level to ethnic Koreans has gained momentum over the past year as a growing number of local assemblies have adopted resolutions backing political rights for non-Japanese permanent residents. Some 680,000 ethnic Koreans currently live in Japan, many of them descendants of Korean laborers forcibly brought to Japan during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the peninsula. An estimated 369,000 of the residents are affiliated with the pro-Seoul Mindan while another 247,000 belong to the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon).
