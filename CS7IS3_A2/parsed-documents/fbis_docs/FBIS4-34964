The proposal is based on the fact the post Cold War period has not favored the financing of programs to protect humanity. Although the 1994 UNDP Human Development Report assesses that military expenses in industrialized countries were reduced 3.6 percent between 1987 and 1991, it considers the so-called peace dividends, which totaled approximately $935 billion, were not used to finance social development programs or to give security to the human race itself. In its preceding report, the one for 1993, the UNDP had stressed the differences that existed in Mexico between the people in Chiapas State and those in the richest areas of the country. On that occasion, it somewhat sounded an alert to the situation and forecast the social explosion that occurred when Mayan peasants revolted against the state administration and the Mexican Government seven months later, on 1 January 1994. After confirming its prediction that large gaps in human development can lead to civil conflict, the 1994 document asserts the Chiapas experience constitutes a disquieting reaction. Human security The UNDP urges giving much more importance to human security than to hackneyed national security, on which the developed world spent approximately $815 billion in 1992. Developed countries used $125 billion in this sector, but those funds were almost all drawn from resources assigned to social programs at a human cost of vast, fatal consequences. By proposing a type of alert system to forecast cases of national disintegration, such as Somalia, the report expresses doubt that all the resources assigned to military spending have increased security for the average citizen of the world. In developing countries, the probabilities of dying from social abandonment, malnutrition, and preventable sicknesses are 33 percent higher than the those of dying in a war caused by foreign aggression. The relation between those expenses and the social costs in the GNP can be appraised by the fact that 1 billion people never see a health professional, more than 2 million children die of preventable, contagious diseases, with another 192 million facing malnutrition, and that 1.3 billion additional people suffer the effects of not having available drinking water. Furthermore, 900 million citizens of those countries do not know how to read or write; 30 million children do not attend grade school, and, regarding the population cost, almost another 3 billion people live in countries where yearly demographic growth exceeds 2 percent. The United States spends an average of $290 billion in defense every year, while crime within its borders costs $425 million, as well as many lives. The UNDP believes the situation is bad for white people but much worse for blacks. According to this organization, one-third of white people live in areas contaminated by carbon monoxide, but the proportion is close to 50 percent for blacks, and the unemployment rate for blacks is double that for whites. Indicating that human insecurity is a universal problem, the UNDP stresses the fact that poor countries are much more concerned about hunger and sicknesses, while the rich ones are kept awake by drugs and crime. Approximately $460 billion could be obtained to perk peace during the period of 1995 to 2000 if military expenses throughout the world are decreased 3 percent a year, but there has to be a guarantee those resources will actually end up as funds to further development. A New Criterion for Cooperation The formulation of a new criterion for cooperation, which ties reductions in military expense to a world pact favoring human development, is based on the need to find ways to share responsibilities. This implies new international agreements to replace those that the UNDP believes have an obsolete foreign aid criterion, so as to satisfy the new demands for human security, the focus of the organization's initiatives for 1994. According to this concept, the industrialized countries would pay for specific benefits, and the developing countries would also be obligated to reform their economies and government policies. Such ideas, akin to the new perspective that emerged from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Summit held in Cartagena de Indias in 1992, address the issue of this new association for development. The UNDP recognizes, however, that the manner in which aid is currently assigned still bears the scars of the so-called Cold War, when aid was reserved for strategic allies more frequently than it was assigned to truly poor countries. A brief overview of the traditional handling of this type of aid also reflects varied concepts of implementation. Thus, while Egypt receives official aid from donor countries that amounts to approximately $280 per poor person, India receives only $7. Only 7-percent of aid given from government to government is assigned to human priorities such as basic education, elementary health attention, and water supply in rural areas, among others mentioned in the report. The proposed UNDP pact establishes, generally, that poor countries as well as the rich ones promise to help satisfy the basic needs previously enumerated. The focus of the UNDP initiative is based on a multidimensional vision of developmental cooperation, a concept used in the past only to define foreign aid. According to the viewpoint which the report endorses, northern and southern countries are intrinsically linked by other cultural, political, and economic factors. It is a fact, it states, that North-South aid is usually only a small part of other types of international financial flows. Foreign aid to developing countries totaled $60 billion in 1992, but the flow of private capital to the South increased to $102 billion that same year and had amounted to only $5 billion in 1990. What is more significant, however, is that three-fourths of that capital only goes to a dozen countries. They are, in decreasing order: China, Mexico, Malaysia, Argentina, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, Venezuela, and Korea. Only 6 percent is designated for sub-Saharan Africa and 2 percent for less developed countries. The UNDP proposal includes the concepts of an international system for minimum social security, compensation systems, and international institutions. The first system will be financed with a world revenue tax of approximately 0.1 percent, which will yield $20 billion a year, to be imposed on countries with a per capita GNP of more than $10,000, to the benefit of, the UNDP believes, those countries that register a per capita GNP of less than $1,000. If this mechanism is not approved, the UNDP suggests the alternative option: that the current Official Aid for Development reserve an amount equivalent to 0.1 percent of the GNP for the poorer countries. Regarding compensation, the UNDP is studying ways to form new associations between the rich and the poor. For example, the first could pay the poor for the destruction of nuclear weapons, the struggle against contagious diseases, the elimination of drugs, and the improvement of the planet's environment. The UNDP also suggests the future International Commerce Organization (OMC) establish a compensation program to be used when a country causes damage to others. Finally, this new form of cooperation must be equipped with new organizations in the UN system. Thus, an Economic Security Council, a World Central Bank, an International Investments Fund, the future OMC, and a World Antimonopoly Directorate should be created. All those proposals will be broached at the World Conference on Human Development scheduled for 1995.
