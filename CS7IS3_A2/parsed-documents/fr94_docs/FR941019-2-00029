FR941019-2-00029 FR941019-2-00020 Default tables, by their nature, may provide an easy way for reporters to estimate the quantity of certain factors they may need in order to report. By virtue of their ease of use, these tables cannot accommodate all variables involved; rather, they are based on judgments on appropriate methodologies and available data. In some fields of endeavor, there is no apparent consensus on methodologies and the quality and quantity of data needed either to develop default tables or to definitively judge their conservativeness. The default tables provided are, in DOE's judgment, generally conservative. Some commenters asked that DOE add default tables covering additional data quantification areas. While DOE agrees that the addition of tables in these documents could be helpful to reporters, their development did not warrant a delay in issuing the final guidelines and supporting documents. In many instances, measurement and other methodologies are in their relative infancy. DOE expects that data and methodologies will evolve as national and international interest continue in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions reduction and carbon sequestration. Since reporters are permitted to develop their own data and submit it to the voluntary reporting program, the program itself may aid in the development of methodologies and the accumulation of data to advance knowledge in these areas. DOE acknowledges that sector-specific documents appear to differ greatly in the detail with which applicable concepts and approaches are discussed. This distinction was especially noted in comments on the Electricity Supply Sector, Residential and Commercial Buildings Sector, Industrial Sector and Forestry Sector documents, expressing concern that the differences may indicate a higher reporting burden for these sectors. The differences in focus and depth are based primarily on the breadth of technical knowledge of each sector's greenhouse gas and emissions reduction or carbon sequestration features, including the knowledge held by each sector's population and the degree to which reporters will have or can develop sufficient data necessary for a report. These differences in focus and depth do not direct any additional or supplementary requirements for these sectors. Minimum reporting requirements, set forth in section GG&hyph;6 of the final General Guidelines, are identical for all reporters and projects, regardless of sector. 1. Electricity Supply In addition to the revisions discussed above, in response to comments on the draft Electricity Supply Sector document, the final Electricity Supply Sector document includes more prominent mention of: (1) The possible use of Integrated Resource Planning data and data development methods; (2) the role of least-cost or other dispatching modes; (3) the role of hydroelectric power in renewable energy; and (4) emissions reduction projects in electrotechnologies. The discussion of relevant electrotechnologies has been augmented in the Industrial and Transportation Sector documents as well. Comments were received on requiring reporters in this sector to use certain existing Federal or State requirements, or other existing protocols in developing reporting data. One example of a Federal protocol is the EPA's Conservation and Verification Protocol, 40 CFR Part 73, which is used in the acid rain program under title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 to determine the distribution of bonus sulfur dioxide allowances based on electricity conservation programs. Another example under the Federal acid rain program is EPA regulations providing for monitoring or estimating and reporting carbon dioxide emissions from certain boilers. Many States also have protocols dealing with estimating energy savings from demand side management (DSM) programs. While activities in this sector are characterized by an extensive array of measurement and estimation methodologies and protocols, many of which are mentioned in the guidelines and supporting documents, DOE does not require their use for the reporting program. Consistent with the flexibility of the program, reporters may choose to use appropriate protocols and data developed for other reasons, including compliance with Federal and State requirements. Significant revisions to some of the examples for this sector were made in response to comments that the scenarios and quantification specifics provided were unrealistic. In addition to these revisions, the language of the caveat discussed in section II.C.7., above, has been added to the presentation of all examples for the purpose of indicating that the example is meant to illustrate concepts, not to prescribe the use of specific approaches.
