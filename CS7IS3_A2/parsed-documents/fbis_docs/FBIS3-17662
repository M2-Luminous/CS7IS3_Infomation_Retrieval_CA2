We have invited you to participate today in the solemn signing of our first Constitution -- the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus -- which we adopted at the 14th session of the Supreme Soviet on 15 March. I have repeatedly noted that the Constitution was worked out during two and a half years with the participation of all members of the Supreme Soviet Presidium, who also acted as members of the Constitutional Commission. Also participating in the work on the Constitution were the majority of our deputies, the government, leading lawyers and scientists of our Republic, and the voters, who came forward with many proposals and remarks after the draft Constitution was published in the media. All this was taken into account, and it contributed to the adoption of the Constitution in the present form. I would like to point out that this Constitution emphasizes and protects civil and human rights for the first time. The Constitution, for the first time in the Republic of Belarus, defines our political system. It has pronounced that Belarus will be a presidential republic. Tomorrow, we will debate legislation concerning elections of the first president of the Republic of Belarus. The Constitution, for the first time in history, approves the Constitutional Court, which has not existed in our public life, and includes an entire range of other proposals. Therefore, before signing the Constitution, I would like to congratulate all members of the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government, all people's deputies, people who participated in the work, and all citizens upon the adoption of this important, basic law in the life of our Belarusian people. I believe that the Constitution will become the first, extremely important step toward strengthening the independence of our state -- the Republic of Belarus.
