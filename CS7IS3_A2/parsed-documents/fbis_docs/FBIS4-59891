In exclusive remarks to MENA correspondent in Tunis, 'Abd-al-Rahim noted that the council will hold its first meeting in Cairo following the 'Id al-Adha to distribute the portfolios and responsibilities among its members. After that, all the council members will return to the homeland following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho. 'Abd-al-Rahim said that during its meeting in Tunis last night the Fatah Movement's Revolutionary Council decided to form several committees to work out a plan for the Fatah cadres to return to the homeland with specific assignments and instructions. Under this plan, each cadre could work in his area of specialization within the National Authority's institutions. 'Abd-al-Rahim added that the Fatah Movement's Revolutionary Council stressed the need for the movement to actively and effectively participate in the Palestinian National Authority to strengthen the Palestinian newborn authority. The Revolutionary Council, he added, backed the Central Committee's decision on the need for Fatah's effective participation in the National Authority's council and institutions in a way that reflects the movement's magnitude and role in the Palestinian struggle and to guarantee success for these institutions. 'Abd-al-Rahim added that this will ensure that the beginning in Gaza and Jericho will be the first step toward the liberation of the homeland and the restoration of the Palestinian people's national rights. He noted that the Revolutionary Council also made a decision securing the return of most of the movement's cadres to Gaza and Jericho so they could assume their responsibility and consolidate the newborn authority, which is the fruit of many long years of struggle by Fatah. Concerning the reasons for the delay in signing the executive program of the Palestinian-Jordanian economic agreement, 'Abd-al-Rahim said it was due to two points related to banking coordination and supervision in the self-rule area. He pointed out that in light of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and the gains made by the Palestinians under the agreement, sound operational mechanisms had to be found to put the Palestinian-Jordanian agreement into effect and establish excellent ties between the two sides as well as between the Palestinians and other Arab countries.
