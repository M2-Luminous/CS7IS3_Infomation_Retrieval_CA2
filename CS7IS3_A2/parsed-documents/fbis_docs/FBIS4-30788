Marash Mirashi: [Mirashi] At the beginning of today's hearing, Chairman Celiku requested explanations concerning the indictment from defendant Aranit Cela. In a very long speech in which slogans were not absent, the former prosecutor general, chairman of the High Court of Appeals, and deputy chairman of the Exile-Eviction Commission for half a century, presented himself to be innocent. Defendant Cela is charged with abuse of position resulting in violation of the fundamental freedoms and rights of citizens and illegal arrests as a result of the application of the State Security platform approved by the Politburo of the Party of Labor. He is charged with a large number of illegal exiles. Defendant Aranit Cela is also accused of illegal convictions regarding exiles and evictions, exiles that go back as far as 45 years. What is worthy of stressing is the fact that Cela committed exiles and evictions without a court's decision, without declaring the persons guilty. Defendant Cela himself declared that they had also exiled persons that represented only a potential social danger, such as the case of innocent persons pursued or surveyed by the State Security. In this framework, we have carried out exiles en masse of the inhabitants of border areas under the pretext that they, one day, could cross the border, Cela said. According to the prosecutor, defendant Aranit Cela approached the evidence of the indictment. Prosecutor Fana said that in the judicial language, social danger is a sack for everybody. The same charges fell on former prosecutor general Rrapi Mino. Among the monotonous rhythms of an oblong speech, the heat, and the claims of innocence by defendant Mino, the reporters, through a complete indifference, almost emptied the hall. Defendant Rrapi Mino stated that he had never violated the law. After several questions by Chairman Celiku, the answers of the defendant Mino proved to be very disoriented. With his intrusion based on charges, Prosecutor Fana, in a very correct way, presented facts and arguments of the committed murders. The counsels for the defense followed the tune of their clients. At this, today's hearing closed. The next session opens at 0900 tomorrow.
