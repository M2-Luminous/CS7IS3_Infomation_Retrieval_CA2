It regulates the structure of the judicial system on the basis of the 1991 Constitution. Under this act, the judiciary will consist of three independent parts: law courts, prosecutor's offices, and investigative bodies. The act provides for the setting up of courts of appeal, a Supreme Cassation Court and a Supreme Administrative Court, beside existing regional, district and military courts. Thus the presence two-instance system is replaced with a three-instance one. The Supreme Cassation Court (SCC) is the final authority on criminal and civil proceedings. It will exercise supervision over all law courts. The court will also exercise appellate jurisdiction over all judgments and orders of the courts of appeal. The SCC will have a civil, criminal and military divisions. The Supreme Administrative Court (SAC) will exercise supervision over administrative proceedings. It will be the court of last resort to rule on the legality of administrative acts. It is the only authority to rule on the legality of acts issued by the executive. So far the functions of a Supreme Cassation Court and a Supreme Administrative Court have been performed by the Supreme Court. The structure of the prosecution will be analogous with the structure of the court authorities: Bulgaria will have district, military-district regional, military-appeals, and appeals prosecutor's offices and a Prosecutor General's Office. The prosecutors will be independent of the court. Investigators will carry out preliminary investigations in criminal proceedings. The act provides for centralized supervision of investigative services by a National Investigation Service. The National Investigation Service will investigate especially complicated cases on the territory of this country, crimes committed abroad and cases opened under legal assistance treaties with other states. In the course of debates some MP's spoke against the existence of a National Investigation Service, citing the Constitution, which does not provide for a centralized investigative body. The act regulates the status of judges, prosecutors and investigators. They will be appointed, promoted, demoted, moved and dismissed by the Supreme Judicial Council. Judges, prosecutors and investigators become irreplaceable following three years in office and are granted immunity. Immunity may be lifted by the Supreme Judicial Council, if there is enough evidence of the commitment of a public law offence. The act sets an experience requirement for judges, investigators and prosecutors. Heated debates were caused by a text in the act requiring the presidents of the Supreme Cassation Court and the Supreme Administrative Court, the Prosecutor General and the director of the National Investigation Service to have served for at least 14 years in the legal system, of which at least 5 years as, respectively, judges, prosecutors or investigators. According to Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) MP's, this text was aimed against President of the Supreme Court Ivan Grigorov and Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev, who have served only as lawyers. SDS MP's described the text as a step toward recommunization. Describing the provision as unconstitutional, they said they would refer the matter to the Constitutional Court.
