This is the result of a contract concluded in 1992 between the Russian "Konversiya-Zhilye" concern and the German firm "Buk Inpar" [name as transliterated]. Under this contract, implementation of which began in summer 1993, residential settlements for servicemen withdrawn from Germany and without accommodations are to be erected in Torzhok, Siverskaya, and Garbolovo by the end of the first quarter of this year. The contract overall is scheduled to continue through 1995 and is based on credits totaling 550 million Marks [DM] granted by German banks and guaranteed by the Russian Government. Ultimately Russian military men without accommodations should receive more than 7,000 apartments with a total area of more than 400,000 square meters. More than 20 apartment blocks have been assembled in Torzhok since August; each block has 18 or 16 apartments. Such rapid construction is possible because the blocks are assembled from modular constructions produced in Pinnow (Germany), where they are furnished with all the materials necessary for house building. They are delivered to the aforementioned regions, where Russian Federation Defense Ministry construction organizations and the concern itself assemble the buildings. "Today we have 320 servicemen without apartments," unit commander Major General of Aviation Boris Vorobyev says. "The 300-apartment camp which is being erected here will enable us to provide virtually all of them with housing by the spring. True, the process of withdrawing troops from the Western Group of Forces is continuing and new servicemen are arriving in need of apartments. So we are very much counting on the continuation of Russian-German cooperation." Unfortunately these hopes may not be justified. At the moment the implementation of the first part of the construction program is being completed -- its construction has cost DM117 million, but that is only a part of the credits needed. The German side is currently under strong pressure, according to one of the leaders of "Buk Inpar," Hans Wirtz. The idea of changing the terms of the credit agreement has gained currency in the European Community, and that could effectively jeopardize the program. If it happens, Russia will have obtained 6,000 apartments short of the stipulated number, and the Germans will lose around 150,000 jobs created thanks to this program. At the same time, continuing the program in the form projected by "Konversiya-zhilye" and "Buk Inpar" on the basis of the second tranche of credits would enable the production of modules to be launched in Russia itself. Some of the money could be assigned to organizing this production process at the Izhora plant, which is not experiencing the best of times. The use of mainly local raw materials and fabrics would enable the factory cost of each square meter of housing to be reduced by 40 percent without any deterioration in quality, and, consequently, allow the construction of an additional 30,000 square meters, to fulfill the entire program in good time. The problem of eliminating homelessness in the Army is acute nowadays, and the possibilities of funding housing construction from the state budget are extremely limited. In these conditions we would like any possiblity for nonbudget funding of housing construction for the military to be exploited 100 percent, and for more and more partners to be involved in this work.
