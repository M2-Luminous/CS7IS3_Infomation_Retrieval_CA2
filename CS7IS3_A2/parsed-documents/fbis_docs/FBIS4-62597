Convinced of their impunity, reads the Military Council's statement disseminated on the occasion, individual military officials of the Black Sea Fleet declare increasingly aggressively about their readiness to violate by force the integrity of existing borders. Moreover, Crimean President Yu. Meshkov accuses, without any substantiation, the Command of Ukraine's Naval Forces of allegedly calling for confrontation. Ukrainian servicemen decisively refute such allegations and confirm their readiness to maintain friendly relations with the Black Sea Fleet.
