The government and ruling coalition parties failed to carry out their scenario that "efforts will be concentrated on working out economic stimulus measures and on dealing with the new Japan-U.S. economic framework talks so as to tide over the Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for 11 February." We asked Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], to express his views on how to deal with the situation in his capacity as the cabinet member responsible for economic policies and trade negotiations, and also on an incident that took place toward last year-end in which he and MITI officials were at odds over personnel affairs. [Takeuchi] What will happen to measures for stimulating the economy? [Kumagai] There is no choice but to put them off. If the House of Councilors had approved the political reform bills, we would have started dealing with the issue the same evening. However, under this unstable political situation, there is nothing we can do. If we should fail to achieve the political reform as soon as possible, we will have troubles. Difficulty in Conducting Coordination Among Ruling Parties [Takeuchi] Why is it that priority cannot be given to working out economic stimulus measures, which is now an urgent task? [Kumagai] It will not do to use tricks in working out measures this time. Nor can we expect any good effects. It will be necessary to work out measures while taking into consideration such issues as how to create the Japan of the next age and how to reform the economic structure. At the same time, we also have to settle other important issues. For example, there are issues on the scale and allotment of tax cut; on how to secure financial resources for this purpose; and on how to distribute funds for public works projects. For this purpose, political coordination must be conducted among various circles with different interests. However, we cannot tackle those issues without settling the issue of political reform while relations among the ruling coalition parties remain tense. I hope our people will understand that the situation is different from the situation under the one-party rule of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. [Takeuchi] Do you mean that the people will have to "wait"? [Kumagai] No, that's not what I mean. However, the final decision on these measures can be made only when the issue of the political framework has been decided. We have been studying the economic stimulus measures at the working level and have entered the stage of the political-level coordination now. That is the very reason why we have kept stressing "the importance of political reform." [Takeuchi] The MITI bureau concerned and the Ministry of Finance [MOF] have worked out an economic stimulus package mainly consisting of "plans to win approval for implementing an income tax cut and for consumption tax increase at the same time and to implement an income tax cut in advance." Negotiations are under way now to lay the groundwork for this purpose. I understand that it has been criticized that "the bureaucrats are trying to have their own way." What do you think of it? [Kumagai] We give our full support to their efforts. Officials concerned are making moves with the approval of both Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and myself. We can make no compromise on a plan to win approval for the tax raise and tax cut at the same time. Without this approval, we will end up in issuing deficit-covering bonds without limit and lose public trust in our policies. I myself have said that "support will be given to the MOF to the very end." I think Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa shares the same understanding with me. [Takeuchi] However, a negative stance on the package has been voiced not only by the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], but also by others, including the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. [Kumagai] If compromise should be made at the present stage, the package plans may easily be abolished one by one. It is true that it is not easy to overcome opposition against the package. The final decision will be made through deliberations among the ruling coalition parties. However, we are determined to carry out many debates. Negotiations To Be Concluded Before Summit Meeting [Takeuchi] The Japan-U.S. framwork talks are deadlocked. In particular, there is an impasse in the negotiations on automobiles and auto parts, which are under the MITI's jurisdiction. How will the present political turmoil affect the negotiations? [Kumagai] Since negotiations on macroeconomic policy, including the issue of Japanese economic stimulation measures, are an important component of the framework talks, this delay in pump-priming measures is a serious problem. However, it is wrong to say that "there has been no progress at all in negotiations in specific sectors." From the beginning, Japan has asserted that "automobiles is a private sector problem." Moreover, the Hosokawa administration is trying to change the relationship between the government and the private sector. We have also stressed that the government does not intend to issue orders to the private sector. I think the United States has come to understand us more on this point. As the trade imbalance actually exists, we also think that coexistence and coprosperity under the principle of expanded equilibrium is necessary. Nevertheless, we cannot accept numerical targets. [Takeuchi] The United States has been criticizing the bureaucracy. [Kumagai] If the United States thinks that there are differences in views between myself and the administrative staff, then that is a misunderstanding. However, if they want to talk with a cabinet minister, I am ready at all times. In any case, we would like to conclude the negotiations before the Japan-U.S. summit talks on 11 February. For the Hosokawa administration, the framework talks have been inherited from the LDP administration. The summit meeting should also not be adversely affected by the talks. I hope the summit will dwell on cooperation on a global scale, and signal the start of a new Japan-U.S. relationship. Rule Violations Should Not Be Tolerated [Takeuchi] While you seem to agree completely with your administrative staff on policy, there was criticism against "uncalled-for political interference in the bureaucratic organization" in relation to the resignation of Masahisa Naito, director general of the Industrial Policy Bureau. [Kumagai] It was not my intention to raise the greater issue of the relationship between the bureaucracy and politicians in that affair. For me, it was simply a question of what to do with a lingering problem. I would like to ask the critics in return, "should the problem be left untouched?" There was a clear violation of rules, and this has been exposed to the public. If nothing was done about this, it would mean rules can be ignored. [Takeuchi] The critics say that "it is unfair that those who circulated the mysterious document [exposing irregularities in MITI personnel matters] were not punished." [Kumagai] If you want to talk about the mysterious letter, what happened after that was even more abominable. Letters and phone calls bordering on blackmail abounded, and some bureaucrats make up things to the mass media. It was like all the dirty linen of the bureaucracy was at once being washed in public. [Takeuchi] Are you saying interference will still be necessary in the future? [Kumagai] No. Generally speaking, one has to refrain from interfering in personnel matters. This time, the case was very rare and very unusual. However, regardless of this issue, I still think that it is questionable that bureaucrats are not made to take responsibility for the outcome, although they are the ones who make policy. Right now, we do not even have a system of assessing policy results. If they say they cannot take the responsibility, they should let the politicians make policy decisions. If it is "policymaking without taking the responsibility for the outcome," then it would be like an armed force with no civilian control.
