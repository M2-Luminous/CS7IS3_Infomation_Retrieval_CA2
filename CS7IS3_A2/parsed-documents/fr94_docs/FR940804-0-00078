FR940804-0-00078 FR940804-0-00022 B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 1. Proposal The proposal includes a discussion of the impact of the rule on small entities at pages 51277&hyph;8. The regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 600 et seq.) requires Federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of Federal regulations upon small entities. Agencies are required to perform an RFA where the significant impacts are possible on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and governmental entities with populations of less than 50,000. Because this action will have some impact, an initial RFA was prepared pursuant to EPA guidelines, which has been placed in the docket to this rulemaking. For the following three reasons, EPA believes the impact of this rule on small entities will be limited. First, any impact that may occur from the offset sanction is limited to sources defined as ``major'' for nonattainment NSR purposes, generally 100 tons per year (TPY) or more of a criteria pollutant, except in the more serious ozone nonattainment areas. The major sources most likely to also be small entities as defined pursuant to the RFA are in these more serious ozone areas where the major source TPY threshold has been lowered under part D of title I of the Act. Second, the amended Act also increases the nonattainment NSR offset ratio in the ozone nonattainment areas. The ratio ranges from 1.1-to-1 to 1.5-to-1, depending on the severity of the area's classification. Thus, any impact the 2-to-1 offset sanction will have may not be as significant in precisely those ozone nonattainment areas where small entities that are also major sources are most likely to exist. Third, as stated above, the only relevant impact period is 6 months in duration, since after that period the State will either have become subject to both sanctions or have corrected the deficiency and been relieved from any sanctions. 2. Comments Section II.B.1. of this document includes several comments concerning the impact of the proposed rule. One additional comment is summarized here. The commenter states that the lowering of the major source threshold under the Act exposes many more small sources to control and the likelihood of sanctions. The commenter believes that many such small sources are small businesses and that, contrary to the analysis in the proposal, an increase in the offset ratio of 0.5 could have a significant impact on the ability of businesses to find adequate offsets. 3. Response The EPA believes that the final rule will have some impact on small entities. The lowering of the major source threshold could expose more sources to the offset sanction. The EPA does not disagree that in individual cases an increase in the offset ratio could have a significant impact on a small business. However, EPA believes that the impact of this rule on small entities will be limited for the second and third reasons discussed above. Additionally, EPA notes that the impact of this rule will also be lessened by the provision in final rules that provides for the deferral and/or staying of the application of sanctions in certain instances when EPA believes it is more likely than not a deficiency has been corrected (see discussion in section II.B.3. of this document). However, because this action will have some impact, a final RFA has been prepared pursuant to EPA guidelines, which has been placed in the docket to this rulemaking. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain any information collection requirements which require OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). When the offset sanction applies, sources subject to it will not incur an additional information collection burden because sources are already required under the section 173 offset requirements to obtain an emission offset from between 1-to-1 and 1.5-to-1. When the offset sanction applies, it should not impose an additional information collection burden because sources will not have to provide any information in permit applications beyond that which is already required in the absence of the sanction. (For the information collection burden of new requirements of the amended Act for nonattainment NSR and prevention of significant deterioration, an information collection request is being prepared to support rulemaking changes to parts 51 and 52.) When the highway sanction applies, the Secretary of DOT is required to determine which projects or grants should not be affected by the sanction and which, therefore, are exempt. This determination will be based on information readily available in existing documentation gathered for the purpose of evaluating the environmental, social, and economic impacts of different alternatives for transportation projects. These analyses are required for the preparation of environmental assessments and impact statements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), (42 U.S.C. sec. 4321 et seq.). Historically, exemption determinations by DOT for sanctions have been based on such NEPA documentation and have not necessitated additional information gathering and analysis by the States. In addition, since under NEPA final environmental documents must be approved by DOT, in most cases the NEPA documentation will already be in DOT's possession. Therefore, EPA does not believe that the highway sanction, when applied, will impose an additional information collection burden on the States.
