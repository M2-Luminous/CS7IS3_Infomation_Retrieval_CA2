According to reliable sources, the delegation which had been sent by Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar to explore avenues for finding a lasting solution to the Afghan imbroglio, could not meet Mowlawi Yunus Khales and Mowlawi Nabi Mohammad, chief of his own faction of Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] and Herakat-e Enqelab-e [Islamic Revolution Movement], respectively, on Friday [21 Jan] and Saturday [22 Jan] due to some unknown reasons. The delegation, which comprises Abdol Hadi Arghandwal of Hezb-e Eslami, Hashamatollah Mojaddedi, a representative of Prof Sebghatollah Mojaddedi's Afghan National Liberation Front, Dr Talib of Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party], and Dr Abdol Karim Zaray of militia warlord Rashid Dostam's Jonbesh-e Melli Eslami [National Movement], Afghanistan, also intends to meet President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to convey to them a personal message from Hekmatyar and to inform them of the four-party coordination council's stand on the fighting in Kabul. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Hezb-e Eslami, Ustad Qaribur Rahman Saeed, said that reports appearing in section of the Press on Saturday about the destruction caused by bombing in Charasyab were exaggerated. Talking to DAWN by telephone, Saeed said that, in fact, the Rabbani forces were left with very limited air power after the recent bombings and there was no question of their jets hitting Charasyab with such severity as was reported. He denied that Hezb controlled radio station, Payam-e Azadi, and a TV booster were destroyed. "Only a rocket had fallen there which did not cause as much damage as was claimed by the enemy," he maintained.
