A thorough study of the Russian Federation president's message to the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State (Main Areas of Domestic and Foreign Policy)" has been completed in the committees and commissions of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly. Specific measures have been outlined, whose implementation via the Federation Council will guarantee steady cooperation among all the branches of power in the interests of democracy and prosperity in Russia. We welcome the political desire expressed by the Russian Federation president in his message to further pursue the reforms course and unite all constructive forces in society with a view to carrying out systematic, joint, and creative work for the good of the country and its citizens in order to strengthen the Russian state. We view the pact on achieving civil accord in Russia as an important step in implementing the Russian Federation president's message, enabling us to establish democratic control over the commitments taken on by all branches of power, parties, and social organizations and movements. We share the Russian Federation president's view that in Russia today there is no firmer basis for achieving civil accord in society, emerging from the crisis, and successfully continuing progressive transformations than the Russian Federation Constitution, adopted by nationwide vote in December 1993. Our task is to realize in practice the full potential of our state's fundamental law. In this connection the Federation Council supports the proposal by the Russian Federation president to establish a united constitutional commission and a united working group to coordinate and enhance the effectiveness of legislative activity. In formulating plans for legislative work, the Federation Council will be guided exclusively by its own constitutional powers and the standing orders of the first convocation of the Federation Council formulated on the basis of the Russian Federation Constitution. The message rightly stresses that power in a rule-of-law state is bound by the law. The place and extremely important role of the Federal Assembly and its chambers within the existing political system in Russia is determined by this fact. We share the concern expressed in the message that practical mechanisms for promoting democracy in Russia are underdeveloped. At the present time work has been initiated by the Federation Council within the limits of the chambers' powers as enshrined by the Russian Federation Constitution to create effective legal mechanisms of power within the Russian state both at the federal level and in the components of the Federation. The Federation Council supports the Russian Federation president's stance regarding the need to find a sensible relationship between the speed of reforms and the real social cost of the reforms, bringing into play all available reserves including effective state regulation compatible with market mechanisms. We believe it necessary at federal, regional, and local level to urgently implement a set of measures to achieve actual realization of the provisions of the Russian Federation president's message. We favor constructive and reliable cooperation among all the federal power structures. We hereby announce our refusal to countenance any contradictions dictated by the interests of political opportunism that hamper the normal exercise of the Russian Federation president's powers and those of the Russian Federation Government. At the same time we are entitled to count on a similarly responsible attitude from the Russian Federation president and the Russian Federation Government regarding problems on which the Federation Council focuses its attention. To date, unfortunately, there have been several occasions when appeals by the Federation Council on extremely acute problems of economics and politics have not met with an appropriate response from the executive branch. For all the different peoples who live in our state, regardless of their ethnic, religious, and linguistic groupings, this country is their common home. None of them should be placed in an unequal legal or moral position. It is particularly important to stress this fact today, when the country is making the transition from a monopoly ideology to cultural diversity. In accordance with the spirit of the Russian Federation president's message, the Federation Council is exercising all its constitutional powers to restore, strengthen, and develop the values of this Russian superethnic community which is unique in the world. In its daily cooperation with the State Duma, the Russian Federation president, and the Russian Federation Government, the Federation Council intends to actively establish constructive political, economic, scientific, and cultural ties among all components of the Federation and to strengthen the planned accord among political parties and national, social, and political movements. Once again stressing its fundamental agreement with the spirit and letter of the message, the Federation Council insistently requests the Russian Federation president and Russian Federation Government to make every possible effort to encourage strict observance of the provisions and standards of the nationally adopted Russian Federation Constitution, the Federation Treaty, and Russian Federation laws, and to create favorable conditions for the rigorous implementation of these provisions and norms. We believe it necessary to speed up the preparation of a program of practical actions across the entire spectrum of domestic and foreign policy areas formulated in the Russian Federation president's message. The Federation Council sees the path to strengthening the Russian state lying through united political will, civil accord, and cooperation among all the branches of power and the citizens of Russia, and it will make every effort to encourage rapid progress along this path. [Signed] The Federation Council of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly
