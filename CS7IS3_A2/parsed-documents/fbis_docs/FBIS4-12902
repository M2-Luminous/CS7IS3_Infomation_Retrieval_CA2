Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock has received a new veneer of gold as part of a two-year renovation project. His Majesty King Husayn paid $8.25 million for the restoration. The official opening ceremony is scheduled to take place at al-Madinah al-Riyadiyah (Sports City) sport center in Amman at 11 am [0800 GMT]. After a speech from His Majesty, the covering of the shrine will be removed and the Dome of the Rock will be officially reopened. Due to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, none of the attendants will actually see the Dome of the Rock first hand. Instead, Jordan TV will transmit the unveiling via satellite from Jerusalem in the first ever live broadcast from the Occupied Territories. Jordan Radio will also cover the unveiling.
