This week the former unity was no longer there. The government decree "On Coordination Organs on Currency-Financial Questions," in spite of its conciliatory name, by eliminating the currency-economics commission, could aggravate the age-old interdepartmental dispute about access to the distribution of Western credit. At the meeting of the government commission on operational issues, the latest version of the new import tariff was approved, and in parallel the GTK [State Customs Committee] with its instruction, "On Exemption From Payment of Customs Duties of the Russian Fund for Disabled Veterans of the War in Afghanistan," is legalizing the almost forgotten but still no less attractive practice of granting customs benefits just like that--for an organization. As a result, there are gaps in the system of regulation, of which participants in foreign economic activity could very well take advantage. The Ministry of Finance Has Its Own Credit, and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations Has Its Own The restructuring of the government apparatus, which was brought about by the reduction by half of the number of deputy prime ministers, was reflected particularly in the elimination of the currency-economic commission, "because the tasks assigned to it had been performed." This wording, unfortunately, does not mean that there is no centralized currency left at all. It comes from two main sources: exports credited to state quotas and foreign credits. The former is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, as the holder of budget funds. It has the firm intention of taking control of and distributing Western credit granted to Russia. But in practice, although the conclusion of the Ministry of Finance will be taken into account in each specific case, the old method is most likely to be used: the submission of the question at the level of some collegial government organ. And it will have to weigh the claims of the departments, that is, at least a deputy prime minister will have to head this commission. Of the available deputy prime ministers, only Oleg Soskovets is suitable for playing this role, and he is already in charge of a commission on operational issues, which will actually expand its authority. For now the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations [MFER], under whose wing the Russian Export-Import Bank (Roseksimbank) is being created, will provide an example of independent extension of lines of credit. While Roseksimbank must initially grant ruble credit to producers of export products, in the future it will not be prohibited from drawing to itself some of the credit of "related" Western banks, in whose distribution the MFER will not have the last word. The credit priorities of the MFER have already been determined: joint-stock companies and state enterprises under its jurisdiction. The New Import Tariff Has Not Even Been Adopted, but Ways Around It Have Already Been Devised At the meeting of the commission on operational questions, which in principle approved the new import tariff to take effect on 15 March, it was stated that the average level of customs rates ranges from 7.5 to 18 percent. On the whole, the rates are simply being increased. But, according to the assessment of the deputy minister of economics, Sergey Vasilyev, the lobbies of the Russian automotive and aircraft builders are committing "highway robbery" with their high offensive import duties. Thus, to the traditional commodity groups that enjoy increased customs protection--alcohol and liquor products, motor vehicles, electric household appliances, equipment for petroleum and gas extraction (such is the condition for receiving the associated credit from the American Export-Import Bank)--they may also add aircraft (recently Russian airline companies have preferred Boeing), products of the textile industry, and foodstuffs. The struggle of the branch representatives is not over, and the question of the customs tariff is to be considered again at a meeting of the government next Thursday. Moreover, the influence of branch lobbies is apparently becoming a permanent thing: At the meeting it was suggested that they create a Tariff-Customs Council, which would be authorized to work out operational changes in the rates of customs tariffs (the government would still make the final decision). But customs duties are not the only thing affecting the dynamic of imports. In January, when exchange rates were favorable for imports, new excise taxes led to an absolute reduction of imports as compared to January of last year. It cannot be ruled out that on 15 March the inevitable (although, possibly, partial) successes of the supporters of raising rates of the import tariff for certain branches of industry will be accompanied by a marked decline of the ruble, which will make import activity a losing proposition. But not for everyone. The GTK has returned the benefits to disabled Afghanistan veterans, the same ones that were taken away last July in compliance with the law on the customs tariff. This time the basis for the decision of the GTK was the president's edict, "On Measures for State Support for the Activity of All-Russian Public Associations of Disabled Persons." Yet under that same law (Article 34) the newly granted benefits "may not be of an individual nature." The benefits were localized by concrete contracts. It is an important precedent, however: A breach has been made in customs barriers that worsen conditions mainly for import activity, which in principle may be utilized by more than disabled Afghanistan veterans. The technology is well known: variations on the theme of sale of contracts and supplements to them as futures. But the main thing is that the Afghanistan veterans have laid a path that can now be widened, and importers and exporters have been given a point for application of their efforts.
