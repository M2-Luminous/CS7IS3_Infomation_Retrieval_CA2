Also, he said the Agrarian parliamentarians "will take advantage" of the debate of the opposition's no-confidence motion in order to present their stand on their own, while shunning certain "opinions" of the opposition. The PDAR leader said that the no-confidence motion promoted by the Democratic Convention ignored certain achievements of the ruling party. The PDAR will back it though.
