Asked why Kiev decided to deactivate the weapons, he said there was no reason to try to keep on combat duty a missile which Ukraine could not and was not going to use anyway. Tarasyuk said different options were being discussed by negotiators from Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S. on how to compensate for the transfer of nuclear weapons to Russia. However, he declined to comment on a reaction from Russia and the United States to Kiev's proposal to reduce its debt to Moscow at the cost of tactical nuclear weapons. Tarasyuk does not rule that Moscow and Washington have agreed to talk with Ukraine following the process of deactivating its nuclear weapons. But he gave no evidence to back his theory. The minister stressed that the Ukrainian government would do its utmost to lift the strings attached by the Supreme Soviet while ratifying the Start-1 agreement. Tarasyuk denied allegations of Ukrainian weapons exports to countries falling under the U.N. arms embargo such as Libya, Iraq, South Africa, and the former Yugoslavia. However, he said there were a number of incidents of weapons transfers to such countries and areas of conflict by go-between companies. The minister admitted to mistakes made in the transfer of dual purpose technologies. However, he said Kiev had at one time intervened to prevent the transfer of chemical fuel for missiles to Libya.
