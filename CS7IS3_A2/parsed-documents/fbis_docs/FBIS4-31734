Among the protesters our correspondents also spotted a group of miners who had come from Hunedoara. Also represented are the trade unions of Copsa Mica and others from the counties of Mehedinti, Galati, and other regions. From the makeshift rostrum in Aviatorilor Square the crowd was addressed by Alfa Cartel Chairman Bogdan Hossu, CNSLR-Fratia Chairman Victor Ciorbea, [CNSLR-Fratia] Executive Chairman Miron Mitrea, and other trade union leaders. They all criticized the Vacaroiu government, considering it solely responsible for the economic and social disaster currently facing Romania's citizens. At about 1200 the participants in the rally left Aviatorilor Square to march on the Victoriei Square-Romana Square-Revolutiei Square route. They are to return to Victoriei Square where -- in accordance with the alterations in the program arranged by the organizers of today's protests -- another rally is to take place. Both during the rally held in Aviatorilor Square and the march, the participants chanted antigovernment, antipresidential, and anticommunist slogans, our correspondents report.
