But this becomes unbearable when you realize that this is the process of creating the next administration. While the factional struggle seen in the election of the party president, hence, the prime minister, during the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] era was indeed repulsive, the people are certainly amazed at the present turmoil among the ruling coalition parties, particularly because this came after the Hosokawa administration, which upheld "new politics." The ruling parties have not even been able to decide the venue for discussions to select the next prime minister. Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Japan New Party [JNP] insist that the issue should be discussed at the "representatives meeting" composed of secretary general-level party representatives. On the other hand, leaders of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and Sakigake [Harbinger] assert that this should be decided at a "party leaders meeting." Both sides refuse to compromise. The leaders of Shinseito, Komeito, and the JNP did not attend the party leaders meeting initiated by SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama on 11 April. The basic reason is: While Shinseito and Komeito want to make the new Diet grouping "Kaikaku" [Reform] the center of activities to realign political parties, the SDPJ and Sakigake are strongly critical of the idea. Behind the SDPJ and Sakigake's opposition is their antipathy to the political style of Ichiro Ozawa, the Shinseito secretary general said to be the strong man in the ruling parties. The present pattern of balance of forces is exactly the same as that during the upheaval relating to the cabinet reshuffle--said to be aimed at "getting rid of [Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi] Takemura"--last February. Shinseito and its allies are working hard to attract former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe to their camp to cut off the SDPJ, Sakigake, and their allies, and cooperate with a section of the LDP to maintain their hold on the administration. On the other hand, the opposition LDP is aiming at recapturing political power by working with the SDPJ and Sakigake. Maneuvers to form cross alliances transcending the existing political framework of LDP versus non-LDP forces are being attempted beneath the surface. Despite the oft-repeated claim that "agreement in policy will be the basis of forming a government," in reality, top priority is being given to the question of how to maneuver to become the ruling party. The Hosokawa administration quickly lost its sense of unity after the passage of the political reform bills. Thus, the collapse of the government was merely a matter of time all along. Yet, the ruling coalition parties simply focused their energy on emotional bickering, without preparing fully for the creation of a new administration. The same is true for the opposition LDP. It is quite at a loss at the sudden collapse of the administration. One cannot even feel the LDP's ardor in putting up its president, Yohei Kono, as a candidate to recapture the political regime. There are numerous urgent issues facing Japan, such as economic stimulation, tax reform, Japan-U.S. relations, and the situation on the Korean peninsula. For one thing, the draft 1994 budget has not even passed deliberations by the lower house Budget Committee. Yet, we see no sense of urgency in efforts to form a new government. The people will be totally disgusted if the next administration is formed solely by the logic of numbers. The people should be able to see what the basis of the new administration will be, and the process of who makes the decision, and where this decision is made. When the Hosokawa administration was inaugurated, the people were in the dark as to why it was Hosokawa, and who made the decision. The formation of a government is a most vital political decision. True political reform precisely consists of making this process open for all to see as much as possible.
