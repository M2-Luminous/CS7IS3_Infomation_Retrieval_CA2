He was speaking to Willy Claes, Belgian vice prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, who visited him today. Cindoruk pointed out that Turkey's policy toward Europe is developing positively and that this is partly due to intergovernmental relations. He explained that if Turkey overcomes its economic difficulties a little more, then there will be no obstacle before its membership in the customs union. The TGNA speaker stressed that the Assembly will support the efforts to adapt the existing legislation to the customs union. Willy Claes pointed out that Turkey will join the customs union in 1995 and that this is a very important step toward full membership in the EU.
