In a mammoth march of 1.5 million people, Damascus renewed its truthfulness to the great national leader, President Hafiz al-Asad, and expressed its love and sympathy to him. TISHRIN adds: What has befallen leader al-Asad has been a blow to Syria as a whole. Every house and family are now bereaved. Yesterday, Damascus was a bright and lofty symbol of national unity whose pillars were laid down by President Hafiz al-Asad, who has strengthened this unity over the years. Al-Asad nurtured this unity by his work, sincerity, and struggle. This unity has borne fruit in terms of pride, dignity, and steadfastness in the face of enemies and suspect plots; in terms of adherence to values, principles, rights, land, and sanctities; and in terms of the relentless defense until the return of all the occupied Arab territories and the establishment of the Palestinian people's rights. TISHRIN says: Today, Syria is waging its greatest ever battle, namely, the battle for a just and comprehensive peace that will end occupation, return the land, and establish rights and truth. TISHRIN notes that the firm national unity as expressed by our people on this great national loss, and which Damascus expressed by its mammoth march, will strengthen Syria's stand in its fierce battle for just and comprehensive peace. Concluding, TISHRIN says: The great departed has left pain and sadness among his family and the Syrian families, but leader al-Asad has always derived strength and determination from the people's trust and waged the greatest and most noble battles. His last battle, the battle for a just and comprehensive peace, will be a new deed to be added to his many immortal deeds. The newspaper AL-THAWRAH stresses that the march that was staged in bereaved Damascus yesterday was an expression of the sincerest condolences to leader al-Asad and his honorable family on this grievous calamity. Al-THAWRAH says: This shocking calamity was unexpected. However, God's will is unavoidable, and the patient believers are the only ones who can stand fast and pass this test. Just as he has always been at all difficult times and in misfortunes, President al-Asad was, despite the calamity, the great leader and father whose heart has enough room for everyone and for all griefs and sorrows. He is the one who consoled all the sons of the nation who were bereaved of the noble knight, Basil. AL-THAWRAH explains the nature of the stage and the size of the grave threats and challenges to the homeland and the nation. This, the paper say, necessitates that we rise above our pain and heal our wounds in order to continue the battle of existence and destiny and of restoring rights. AL-THAWRAH adds: The Syrian people were not alone in living the sorrow and anxiety, for the entire nation, throughout the greater homeland, mourned and shed tears on the departure of the knight Basil out of their faithfulness to the leader and father who carried their pan-Arab issues and concerns and who has honestly defended and is still defending them. The people and the nation stood at the side of President al-Asad, wishing him long life and strength so he will continue to be the inspired leader under whose banners the people will continue to line up and to seek support against tragedies and misfortunes. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: This is loyalty and faithfulness. Our people, who staged marches in Damascus and all the governorates yesterday to mourn the deceased, and who showed the greatest images of cohesion and national unity, are the same people who pledged allegiance to President al-Asad as a leader forever, and adhered to his triumphant march until the full liberation of land and the restoration of rights.
