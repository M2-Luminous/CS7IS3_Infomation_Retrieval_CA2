The 12-member committee was created by a governmental decree, apparently overriding what informed sources said was resistance by Chad's warlord President Idriss Deby to the formation of any such body. The decree charged the new commitee with "forming contacts and opening dialogue in the country's interior and negotiating with political-military groups." The 12-member body has two representatives from the government, two from the provisional parliament known as the Higher Transitional Council (CST), two from political parties, two from human rights associations and four other well-known figures. The National Sovereign Conference, a body of various political and interest groups set up to chart a new democratic constitution and set up an interim government, urged formation of a reconciliation committee when it closed work in April 1993. The main armed rebel movements targeted are the National Salvation Committee for Peace and Democracy in the south, the Chad National Front in the east and the Movement for Democracy and Development in the area of Lake Chad. According to former prime minister Fidel Moungar, who was chosen by the National Sovereign Conference but later ousted by the provisional parliament, Deby wanted to handle rebel matters his own way and long resisted forming any reconciliation committee. But Moungar noted that the return to Ndjamena of former dissident leader Abbas Koty had been negotiated by aides close to Colonel Deby without any involvement by the government and Koty ended up being killed last October at the time of his arrest. The government finally went ahead with the committee's creation after its negotiations with the National Salvation Commitee in Bangui in February broke down.
