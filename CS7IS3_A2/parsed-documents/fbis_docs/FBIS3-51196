In view of the circumstances, the Council deems it necessary to state the objective and patriotic position of the Armed Forces to the Honduran people to prevent continued speculation on the subject by sectors not necessarily interested in social peace or the national well-being. Therefore, we hereby state our position under the following terms: 1. The Honduran Armed Forces, as a part of Honduran society, have developed and will permanently develop a plan to participate in actions for our homeland's modernization, reconciliation, social peace,and human and economic development. Our only interest is promoting the people's well-being and Honduran progress. We are aware of the fact that without our participation, we would not have reached the state of human solidarity and the opportunities for development we can justly expect today. 2. The historical circumstances that existed in our country during the eighties cannot and should not be radically analyzed or isolated from the ideological, political, and economic context that characterized the Cold War. During that period, antagonistic forces maintained a climate of confrontation not only in Honduras, but in the entire world. 3. Therefore, within the fast moving process of society's transition toward total respect for human rights within a pluralist and participative democracy, the Honduran State and its national institutions have clearly defined the levels of participation and responsibility in the efforts to reconcile the Honduran family and consolidate democracy. We feel we have contributed to those lofty objectives and we are proud of the role played by our institution, with loyalty, honor, and sacrifice. 4. We categorically reiterate our commitment to abide by the Constitution and laws as the essence for our professional duties and responsibilities. Within that concept, we believe that the entire process for investigating the actions that motivated this communique must be carried out based on legal grounds, and not on sectarian positions and obscure interests. 5. The actions carried out by Division General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, commander in chief of the Honduran Armed Forces, have been and continue to be consistent with the task of democratizing and modernizing the Honduran State. The military institution takes part in the process of modernization and professionalization. Hence, we publicly express our strongest "vote of confidence" to him, supporting his actions. We also believe he should continue performing his constitutional duties as commander of the "people's armed branch." Hence, it should be clearly established that the Armed Forces and its commander in chief constitute an indestructible unity at the service of our homeland, and that it will act within the framework of the law to defend the institution's unity, permanence, and stability, for the benefit of the national community. 6. Finally, we believe that our fatherland should come first in our plans and goals. The Armed Forces have faith in the nation's future and will continue to be a decisive factor for the achievement of the people's aspirations, guided by the principles of national reconciliation and respect for the law. Consequently, we clearly and categorically affirm that it will not be the differences that separate us, but the ideals that unite us, which will help Hondurans build the fatherland we all want: high in the eternal dream of our civic glories and great in the minds of its best children.
