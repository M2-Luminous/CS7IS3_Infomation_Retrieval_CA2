This important event in SRV-Malaysia neighborly ties attracted good attention in the region and the world. This successful visit not only further strengthens SRV-Malaysia friendship and cooperation but will also contribute to futhering the aspirations of the people of Southeast Asia for peace, stability, development, and prosperity. During his stay in Malaysia, our general secretary was solemnly and warmly received by the highest government leaders, the ruling National Front, the United Malays National Organization, and the Malaysian people. Talks between General Secretary Do Muoi with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed on ties and issues of mutual concern were held in an atmosphere of sincerity and friendship. Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi highly evaluated Malaysia's great national development achievements, which have been rapid and stable, and its increasing world reputation. He thanked the Malaysian Government for its sincerity in sharing its precious experience in national development and management. He aslo welcomed Malaysia efforts in strengthening and expediting relations with Vietnam. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed expressed his admiration at Vietnam's economic development and belief that Vietnam will develop and prosper like other nations in Southeast Asia. General Secretary Do Muoi's visit has enhanced the mutual understanding and trust between the leaders and peoples of the two countries. Vietnam's important achievements in the renovation and its open-door foreign policy to diversify and multiply party and state ties, together with the Malaysian Government's policy of improving relations with Vietnam are very important elements for both countries in developing their potential and accelerating friendship and cooperation for their peoples. Among new developments in Southeast Asia and in the Asia Pacific, Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi's visit is a new and vivid manifestation of Vietnam's policy of wanting to befriend all nations to strive for peace, independence, and development. Vietnam has joined the Bali Agreement, become an ASEAN observer, and participated in some ASEAN activities in preparation of its joining ASEAN at an appropriate time. Persisting on the four-point policy announced by General Secretary Do Muoi in Bangkok in his October 1993 Thailand visit, Vietnam supports initiatives for increased cooperation. This includes Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed's initiative on the East-Asia Economic Caucus. Vietnam is also ready for joint cooperative institutions in the Asia Pacific such as the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council [PECC], the Pacific Basin Economic Council, and so forth. At the 10th PECC General Meeting in Kuala Lumpur on 25 March, our general secretary emphasized Vietnam's consistent policy in maintaining good ties with nations in the Pacific. Vietnam places on priority the duty of broadening cooperation with nations in the Pacific and the development of ties with all nations in the world for the acceleration of better and broader friendship and cooperation with neighboring countries in Southeast Asia. At the same, it advocates negotiations to settle all things left over by history or newly arising problems. We ensure that all nations in the Asia Pacific will find in Vietnam a positive counterpart and a reliable customer. Our open-door foreign policy, independence, and sovereignty has been welcomed by friends. Malaysia highly evaluates the positive developments in bilateral ties. The SRV-ASEAN ties has opened many potential areas for long-term cooperation. It also emphasizes the need for a common voice on issues of mutual concern. Our people welcomes the success of General Secretary Do Muoi's visit to Malaysia. We are happy at the new developments in SRV-Malaysian friendship and cooperation, which meet the aspiration and benefit of the peoples both countries for peace, cooperation, development, and prosperity in the entire region.
