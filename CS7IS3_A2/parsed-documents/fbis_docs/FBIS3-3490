The Second Session of the National Committee of the Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] ended in victory on 19 March. The "two meetings," which were convened in the early spring of this year, have distinctly reflected the basic policy of the entire party and of the national work for this year, the overall situation of the entire party and the national work, and the will and wishes of the people of all nationalities in the country. There were meetings on democracy, reality-seeking, unity, and encouraging all to forge ahead. The meetings will surely produce a major impact on propelling reform and opening up, on economic construction and on comprehensive social progress, and on promoting the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland. NPC deputies and CPPCC members highly evaluated Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report." They said this "Report" takes China's overall situation into consideration, seeks truth from facts, urges all to forge ahead, and will encourage the people of all nationalities to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, maintain stability, and comprehensively fulfill this year's various tasks. The outstanding achievements of this year's "two meetings" lie in the NPC deputies' and CPPCC members' further unifying understanding of the overall situation of the entire party and of national work through their examination and discussion of the "Government Work Report" and through other reports, and in their unanimous support for the belief that all work must be subordinate to and serve the overall situation's strategic requirements. Following the closing of the "two meetings," some 3,000 NPC deputies and 2,000 CPPCC members will return to their own regions and respective posts to spread and implement the guidelines set forth at the meetings, which will surely help the entire nation become united and work with one heart and one mind to fulfill new tasks. Correct understanding and handling of the relationship among reform, development, and stability is the key to victoriously realizing the tasks set forth at the meetings. Development is the goal; reform is the impetus: and stability is the guarantee; the three complement one another; the three are inseparable; neglect of and inattention to any of them will result in harmful effects. Only by paying equal attention to them and by skillfully handling the dialectical relationship among them will we be on the road to success and victory. This has been an in-depth summing up of the historical experience since our country adopted the policy of reform and opening up. This year marks a crucial year for a planned economic system in transition toward a socialist market economic system, and a year for tackling difficult reform measures. A number of major reform measures have been introduced since the beginning of this year and they are being implemented in a steady manner. The depth, breadth, and force of the reform are unprecedented. Seen from the general trend of this year's reform, development, and stability, reform occupies a pivotal status. Fresh changes, new trends, and new characteristics arising from the relationship of reform, development, and stability will bring forth a series of new problems; thus arises the need for us to pay extra attention to handling well the relationship among reform, development, and stability; to promote a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy in the course of steadfastly promoting reform; and to reinforce the foundation of political and social stability. At the same time, promoting development to support reform and promoting stability to ensure reform are of utmost importance in consolidating and developing an excellent situation. Adhering to the policy of "carrying out the policy of promoting the reform and opening drive with one hand, cracking down on severe crimes with the other, and putting an equal emphasis on both," and enhancing socialist spiritual civilization building and democratic legal system building are the important aspects of triumphantly realizing the tasks set forth at the meetings. During the "two meetings," Comrade Jiang Zemin said the more we promote reform and construction, the more we need to stress ideals, discipline, unity, and the overall situation and to further develop this kind of spirit within the party and among the people in the nation. The "four stresses" are very important and are needed for promoting reform and construction. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics and building our country into a socialist nation which is rich, strong, democratic, modern, and civilized are the common ideals of the people of all nationalities at the present stage. We must uphold this ideal and help forge an even closer unity among the people of all nationalities to realize that grand goal. We should advocate taking the overall situation into consideration. Our remarks and actions should be conducive to the overall situation. Leading cadres in particular should correctly handle the relationship between the central and local governments and between overall and partial interests. We should strictly abide by discipline, implement the principles and policies worked out by the CPC Central Committee to the letter, and help maintain the centralism and unity of the CPC Central Committee. In carrying out a great cause of unprecedented socialist modernization drive in such a large country as ours, only by persisting in stressing ideals, discipline, unity, and the overall situation will we be able to provide a powerful ideological, political, and organizational guarantee for the smooth development of various undertakings. A rapidly developing situation and great and arduous tasks require leading cadres at various levels of party and government departments to further raise their understanding, change their work styles, and work in a down-to-earth manner. It is necessary to understand both domestic and foreign situations in a comprehensive and correct manner. We need to understand not only that we indeed face great and excellent opportunities for reform and development, but also that difficulties and potential risks may lie ahead; we should neither be overly optimistic because of a good situation, nor should we waver in our confidence because of existing problems and difficulties. All in all, we should remain sober-minded; guard against arrogance; be patient; be prepared for danger in times of peace; work hard; and perform well in our work. We must firmly keep in mind that wholeheartedly serving the people is our fundamental purpose. It is necessary to forge close ties with the masses, listen to the calls of the masses, and help them solve their difficulties. We need to increase our efforts to build a clean administration; combat corruption; advocate the honest performance of official duties; wage a resolute struggle against corrupt elements and corrupt phenomena. As new situations and new problems constantly appear in the course of deepening reform, leading cadres should try to overcome bureaucratism and formalism; go deep into reality to conduct investigations and study; call on advanced experience and advanced models; pay attention to hidden and emerging problems; adopt appropriate and forceful measures to solve problems in a timely manner; and gather all positive factors to help realize the goals of reform, opening up, and modernization construction. The people's congress system is our country's fundamental political system. The multiparty cooperation and political consultative system under the leadership of the Communist Party is our country's basic political system. Doing an even better job in NPC and CPPCC work and giving full play to the roles of the NPC and the CPPCC in the state's political life are extremely important to maintaining the country's unity and long-lasting peace and stability and to fulfilling the historical mission of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Building a socialist democratic legal system has been progressing steadily and in earnest since the convening of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. The CPC Central Committee works out principles and policies and the State Council formulates implementation plans for major issues which surface in the course of socialist modernization; those plans are sent to the NPC and the CPPCC for examination, discussion, revision, and improvements; following the adoption of the plans, people in the nation are mobilized to implement them. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, a pattern of the NPC, the Government, and the CPPCC working in close coordination and with efficiency has taken shape. Such a pattern is conducive to unifying the will of the entire party and the people in the nation and to concentrating efforts to handle major affairs; this is the characteristic and advantage of our country's political system. The "two meetings" which were held during spring two years ago implemented the essence of the remarks made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his southern China tour and the guidelines laid down at the Plenary Session of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and made a positive contribution to the entry of a new stage in our country's reform and opening up. The "two meetings" held in last spring implemented the guidelines set forth at the 14th CPC National Congress and made a positive contribution to the deepening of reform and the acceleration of development. This spring's "two meetings" comprehensively implemented the guidelines set forth at the 14th CPC National Congress and at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and made the "20-character principle" [seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability] a guide for reform and construction; this year's "two meetings" will repaint the ten-thousand-li of the spring landscape of the motherland! This year marks the 45th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China. People of all nationalities in the nation will rally even closer around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core; they will unwaveringly make great strides along the direction shown by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and by the party's basic line; and they will greet this great festival with even more brilliant achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization construction!
