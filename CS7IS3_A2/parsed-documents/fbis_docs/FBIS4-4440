I believe the peace process is moving forward. Not spectacularly, but moving forward steadily, and we have to continue the efforts of he OPAPP (Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process) and try to see if we can still further accelerate the pace of the peace process. But it is doing quite satisfactorily, and it is a factor in the improvement of the peace and order situation. That's why the president is really keen on seeing to it the peace talks of all the three panels will be further enhanced. On our part, on the part of the panel dealing with the MNLF (Moro National Liberation Front), we will have our second mixed committee meeting in Zamboanga after holy week and then in the middle of the month of April we go to Jakarta for the second round of formal talks. Exactly how will do you propose to accelerate the pace of the peace process? On the part of the holding of the peace talks, we will depend on the chairmen of the other two panels also to try to dispose of the obstacles in the way of the holding of exploratory talks or resuming the ongoing negotiations insofar as the military rebels are concerned. When you say the peace process is moving forward, this statement seems to apply only to the talks with the MNLF. That is why as I said the president has appealed to the other chairmen to try to ride over the existing obstacles there are in the way of having formal negotiations or resuming the negotiations if they have been stalled. And that's the reason why he said we should not rely so much on legal technicalities. We have to do everything in order to move the talks. There are now reportedly three communist rebel groups. So far the panel of Ambassador (Howard) Dee is dealing with the main group headed by Joma (Jose Maria) Sison and Mr. (Luis) Jalandoni. Because Jalandoni has been recognized as their chief negotiator and spokesman. So that's why Ambassador Dee is doing his best. Are there any concrete plans to start dealing with any of the rebel factions? Maybe later on. Just like our panel: we are now having talks with the MNLF, but we are also committed to later on negotiate with the MILF. Because these are all elements of our society so we have to try to do our best to have talks with them and to have an agreement with them and come to terms with them. That's the only way we can have peace, really, because these are all elements of Philippine society, the Philippine community. How long do you think the peace process will take? Oh... Another six years? I don't know. We cannot really give a time cap on these negotiations. In our case, you know that the Tripoli Agreement was signed in 1976. So we are now still in the process of elucidating and clarifying the issues that remain to be discussed, for further or later discussion. How will you deal with the apparent impatience of some groups, such as the RAM [Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa; Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] which has repeatedly rated the pace of the peace process as too slow. All we can say is we would like to conclude these negotiations as soon as possible. But as I said it's very difficult to put an exact date. On what does the success of the peace process depend on? It will hinge first of all on the sincerity and determination of both panels in each of these areas to really move the talks forward. Secondly, it will depend also on the support given to the holding of these talks by all agencies of government, the bureaucracy. And then in the final analysis, it will depend on all the support given to it by the people themselves -- by the NGOs [nongovernmental organizations], and the people in the different communities. And that's why on our part, for instance, in the panel dealing with the MNLF, we want to have different meetings, in different places in Mindanao. That has the beneficial effect of acquainting the people in each of these areas with the ongoing peace process. How can the people interact? For instance, in making preparations for the holding of the talks in certain communities, we first contact the local officials, and then inform them of the site where the talks will be held. Later on, when the talks are going on, both panels, will have the opportunity to meet with people's organizations, the NGOs. For instance before, Congresswoman Lobregat in Zamboanga City had objected to our holding talks there. Now they have offered to host, and Congresswoman Lobregat is even offering her own place for the second meeting. How will your new job as acting chief of the OPAPP affect the talks with the MNLF? It will certainly help because first of all it enhances my own status in the eyes of the MNLF and also in the eyes of the Indonesian government. We have already established a close rapport with Nur Misuari and I'm sure he will welcome this development and he will be happy to deal with us better. What extra powers or authority come with the office? The extra authority is, I have the authority now to supervise and coordinate the talks of the other panels. Will it give you more power to offer concessions to the MNLF? No. Whatever concessions I will offer will still have to depend on the president. Because he was the one who made that commitment that we are going to elevate the talks to a higher level in order to show his commitment to the peace process as a whole and to the success of our negotiations with the MNLF. What is the ideal role of the presidential adviser on the peace process? The ideal role? The role of the presidential adviser on the peace process covers a very wide scope, so it is difficult to put the pin on just one area. But in general we have to see to it that there will be a satisfactory progress in the area of negotiations with the three groups. Secondly, we also have to look after the welfare and rehabilitation of those who will decide to surrender and come within the fold of the law. In our case, one of our primary objectives in the talks with the MNLF is to attain the objective of their return to Philippine society as members of the community. Will there be any major policy changes with regard to the peace process? I don't think there will be any major changes in policy. We will have to follow the same guidelines and policies that have been prescribed by the president to the defunct NUC (National Unification Commission) and the OPAPP since it was set up last year. The negotiation panels have their own respective instructions from the president and I intend to sit down with the other two chairmen in order to get a more detailed briefing of the progress of their negotiations and how they come up to the compliance with instructions to the president. On our part we have our own manual of instructions which have been approved by the president. What innovations, new ideas will you introduce at OPAPP. I still have to go to my of office. After I take my oath of office I'll go there and get a feeling of the set up there. What is important is first of all to motivate the people in the OPAPP to discharge their duties not only properly but with the proper spirit. And the same goes for all the personnel involved in the peace process. Later on I'll contact also the other agencies in the process like the convenors in the provinces and the representatives of the different sectors. Won't your duties at OPAPP take up too much of your time which would in turn adversely affect the talks with the MNLF? I don't think so because there is an existing office organization there, a secretariat, and as a matter of fact they have been working in that line of activity since a few years ago, since the time of Cory [President Corazon Aquino], that group was there. Then they were converted to NUC when President Ramos came in and now the OPAPP. But more or less the key people are there. What are the remaining obstacles to the peace process? Well they're not really obstacles. Maybe we really have to find out whether there are adequate funds and resources for the further advancement of the peace process. Now when I say further advancement we want the acceleration of the peace process because we want the peace process to be able to contribute meaningfully towards our economic takeoff especially in Mindanao. Mindanao is part of the East Asean Growth Polygon that President Ramos wants. So if we want the Growth Polygon to really become a working concept then we have to do our part in achieving that comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Mindanao. And the other two elements, the other two negotiating panels, the same: whatever will enhance the peace and order and security situation in the Philippines will certainly help in further improving our economic image. What will the additional funds be used for. We need funds for the conduct of the talks, and funds for the rehabilitation of those who will apply for amnesty, funds for the conduct of consultations with the communities all over the country. Is the budget for the peace process inadequate? Well in our experience, the budget that we have requested is adequate but we would like to request for more prompt and speedy release of funds. Rebel personalities often accuse government of insincerity. Exactly how will government convince them of its sincerity? That is also a two-way proposition. As they say it takes two to tango. If one side perceives insincerity then of course the other side will have to make extra effort to prove that they are sincere in holding these talks. That is the key, precisely, to the success of the negotiations: the sincerity and determination of both sides to proceed with the talks in order to attain success. Because success will redound to the interest of both sides. Does government have any new ideas on how convince, for example, Luis Jalandoni and Jose Maria Sison? What I am sure of is Ambassador Dee and members of his panel are really very sincere and determined and keen on meeting with the NDF/CPP/NPA [National Democratic Front/Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's Army] panel. Only that there have been some extraneous issues introduced into the picture. For instance, they are supposed to have these exploratory talks. I see no reason why we cannot have that, it's just exploratory. But right now they are involved in discussion of issues, like the Constitution. What about the RAM? The RAM now is willing to go back to the negotiating table. They had been holding formal negotiations already but they are suspended because of some demands on the part of the RAM. But now I think they have become aware of their commitment also to participate in these peace talks, to move it forward. How will government prevent them from withdrawing again? Mayroon silang mga hiningi [They have], certain demands, so the panel is now studying how to meet some of these demands without sacrificing our integrity and our sovereignty and provided they are done within the framework of our laws. If it is within the scope of the law, I see no reason why the Philippine panel will not agree to it. Can government continue to bend over backwards just to entice rebel groups to participate in peace negotiations? On our side we are going on with our discussions, whatever agreements have been reached were all within the framework of our laws. So that's our principal guidance. I know they are now studying the requests of the RAM to see how far they can meet the requests -- still within the framework. What can we expect from the peace process. Will there be any concrete developments within the year? Within the coming year we would expect a little more, some more developments. Do you foresee formal talks with the NDF occurring within the next six months? Well, formal talks in the case of the panels which are already in it and in the case of other panels, exploratory talks. Will exploratory talks with the NDF begin within the next six months? Yes, I think it's very probable that can be brought about.
