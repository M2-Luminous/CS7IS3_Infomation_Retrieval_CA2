Northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih captured the Sabr village 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Aden in a push which took them several kilometres (miles) closer to the city, an AFP correspondent witnessed at the front line. Southern Lieutenant Muhammad Husayn accused the Sanaa authorities of using the ceasefire, announced unilaterally by Salih's government late Monday, to mass troops and tanks in preparation for the dawn advance. There were heavy artillery exchanges as southern forces tried to halt the northern tank offensive. [passage omitted]
