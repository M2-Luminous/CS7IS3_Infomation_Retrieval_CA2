The most acceptable and advantageous option for deciding the aircraft carrier's future is to sell it in its present condition (68-percent finished), according to Ivan Vinnik, deputy general director of the Black Sea Shipbuilding Plant. Another possible option for using Varyag is to remove everything possible from it and to sell its hull for use as a cruiser or other vessel. We will not break up the Varyag out of morale considerations, Ivan Vinnik stressed.
