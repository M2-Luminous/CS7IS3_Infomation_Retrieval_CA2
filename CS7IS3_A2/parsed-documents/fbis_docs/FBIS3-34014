This will serve to place Algeria on the road to democracy and national reconciliation. The JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY's Arab affairs editor commented on this saying: These official French statements constitute a blatant interference in the internal affairs of friendly Algeria. At the same time, France has acted in a silly manner towards Algeria. The editor added that if France had, for example, called for building cordial relations with Algeria then this would be reasonable. However, for officials to meddle in an internal matter which concerns Algeria, as was the case with the statements made by the French spokeswoman, then the matter is both silly and constitutes a blatant interference in Algeria's internal affairs. The editor said that if no one could be found to say this then the Great Jamahiriyah will say it [word indistinct] in a loud voice, for France continues to see itself as a colonial power and as if it is its mentor. It is as if Algeria belongs to France and Algeria sacrificed one million and a half martyrs in the battles for independence and freedom against French colonialism. Such interference, propelled by a colonialist bias, can only serve to increase the anger we feel against France, its `colonial master' mentality, and the spirit of a colonialist country.
