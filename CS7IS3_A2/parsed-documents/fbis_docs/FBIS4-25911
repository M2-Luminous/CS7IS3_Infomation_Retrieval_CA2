"We are going to be very deliberate, very firm," Clinton told reporters at the White House before meeting with bipartisan congressional leaders. He said that the proposed resolution would "include phased sanctions designed to deal not only with the actions of the North Koreans to date, but as a deterrent to future constructive conduct with regard to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty) [Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]." "I feel that we are pursuing the proper course at this time," the President claimed. Asked what he hopes for former President Jimmy Carter's meetings with the DPRK leaders, Clinton said he is more hopeful that Carter "will get a better sense from them about where they are and that they will understand that we're very firm in our position." But "there is an alternative path and a very good one for North Korea," Clinton also said, "They don't have to become more isolated; they could become more engaged in the world in ways that would be much better for their own people."
