Bronshteyn, IZVESTIYA correspondent: "KamAZ: A Year After the Fire"] [Text] Naberezhnye Chelny--Exactly one year ago, on 14 April, the largest enterprise of the KamAZ joint-stock company--an engine plant--burned nearly to the ground. Since the tragedy, KamAZ has received the Golden Globe, an award from the American Fund for Eastern Development, for its high level of production, and the Diamond Star, a prize for quality from Mexican industrialists. The auto giant was included in the catalog "The Elite of Russian Business"--"Darin-94," and its general director, Nikolay Bekh, is listed in Who's Who, a world encyclopedia representing 5000 outstanding individuals in the world. Not bad for someone whose lost everything in a fire, is it? The Iron Phoenix Naturally, things are not going all that brilliantly at KamAZ, despite all the awards and honors. Moreover, according to some indicators (for example, for solvency), things are simply bad. The main thing that they have managed to prove in the past difficult year, however, is KamAZ's capacity for self-renewal and self-development, and in conditions of general economic chaos, moreover, which is scarcely better than a fire. IZVESTIYA has spoken to its readers about the progress of the restoration of the engine plant, but it would not be out of place to repeat that this work, impressive for both scale and tempo, was accomplished with minimal assistance from the state. KamAZ had been promised 50 billion rubles (R) of gratuitous assistance; R18 billion were allocated. Matters also went badly with credits: KamAZ again received R18 billion per year at a 170 percent rate of interest. Even so, last autumn engine assembly started up at the restored (and fantastically re-equipped) plant. The restoration of this production took, apart from enthusiasm, R150 billion and $150 million. Understandably, KamAZ is up to its ears in debt. Suffice it to say that it owes upwards of R70 billion to the builders responsible for the restoration work, who are counting on the authority and stability of KamAZ, which will not let them down and will pay them when things ease up. KamAZ's salvation throughout this very difficult period has been that it never ceased operation. By assembling vehicles and selling them, the joint-stock company took in about R50 billion every month. For many, the idea of putting out trucks without power units was surprising, but, strange though it seems, there was a steady demand for them for several months. After all, many buyers had engines in reserve, and others were able to obtain them from service operations. Moreover, as has already been reported, KamAZ had efficiently arranged for the assembly of engines at others of its enterprises, if only on a small scale. There were times when the assembly line would come to a halt for short periods of time, but the hardest times already seem to be behind them. Today at KamAZ they are assembling 150 vehicles a day (they need to make 400 to do well), they have finally paid salaries for January and February, and they are starting to talk about paying the March salary. True, as before, many workers in the forging and casting plants are on mandatory leave. However, even here there has been an improvement in the situation: KamAZ now has the funds to acquire pig iron and aluminum, and by May the plants may be supplied with the resources to meet at least half their needs. Here it is appropriate to speak about another large debt of KamAZ--to the supplier plants. Since the auto plant has nothing to pay them with, they are not supplying parts. At KamAZ, there are now hundreds of incomplete trucks stowed away (in March there were 3500). Therefore the April program might seem somewhat strange: assemble 2000 vehicles and sell 3000. That is, the plan is to pull out an extra 1000 and finish them. And in general, to pay off their partners and restore the supply system, now the chief task, which is no easier to carry out than rebuilding a burned out plant. The View Through the Windshield So, now the ashes and the gigantic building site can only be seen with the help of a rear-view mirror. But what kind of prospects open up with the view through the windshield? There is no bad without good, and the problem that arose with the engines forced the KamAZ directors to take absolutely revolutionary decisions, in particular, the agreement with the American firm Cummings. This partnership was conceived of back in 1991, after the privatization of KamAZ. Energetic and purposeful actions afterthe fire by the people at Naberezhnye Chelny proved yet again to their foreign partners that they could do business with KamAZ. As the American press noted, the Cummings Company decided to stand back from the principle of slow rapprochement, speed up the deal, and expand the scale of the collaboration. As a result, it was decided to build an engine plant jointly at Naberezhnye Chelny that will produce up to 50,000 motors a year. Construction is slated for 1996, and in the meantime American engines are being installed into Naberezhnye Chelny trucks designated primarily for export. For our consumer they are rather expensive. We know that KamAZ today is not only trucks. More and more on our roads one comes across the Naberezhnye Chelny-produced, limited-run Oka, which at one time was nearly called the Kama. Last year, which was so unsuccessful for the Naberezhnye Chelny people, KamAZ put out 6000 passenger cars, increasing their production over 1992 by 40 percent. As the plant's director for passenger vehicles, Oleg Belonenko, told the IZVESTIYA correspondent, the assembly line is just about to move to the new building, where capacities for 50,000 motor vehicles a year are being created. "We financed the construction of this building out of our own funds," he said. "In this sense the fire did not affect expansion of production. You know, it's nice to hear that someone is encouraging production when everyone around him is undermining it." Not everyone knows, probably, that a program to put out city buses, the KamAZ-5262, is beginning to be implemented at Naberezhnye Chelny. An experimental model has already been tested in Kazan, and Mintimer Shaymiyev, the president of Tatariya, has already ridden in it. The bus is roomy, designed for 120 passengers (it is not hard to guess that when the president is not on board, a good 240 will squeeze in). The first industrial lot of 100 buses is expected to be put out this year, and in general the program is calculated for 10,000 vehicles a year. In short, as Nikolay Bekh, general director of the Naberezhnye Chelny auto giant, says, KamAZ is eternal and will live forever. True, some of Nikolay Ivanovich's subordinates feel that he frequently manifests excessive optimism, but it is better to have an optimist-director then a pessimist--you get nothing but melancholy from those pessimists. In conclusion, a couple of words on the fire. Evidently, the accident taught the KamAZ people something. Reports on the laying of the roof on the restored plant indicate that anti-fire zones are being put in (previously there had not been a trace of them). In addition, there is information to the effect that KamAZ for the first time intends to insure its multi-billion-ruble property according to Western standards--something which, apart from everything else, its foreign partners are insisting upon. This is probably right: you cannot trust to chance or to lightning not striking in the same place twice.
