Speaking at a nation-wide conference in the FCS in Moscow Friday, he called for combined efforts and coordinated activities by the law-enforcement bodies in the struggle against crime which had corrupted many state offices, the FCS public relations center told Interfax. The conference was attended by officials of the Prosecutor's Office, State Customs Committee, Supreme Court, tax police and border guards. Yerin said that revealing traitors was equally important for all agencies. "We struggle for the honor of the law-enforcement bodies, removing those who cooperate with criminals," he was quoted as saying. In Yerin's opinion, supported by the FCS Director Sergey Stepashin, it is necessary to develop an agreement between the Interior Ministry and the FCS clearly defining their interaction in critical and emergency situation. Acting Prosecutor General Aleksey Ilyushenko said that crime had expanded in Russia recently. He called for the return of investigation units which used to be the most professional structures within the Russian Security Ministry specializing on specially grave crimes.
