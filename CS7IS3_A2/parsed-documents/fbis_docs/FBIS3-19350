Berlusconi grew angry yesterday morning when he arrived from Arcore at his Rome house on via dell`Anima and heard people repeating Bossi's contemptuous litany of the previous day. Bossi is saying that from now on he will call you "Berluscone" or "Berluscaz"; that if there is an institutional government, you will disappear; that he allied with you because, as Machiavelli taught, if you cannot defeat an enemy directly it is better to ally with him, "to embrace him in order to hit him later"; that when he talked to you about antimonopoly measures you replied evasively that the matter will be examined by committees.... "Oh, yes? I have never talked to Bossi about antimonopoly measures or committees. But that is enough, I do not feel like discussing Bossi," Berlusconi said, waving his hand like someone trying to swat a fly. In the evening the news agencies reported other, even more sensational, political broadsides: "Berlusconi's opinion polls are false," Bossi shouted, going on to attack "the RAI-Fininvest duopoly," and accuse Berlusconi of having attacked Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] "in order to confuse matters within the pole [for freedoms]. But he cannot be the representative of economic liberalism, of small and medium-sized enterprise." And still it was not over: Bossi's big guns fired again: "Within Forza Italia there is something of the recycled Five-Party coalition; behind it there is [former Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi, `fatso.'" Bossi urged League supporters to plan their defenses: "Raise your guard! Because after the Bribe City farce, those people will return. They say that we use strong language: Yes, and we do so because we are working class people. We must not speak with affected voices, wearing toupees, in fluting tones, and surrounded by pink clouds. No! Beware, people, they are deceiving you because they are trying to return in disguise." It was an evening for Berlusconi to vent his anger. Now all that is lacking is for Bossi to urge League members to vote for the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] rather than for Forza Italia. But Berlusconi let it be known that he had taken his telephone of the hook -- no comment, nothing to add to what he said in the morning, namely, the following regretful consideration: "I console myself by thinking about [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema. I see that he is saying that if I lose the elections I will have to pack my bags and go abroad. That is progress, in view of the fact that hitherto he has been saying that he wants to see me in the street begging for charity. He must have been magnanimous enough to grant me a passport." But apart from a few reluctant comments and some compassionate head shaking, Berlusconi, who took part in "Nuccio Fava's Election Platform" on television channel one last night, explained his political strategy. His strategy is based on the belief that Forza Italia will emerge from the elections as "Italy's prime political force." "So it will be impossible to form any government without Forza Italia," Berlusconi said, issuing the following warning to Bossi: "League candidates elected partly thanks to Forza Italia's votes would never accept the idea of a government alliance that excluded us. Because that would violate their honest relationship with their own voters." So would Forza Italia join an institutional government if there were not a sufficient majority for a "full" government? Hitherto Berlusconi has refused even to consider the possibility. Now, under attack from Bossi, that is, his main ally, and therefore under attack from everyone plus one, he started by saying that he considers an institutional government "what the country needs least at present, in view of the very serious issues that it has to tackle vigorously, starting with a new boost to the economy and the struggle against unemployment." But then he decided to take the big step: "Yes, an institutional government comprising all the political forces. A transitional government to enable parliament quickly to draw up new electoral rules -- a single-candidate system in one round and, we say, also the direct election of the president -- and to hold another election as soon as possible, very soon." So Berlusconi is willing to support an institutional government. But he is nevertheless convinced that he will emerge from the electoral contest as the absolute winner. Although in the past few days he has realized that the "uninominal" contest in his own constituency, against Spaventa and Michelini, is full of dangers. "The voters will decide which force and which prime minister must have the leading role in the government," Berlusconi said confidently. He repeated this on RAI's "Election Platform", which set three National Alliance representatives (Maceratini, Ramponi, and Fisichella) against three of the Forza Italia pole (Berlusconi, Maroni, and Taradash). It was basically a debate between "separate" allies, since Berlusconi is linked to [National Alliance coordinator] Fini in the center and south and to the League in the north. Though Maroni repeated that the League rejects any possibility of an agreement with Fini, Berlusconi said that he is "optimistic" and put himself forward as the guardian of a huge single party in the near future. Yesterday evening's debate was not a very lively one, Berlusconi having again refused one with the representatives of the progressive forces.
