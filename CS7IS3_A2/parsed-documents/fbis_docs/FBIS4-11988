[Al-Majali] For over three years, the al-'Aqabah Port has been subjected to inspections. Jordan has been under siege. From time to time, there is a noticeable increase in the pressure being applied against Jordan. This has had a severe effect on the economic situation in the country. Unable to reach Jordan because of the harassments that take place, a large number of shipping companies stopped dealing with Jordan. Besides, the conditions that have been set regarding the arrangement of shipped cargoes and their quantities have led to an increase in insurance premiums, fees, and the cost of living in Jordan. Some cargoes have even been lost or unloaded at other ports. Their owners could not find them. All this has led to an inconvenient situation. In addition, we are suffering from a major restraint imposed on exports to Iraq, especially basic supplies. Of course, food and medicine are allowed, but there are complications. Other human supplies also face many complications. This has affected the Jordanian economy, which has for a long time been built on the basis that it is a main exporter to Iraq. When the Gulf war broke out, the blockade started. The Jordanian economy has been negatively affected. Under these circumstances and the extremely negative effect on the Jordanian economy, how can we go and negotiate within the peace process? The negotiator must feel comfortable and must have the feeling that peace brings benefits to everyone. Moreover, we have the feeling that many parties in Jordan feel and explicitly say that all these measures are aimed at twisting Jordan's arm and forcing it into a certain course of negotiations. We want this matter resolved, especially since all the inspections have not spotted a single violation. [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, has the decision been coordinated with the other Arab parties to the peace conference? [Al-Majali] Among other states, Jordan is the only state that has been subjected to a blockade. Our's is a Jordanian decision. But the brothers have been in the picture. They have found this to be one of Jordan's rights. [Al-Silawi] Therefore, the decision was made through coordination with the brothers in Syria, Egypt, and the PLO? [Al-Majali] I cannot say so. But in view of our constant coordination, our brothers in Syria have been contacted. [Al-Silawi] The United States says that there are discussions and proposals concerning ship inspections. What are these proposals? Will the Jordanian Government respond to them? [Al-Majali] First, I would like to emphasize that we hide nothing. We are a committed and credible state. When we say that we import nothing that violates the UN resolutions, we mean that. But they insist on inspection. Therefore, we proposed several verification methods, including the hiring of an international firm, such as Lloyds Register, so that it would send representatives to al-'Aqabah, where they can monitor traffic and send their observations and reports to the United Nations directly. This proposal was made three months ago. As we understood, those concerned have approved the proposal. But so far, nothing has happened. On the contrary, strangely enough, the number of ships that have been inspected or intercepted this year is nearly equal to the number of all ships that have been inspected in the past years. [Al-Silawi] But is there a specific commitment or guarantees concerning the international organization's resolutions on Iraq? [Al-Majali] Of course, we are committed. We are a UN member country. We respect and implement its resolutions. This is a moral commitment. The picture should be clear. How can we not be committed to an organization in which we are a member? [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, can you give us the losses in figures resulting from the inspection operations? [Al-Majali] These losses range from $300 to $400 million a year. Total losses so far have reached $1.3 billion. For the Jordanian economy, this is a very sizable loss. [Al-Silawi] Reports in the Israeli press say there is a project to widen the Jordan River to benefit from its waters, and that Jordanian firms will carry out this operation. Is this true? What do you have to say about this? [Al-Majali] I do not have any information on this. This is the first time I've heard of such a thing. However, from a quick review of the issue, I do not see any justification for this. What little what there is in the Jordan River is mineralized. The Israeli authorities are pumping this mineral water to purify the Tiberias Lake waters. [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, as journalists we feel that there is a missing link. Sometimes, we cannot understand what the government wants. For example, when we speak about the issue of Jerusalem, we do not know how to translate the state's stand on the Jerusalem issue. What are the terms of reference? We understand that only God's authority should prevail at holy places. So far, we do not understand what the government wants. What are the state's policies on these issues? There is a missing link. [Al-Majali] There is no missing link. The problem is that journalists do not carry out indepth studies. They do not come to us about these issues. But, since you have asked this question, I will answer you: When his majesty the king says that sovereignty over Jerusalem and the holy places belongs only to God, this is clear. He does not say sovereignty belongs to him, but to God. The Islamic quarters should meet and study how to achieve this, that is, sovereignty is not for Israel, which in its religious books and propaganda says Jerusalen belongs to it and that it enjoys sovereignty over it. When we say to the world at large that sovereignty belongs to God almighty, this is to emphasize that sovereignty does not belong to Israel but to god, and that we have to sit down and discuss this issue. One other thing we should not forget is that Jerusalem falls under the 1947 partition. The city and its environs are areas that were given to an international administration that did not materialize. Israel occupied the western part. There was the Jordanian presence in the eastern part. There were two parts. Western policies see it as a unified city. Most countries still do not recognize Israel's sovereignty over the occupied eastern part of Jerusalem. That's why these countries, including the United States, have no embassies there. [Al-Silawi] Jordan has asked for a clarification from the United States concerning Resolution 904. Tnis resolution is crucial if we realize that the U.S. Congress, which is controlled by the Democrats, had in the past asked that Jerusalem be the capital of Israel. [Al-Majali] The United States did not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Even so, President Bill Clinton said during the election campaign that he would transfer the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem if it did not constitute an obstacle to peace. The fact is, this is an obstacle to peace. This is something we should know. [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, are there Jordanian-U.S. contacts on this resolution? [Al-Majali] Contacts on this resolution and others are under way. His majesty the king's intervention was very clear that the United States should not veto this resolution. This also should be taken into consideration. [Al-Silawi] Mr. Prime Minister, this issue might have created a disagreement between the PLO and Jordan. [Al-Majali] The brothers in the PLO placed the issue of Jerusalem in the resolution with good intentions. They believe Jerusalem should be Arab. We also believe it should be Arab. But, the question is when to raise such an issue and in which resolution. This is our viewpoint. It was feared that the manner with which it was introduced would lead to removing it. Thus, things would become worse, or it would have been vetoed. This would have been very bad. The safest and the less damaging stand was that the United States abstained on the paragraph on Jerusalem. But, the resolution as a whole was adopted by the UN Security Council members. The deliberations took place and there was success. However, we do not wish to place the issue of Jerusalem where it could be affected. [passage omitted]
