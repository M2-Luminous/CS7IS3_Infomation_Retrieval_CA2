According to the radio station, which cited Colombian ham operator Jorge Villa, "they monitored the call for help on a shortwave frequency from a group of Cubans when the boat in which they were escaping was attacked by a Cuban gunboat." The ham operators immediately contacted a U.S. military base, explained what had happened, and gave the location of the Cubans who were quickly aided by a Coast Guard vessel and two helicopters. The attacking gunboat returned to its Cuban base, the Caracol report states, citing the ham operators. The boat was carrying approximately 70 Cuban refugees who decided to flee to the United States. The report does not indicate the final destination of the Cubans or their identities.
