They exchanged views on bilateral ties, international concerns and other issues of common interest. During the talks, Li recalled his meeting with Aho in Finland in 1992, when he stopped over on his way back from the Rio Conference on Environment and Development. "I had a fruitful meeting with you," Li told Aho. "Though the visit was short, it was very successful," Aho said. The two countries have cooperated well in political, economic and other fields in recent years, Aho said, and there remains great potential for further economic and trade cooperation. Li Peng agreed with this. He said that in recent years, the bilateral ties have been developing smoothly and that the economic and trade ties have scored relatively fast development and the trade volume has been increasing at an average two percent yearly. And the number of scientific and technological cooperative projects have reached some dozens, Li said, adding that the majority of them perform well. The two countries have also had good cooperation in the fields of culture and education, Li said. He noted that Finland has rich experience in forestry, wood processing and environmental protection. There are lots of opportunities for the two countries to cooperate in these fields, he said. The current visit here by many Finnish businessmen will help promote the contacts and cooperation between the two countries' enterprises, he said. He expressed the hope that more Finnish entrepreneurs would come and participate in China's economic construction. Talking about the world situation, Aho noted that although the Cold War is over, the new world order has not been established and there still exist many regional problems in the world. The United Nations should play an important role in solution of these problems, he said. Li said that although the world situation is moving toward relaxing of tensions, there are still many unstable factors, such as economic regression, national conflicts, and territorial disputes. A new world order should be built in which all nations, whatever their ideologies, social systems or economic development levels, can live in peace and make joint efforts to tackle the peace and development issues facing today's world, Li said. During the meeting, Li also elaborated on China's stance on human rights. Li noted that the rights to survival and development are crucial to developing countries, a proposition recorded in the Vienna declaration and program on action. When talking about human rights, differences in culture, history, traditions and economic development levels in different countries cannot be ignored, he said. He noted that China is willing to conduct dialogues in this respect with other countries on the basis of equality, mutual respect and understanding. Finland holds that the human rights issue should be discussed in a frank and friendly manner, rather than through criticizing and censuring, Aho said. Touching on China's domestic situation, Li said that maintaining stability is an overwhelming task. Only with a stable domestic political situation and peaceful international environment can a country develop its economy and raise people's living standard, Li stressed. During the talks, Aho showed much interest in China's economic performance. He told Li that the economy is growing slowly in Europe and that Finnish businesses want to intensify their cooperation with China and participate in its economic construction. This is very important to Finland's economy, he said. Aho invited the Chinese premier to visit Finland at his convenience. Li received the invitation. After the talks, the two sides signed an agreement for a cultural exchange program and a contract for the building of a disaster reduction system along the Yellow River. Among those participating in today's talks were Chinese State Councillor and Minister in Charge of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office under the State Council Qi Huaiyuan and Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs Veli Sundback. Aho arrived here this morning for a six-day official visit to China at Li's invitation. Prior to the talks, Li hosted a welcoming ceremony in Aho's honor. After the talks, the two prime ministers met with Finnish businessmen and press representatives. Asked about the talks, Li and Aho both responded that the talks were successful.
