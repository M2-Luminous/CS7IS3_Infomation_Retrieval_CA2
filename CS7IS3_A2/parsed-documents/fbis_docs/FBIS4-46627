This was stated by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk during a visit to the Zhitomir Higher Military Electronics School of the Air Defense Forces. He emphasized that work has been going on for a long time in this direction in the United States, Russia and a number of other states. The main advantage of such weapons is guaranteed destruction of military objectives.
