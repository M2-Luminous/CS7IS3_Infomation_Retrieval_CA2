FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Holly Reckord, (202) 208&hyph;3592. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Jena Band of Choctaw Indians directly descends from a community of Choctaws who resided in western Catahoula Parish, now LaSalle Parish, in the vicinity of Jena, Louisiana, since first identified by the census of 1880. The linguist Albert Gatschet reported finding three Choctaw families on Trout Creek, Catahoula Parish in 1886. The Trout Creek settlement lived in log huts on land owned by Thomas Whatley. They were known locally as the Eden Indians, the Choctaw Indians on Trout Creek, and the Whatley Indians in reference to their residences or to the landowners with whom they were associated. After World War II, most of the tribe moved into the nearby town of Jena, Louisiana. They formally incorporated in 1974, as the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, but usually refer to themselves as the Jena Choctaws. Aboriginal Choctaw territory lay east of the Mississippi River, but the Choctaws also hunted west of the river. Although wandering Choctaws had been observed in Louisiana before 1800, there is no evidence to connect any of the Jena Choctaws with the earliest Choctaw inhabitants of Louisiana. There is some evidence that they had attempted to go north to the Choctaw Nation, but returned to Louisiana from there. Gatschet's interviews, the Federal censuses, and the testimony of ancestors before the 1902 U.S. Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, known as the Dawes Commission, all substantiate that the Jena Choctaws came from Scott and Newton counties in Mississippi and probably arrived in the vicinity of Jena, Louisiana during the 1870's. Several of the Choctaws from the Jena vicinity removed to Oklahoma between 1903 and 1920, but the remnants of four families remained, thus maintaining the community. Between 1914 and 1917, a large family of Choctaws, who lived less than 20 miles east of Jena at Manifest or Aimwell, Louisiana, moved to Trout Creek and began marrying into the remaining families. Their arrival saved the community at Trout Creek near Jena, which had suffered significant losses due to the removals.
