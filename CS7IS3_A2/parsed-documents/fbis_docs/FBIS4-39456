The Russian general who spoke on condition of anonymity pointed out in an interview with Interfax Tuesday that President Yeltsin had given the Defense Ministry no instructions to start deploying peacekeepers along the border river Inguri to separate the warring sides. The Interfax interviewee emphasized that the ministry was not entitled to independently make such decisions. At the same time, he did not preclude that the peacekeeping operation could start in the conflict area within the next few days. With a majority of one vote, the Federation Council declined Yeltsin's request to send a 1,500-strong Russian contingent to the conflict area last week. The deputies decided that the Russian troops' legal status had not been worked through as thoroughly as it should have been done. Moscow did not preclude that the Federation Council would return to considering the Russian peacekeepers' deployment along the Inguri at its regular session on June 21.
