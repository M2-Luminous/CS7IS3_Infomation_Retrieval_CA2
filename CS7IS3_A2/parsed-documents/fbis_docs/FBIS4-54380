FBIS4-54380 "dreas103_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-103 Daily Report 27 May 1994 North Korea Government Asks ROK To Return `Kidnapped' Loggers Government Asks ROK To Return `Kidnapped' Loggers SK2705060594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0538 GMT 27 May 94 SK2705060594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the South Korean puppet Unification Board contended in a far-fetched way that the kidnapping of the North's lumbermen to South Korea from the far eastern region of Russia was a "defection" and even slandered the North with the absurd allegation that the North "is making it a political issue", according to a radio report from Seoul. This is a brigandish logic reversing black and white which can convince no one and a malicious challenge to the DPRK and an unpardonable criminal act. As has been reported, the South Korean puppet clique on May 18 and 20 kidnapped again six citizens of the DPRK engaged in regular Tree-felling in the far east of Russia and took them to Seoul. This kidnapping is really an inhumanitarian act of destroying happy families of members of the nation and producing more separated families and a heinous crime of leading the frozen North-South relations to an extreme phase of strain. It is needless to say that the kidnapping of lumbermen of the DPRK was a product of the intentional and premeditated anti-communist, anti-North intrigues of the South Korean puppet Security Planning Board to impair the international image of the DPRK and aggravate the North-South relations. The puppets describe our kidnapped lumbermen as "displaced persons," which is totally nonsensical. In general, a displaced person means a war refugee or a sufferer from a natural calamity. But what a war or a natural disaster hit the far east of Russia to make the lumbermen of the DPRK "displaced persons"? Still more preposterous is the claim of the South Korean puppets that the lumbermen of the North went to South Korea voluntarily. The DPRK Government shows all solicitude for the lumbermen who are devotedly working in the far east of Russia to do their bit for the prosperity and development of the country so that they may not feel the least inconveniences, and grants large state benefits to their families in the homeland. It is quite unimaginable that our lumbermen who devote themselves to tree felling with patriotic enthusiasm, inspired by the benevolence of the socialist system, should betray the beloved motherland and voluntarily go to the cursed land of South Korea, a barren land of human rights. The "exile" of the North's lumbermen advertized by the puppets is a fiction to cover up their brigandish kidnapping. Foolish, indeed, are the puppets who, after committing the anti- national and inhumane crime, are attempting to mislead public opinion by alleging that the North is making the kidnap case "a political issue". The very one making it a political issue is none other than the South Korean puppet clique which took away the North's workers to South Korea and is using them for a sinister political purpose. In order to organize the kidnapping of the North's lumbermen, the puppets "decided" a "policy of receiving exiles" at a "unification and security coordinating meeting" on April 15 and then formed even the "working measure committee" to launch into a full-scale kidnapping operation. This fact alone shows well that the puppets made the kidnapping of the North's lumbermen a political issue from the beginning. The South Korean puppet clique must stop the ridiculous acts of a thief turning on the master with a club, and unconditionally and immediately send back all our lumbermen they kidnapped this time and apologize to the nation for committing inhumanitarian act, impairing the dignity of the nation even in an alien land. If they continue kidnapping our lumbermen, not sending back the spirited ones, that will bring irrevocable grave consequences to the North-South relations as a whole and the puppets will be held wholly responsible for them.
