FR941230-2-00071 FR941230-2-00046 VI Alternative to the Proposed Final Judgment The alternative to the proposed Final Judgment would be a full trial of the case. In the view of the Department of Justice, such a trial would involve substantial cost to the United States and is not warranted since the proposed Final Judgment provides the relief that the United States seeks in its complaint, which effectively will prevent any recurrence of the alleged violation. VII Determinative Materials and Documents No materials and documents of the type described in Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b), were considered in formulating the Proposed Final Judgment. Dated: December 5, 1994. Respectfully submitted, Geoffrey Swaebe (GS 6073) Patricia L.
