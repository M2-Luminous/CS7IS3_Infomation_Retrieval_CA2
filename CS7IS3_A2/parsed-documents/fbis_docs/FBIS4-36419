This party is known for its close links with the jihad movement and fundamentalist groups in the Arab states and elsewhere in the world. These sources express the view that constant and intense contacts are being maintained between the governments in Iran and Sanaa within a period of less than a week. In this respect the two foreign ministers have met while officials in Sanaa, the last of whom was 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi, the secretary general of the Reform Party, have met the Iranian ambassador more than three times. The sources stress that the pressure brought to bear on the UAE is an attempt to shift it away from the clear stances it has adopted towards the destructive war launched by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih against the people in the south of Yemen. The sources are surprised by this alliance now formed between Iran and Sanaa, recalling that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih stood strongly on the side of Iraq during its war with Iran and sent to Iraq over 10 brigades to fight on Iraq's side against Iran.
