Of these, the ability to get control of and coordinate operations is the standard of measure showing a prime minister's working ability. How, then, does Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang score on this test? "I will get control of the Cabinet through work." This has been the pledge and regular recipe of successive prime ministers early after being appointed. However, with the vague image of the prime minister in a president-centered system, this has almost never been achieved properly due to the lack of cooperation of the ministries. Recently, Prime Minster Yi has been exercising actual coordination authority, which had practically been unheard of, over ministry operations and has been breaking long-standing practices. Some ministries, such as finance and construction, had decided on and published policies without properly going through preliminary deliberations with the Prime Minister's Office and suffered more than a little for it. Prime Minister Yi's use of his coordination authority has been to unsheathe his "sword" and turn ministries inside out. He even issued warning summons to relevant ministers. Going one step further, Yi greatly strengthened the policy-evaluation team within the Prime Minister's Office. Actually, it is a fact that up until only a little while ago, each ministry considered the Prime Minister's Office simply a place to give notice before reporting to the Blue House. This practice was particularly serious in the economic ministries, reports from which first pass through a meeting of economic ministers and vice-ministers. In view of this, the recent readjustment of items announced by the economic ministries under the management of the Prime Minister's Office signifies much. From a certain viewpoint, this can be seen as the realization of Yi's conviction that he should "guarantee the maximum autonomy of the ministries in the preparation and performance of policy, but definitely exercise his supervisory role in coordinating divergent views, and so on." Decided upon upon on 24 January, the "Farm and Fishing Village Special Tax Assessment Proposal" was originally proposed by the Finance Ministry, but was changed extensively by the Prime Minister's Office before being announced. Before this, on the 21st, "according to standard practice," the Finance Ministry prepared a revenue-source procurement proposal and made it public without consulting the Prime Minister's Office beforehand. This was because a "powerful" ministry such as the Finance Ministry has no need to concern itself with the displeasure of the Prime Minister's Office and because there had been no previous instance of the Prime Minister's Office interfering in the peculiar operations of the Ministry of Finance. The situation, however, changed at the instruction of Prime Minister Yi. Because there were problems with the Finance Ministry's proposal, such as that the Farm and Fishing Village Special Tax would be a great burden on those in low-income brackets, it was ordered that the Prime Minister's Office review the proposal. Changing the proposal and aiming for those in high-income brackets, the Prime Minister's Office created a revised proposal whereby the wealthy would pay the Farm and Fishing Village Special Tax, as well as a golf-course entrance fee and an integrated land tax, but would not impose these taxes on companies moving to rural areas and those in low-income brackets. Afterward, at an unscheduled meeting of the heads of relevant government ministries, departments, offices, and bureaus, held on the instructions of Prime Minister Yi, the already-published Finance Ministry proposal was repealed and the Prime Minister's Office's revised proposal was adopted. "The operations of the economic ministries in fact had extraterritorial rights within the Prime Minister's Office," according to the evaluation of one source associated with the Prime Minister's Office, "There had not been a case such as this one, in which the Prime Minister's Office intervened and changed a Finance Ministry proposal." Another case in which with similar form Prime Minister Yi exercised his operation-coordination authority was the Ministry of Construction's "Capital Maintenance Plan Law, Enforcement Ordinance Revision Proposal." This proposal, about which preliminary notice had been given that it would be introduced as a legislative bill, changed capital development strategy 180 degrees, such as allowing the construction of large buildings anywhere in Seoul if only 10 percent of the construction costs are paid in advance. The Ministry of Construction on 25 January held party-government consultations and unilaterally announced the proposal without going through preliminary deliberations with the Prime Minister's Office or even informing the office of the content of the proposal. Considering this a problem, Prime Minister Yi in his weekly report on the 28th reported to President Kim Yong-sam on the problem of the decisionmaking process of the Construction Ministry's proposal. He also had his office come up with supplementary measures. In connection with this, President Kim, in his weekly chief-secretaries meeting held on this day in the afternoon, said concerning the construction ministry proposal, "We must not have an immoderate removal of regulations." On the 29th, Prime Minister Yi even called Construction Minister Kim U-sok and received a progress report. In this process, Yi sent a directive to each of the ministries, giving strict orders, "Plans which are to become legislative bills must pass through interministerial deliberations, but a preliminary report must be made on everything two days prior to publication." Besides this, the Prime Minister's Office's unprecedented, active exercise of its operation-coordination authority has also been seen in almost all policies, such as the Water-Quality Management Measures, since Prime Minister Yi took office. With one section responsible for this, it was no more than a formality. However, Prime Minister Yi expanded the policy-evaluation function of the Prime Minster's Office to four sections, making his control of the ministries more concrete. "The administration has made many policies, but there is no place to appropriately evaluate these," said Yi on the 31st, revealing his reasons for strengthening his policy team. Evaluation results are reported directly to President Kim.
