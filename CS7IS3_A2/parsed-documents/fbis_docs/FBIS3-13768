We have not heard the Jerusalem Committee, which is made up of Arab kings and presidents, breaking its silence to submit an oral or written protest telling that person sitting in the White House that Jerusalem was Arab before he was born and that it will be Arab eternally. The Arab League, which speaks on behalf of the Arabs, has not called an emergency meeting to discuss this serious shift, which threatens Arab rights to Jerusalem. Not a single foreign ministry throughout the Arab world has issued a statement, not even a one-page statement, saying that the Arabs reject the provocative U.S. statements and demanding an explanation, if not an apology. Do these remarks mean that the United States has unilaterally decided to change the bases on which the Madrid peace process was founded? What kind of talks are these if everything is being determined away from the negotiating table and without involving the negotiators? Can America put on priestly robes and claim to be honest and neutral after this? With the new Balfour Declaration he just made, Clinton has stooped to the level of blatant bias toward Israel at the expense of Arab rights. We do not dismiss the possibility that he might come out on us one ill-omened morning to announce the movement of the American Embassy to Jerusalem. O Arabs, wake up and stand up as one man so that we do not lose Jerusalem forever.
