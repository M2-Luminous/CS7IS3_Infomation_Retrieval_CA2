The Kerch organization of the UHKK asserts that "a totalitarian dictatorship based on Russian chauvinist principles, lightly coated with general democratic rhetoric, is now taking shape in Crimea." The Kerch organization of the UHKK, and the Kerch organization of the Ukrainian Republican Party that is in solidarity with it, are demanding that official Kiev act immediately and decisively. Any further concessions to the separatist rebels will not only fail to appease them, but will rather motivate them to commit further acts to make Crimea secede from Ukraine and join Russia, the statement emphasizes.
