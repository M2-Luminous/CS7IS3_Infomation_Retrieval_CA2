Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito expressed concern that the political turmoil in Tokyo could affect efforts to resume stalled trade talks with Washington. "We are not sure if it will be possible to come to an agreement on reopening negotiations," Saito said at a seminar in Chiba. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who are both attending ceremonies to finalize the agreements of the Uruguay Round world trade talks in Marrakech, Morocco, were expected to discuss the issue. "With Japan's political situation having come that far, it probably won't be easy to make a decision," Saito said. Earlier the same day Egypt's President Husni Mubarak, scheduled to visit Japan from April 18 to 21, postponed his trip apparently because of the anticipated government change. While Thai Government officials indicated that given the uncertainty about when a new Japanese prime minister will be sworn in, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's visit from April 22 to 27 might be difficult to realize. However, Japanese Foreign Ministry sources said the next prime minister and foreign minister should stick to the already arranged travel schedules "for the sake of diplomatic continuity." Hosokawa was scheduled to make a three-nation visit to Europe starting May 3, while Hata was scheduled to pay a visit to the Middle East, including Egypt and Israel, from April 29. Other meetings that could be affected by the anticipated government change include Defense Chief Kazuo Aichi's talks with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry in the middle of next week and with South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae around April 25, according to the Foreign Ministry sources.
