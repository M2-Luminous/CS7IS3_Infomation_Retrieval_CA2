"Kovac and Goncz are actually only symbolic proponents and creators of this objectively inevitable process although symbols are irreplaceable and very necessary," the daily notes. Realistic people on both banks of the Danube River are fully aware that what had happened between French and Germans or Austrians and Italians must happen between Slovaks and Hungarians as well, the paper states. Afterwards, the Slovak-Hungarian compromise could serve as a model for the rest of the postcommunist world, including Hungary's other neighbors. "It is in Slovaks' and Hungarians' own interest not to postpone the process," the daily adds. "The framework has been created, there is willingness and courage. If the process is halted, or something worse occurs, the present and future generations could curse their fathers and grand- fathers for not having used the offered historical chance. And it is here, indeed," the paper concludes.
