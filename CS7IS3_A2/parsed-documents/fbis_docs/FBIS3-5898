In preliminary deputies talks last week, the U.S. Treasury Department aired a set of proposals that could be developed into institutional mechanisms for expanding market access for U.S. financial firms. For example, Washington suggested the creation of a committee to "study the rule of foreign financial institutions in APEC countries as well as liberalization of their capital markets." Korea, Japan, and even Brunei rejected the idea as it does not deal with multilateral issues for common prosperity of the region, according to Assistant Finance Minister Yim Chang-yol. Instead, the deputies agreed to adopt the Four-Cs (consensus, cooperation, cordiality and consultation) as a guiding principle of the APEC finance ministers meeting, Yim said. Furthermore, the meeting will be "non-binding" and no country will play the role of "coordinator" in the forum, Yim said. Despite such a suspicious attitude among APEC countries, analysts here expect the United States to "make the point in the Hawaii meeting that financial market integration and liberalization is in APEC's best interests." Washington is said to have adopted "three principles" in further opening the Asian financial markets, they said. First of all, the United States, out of its ambition to open up foreign financial markets, threatens not to grant most-favored-nation (MFN) status to foreign firms in which countries deny full market access and national treatment to U.S. firms. It is looking for bilateral agreements which offer reasonable market access and national treatment. In the case of Korea, the United States might use the standard of "equality of competitive opportunity," instead of national treatment, analysts said. Washington is said to be prepared to guarantee full market access and national treatment to countries which give U.S. firms satisfactory access and national treatment, they noted. The United States is said to be seeking to negotiate constructively with foreign countries, including Korea. There will be a standstill or "grandfathering" of existing operations of firms already in the U.S. market during negotiations. Furthermore, U.S. Treasury officials are said to be airing the position that the United States will not unreasonably refuse access to nations which are not already in the U.S. market, analysts said. The U.S. objective remains multilateral. However, Washington argues that it can not accept the situation in which other nations retain the right to discriminate against U.S. firms while they are permitted to expand in the U.S. market, analysts said. Washington officials are said to be asserting that they will be reasonable and pragmatic. For example, the United States understands the Korean position which considers that its financial system is an integral part of its economic policy and its financial system should remain in domestic hands, they said. U.S. officials understand this, analysts here said. However, Treasury officials allegedly cite ASEAN countries, Japan, Korea and Brazil as their main "problem" countries regarding full access to the U.S. services agreement. It may intensify its financial policy talks (FPT) with these countries over the next two years with the expectation of reaching an agreement which would enable the Treasury Department not to apply the MFN exemption, analysts said. In carrying out such action, the U.S. Treasury Department has the legislative authority to reciprocate against foreign financial firms which apply to expand their operations or seek new operations in the United States. For example, it has existing Section 301 authority of the Trade Act to take such action. But the Treasury Department has been reluctant to use this authority in the past except in cases of third country restrictions on market access of U.S. insurance companies. The Treasury Department also expects Congress to enact the "Fair Trade in Financial Services" act this year. For the first time, the U.S. administration has taken a united position in supporting this legislation. However, there are still problems in winning passage, particularly in the House of Representatives, analysts said.
