After all, the statement in the relevant resolution that "in the past few years, there was hardly a genocide that did not also involve fire from German arms..." is meanwhile regarded as a sure fact. Even two years ago, the United Nations demonstrated that with arms exports totaling $2.53 billion in 1991, Germany, for the first time, moved up to third place in the list of major arms exporters behind the United States and Russia. What is probably less well-known are the deals in connection with the dissolution of the National People's Army (NVA) of the GDR, and the "scrapping" of its sizable military technology. After the last NVA flag was lowered on 2 October 1990, experts from the Defense Ministry in Bonn and the Bundeswehr Command East could hardly believe what they counted: They had not expected the more than 2,200 combat tanks, 7,000 armored vehicles, 2,400 artillery pieces, 400 combat aircraft, 57 warships, 296,000 tonnes of ammunition, and 1.2 million handguns. However, other things came to light, too. After the Modrow government stopped all arms sales on the part of the GDR, the last GDR Government under De Maiziere decided to sell as much of the sensitive heritage as possible. Defense and Disarmament Minister Rainer Eppelmann, a former priest of the opposition and conscientious objector, and now a deputy for the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] in the Bundestag, in the summer of 1990 issued Order 31/90 to "step up efforts...to sell military materiel." This was done through "effective marketing." A few days before German unity, in August/September 1990, Eppelmann's ministry concluded 44 contracts with other countries or private companies on the supply of NVA material. According to insiders, the trick was to conclude these armament sales still under the GDR Government so that the future all-German Government could not be held responsible. It was bad luck for Eppelmann that a short time after unification he was charged with extensive shady NVA dealings, resulting in billions [currency not specified] of damage to the Bundeswehr through the squandering of national assets. Yet, investigations came to nothing.... Independent of such dubious last-minute sales, after the GDR's accession to the FRG, the question remained: What should one do with the old burden inherited from the NVA? The objective was to get rid of everything by 1995. Yet, the Defense Ministry in Bonn expected that getting rid of the almost 300,000 tonnes of ammunition alone would take 10 years and cost 5,000 marks [DM] for each tonne to take apart and discard -- altogether DM1.5 billion. Moreover, the guarding and clearing of the 3,315 buildings cost a lot of money each day. Requests for second-hand NVA arms from more than 70 European and oversees countries created the idea in the Defense Ministry to turn "scrap" into money and political assets through generous donations. The Federal Government donated NVA equipment worth DM740 million to the United States for its Gulf war forces. Air-to-air missiles, launcher vehicles, guided missiles, motor vehicles, and ammunition went to Israel. Turkey received German tanks, artillery pieces, and aircraft free of charge. Uruguay's fleet bought five minesweepers from the NVA heritage and two barges for DM3.1 million. The U.S. Navy picked up, among other things, the Hiddensee of the Tarantul rocket fast patrol boats. The Belgian BEIJ-MA group took the Dessau, Tangerhuette, Genthin, and Rosslau minesweepers. The Indonesian Navy bought 39 warships from GDR stocks at a price of $1.1 billion. The United Nations received L60-type trucks. A total of 475 water transporters went to Uruguay and Ecuador in humanitarian aid, 751 trucks were sold to Russia and Ukraine, pontoon vehicles to Greece, ammunition to Finland and Greece. In eastern Germany itself, all kinds of motor vehicles, multicars, fork trucks, tank trucks, snowplows, cranes, field bakeries, fire trucks, and emergency power generators from the enormous stocks are being sold to private persons. How much money has been made or what infringements against the arms export laws there were remains an open question. Exports of NVA material to Turkey has become a permanent political scandal. Apart from Bonn's arms exports to Turkey, which have caused a great deal of controversy for decades, according to official information from the Federal Defense Ministry, the following has been supplied to the Bosporus since April 1994 from the stocks of the former GDR Army: 300 BTR-60 PB armored personnel carriers; 4,996 RPG 7 bazookas, including 197,130 grenades; 222 heavy machine guns; 2,491 light machine guns; 303,934 Kalashnikov submachine guns; 20 KMT 5 mine detectors; 500,000 steel helmets; and hundreds of millions of rounds of various ammunition -- altogether worth $1.6 billion. For two years, human rights organizations, former NVA officers, and journalists have documented in letter and picture that such arms from GDR stocks have been used to suppress the Kurds. This is why the Federal Government put a temporary halt to arms supplies in early April. Yet already in May it was said that the accusations that German military technology would be used against the Kurds have "not proved sound." Exports have resumed. Last week, Ankara reported officially that 1,168 Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) guerrilla fighters had been killed since April....
