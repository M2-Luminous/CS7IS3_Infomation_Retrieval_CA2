According to ISKRA [Krajina Serb news agency], the government has prepared its platform--which will be presented to the assembly committees--based on the modified Article 20 of UN Security Council Resolution 820, which envisages export and import of goods from and into the RSK under the control of UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] civilian services. The possibility of providing water supplies for Zadar is envisaged as a gesture of good will, in exchange for parts for the hydroelectric dam in Obrovac. After that, other problems--particularly traffic problems--would be addressed. With regard to the assembly's decision that the government--which is currently being reappointed--should not hold talks with the Croatian side, the government has decided to accept this decision, noting that, if necessary, it will send a delegation only with a written order from the president of the RSK and the president of the assembly.
