They have proposed using toxic agents as raw materials for the production of materials needed by the national economy. In particular, the Volga scientists plan to obtain arsenic from lewisite. They have managed to organize the production of medicines and household chemical products here. However, the funding of research work in the destruction of lethal weapons is proceeding poorly. Last year, just 17 million rubles were allocated for this purpose. The chemical workers are bewildered. How can this be? For several months now staffers at the institute have not received their wages and the enormous collective has been forced to take administrative leave without pay. How can there be any talk of getting rid of weapons when there is no money to pay for their destruction?
