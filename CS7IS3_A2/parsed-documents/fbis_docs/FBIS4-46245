In February 1991, police found a videocassette in a Lima house supposedly used as Guzman's hideout. In the video, Guzman could be seen imitating the dance shown in the film "Zorba, the Greek." The video also showed the main Shining Path leaders close to Guzman. Among them was Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, aka "Augusto," who also was dancing with his chief, "President Gonzalo" as he is addressed by his followers. On 26 May, Peruvian police publicly presented Tenorio to the country dressed in the striped uniform worn by arrested terrorists. Tenorio probably will be sentenced to life imprisonment. According to police, "Augusto" was the "No. 2" man in the new Central Committee of the Peruvian Communist Party, which is the real name of the Maoist terrorist group. "Augusto" is second only to Oscar Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano," who is the current Shining Path leader. "Feliciano" has been trying to reorganize the terrorist group since Abimael Guzman's arrest in Lima on 12 September 1992. Guzman was later sentenced to life imprisonment. "Feliciano" has bluntly rejected Guzman's proposal to the Peruvian Government calling for a peace accord as well as his orders to suspend attacks and murders. [passage omitted] As in Guzman's case, "Augusto" was arrested at a house in Los Olivos District, Lima, without having the chance to shoot a single shot. He had been one of terrorists most wanted by the National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote). [passage omitted]
