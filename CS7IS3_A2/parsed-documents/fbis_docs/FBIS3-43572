President Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, addressing supporters after lengthy talks with faction leader Mohamed Farah Aidid, said the United Nations should not portray Aidid as a monster. He said the United Nations does not understand the complexity of the Somali problem. UN troops last year clashed with supporters of General Aidid, the strongman of southern Mogadishu, and he was declared a wanted man for murderous attacks on Pakistani peacekeeping soldiers. The hunt for him has subsequently been called off.
