The PNC, in a message aimed at the World Bank-organised Conference of the Caribbean Group for Economic Co-operation and Development (CGCED) here, also said further support for the government would be fruitless unless it was accompanied by good governance and sound economic policies. The party says the donor community must insist that the Cheddi Jagan administration formulate, publish and table in Parliament a policy paper committing itself unreservedly to a free and open society and a market-oriented economy. "They should require of the government a firm undertaking to eschew Marxist/Leninist ideological considerations in the determination of economic reforms," the PNC said. About 70 supporters of the party, including several former top government ministers, picketed the opening of the two-day CGCED and chanted "broken promises" when former U.S. President Jimmy Carter arrived at the forum. The umbrella Trades Union Congress (TUC), the Amerindian People's Association (APA), the Guyana Human Rights Association and the Guyana Consumers Association also picketed the conference. The PNC, in the lengthy statement, accused the government of spending too much time "bemoaning" the state of the country's economy, harassing and dismissing black public servants, of reneging on promises and displaying a lack of enthusiam for free enterprise and market policies. The Jagan administration, the opposition party said, has "dithered with respect to privatisation. After some 15 months in office, no state-owned enterprise has yet been privatised". It also accused the government of unnerving businessmen and investors with unfavourable statements, shown hostility to private investment, mismanagement, bad faith and corruption.
