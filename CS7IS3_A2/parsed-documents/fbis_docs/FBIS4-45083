Union Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee, addressing a meeting of the Congressmen at Bhubaneswar on April 24, said: "The Union Council of Ministers is fully empowered to take a decision under the Indian Constitution where Parliament has no role." He further said: "Scores of treaties and agreements had been signed by India in the past after being approved by the Council of Ministers and no one has ever raised the question as to why it was not debated in Parliament," and added "Articles 73(b) and 253 fully empower the Cabinet to take such decisions." Provisions In view of this controversy, it is pertinent to examine the relevant provisions of the Constitution. The following are the provisions relating to conclusion and enforcement of treaties in the Indian Constitution: Articles 51(c), 73(b), 253 and Entry 14 of List I in the Seventh Schedule. Art. 51(c) is the Directive Principle of State Policy and it urges the State to endeavour to foster respect for international law and treaty obligations. Art. 73(b) states that the executive power of the Indian Union is exercisable without prior legislation to enforce the provisions of a treaty provided it does not conflict with the provisions of the Constitution. Art. 253 gives power to Parliament to make laws even encroaching upon the State subjects enumerated in the State List II of the Seventh Schedule for implementing a treaty. In other words, what Parliament by itself cannot do, it can do, aided by a treaty. Finally Entry 14 of the List I of the Seventh Schedule confers on the Union Government exclusive power to conclude treaties with foreign countries. To understand the implications of the constitutional provisions relating to treaty, one has to know the British Common Law practice and the attitude of the Indian judiciary. British Common Law is in force in India by virtue of Art. 272. For instance, the personal laws of Muslims and Hindus, and the Law of Torts are part of British Common Law. According to Common Law practice it is the royal prerogative to make a treaty. But if the treaty were to alter the internal law either by conferring rights on individuals or depriving individuals of their rights which they enjoy under the domestic law, that treaty requires legislation by parliament. It is known as enabling act. It means unless Parliament by appropriate legislation incorporates the provisions of a treaty into its domestic law (Municipal Law) it does not become part of English Law. Executive Act The reason why the enabling act of Parliament is required to enforce a treaty internally is, that the conclusion of a treaty is an executive act. Neither Houses of Parliament participate in the treaty-making process. If the treaty were to be enforced internally without the enabling act of Parliament, it amounts to the executive being empowered to legislate. This may be dangerous. The British practice is that the enabling act is passed by parliament before the treaty is ratified. There is also a practice called the Ponsonby Rule. Under this Rule, a treaty is laid before Parliament 21 days prior to ratification and publication in the United Kingdom Treaty Series. However this is not a legal requirement. In America Under the United States Constitution, the President has the "Power by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur" (Art. 6). As the US Senate, one of the houses of the legislature, participates in the treaty-making process, "all treaties which shall be made under the Authority of the US shall be the supreme law of the land" (Art. 6). An enabling act to enforce a treaty internally is not required. The courts in India follow the British practice. The President of India like the Queen in England is competent to make a treaty. If a treaty were to affect the rights of a citizen, it has to be supported by legislation. In Maganbhai vs Union of India (1969, SC). The Supreme Court said: "If as a consequence of the exercise of executive power, the rights of citizens or others are restricted or infringed or laws are modified, the exercise must be supported by legislation, when there is no such restriction, infringement of the right or modification of the laws, the executive is competent to exercise power." Besides infringement of rights, legislation is also required to give effect to a treaty which provides for payment of money to a foreign power which must be drawn from the Consolidated Funds of India (Moti Lal vs Uttar Pradesh, 1961 Allahabad High Court). However, an amendment to the Constitution is necessary to cede Indian territory to a foreign State (re. Berubari Union of India, 1960 Supreme Court). But neither an amendment to the Constitution nor legislation is necessary for an agreement with a foreign State to refer a boundary dispute to an international tribunal or to implement the award of the tribunal. Changes in the boundary line can be done by executive following the award. Boundary settlements or the awards of tribunals should be recognised by the courts of our country (Maganbhai vs Union of India). The GATT accord does not, in any way, infringe the legal rights of an Indian citizen. If the Government of India had felt that GATT would infringe or modify the rights of the citizens it would have introduced appropriate legislation in Parliament to bring the Indian laws in accordance with the provisions of GATT before ratification. Assumption It should be noted that Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties stipulates: "A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as a justification for its failure to perform a treaty." A country cannot legislate out of international law. The courts while, giving effect to the provisions of treaty internally, should presume that it was not the intention of the executive or parliament to violate the law of the land.
