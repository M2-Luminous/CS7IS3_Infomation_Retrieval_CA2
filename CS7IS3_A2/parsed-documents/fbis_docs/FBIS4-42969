In his report, which circulated tonight, the UN secretary general mentions that UNFICYP's presence is still necessary to achieve the Security Council's goals. The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent reports from New York that the UN secretary general is concerned with the lack of progress in the reduction of troops and armaments in Cyprus. He blames the Turkish side for the fact that talks have not begun on disarmament in Cyprus and on prohibition of using arms along the buffer zone other than sidearms. Butrus-Ghali also mentions that concern for the lack of progress in this sector intensifies if one considers the lack of political will that was apparent in the latest efforts to agree on the confidence-building measures. The UN secretary general adds in his report that he has informed Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller of President Glavkos Kliridhis' demilitarization proposal. Butrus-Ghali says that the Turkish Government replied that the Turkish Cypriot community is the appropriate party to decide on that proposal. He also mentions that military equipment on both sides in Cyprus has been upgraded and that the number of Turkish troops on the island has risen to 30,000. The UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus numbers 1,250 men, 110 less than the number provided for.
