Russia, which disapproves of NATO airstrikes against Bosnian Serb positions, as of Thursday morning had not officially reacted to the alliance's ultimatum issued overnight. [passage omitted] SEGODNYA said Yeltsin discussed the matter over the telephone Wednesday evening with several western leaders without identifying them. [passage omitted] Several Russian diplomats contacted Thursday declined to comment on NATO's decision saying it was "too delicate an issue." [passage omitted] Meanwhile the Russian army's daily newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reported Thursday that any ultimatum must be addressed to Bosnia's three warring factions -- Muslims, Serbs and Croats -- and not only the Serbs. "Washington's demands that the Serbs pull back their artillery from Sarajevo or face airstrikes are blatantly one-sided," the daily said. "This approach will no doubt be interpreted by the other party to the conflict as an unspoken support."
