Chokchai said there are bright prospects for Thai investment in China in areas such as factory development, infrastructure construction, and retailing. Thai investors can also export construction materials for projects in China. Simultaneously, there are good opportunities for Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in Thailand to produce goods for export to Indochina. This will help save transportation costs. Moreover, China's cooperation with ASEAN countries and the quadrangle economic development project invovling China, Thailand, Laos, and Burma will enable this region to become an important area of greater economic prosperity. Now, some Thai products such as motorcycles, kitchen ware, consumer products, and construction materials have penetrated the Indochinese market. However, countries in each region have set up regional trade groups. This has prompted Thailand to enhance its competitiveness in the market by improving development analyses or relocating production bases to other countries with cheaper labor costs. Labor cost in Thailand is much higher than in neighboring countries. The Chinese chief delegate said Wuxi city has registered the rapid economic growth rate of 25 percent, the highest in Jiangsu Province. There are over 140,000 factories in the city. There are also some 3,669 foreign-owned factories with a combined investment of U.S. $2,900 million. Chinese entrepreneurs are interested in investing in metallurgical and rubber industries in Thailand.
