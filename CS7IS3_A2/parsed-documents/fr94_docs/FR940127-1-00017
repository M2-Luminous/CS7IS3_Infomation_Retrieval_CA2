FR940127-1-00017 FR940127-1-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [MT1&hyph;1&hyph;5697; AD&hyph;FRL&hyph;4830&hyph;5] Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of PM&hyph;10 Implementation Plan for Montana AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: In this action EPA proposes approval of the state implementation plan (SIP) for the Columbia Falls, Montana nonattainment area submitted by the State of Montana to achieve attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10). The SIP was submitted by Montana to satisfy certain federal Clean Air Act requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP for Columbia Falls. EPA is also proposing approval of the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing by February 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Meredith A. Bond, 8ART&hyph;AP, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405. Copies of the State's submittal and other information are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405; and Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, Air Quality Bureau, Cogswell Building, Helena, Montana 59620&hyph;0901. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Meredith Bond at (303) 293&hyph;1764. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Columbia Falls, Montana area was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 1 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 40 CFR 81.327 (specifying designation for Columbia Falls and vicinity). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are set out in Subparts 1 and 4 of Title I of the Act. 2 The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of Title I advanced in today's proposal and the supporting rationale. In today's rulemaking action on the Montana moderate PM&hyph;10 SIP, EPA is proposing to apply its interpretations considering the specific factual issues presented. Thus, EPA will consider any timely submitted comments before taking final action on today's proposal. 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Public Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act''). The Clean Air Act is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. Sections 7401, et seq. 2 Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally and Subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM 10 nonattainment areas. At times, Subpart 1 and Subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in today's notice and supporting information. Those States containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 that become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512, 13543&hyph;13544.
