He addressed an audience of 150 people attending a National Party [NP] campaign meeting in the Sommerset West town hall and elaborated on the precise role of the TEC. Mr Meyer also explained the events around Bophuthatswana and Ciskei and called for South Africans to give their moral support to the security forces as the only guarantee of everyone's safety. "It is important to note that the TEC is not the government, nor a government in waiting or in training," he said. The government still dealt with the day to day administration of the country while the TEC had limited powers to level the political playing field and ensure a free and fair election in the transition to a democratic South Africa. He asked his audience to imagine the chaos which would have resulted without the TEC in dealing with the crisis in Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu. "Without the TEC they would all have been the government's sole responsibility and used against the government by all the other parties. Now all the other parties are co-responsible and the government's responsibilities are shared by the other participating parties in preparing for the elections. If the ANC is seen to play too big a role then it is so much hot air with one eye on the elections and the other personal aspirations," he said. Mr Meyer said it was sometimes not easy to be the government representative on the TEC which consisted of 19 other parties, each with their own approach to a problem. He said the SAP [South African Police] and SADF [South African Defense Force] were the security forces of all South Africa's people. "It is the responsibility of every political leader to give their full support to the security forces. Our safety depends on it." Regarding the latest Goldstone Commission report alleging third force activities backed by high-ranking police officers, he said the just thing to do was to ensure there was a quick, efficient and impartial investigation to establish whether there were grounds for further investigation and action. The government would in consultation with the TEC and possibly with international assistance see to it that such an investigation was constituted as swiftly as possible. "But irrespective of this, we have a responsibility to stand by the police and the commissioner (of police) and to support them that they may protect us." Reviewing the situation in Bophuthatswana, he said the events there had been tragic and unnecessary. "He (former Bop [Bophuthatswana] President Lucas Mangope) was swallowed by history because he would not make the correct decisions in time to be part of the future." State President F W de Klerk had invited Mr Mangope and his cabinet for discussions more than a year ago to join him in planning for the future in order to ensure that Bophuthatswana would become part of South Africa and participate in elections. "Mr Mangope's answer then and consequently every time afterwards, remained the same: `I will die for independence'". "Politically, unfortunately he did die," Mr Meyer said. There was no way Bophuthatswana could remain an independent state. In the 1993/94 budget year 71 per cent of its income was derived from South Africa. "Democracy arrived in South Africa and democracy often plays hard with those that stand in its way." On the Zulu quest for an independent sovereign monarchy, Mr Meyer said it could be accommodated within the new amended constitutional structure but not in terms of a sovereign king ruling without elected representation of the people. On the issue of international mediation, he said he would be meeting representatives of the ANC and IFP on Thursday morning and as yet had no confirmation as to whom they would be proposing. "What is important, however, is that whatever they wish we will consider in terms of such a mediation panel." The government would look at its scope and final intentions but could not consider it unless it was certain that mediation could make a contribution to resolving the issues. The two parties have decided on international mediation ?o determine the federalist content of the transitional constitution.
