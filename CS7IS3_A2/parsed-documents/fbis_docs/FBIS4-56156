But with the expectation of privatization, the "blue chips" alone -- mainly Eletrobras -- are valued at $47.1 billion on the stock exchange. This means that if the government decided to sell off those firms quickly, it would collect enough money to pay off a good share of the public debt. But Marina Figueira, professor in the Department of Economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro and author of a detailed study of Brazilian government-owned firms, says that immediate privatization like that which has occurred in other Latin American countries would not work in Brazil because the structure of federally owned firms is much more complex that that of their neighbors. "Chiefly since 1964, the Brazilian state has grown beyond the public sector. The main economic groups in the government productive sector are controlled by mixed-economy companies whose owners include partners in the private sector and whose shares are traded on the exchange," she says. Blue chips: An example of that limitation on the state's ability to divest is precisely the value of its firms in the stock market. The fact is that of the total stock market value of shares in those blue chip companies (Rio Doce Valley, Eletrobras, Telebras, and Petrobras) -- $47.1 billion -- the government's share comes to $25.6 billion. So in order to get rid of its shares, the government will have to engage in some intense negotiations with minority stockholders. Because of that, according to the study by Marina Figueira, and unlike what happened in other Latin American countries, privatization attempts in Brazil are being preceded by innumerable fights over ownership rights. The government-owned firms have become so independent of the state that when subsidiaries have been privatized -- Petrobras's subsidiaries, for example -- the proceeds of the sale have gone directly to the holding company, not the National Treasury. Funds: "If privatization is aimed at raising money for the Treasury, we must sell our stock in the big parent companies such as Petrobras, Eletrobras, the CVRD, and Telebras," she says. But she explains that doing so would also mean selling ownership in each of those firms to a single parent company. And in her opinion, that could not be done because it would make the economy's pattern of efficiency worse. As an example, she points to the sale of the Chilean electric companies. Their sale followed that pattern, and the result for the government has been serious and undesirable problems with regulation. In view of all those special features, the Brazilian privatization program must, according to Marina Figueira's study, be seen not as a way of raising cash but of unburdening the state and increasing efficiency and competitiveness. The result, says the professor, is that every step in the direction of privatization must be carefully executed. "If it is concerned about its level of revenues, the government could sell the firms quickly. In that case, the cost of raising cash quickly would fall upon the private sector," she says, pointing out that a different approach should be adopted in selling off each group to be privatized. SEST: Marina Figueira de Mello warns that her figures regarding the net worth of government-owned firms were not based on more recent data than those in the 1988 register of balance sheets because that was the most recent survey published by the Special Secretariat for State Enterprises (SEST). The register lists 258 firms whose majority stockholder is the Union: 179 in the productive sector, 20 typical government enterprises (Brazilian Agriculture and Livestock Research Enterprise, for example), 28 service licensees providing electricity, 25 financial firms, and six social security and welfare services. "Over the past five years, the performance of the government-owned firms included in the program has improved, with favorable effects on their operating results, a factor that has probably caused their net worth to increase even further," the professor comments.
