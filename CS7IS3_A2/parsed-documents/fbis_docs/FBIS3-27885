Is Minister Hong lying or is the United States seeking an "overblown" political and strategic reaction to squeeze more concessions from Korea? U.S. government officials, including U.S. Trade Representative chief Mickey Kantor, picked Korea and Japan as their "main problem countries" in their market opening regarding for American financial service firms. Finance Minister Hong said he wants to make Seoul a leading financial center in Northeast Asia. And few Korean bankers doubt the government has been implementing its financial reform plan at a full speed. Many American bankers, including James D. Vaughn, manager of the Seoul branch of American Express Bank, did not hesitate in praising Seoul's recent financial reforms but U.S. government officials are reluctant to appreciate what's happening in the Korean financial market. A few divisions of the MOF [Ministry of Finance] appear to be waging a competition these days to rewrite insurance, foreign exchange, and foreign direct investment laws. They are liberalizing foreign exchange and capital flows and eliminating preferential policy loans. They deregulated the bulk of interest rates, and announced a series of reform measures. Why does the United States have such a complaint? Is it justifiable? Many analysts here believe that the U.S. Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative are waging their own competition to gain the upper hand in their push to open the "lucrative" financial market in Korea. Sandwiched between the bureaucratic infighting, Korea faces double pressure, they said. Seoul's financial market is being liberalized at a rapid pace by Korean standards but at a snail's pace by U.S. norms, a Western diplomat said. Kantor said the United States wants Korea to open its market in a way that the United States and the European Union open theirs. Choe Chang-pong, an economist at the Korea Tax Institute, said "The United States will not be satisfied until Korea has an open financial system the same as the United States has." But he said if Korea further speeds up its liberalization, local institutions may have a tough time in keeping up with it." [quotation marks as published] Washington is hell-bent on prying open Korea's financial market because American financial services firms can do good business here. The United States appears to expect Seoul to open its financial market wider following Korea's concession to open its rice market, analysts said. Although Seoul unveiled its five-year financial reform plan last year, it refused to link it to the Uruguay Round. This raised U.S. suspicions that Korea might change its mind on reform in the future, they said. Washington believes that without constant pressure, Korea might backpedal on its liberalization, analysts here said. The U.S. threat to retaliate has discouraged Korean policymakers who have worked overtime to implement financial reform plans, an MOF official said. One Seoul professor said, "If the U.S. repeats its threat of retaliation without praising Seoul's achievements, MOF officials may not voluntarily deregulate financial rules." Instead, they will hide major issues of great interest to American firms until the United States puts pressure on Korea. They will hide "big gifts" (concessions) until U.S. officials visit Korea, he added. He and Korean economists said that the U.S. will invite undue anti-Americanism from the Korean people when they use such "hackneyed" words as threat or retaliation at a time when the nation is moving toward fuller financial reform. U.S. Pressure MOF officials are angered when U.S. officials threaten to twist their arms to open the market further at a time when many American bankers and businessmen are praising MOF officials for their reform of the domestic financial system. They question who is pushing the U.S. government to put pressure on Korea to open its market wider. MOF officials suspect that a few American bankers, who have seen their profits fall here, are complaining that it is because of the "worsening business environment." The worsening environment is due to the intensifying competition following deregulation, not because of Seoul's discriminatory practices against foreign financiers, MOF officials said. Many bankers, including Hana Bank's Yun Pyong-chol, said the more Korea opens its market, the more difficulty foreign banks will face in expanding revenue. MOF officials speculate such complaints originate from a few foreign bankers' attempt to hide their mismanagement or lack of talent. Arm-Twisting The U.S. Treasury expects Congress to enact the "Fair Trade in Financial Services Act." For the first time, the U.S. administration has taken a unified position in supporting this legislation, which will be used to retaliate against foreign countries. But analysts here said there are still problems, however, in winning passage, particularly in the House of Representatives. Despite high-pitched rhetoric, the United States will not be able to retaliate against Korea at least until the end of 1995. An MOF official said, "We are worried over how successfully we implement our reform plan, not U.S. retaliatory threats." For the next two years, Washington will seek intensify pressure on Korea and other Asian countries to open their financial markets. But MOF officials say over the next two years, Korea will implement the bulk of its five-year financial reform program and hope U.S. complaints die down.
