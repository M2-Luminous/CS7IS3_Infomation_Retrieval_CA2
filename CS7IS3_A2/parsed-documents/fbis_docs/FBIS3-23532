Marshal of the Soviet Union V. G. Kulikov, General of the Army V. I. Varennikov, men who served with Nikolay Vasilyevich in the Great Patriotic War, and representatives of veteran and public organizations bade a fond farewell to the decedent at his funeral in Novodevichye Cemetery. Marshal N. V. Ogarkov's funeral was organized by the Ministry of Defense fully in accordance with accepted ritual, established procedure, and honors. Nonetheless we cannot shake a feeling of anger and insult in connection with, mildly speaking, the strange inattention to the decedent on the part of other official agencies and the mass media. Thus, only KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carried a notice of the death of Marshal N. V. Ogarkov, in an obituary undersigned by the leadership of the Ministry of Defense. All other publications, television and radio (except for the "Mayak" program) remained silent as if nothing had happened. For this reason thousands of citizens, including many war veterans, did not have the opportunity to part with the decedent, and to see him off on his final journey. On 27 January only SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA and VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA carried information on the funeral. Once again the other publications were silent. Not a single television program devoted a single minute to this funereal event on the day of the funeral and on subsequent days. And yet, on 26 January television viewers were shown, time and time again, the harmless attack by some madman with a starting pistol on England's Prince Charles, a lengthy interview with the bankrupted former ministers and shock therapists Gaydar and Fedorov, and other unimportant stories. But no time or room could be found on the airwaves for a broadcast or even a brief televised news report on the state--we emphasize the state--funeral of a Marshal of the Soviet Union, veteran of the Great Patriotic War and Hero of the Soviet Union. In the Sunday, 30 January "Itogi" program the anchorman uttered not a single word about the death and funeral of Marshal N. V. Ogarkov. We feel certain that this is not simply the professional neglect of persons in positions of leadership in the mass media, and not only a deliberate demonstration of their attitude toward the decedent through the method of silence. This is but one manifestation and a logical continuation of the discreditation of the armed forces, of merited military chiefs, and of veterans of the Great Patriotic War who saved the world from fascism, begun back in the years of "perestroyka" by certain circles and strata of our society, and still going on practically without end. As far as Marshal N. V. Ogarkov's funeral is concerned, Ogarkov apparently simply cannot be forgotten by some of our "reformers" working in government corridors of power and the mass media for the fundamental position he took in the years of "perestroyka." Everyone remembers his prophetic statement at the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union immediately following the events of August 1991, in which Nikolay Vasilyvich warned of the danger of the impending disintegration of the Soviet Union, in which he turned out to be absolutely correct. Nor can they forget N. V. Orgakov for his leadership of the Union of War and Labor Veterans, the members of which supported, in their overwhelming majority, the attempt by the lawful leadership of the Soviet Union in August 1991 to avert the trouble into which the country was steadily slipping. Nor could the ill-wishers forget Nikolay Vasilyevich for his stern, principled protests as inspector general of the armed forces against the unjustified "treaties" hastily concluded by Gorbachev to reduce, and for practical purposes to disarm the army and navy, the division of our mighty Armed Forces of the Soviet Union into "sovereign" chunks following the Belovezhskaya agreement, and the distribution of military equipment and armament, together with personnel, among the new so-called "independent" states that appeared suddenly in place of our former union republics. We are outraged by the fact that such an insulting attitude toward merited military chiefs departing from this life, and through them toward the Armed Forces, is being planted in Russia. We demand cessation of such a practice, and payment of worthy honor to glorious Soviet military chiefs. [Signed] V. Varennikov, General of the Army, Hero of the Soviet Union; I.
