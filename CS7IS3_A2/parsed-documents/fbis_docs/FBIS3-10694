[Begin Meneses recording] Everything is calm before the holding of the second stage of the peace dialogue. The Chiapas residents do not want any more temporary governments and have also requested elections this year. In Oaxaca, Bishop Samuel Ruiz said a peace agreement will be signed in Chiapas between Monday and Tuesday of the coming week.
