Hence, they proposed that in continuing to develop the economy, it is necessary to search for new ideas instead of following the trodden path of emphasizing speed alone. In searching for new ideas for development, it is necessary, first of all, to proceed from the national strength and conditions in deciding a scientific rate of economic growth. Deputies and members said: Despite a marked increase in our overall national strength in recent years, the country's financial and material capabilities remain rather limited because of its low starting point. Therefore, we must decide on a growth rate and construction scale that are within our capabilities. Citing an example, deputies recalled the housing and real estate boom last year that led to a rush in the construction of luxurious apartments, tourist resorts, and modern recreational facilities in disregard of actual benefits, demands, and capabilities. On the surface, such a construction boom could accelerate the pace of development and improve the economy; but in actuality, it caused a series of problems, such as capital shortages, price increases, and strains on "bottleneck" industries. Second, it is necessary to strive to develop the national economy with high efficiency and quality. Describing low efficiency and high growth rate as the most salient characteristics of a "bubble economy," deputies said: Local governments and enterprises should guard against one-sided emphasis of high output value and speed; and should concentrate efforts on upgrading technology, improving management and operation, developing new products, conserving energy to lower consumption, and tapping potential. To this end, they should adopt effective measures to raise major indices reflecting economic efficiency, such as the sales rate of manufactured goods, profit and tax payment rates of industrial capital, profit rates of costs and expenses, turnover rates of working funds, and all- personnel labor productivity. Moreover, it is necessary to proceed from the realities of each locality, making the best possible use of favorable conditions and avoiding the unfavorable, and refraining from demanding a unified speed. Because of the vast differences in geographical locations and resources, economic development is extremely uneven throughout the country, with an enormous gap between the eastern and western regions. In developing the economy, localities should not pursue the same target and speed, but should proceed from local conditions in exploring the most effective way of developing local economy. For examples, Zhejiang should rely on Pudong's opening up and development in achieving new economic advances; Henan should transform itself from a major agricultural province with rich resources into a major industrial province as a motive force for scaling new heights in economic development; Sichuan should energetically develop transportation and communications as an important way to taking off from its southwestern region-oriented economy and converge its economy with the international market; and Gansu should expedite the development of village and town enterprises and help poor mountainous areas cast off poverty and become well off as this is crucial to narrowing the gap between the western and eastern regions. These measures for developing the economies, which correspond with the local realities, can avoid aimlessness, overcome one-sidedness, and allow each locality to develop on its own while ultimately contributing to an excellent situation characterized by a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy.
