FBIS4-53041 "dreas095__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-095-A Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Competition Heats Up for Lithium Ion Battery Competition Heats Up for Lithium Ion Battery 942A0200A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 Apr 94 p 11--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0200A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Sanyo Electric announced on 19 April that it will enter the lithium ion battery market on which attention has been focused as a key device for multimedia data terminals on par with liquid crystal. That is because it is anticipated that demand will quickly expand in the future as a power source for data terminals to handle portable telephones or multimedia. There have been new entries by Matsushita Battery, Japan Storage Battery, and others one after the other, and Sony and others in the lead are preparing to counter them by augmenting facilities capability. Currently, only Japanese manufacturers can supply lithium ion batteries. Not only domestic, but foreign electrical machinery manufacturer users have come into view, and they are prepared to spur development and mass production competition with lithium ion batteries as "the second liquid crystal." Sanyo Electric began production of a cylindrical lithium battery at their Sumoto plant (Hyogo Prefecture) in April. The initial monthly production plan is 100,000 units, but they are investing 5-6 billion yen, setting up two special lines, and will additionally market a square battery. They aim for monthly production of 1 million units during the year. In addition to the nickel cadmium battery and nickel hydrogen battery which have been the mainstream charging batteries up to now, the company will make a strenuous effort in the future to supply lithium ion batteries for multimedia terminal equipment. The idea of the company is that "the respective special characteristics are that the nickel cadmium battery is for equipment where a large discharge is necessary, the nickel hydrogen is large capacity, and the lithium ion battery is small and lightweight. The special characteristics differ according to equipment used, and we plan to segregate cultivation of demand by the three kinds of batteries" (Kennosuke Matsumura, manager Soft Energy Division). Various companies, such as Matsushita Battery and Japan Storage Battery, have entered the lithium ion battery market one after the other. Yuasa also will begin shipment of a business card-size film-type lithium ion battery sample beginning this summer. Sharp also has already succeeded in development. With the recent start of production by Sanyo Electric, the various domestic entry manufacturing companies will be just about all present. Sony, which was the first to succeed in commercializing the lithium ion battery, will up production capability 50 percent by the end of fiscal 1994 at the Koriyama plant (Koriyama city) of its production subsidiary Sony Energy Tech, and boost it from the current monthly 1 million unit production system to 1.5 million units. That is because they have judged that OEM [original equipment manufacturing] supply as a power source for family videos, MD's (mini disks), portable telephones, and personal computer backups will further expand. So far, they have invested a little more than about 10 billion yen, but it is said that they "will introduce new facilities" as they discern demand trends (Shiro Takahashi, senior vice president, Energy Division, Recording Media and Energy Company). AD Battery (Chiyoda, Tokyo; president, Takashi Shimada), a joint investment company of Toshiba and Asahi Chemical Industry, which is a leading manufacturer on a par with Sony, is building new facilities at their Horikawa-cho plant (Kawasaki city), and will boost monthly production capability from 400,000 units to 1.6 million units all at once with this summer as the goal. Investment during fiscal 1994 is anticipated to amount to a total of 5 billion yen. The company further increased capital from 1 billion yen to 3.5 billion yen at the end of March, aimed at strengthening management. So far, investment has been 50-50 by Toshiba and Asahi Chemical Industry, but Toshiba Battery (Shinagawa, Tokyo; president, Jun Sasakura) has newly participated in capitalization. The investment ratio is 40 percent each for Toshiba and Asahi Chemical Industry, and 20 percent for Toshiba Battery, and the plan is "to begin preparations for full-scale supply," transferring the increase in capital to facilities investment (President Takashi Shimada).
