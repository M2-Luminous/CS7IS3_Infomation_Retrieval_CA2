FBIS3-47337 "dreas008__a94025" FBIS-EAS-94-008-A Document Type:Daily Report 12 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Factional `Wrangling' Within MITI Noted OW1201093094 Tokyo AERA in Japanese 3-10 Jan 94 pp 13-14--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1201093094 Tokyo AERA Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Article by editorial staff member Keiko Ito: "Outcome of Factional Wrangling in `Declining MITI'"] [Text] Yuji Tanahashi (59), former administrative vice minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), who retired in June 1993 was referred to as an "emperor" within the ministry. Comments by people who knew him follow. "Among the successive vice ministers, he was extraordinarily skillful at making a connection with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]." "He was skillful at making allies of the politicians, when there were inter-ministerial power struggles." The factional wrangling within the ministry surrounding this Mr. Tanahashi seems to have cast a shadow on the incident in which MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai advised Industrial Policy Bureau Director Masahisa Naito (55) to resign on grounds of the "spoils system." The struggle between the "Tanahashi faction" and the "anti-Tanahashi faction" is said to have intensified over the last three or four years. In July 1993, copies of a mysterious document, claiming to be signed by "all concerned junior officers in MITI" and criticizing Mr. Tanahashi were sent to current senior officials and to "OB's" [former officials] and were printed in some of the weekly magazines. There was also past factional wrangling in MITI in 1963, during the time of the Ikeda cabinet, surrounding selection of a successor for Mr. Shigeru Saji (now deceased) who was then called "Mr. MITI." Mr. Nobuyoshi Namiki, an economist who retired as a result of his involvement in that struggle and who wrote The End of MITI, comments: "Since about that time, the office's power had been decreasing, and we were losing work. The senior officials seemed to be spending their energy on the factional fight and to be less concerned about the work itself. Such an atmosphere prepared the ground for the current incident." There are even rumors that some senior officials, until recently, formed a "club of people who live along the Toyoko [Railroad] Line up to XX Station," a "MITI Ladies Club," and had meetings with those subordinate officials who participated. There are people concerned who unhappily say: "During the Sahashi period, there was still some semblance of policy argument. Today, it is just a personnel struggle." Promoted the Eldest Son Seven Years Early The favoritism in personnel affairs which became an issue developed during the time Mr. Tanahashi was vice minister. They transferred Tanahashi's eldest son, Yasufumi (30), who entered MITI in 1987 while his father was director of the Secretariat, from deputy head of section to a newly created position of planning advisor in the minister's Secretariat in December 1992. This [promotion] was said to have been seven years earlier than [promotions] for people who entered the ministry the same year as he. Yasufumi [Tanahashi] resigned a week later, in January 1993, ran in the July general election from the first district for the House of Representative in Gifu Prefecture, and lost. His father, who retired from MITI, stuck closely by his only son and campaigned during the election. The father of Mrs. Yuji [Tanahashi] is Koko Matsuno, [former] representative from the first district of Gifu and former director general of the National Land Agency. At one time it was rumored that Mr. Tanahashi himself might eventually try for political office. Bureau Director General Naito was, during the time of Tanahashi's vice ministership, the chief of the Secretariat. He supported the vice minister and was accused of playing a part in the favoritism in personnel affairs. He was urged to resign by the minister on 16 December and submitted his resignation on the 22d. The director of industrial policy is at the head of the list of director generals, and was the candidate most likely to become the next vice minister. Mr. Naito was thought to be close to Mr. Tanahashi. But Mr. Kozo Watanabe, who is the alternate representative secretary for Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the party to which MITI Minister Kumagai also belongs, and who is himself a former MITI minister, comments: "He kept his distance from politicians and served earnestly, regardless of who his superior was. He was a bureaucrat-like bureaucrat." Cabinet Minister Exercises Authority and Causes Commotion Cabinet ministers have the right to appoint and dismiss bureaucrats. It is legal and justifiable for a cabinet officer to dismiss a director general based on his own judgment. But when this incident was reported, there was a great commotion in Kasumigaseki [government sector of Tokyo]. That is because the fact that a cabinet minister would [actually] exercise his authority and would regard pre-election favoritism in personnel affairs as inappropriate was all contrary to "custom in Kasumigaseki." Director Naito himself continued to resist [dismissal] for nearly one week, saying: "Why do I have to resign (only for such a minor matter)?" When Mr. Naito's post-resignation press conference was aired, in a certain office in the ministry young staff members shouted loudly "what is this minister thinking of?" "We just cannot have the whims of a new minister, who does not know anything, influence our personnel." Mr. Watanabe himself once tried to make up a personnel chart while he was MITI minister. The personnel proposals subsequently brought to him by the [administrative] vice minister and chief of secretariat matched 99 percent with those Mr. Watanabe had devised. He takes an affirmative view of the custom, saying: "It is the bureaucrats' wisdom gained from long experience that catches the minister's feeling and the [LDP] party's atmosphere through day-to-day contact, so they can come up with appropriate personnel. It is not that the ministers are controlled by the bureaucrats." Mr. Kumagai is a former MITI official. He gave the notice to Mr. Naito, who entered the ministry three years ahead of him, with language along the lines of: "I am dismissing you according to the new cabinet's policy." He was saying that he wanted to correct bad practices such as favoritism in personnel which had been normal during the LDP era. He stressed during the [news] conference that "(favoritism in personnel matters) is inappropriate when one looks at it with general common sense." Many of the concerned MITI officials agreed that a number of similar personnel actions occurred in the past, and very few questioned such a "practice." "That much should be permissible for people who run for elective office, as a gift from MITI" (former official). "They quit immediately after receiving the promotion, so there was no real harm" (former official). Mr. Naito too did not conceal his resentment at the news conference, saying: "It is as if I am being executed for a minor offense." For the past week, some volunteer former MITI officials filed into the administrative vice minister's office and pressed the vice minister to refuse the minister's demand. Senior officials still in service sent an open letter of questions to the minister. The commotion expanded. Glory Is Declining and.... People in the United States Trade Representative's Office (USTR) called Japan's MITI the "notorious MITI." This was in the latter half of the 1970's. It was a nickname given with grudges, but also with some wonder. MITI was the locomotive for Japanese industry which, while creating friction with other countries, had built up a trade surplus. Prior to that, Japan was also called an "economic animal," "Japan, Inc." The world thought that all the secrets for achieving that surprising economic growth were possessed by MITI. MITI was formerly the Ministry of Agriculture and Industry during the Meiji period. In 1925, it became the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and for a time during the war was called the Ministry of Munitions. After the war, it was reborn as the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. In 1949 it became the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and supported the Japanese prosperity which followed. The share of the national budget it receives is only 1 percent. Pride that "this is a place to work on a national vision, not a bureaucratic office to administer subsidies" is said to lead to the staff's sense of elitism. One former official reminisced: "I was embarrassed because people overrated us, believing that if MITI gave its OK, then everything was decided." But as the nation has entered a period of stable growth, the current of trade has begun to flow toward liberalization and deregulation, and their glory has begun to wane. Now the people concerned are at a loss: "The key phrase is a people-oriented country. What is the role for MITI, which has single-mindedly pursued production? While the organization has expanded, the work keeps decreasing." Mr. Watanabe can not forget the voices of admiration, and the eager looks he received in meeting halls every time he was introduced as the "MITI minister" at parties or when he visited Asian countries while he was the MITI minister. "For a while there was a trend that the industries which had been nurtured by MITI became independent and said that they no longer needed MITI. But now, in this time of recession, MITI is again needed. At the very time, such an incident occurred...." As he reads the newspaper he says he feels like crying.
