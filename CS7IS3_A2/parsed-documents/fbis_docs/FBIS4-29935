The message says: It is a policy we have consistently maintained from long ago to remove distrust and confrontation between the North and the South and open a new phase of national reunification independently and peacefully without dependence on outside forces through top-level talks. The acute situation prevailing in the country makes it all the more urgent for both the North and the South to hold top-level talks. I think it lucky that at such a time your side expressed its readiness to hold top-level talks with us. I have been authorized to notify you that we welcome and agree to your side's proposal to hold a preliminary contact for the North-South top-level talks. The holding of the top-level talks between the sides will be a historical event bringing joy of national reconciliation and unity to our 70 million fellow countrymen and giving a new hope of peace and independent and peaceful reunification of the country. Our side will send a three-member delegation headed by an official of vice-premier level and four suite members to your side's portion of Panmunjom at 10:00 [0100 GMT] June 28 (Tuesday) in order to successfully arrange the North-South top-level talks on which the concern and expectations of the people at home and abroad are being focused.
