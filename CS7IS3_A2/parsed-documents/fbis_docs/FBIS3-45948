Joshi said there were positive gains for both India and China in implementing the historic border agreement. In an interview to inter-services newsletter "SAINIK SAMACHAR" on the eve of the Army Day here today, General Joshi said that though the Sino-Indian border agreement, signed last September when Indian Prime Minister Rao visited Beijing, was not fully implemented yet, the course that had been set was a positive one. Progress achieved in this path would indicate the thrusts and changes in the mission of the Indian Army, Joshi said. The two dimensions for the Indian Army to defeat external and internal threats had tended to merge and peace with "our neighbors" was a vital aspect in this battle. In an apparent reference to large number of force levels which would become available once the reduction in troop and weaponry level went underway as stipulated in the agreement, the general said the progress of implementation of the agreement would indicate how best Army could use this manpower.
