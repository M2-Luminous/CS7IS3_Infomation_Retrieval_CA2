Our correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin left for Paris this morning for a working visit, in the course of which he will meet with the top echelons of the French Foreign Ministry. Among other things, he will try to promote the Israel-Tunisia relations. In some two weeks, Beilin will travel to Tunisia as head of the Israeli delegation for the steering committee of the multilateral peace talks. In his meetings with top Tunisian officials, he will attempt to conclude the establishment of relations, perhaps a mutual opening of interest offices.
