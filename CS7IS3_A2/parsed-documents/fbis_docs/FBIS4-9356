On Wednesday [20 April] afternoon, a Public Order Ministry statement confirmed reports that, following several surprise raids in different districts of Albania, "a large amount of anticonstitutional literature has been found, proving Greek expansionist aims toward Albania and Albanian territory," as well as "brazen Greek attempts to Hellenize the area of southern Albania." These confiscated documents include publications such as "Greece's Northern Epirus," by Sebastianos, the metropolitan of Dropull; many maps showing more than four-fifths of the present territory of Albania as "Northern Epirus," and other secret material. Also on Wednesday, Omonia's main leaders, while not unambiguously speaking out about the reasons behind the detention of many of their leading activists, demanded in a letter to President Berisha "the immediate release of all the detainees," who belong, they claim, to the Greek ethnic minority in Albania. The lightning strikes organized by the Public Order Ministry, according to its statement, were carried out following reports of the unlicensed possession of weapons and of criminal anticonstitutional activities. The 11 detainees confirmed by the Public Order Ministry include many persons from other districts of the Omonia branch in Gjirokaster, and other activists of the association. On Tuesday alone, five more people, whom preliminary investigations accuse of anticonstitutional activity, were detained in Delvine. These are Kosta Miculi, Pirro Kondi, Panajot Mato, Pandeli Gazeli, and Kostaq Cavo. An unlicensed firearm was found on one of them. Thoma Sharra, deputy general chairman of Omonia, told GAZETA SHQIPTARE that "As far as we know, four people have been detained in Sarande alone, including one woman activist. The detainees include Vangjel Papakristo, chairman of the Omonia branch in Sarande." [words indistinct] three more Omonia activists in Gjirokaster have been detained, while two people remained in detention in Korce on Wednesday. The first was Ermioni Andrea, chairwoman of Omonia in Korce, and the second the chairman of the Albania-Greek Friendship Association. According to Sharra, the deputy chairman of the Omonia branch in Tirana was detained for 18 hours. Omonia Chairman Sotiraq Qiriazati wrote in his letter to President Berisha that, "in recent days, the ShlK [National Intelligence Service] and the police have been subjecting us to a wave of psychological repression, with detentions, raids on homes, and searches of Omonia offices." The day before the delivery of this letter, which attempts to connect the recent detentions to the criminal incident in the barracks at Peshkepi, the Public Order Ministry's spokesman had explained that "all Albanian citizens, regardless of their ethnicity, are obliged to obey the law of the Albanian state."
