FR940118-0-00025 FR940118-0-00008 40 CFR Part 52 [CA&hyph;14&hyph;5&hyph;5756; FRL&hyph;4822&hyph;3] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision; San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the Federal Register on September 2, 1992. The revisions concern rules from the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD) which is comprised of the following eight air pollution control districts (APCDs): Fresno County APCD, Kern County APCD, Kings County APCD, Madera County APCD, Merced County APCD, San Joaquin County APCD, Stanislaus County APCD, and Tulare County APCD. This approval action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rules control VOC emissions from vegetable oil processing and from can and coil coating operations. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action is effective on February 17, 1994. ADDRESSEES : Copies of the rule revisions and EPA's evaluation report for each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region IX office during normal business hours.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On September 2, 1992 at 57 FR 40157, EPA proposed to approve the following rules into the California SIP: SJVUAPCD Rule 461.2, Vegetable Oil Processing Operations, and SJVUAPCD Rule 460.4, Can and Coil Coating Operations. Rule 461.2 was adopted by SJVUAPCD on April 11, 1991; and Rule 460.4 was adopted by SJVUAPCD September 19, 1991. The rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on May 30, 1991 and January 28, 1992 respectively. The rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the NPR cited above. EPA has evaluated the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPR cited above. EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and evaluations has been provided at 57 FR 40157 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at EPA's Region IX office (TSDs for Rule 461.2 and 460.4 dated April 30, 1992 and March 12, 1992 respectively). Response to Comments A 30-day public comment period was provided at 57 FR 40157. EPA received no comments on rule 460.4. EPA received comments on rule 461.2 from three sources: (1) The National Cottonseed Products Association (``NCPA''); (2) the J.G. Boswell Company (``Boswell''); and (3) the Institute of Shortening and Edible Oils, Inc (``Institute''). All three commented on SJVUAPCD's definition of volatile organic compounds (``VOCs'')_suggesting that the definition not include vegetable oil emissions. In addition, the NCPA and Institute also recommmended that SJVUAPCD rule 461.2 specify performance standards or emissions limits rather than specific equipment for RACT controls. The comments are discussed below. 1. Definition of VOC Summary of comments: Rule 461.2 defines VOC as ``any compound containing at least one atom of carbon except for the following exempt compounds.'' Vegetable oil is not listed as an exempt compound. The comments stated that the rule should exempt vegetable oil from the definition of VOC because of its low volatility and because the EPA has determined that vegetable oil should not be considered a VOC under EPA test methods.
