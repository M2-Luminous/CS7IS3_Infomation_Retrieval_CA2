Speaking to our correspondent, Captain Mahmud Bidel, the head of the research unit and self-sufficiency department of the naval forces referred to the exhortations of his eminence, Imam Khomeyni (may God be pleased with him) in 1362 [year beginning 21 March 1983] on the need to attain self-sufficiency in the three branches of the armed forces and the Corps, said: According to the decree of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the great leader and the commander in chief of the armed forces, which he issued at the end of last year, a research unit was added to the self-sufficiency department. He added: The objectives of this measure were to strengthen the base of the country's defense. The naval forces have carried out effective work in the field of electronic warfare and have attained remarkable success. The head of the research unit and self-sufficiency department of the naval forces continued: One of the most important tasks of this force in the aftermath of the imposed war has been to modernize the radar systems of the naval forces and to coordinate them with the latest techniques currently being used in the world. Referring to the continued military embargo against Iran by world powers, Captain Bidel said: The necessary links have been forged with the industrial university and with the country's industry for the manufacture of the components needed for the various units of the Navy. He said: According to my estimates, we saved 765 million rials last year on the purchase of various components for military equipment. Fortunately, now that we have forged the necessary links with the industrial university and the country's industry, there has been a 93-percent saving. He added: Last year, the Navy succeeded in manufacturing one of the strategic weapons used in the naval fleet's aviation division. He referred to the fact that these weapons will help in strengthening the projects above sea level and in underwater defense which can assist in search, defense, and reconnaissance tactics. He said: These weapons were used in the joint Iran-Pakistan maneuvers (IR-PAK 94) and amazed the Pakistani naval officials and the international observers. Elaborating on the fact that an underwater reconnaissance unit of Iran would be ready by the end of this year, Captain Bidel said: Armaments related to the identification of underwater units and fleet helicopters will be ready by the end of this year. Regarding the Hamzeh warship (formerly known as the Shahsavar) which had been completed in Azar [22 November-21 December] last year, he said: Preliminaries for the manufacture of submarines that can be used for deep sea diving fitted with heavy-duty equipment have been initiated. He added: The renovation of one hovercraft [preceding word in English] will be completed by the end of this year and it will become operational. Captain Bidel said that an astronomical system had been developed by the marine sciences academy in Nowshahr in collaboration with the research unit and self-sufficiency department of the naval forces and has been put into use. He stated that the preliminaries for the utilization of this system at the marine sciences academy in Sistan va Baluchestan have been completed. He stressed: With the help of this system we can identify celestial bodies from inside the submarine. He added that the naval forces have attained great success in manufacturing underwater communications and said: The research unit and self-sufficiency department has set up an inverse engineering section, in collaboration with the Sharif industrial university and has implemented four projects, including duplication of the computers currently being used worldwide. In conclusion, the head of the research unit and the self- sufficiency department of the naval forces said that the work for the construction of a 150-ton dock has been initiated in Bushehr and will become operational on 22 Bahman [11 February] this [Iranian] year. He said that this dock would be able to accommodate small and large vessels for repairs.
