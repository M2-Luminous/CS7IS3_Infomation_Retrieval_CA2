Khalifah Haftar, commander of the National Libyan Army, and Burayk Suwaysi, official spokesman for the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform, by Mufid 'Abd-al-Rahim "Somewhere in the United States"; date not given] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Rahim: If your differences with the Libyan opposition factions are not substantive, why create this new organization? Haftar: We will be distinguishable from others by our program of action. We do have differences with certain factions. We would not have quit the NFSL if there had not been differences between us. We do not want to be mere public relations people trumpeting non- existent successes without taking concrete action against the regime. Based on our understanding of how this regime handles Libyan forces inside and outside the country, we feel that the way to deal with this regime is through military operations and violence. 'Abd-al-Rahim: Are you an armed organization out to topple the Libyan regime by force? I am asking this question because the new organization is headed by a military man. Suwaysi: Let me first put the record straight. Colonel Khalifah was not appointed chief of the new organization. He remains the commander of the National Libyan Army, virtually all of which has switched sides and joined our new organization. Colonel Khalifah is also a member of the constituent assembly of the new organization, which plans to choose its leadership by a democratic vote that will be held during a general congress in four to five months. Media reports to the contrary are not true. It is not true that we are a military organization only. We will use all means, including military, to advance our objectives. We will use violence as a means to an end, and only as a last resort. We would very much like not to have to resort to violence, which will, naturally, result in bloodshed, and that we certainly do not want. If the regime fulfills the people's demands peacefully, then so be it. Otherwise, we will have no other alternative but to resort to violence against it. [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Rahim: Have you contacted Arab governments, specifically neighboring countries, given that they are more important to you as a Libyan opposition movement. Have you opened any official bureaus in any Arab or foreign country? Suwaysi: We have not contacted these countries, as yet. If this takes place, it will be in a very limited manner, for example like the contacts that should have already been held with the Egyptian brothers. Of course, we intend to contact all the Arab countries soon. We have not opened official bureaus either because we are still a new movement, no more than 40 days old. 'Abd-al-Rahim: How do you view your movement's relationship with the United States, which is without any doubt an important country to you because part of your armed elements and members of your movement are in the United States? Suwaysi: Our relationship with the United States will be as with any other country, based on Libya's national interests. We will develop this relationship to serve the Libyan cause without harming the Libyan people's interests. We hope that the United States will understand the Libyan people's cause and their legitimate demands for freedom, democracy, and human rights. [passage omitted] Haftar: The National Libyan Army, groups of which are in the United States and Europe, is also comprised of nationalist elements within the Libyan Armed Forces who have patriotic feelings. They can carry out military operations against the forces supporting the regime in parallel with the operations we will carry out abroad. [passage omitted] We believe it [the United States] will adopt a neutral stand on the establishment of our movement until we contact it officially to explain our new approach to the situation, an approach that is different from that of the NFSL. [passage omitted] Suwaysi: [passage omitted] A military strike on Libya sounds like the easiest option open to the Clinton administration. We are certain that al-Qadhdhafi would like nothing better than for the United States to launch an air attack on Libya to recoup some popular support for his regime. Such an attack would be a disaster, since it would once again cast al- Qadhdhafi in the role of a hero and victim. 'Abd-al-Rahim: Are you saying that you and the Clinton administration do not see eye to eye on how to exploit the Lockerbie affair to topple the al-Qadhdhafi regime? Suwaysi: No. We have said publicly that the removal of al- Qadhdhafi is a matter for the Libyan people. We are not asking the United States to dislodge al-Qadhdhafi for us; all we want from the United States is to understand and support the Libyan people's goals. Given that the United States has not been able to muster the required UN Security Council vote to impose a moratorium on Libyan oil exports, it may be tempted by its "cowboy" mentality to deliver a strike against Libya. Such a course of action, in our opinion, will hardly eliminate al-Qadhdhafi; it may even make him stronger for having been the target of an external attack. [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Rahim: Are you aware of any further plans to harm Libyan opposition figures after the disappearance of [former Libyan Foreign Minister] Mansur al-Kikhya? Haftar: No. It must be pointed out, however, that a decision to hit Libyan opposition figures is determined by whether the resources and opportunity are available. If these are available, al-Qadhdhafi will not be deterred by any scruples. To our knowledge, al-Qadhdhafi now lacks the ability to target Libyan opposition figures.
