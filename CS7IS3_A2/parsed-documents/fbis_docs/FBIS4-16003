As SNARK was informed in the Defence Ministry today, there is some destruction in the suburbs of Kapan. According to the preliminary data, there are no fatalities. The Armenian Air-Defence Service tried to prevent the air-raid, but the Azerbaijani planes, flying at low altitude, managed to get away. Over the last 48 hours this was already the third attack of the Azerbaijani Army at the cities of Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, located far from the confrontation line. Yesterday Levon Zurabyan acting in the capacity of the Armenian President's press-secretary in his interview to SNARK qualified those actions as terrorist acts against the peaceful population, caused by Azerbaijan's disability to succeed at the battle field.
