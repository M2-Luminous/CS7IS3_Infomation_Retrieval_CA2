The plea was made by Endel Lippmaa, an ex-minister for relations with Russia, who argued that Estonia could no longer guarantee the safety of citizens residing in the Russian-controlled area. In recent weeks, the 2,000-square kilometer Petseri region has been the site of several skirmishes between local residents and Russian authorities. In one notable incident last month, Russian militiamen allegedly entered Estonian territory in Varska, in the Petseri county, and accosted a group of local villagers. The militiamen reportedly dragged the villagers across Russia's "administrative border" and beat them. Mr. Lippmaa proposed making the current administrative border with Russia an official state demarcation line, a move which, if carried through, would effectively cede to Russia territory which Estonia has claimed as its own under the terms of the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty. The remarks were made in an interview with Radio Free Europe on March 2 in which Mr. Lippmaa commented on the progress of Estonian-Russian talks. An estimated 6,000 residents out of a total population of roughly 50,000 in the Petseri region are believed to be Estonian citizens. Many Estonians have accused Russia of encouraging ethnic Russians to settle there as a way of reinforcing its claims to the area.
