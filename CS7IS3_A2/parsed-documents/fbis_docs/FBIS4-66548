Briefing newspersons on the issues discussed at the National Council of the CPI which met here from February 8 to 10, the party General Secretary, Mr Indrajit Gupta, said to start with, the government should convene an all-party meet at the national level to discuss the question of `political freedom', and pave the way for a dialogue with the various political forces in the State. He said the National Council also wanted the problem to be resolved within the framework of the Constitution while preserving the special status of the region under Article 370 and respecting the desire of the people to safeguard their identity. Referring to the external pressure with regard to Kashmir, Mr Gupta said India should take all possible steps to rebuff the United States' anti-Kashmir stand. The evil designs of the United States against peace and amity in the sub-continent, must be frustrated. Charging the government with procrastination and lacking in a clear cut policy on Kashmir, he said the Kashmir administration was not responding to the people's urges as it was treating the problem merely as a law and order one. Instead of creating a favourable condition for initiating a political process in the State, the Narasimha Rao Government was relying only on administrative measures, he said. Mr Gupta also opined that the leaders of both the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the CPI should "sit together and talk of the possibilities of a merger." These two parties, he said, had a special relationship which had to be developed, although there were differences on some questions. The two should also seriously consider the question of the unity of mass organisations like the trade unions, rural organisations and students' organisations. "Both of us together can and should give a new turn to the nation's politics," he said, adding that the Left parties have planned an intensive nation-wide campaign in February and March and also a march to the Parliament on April 5 to protest against the economic policies of the Rao government.
