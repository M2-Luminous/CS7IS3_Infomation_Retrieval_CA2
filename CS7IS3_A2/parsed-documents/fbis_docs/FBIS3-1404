The African National Congress [ANC] and violence monitor Mary de Haas said there were unconfirmed reports of another 10 killings throughout Natal, and in northern Natal particularly, where political fighting is said to be rife. The kwaZulu police said four people were killed in separate incidents in homeland-administered areas at the weekend. Ms Alice Mhlongo, 43, and Mr Mzokhona Daniel Mhlongo, 17, were attacked and shot dead at their home in Umbumbulu, south of Durban. Ms Regina Mthembu, 38, also of Umbumbulu, was shot and killed by unknown assailants and Ms Thembi Khumalo, 36, of Esikhawini on Natal's north coast, was stabbed to death. A criminal motive is being investigated in all cases. Police spokesman Maj Hamilton Ngidi said two people were killed in kwaMakutha, south of Durban, and two people were fatally shot in Ndwedwe, north of Durban. In Bhambayi, also north of Durban, four people were murdered. ANC northern Natal spokesman Zipho Mkhize said six people were believed to have been killed in Ntambanana, near Empangeni, since last week. Ms de Haas said there were unconfirmed reports that three people had been murdered in Ensingweni, near Mtunzini, on Natal's north coast. She said the situation in areas around nearby Eshowe were worsening with reports of a politically motivated murder in S'qwanjana on Friday. Women in the kwaMfana area were fleeing their homes at night and sleeping in the bushes after a number of homes had been attacked and set alight, she said. On Sunday there were fears of a confrontation between IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] supporters and ANC members after the network of independent monitors alleged that IFP members had occupied an ANC rally venue in Vryheid, northern Natal. The ANC on Natal's south coast said it was worried about similar conflict linked to its rally, to be addressed by SA Communist Party stalwart Joe Slovo on Sunday. Continuing violence in Natal was the subject of urgent talks between State President F W de Klerk and IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Durban on Saturday. There the leaders agreed to establish a mechanism to search for solutions to the problem of holding elections in kwaZulu- administered areas, and both pledged to try and reach agreements aimed at eliminating violence and the present tension in Natal. While they met, about 10,000 ANC supporters marched through Pietermaritzburg to support their stated demand of free political activity in the province. On Friday, the ANC brought Durban to a standstill when 80,000 supporters demonstrated for the same reason. The ANC has demanded the immediate deployment of South African troops and the National Peace Keeping Force (NPKF) in the region to ensure free political activity, and warned of "unprecedented" mass action if its demands were ignored. Expressing its concern about the worsening situation in the province, the Natal church leaders' group on Friday said the SA Defence Force (SADF) should be deployed in violence flash points. The Democratic Party (DP) said the situation was bad enough to warrant a postponement of the April elections. The initial weekend death toll has brought to over 120 the number killed in Natal since last Friday.
