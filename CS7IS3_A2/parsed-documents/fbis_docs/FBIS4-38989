Karatchenya visited the Central Asia states and Georgia. He visited these states with the intent to put into effect a request by Eduard Shevardnadze, President of Georgia about the deployment of joint CIS forces in Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone and about the appeal by Boris Yeltsin to CIS members. The decision regarding the troop deployment might be adopted as early as Friday, after Karatchenya briefs Yeltsin on the results of his visit to the two regions. Karatchenya told the Azeri President that although Central Asia supports the peacemaking forces, questions do remain. In this respect Karatchenya said that Azerbaijan's position has particular significance. He admitted that the CIS forces will consist only of Russian troops. According to Aliyev, this situation arises serious questions. "We speak about the CIS as forces cooperating as a commonwealth. And now it has become evident that talk is only about Russian troops. I think that international authority of the CIS as a Commonwealth of members with equal rights will suffer from this arrangement," said Aliyev. The confidentiality of the talks is testimony to the fact that Speaker Rasul Guliyev, Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, State Secretary for International Affairs Vafa Guluzade, and Vice-Premier Abbas Abbasov waited for the closed-door discussions to come to an end. During the short recess, TURAN was able to speak with Karatchenya who said that "Azerbaijan's leadership sees the deployment of CIS peacemaking forces into Georgia as necessary, but with the active participation of the United Nations and the CSCE. The Azeris think it is necessary to increase the contingent of UN observers to equal that of the CIS. I do not exclude the fact that the Azeri President will adopt the decision to send an Azeri military subdivision as part of the CIS peacemaking forces to Abkhazia, since these must be joined." He further said that discussion is about a 400-soldier batallion. It is expected that CIS forces totalling 2500 to 3000 people will be deployed to Georgia. The UN will finance the bulk of the expenses. The operation for the CIS force deployment to Georgia is scheduled to [sentence as received; passage apparently dropped in transmission] Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone can be applied, in part, be applied to the Karabakh situation.
