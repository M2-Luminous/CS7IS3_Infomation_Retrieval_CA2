Thomas Eddy Dupiton is demanding the discharge of President Firmin Jean-Louis, whom he accuses of being an agent of the international community: [Begin recording, in Creole] We see that Firmin Jean-Louis, as I told you yesterday, is at the service of the international [community]. They had to come and give him instructions. But the instructions that he receives -- it is not the Senate of the Republic that would execute them. Those are instructions for Firmin and all the hired hands of his ilk. What do you see happening today? Firmin is taking orders from foreigners. He has blocked the Senate of the Republic since he ratified Malval. When Firmin has the entire international [community] behind him, the office that the country would have supported -- that all men of good faith would have supported -- this office would be accepted and would be imposed on those who still stand up in this country, those who do not crawl and who do not take their orders from foreigners. [end recording] These statements were made on 3 February by Senator Thomas Eddy Dupiton in reaction to the visit of U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing to the Senate of the Republic.
