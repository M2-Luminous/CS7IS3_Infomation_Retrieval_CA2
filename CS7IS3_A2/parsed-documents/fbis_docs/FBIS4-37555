[passage omitted] Apparently, during the same gathering in Crans Montana an interview was arranged where the Iranian president carried out an interview with them by satellite -- for questions to be put to the president and the respected president to respond to them. He replied and made Iranians proud. I listened to the contents of the president's replies. They were all excellent. The nation endorses such issues [crowd chants: "God is great," "Khamene'i is the leader," "Death to the anti-independence and revolution"], especially as his remarks were in accordance with the high objectives of the nation and in line with the wishes of our great leader [Khamene'i]. I hope that God makes his words effective. Another point I should mention here is that the eminent leader's directions should be implemented by the people. When we speak of the eminent leader... [pauses] The same reasons that since the era of the Shaykh Mofid [Islamic scholar] until now have given the great personalities and sources of emulation legitimacy, religious authority, religious leadership, influence of word, authority to be obeyed, they have made our great leader, Ayatollah Khamene'i as well. [crowd chants: "Peace be upon Prophet Muhammad and his scion"] We recognize the authority of our leader as a leader for the same reasons that we recognized the grand Ayatollahs Esfahani, Borujerdi, Hakim, Ruhollah [Khomeyni], Golpayegani, and 'Araki, may God extend their shadow. Please pay attention: His order is influential. If even a religious leader issues a fatwa [religious edict] and Khamene'i issues a ruling, that ruling takes precedence over the fatwa. If a religious leader has written a book of religious practices -- and he has the right to do so, he is an honorable source of emulation -- he has written in his book of religious practices. I think it is religiously forbidden to enter arms deals with a certain country. That becomes a fatwa. Then the leader sits down and finds that to deal in arms with such and such a country is appropriate today. He issues a ruling that the government should sell arms. The government is obliged to carry out the ruling and set aside the fatwa, that is because the religious leaders here say: A ruling cancels a fatwa, but a fatwa does not cancel a ruling.
