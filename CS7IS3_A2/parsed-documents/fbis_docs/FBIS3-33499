Of the possible agreements between the IMF and the different countries, the government decided to quit the "enhanced surveillance" [two preceding words in English] agreement which follows the "stand by" [two preceding words in English] on strictness regarding IMF loans and a quarterly control of the established goals. "Enhanced monitoring" [two preceding words in English] will be conducted instead. Official sources told BUSQUEDA that the new agreement will be established in March. The "staff" [preceding word in English] of experts headed by Western Hemisphere Director Steri Beza will study details of the program submitted by Uruguay with the adjustments made last week. For 1994 there is a predicted inflation rate of 35 percent, a fiscal deficit of 0.5 percent of the GDP, a devaluation of 2 percent per month, and a salary increase of 32 percent for public employees "consistent" with the devaluation percentage. It was stated that the choice of a more slack agreement with eventual measures for the correction of incorrect fiscal spending this year "leave doubts among IMF experts about their real fulfillment." The approval of the IMF executive board (which is reserved for the "stand by") is not required for "enhanced surveillance" but it supposes explicit acceptance by the IMF of the country's economic program. It was explained that "enhanced monitoring" also has quarterly goals but it allows "greater margins for deviation from them," and the IMF controls are more "global."
