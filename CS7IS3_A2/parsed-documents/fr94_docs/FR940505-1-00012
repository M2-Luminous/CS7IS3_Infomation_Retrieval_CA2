FR940505-1-00012 FR940505-1-00006 Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation 33 CFR Part 402 Tariff of Tolls: Proposed Revision AGENCY: Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation and the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority of Canada have jointly established and presently administer the St. Lawrence Seaway Tariff of Tolls. This Tariff sets forth the level of tolls assessed on all commodities and vessels transiting the facilities operated by the Corporation and the Authority. To improve the competitiveness of the Seaway, the Corporation and the Authority are proposing that the Tariff be amended to provide that the charges for the 1994 season under the Tariff Schedule be the same as for the 1993 season, except the toll for steel slab. In an effort to increase steel slab shipments, the Corporation and the Authority are proposing a separate, lower toll for this commodity, which is now included under the general cargo rate. In addition, the Corporation and the Authority are proposing for competitive purposes that the Incentive Tolls Program be continued and be revised by increasing the amounts of the discounts and rebates and their applicability. DATES: Any party wishing to present views or data on the proposed revision may file comments with the Corporation on or before June 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments to Marc C. Owen, Chief Counsel, Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marc C. Owen, Chief Counsel, Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366&hyph;0091. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In and effort to improve the Seaway's competitiveness, it is proposed to amend ยง402.8, the Schedule of Tolls, to provide the charges for the 1994 season under the Tariff Schedule be the same as for the 1993 season, except the toll for steel slab. In an effort to increase steel slab shipments, the Corporation and the Authority are proposing a separate, lower toll for this commodity, which is now included under the general cargo rate. This separate toll would be a 25 cents per metric ton reduction for each of the two Seaway segments, a net reduction of 50 cents per metric ton for vessels transiting both segments. As a conforming amendment, paragraph (i) of ยง402.3, the definition of ``general cargo'' would be amended to reflect that steel slab is no longer included in this category. The Corporation and the Authority also are proposing, for competitive purposes, that the Incentive Tolls Program be continued and be revised. Section 402.9 would be amended to provide that a new business incentive of a 50% discount would be granted to a carrier immediately upon application before transit or upon arrival at its destination. In addition, North American origins and destinations will be grouped into five geographic regions to discourage cargo diversions. It is additionally proposed to amend ยง402.11 to provide that volume rebates of 50% would be available to both shippers and receivers of cargoes with a satisfactory three year traffic history for the commodity involved. When a particular shipper's or receiver's shipments of a specific commodity exceed their highest single season tonnage amount of that commodity of the previous three seasons by at least 25,000 metric tons, the rebate would be applied to all tons exceeding that previous high. This change will target to rebates more directly to shippers and receivers. The alternate use of bulkers program (section 402.13) would be continued, but amended to include steel slab as a separate commodity. That section would also be amended to make clarifying, editorial changes that have proved necessary from experience, but the manner in which the provisions is interpreted and administered would not change. Finally, a new section 402.15 would be added to clarify that carriers, shippers, or receivers would be eligible to receive only one of the incentives, i.e., new business, discount, bulk trade discount, or volume rebate, for any one shipment.
