In this period a communique reflecting the principles of cooperation of these structures has been signed, regularized exchanges of information have been set up, important steps have been taken in the defense of freedom of speech and of the press in Azerbaijan, and appeal has been passed to state organs about unifying forces in the sector of eliminating problems created by Armenian aggression, and a joint press conference by opposition parties was organized for the first time. These meetings helped to bring together the positions of parties on a number of important issues and prepared the ground for their broad cooperation. But now the need to broaden the circle of joint activity of the political structures of political organizations and to develop and strengthen domestic and foreign ties demands that the work of these meetings be built up to a qualitatively new level. This is only possible under conditions that other structures of the parties begin to cooperate. At a period when the sociopolitical situation in Azerbaijan is gradually worsening and social conditions are becoming more serious, and in a period when problems created by the war have reached dangerous limits, establishing such unity would be a great step in the direction of finding the optimal way out of the situation, maintaining stability in the country, and creating civic solidarity. Taking all of this into consideration, we appeal to the parties we represent to make use of closer forms of cooperation and expedite the work of establishing unity among the democratic forces. [Signed] APF [Azerbaijan People's Front], Musavat Party, People's Liberation Party, Azerbaijan Democratic Party
