Korean businesses reported nine damage claims against foreign companies worth 2.41 million U.S. dollars last month, up 225 percent in number and 296.1 percent in value from January last year. In contrast, foreign companies demanded damages in 26 Korean cases, off 33.3 percent from a year earlier, worth 1.26 million dollars. As trade volume grows and export lines diversify, Korean businesses are suffering more damage, a KCAB official observed. Another reason for the increase in claims by Korean companies is their change of attitude in reacting aggressively to cut-throat world competition following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round pact, the official said. Their trade claims reported to the KCAB totaled 106 last year, up 65.6 percent from 1992, and foreign claims against Korean companies dropped from 395 to 387. Trade friction with the United States overshadowed that with other countries as cases hit 28 last year and nine last month, followed by China with 13 last year and four in January. Although China is Korea's third biggest trading partner after the United States and Japan, Korean companies claim many damages because of China's inconsistent trade practices, the official said.
