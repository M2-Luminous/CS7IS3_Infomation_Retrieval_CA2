Foreign Minister Willy Claes explained to the press this afternoon that, despite the fact that the Security Council has not made an official decision on the desire of the Belgians to withdraw from UNAMIR [UN Mission in Rwanda], its members have told the Belgian Government that they acknowledge and fully understand the Belgian decision. For Willy Claes, it is important to act quickly. We do not have any time, he said. Listen to him. He spoke to Gerard de Saigne: [Begin recording] [de Saigne] I would like to ask you two questions. The first one is this: You said that we do not have any time. But why so much haste? The second: Have there been any precedents.... [Claes, interrupting] I do not understand your first question. [de Saigne] You said that we do not have any time to repatriate our troops. This means that it is important to act quickly. I am asking you: Why so much haste? Why so fast? Why right now? [Claes] I still do not understand your first question. What do you mean? [de Saigne] You said: We do not have any time. This means that we have to act quickly. Why do you want to repatriate our troops so fast? Is it not clear? [Claes] If I understand you, you are saying: Stay a bit longer. [de Saigne] I am not saying that. I am asking you why. [Claes] You are intimating.... [de Saigne, interrupting] I am not intimating anything. I am asking a clear question. [Claes] For me, it is not clear because I have already explained four times why. I did not speak in double Dutch, but I will have to explain things once more for your benefit. Chaos is increasing by the minute in Kigali and in the rest of the country. Since yesterday -- and a colleague of yours showed it in pictures -- the Rwandan Armed Forces have even been using the most modern multiple rocket launchers. This means that, any moment now, even the airport runway, which is considered as the most strategic point in the whole country, is in danger of being destroyed. If you want your troops to have an unthinkable fate -- they are like rats in a trap -- it is your responsibility. We will not accept it. Moreover, I would like to remind you that the anti-Belgian climate has meant that the UN soldiers have been running extra risks for several days now. The others do not seem to be running these risks for the time being. We even have information from reliable sources according to which the Rwandan Armed Forces are getting ready to attack the Belgian UN soldiers as soon as the Belgian paratroopers leave. [end recording] [passage omitted] An increasing number of refugees are flocking to the border countries, including Zaire. About 1,000 of them are stuck at the Zairean border at the moment, since the Rwandan authorities have decided to close that border. Many of these refugees are Tutsis.
