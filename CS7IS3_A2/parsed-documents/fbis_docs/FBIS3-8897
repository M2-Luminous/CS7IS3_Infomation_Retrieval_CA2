There was talk about a need to set up a 100-person constituent assembly and also about the possibility of legal experts from the President's Office preparing a Constitution, assisted by presidential councils to be set up by Walesa or in cooperation with extraparliamentary parties. which are working on their own drafts. "The president will present the new Constitution directly to the nation, and the nation will adopt it in a referendum," Lech Walesa's associates announced. All significant extraparliamentary parties and blocs have been trying to come up with their own ideas on what kind of constitution Poland should have. According to the ZChN, the PC, the RdR, the PL, and the KK The most popular constitutional commission outside of the Sejm was established by a coalition comprising the Christian-National Union [ZChN], the Center Accord [PC], Movement for the Republic [RdR], and the Peasant Accord [PL]. The commission's proceedings are coordinated by Walerian Piotrowski, chairman of the National Assembly's Constitutional Commission of the previous term. During the previous term of parliament, he was a senator for the ZChN. The commission includes as its members leaders of all of the parties forming the alliance, among them Wieslaw Chrzanowski and Marek Jurek of the ZChN, Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Ludwik Dorn of the PC, Romuald Szeremietiew and Lech Jeczmyk of the RdR, and Gabriel Janowski and Henryk Bak of the PL. Recently, as the right-wing camp was joined by the Conservative Coalition [KK] (a group formed after a split within the Conservative Party), the commission began to also include KK leaders Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski and Lech Mazewski. Proceedings by Piotrowski's Constitutional Commission began on 17 January, and the basis for the commission's work was determined to be made up of two drafts: a Senate draft of 1991 and the PC draft from 1992. Actually, both of these propositions suited the views of the PC leaders in the various periods of the party's activity. The Senate draft, whose main promoter and coauthor is Senator Alicja Grzeskowiak of the PC, who is also a member of the Senate club of Solidarity and of the current National Assembly's Constitutional Commission, proposes strong presidential power, whereas the PC's draft is more cautious when it comes to defining the powers of the head of state. Leaders of the parties that are working on the draft do not hide the fact that a "too strong presidential power may lead to authoritarian rule, similar to anarchy." The PC-ZChN-RdR-PL coalition has made a suggestion, on Ludwik Dorn's initiative, to the parties in the parliament, that a constitutional "Roundtable" be formed. A constitutional draft would be adopted by a National Constitutional Council, which would include proportionate representations by parties that gained at least 1 percent of the vote in the recent parliamentary elections. A draft agreed upon by such a commission would then be adopted by the Sejm on a "gentlemen's agreement" basis, just like the "Roundtable" agreements of 1989. But the governing coalition rejects the idea. According to Solidarity and Secretariat A Social Constitutional Commission under the patronage of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity has been working on a constitution from scratch. The commission was set up during a congress of center-right-wing parties that took place in Krakow on 5 December 1993. The idea to establish this commission was put forward by the Secretariat of Center-Right-Wing Parties, which, among others, includes Christian Democracy-Party of Labor (of Tomasz Jackowski), Movement of the Third Republic (of Jan Parys), and the Polish Association (of Andrzej Anusz). Noninvolvement in politics is the commission's basic rule of action. Even though after Solidarity assumed patronage over the commission the trade union's chief, Marian Krzaklewski, became the commission's honorary chairman, the commission primarily includes different kinds of experts, including legal ones. In fact, the commission is chaired by Andrzej Rosciszewski, dean of the Warsaw Bar Association. The commission's sessions also include participation by members of the Senate club of Solidarity, such as Piotr Lukasz Juliusz Andrzejewski, Zbigniew Romaszewski, and August Chelkowski. Senator Alicja Grzeskowiak has also declared her willingness to participate (she is already a member of two other constitutional commissions). Among others, Jan Olszewski, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Kazimierz Barczyk, and Jozefina Hrynkiewicz debate as experts in four groups: human and civic rights and duties; general constitutional principles as well as the defense system and extraordinary emergencies; political, social, and economic system; and sources of law and justice system's institutions. The commission's groups often conduct tours financed by Solidarity; the most recent of those took place this past weekend in Rynia, in the Zegrzyn lagoon area. The Secretariat's politicians are hopeful that the law on proceedings for preparing the Constitution will include a citizens' constitutional initiative. After the rejection of Lech Walesa's draft, a similar proposition was suggested by Jerzy Jaskiernia of the Democratic Left Alliance. According to him, a group of half a million citizens should enjoy the possibility of submitting their own constitutional draft. "Only Solidarity is capable of gathering half a million signatures," one of the Secretariat's politicians says. According to UPR, the PChD, the PK, the SLCh, and the SND "The Accord of 11 November," which includes the Union for Real Politics [UPR] of Janusz Korwin-Mikke, the Party of Christian Democrats [PChD] of Pawel Laczkowski, the Conservative Party [PK] of Aleksander Hall, the Peasant-Christian Party [SLCh] of Jozef Slisz, and the National-Democratic Party [SND] of Jan Zamoyski, does not intend to set up a constitutional commission of their own, even though a team is already working that is supposed to present "constitutional theses" of the economic right wing by 1 May 1994. "Out of the existing drafts, we feel that the Senate draft fulfills our expectations the most," the coalition's leaders say, but they also emphasize that the draft is not perfect. Who With Walesa? Lech Walesa counts the most on cooperation with Solidarity and its Constitutional Commission. The president, while himself being in a dispute with the government, is looking for an ally in his dispute with parliament (the trade union is also in a dispute with the government). Lech Falandysz, deputy chief of the President's Office, stressed several times that the presidential proposition of a citizens' constitutional initiative was a cordial gesture addressed precisely at Solidarity. The trade union's activists and the Secretariat's politicians do not rule out a tactical alliance with Walesa during the fight for the Constitution, but they want to remain very cautious when it comes to any kind of wider cooperation. Right-wing activists of the other two blocs outside of the Sejm do not see a chance for cooperation with the president, while almost everyone agrees that the completely extraparliamentary way of adopting the Constitution suggested by Lech Walesa is unacceptable to them.
