The conflict resulted in the deaths of at least 600 ordinary citizens from the two sides. Dr. Ahmad al-Jalabi, head of the [Unified] Iraqi National Congress Executive Bureau, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone yesterday from his residence in the city of Salah al-Din in north Iraq that "life has returned to normal" in most Kurdish areas since the meeting held last Sunday between Barzani and Talabani. [passage omitted] Asked about the clashes that broke out the day before yesterday in the Qal'at Dizah and Halabjah areas near the border with Iran, al-Jalabi said that the National Congress, which has been entrusted with the task of disengaging the warring militias, sent forces belonging to it to these areas yesterday "to disengage the forces and prevent fighting from breaking out between them." PUK (Talabani) sources accused joint forces of the KDP (Barzani) and Kurdish Islamic organizations, which are accused of collaborating with Iran and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, of attacking PUK positions in these areas. But sources from Barzani's party have denied that the KDP forces participated in these clashes, which they said took place between "PUK forces and Islamic Movement forces only." AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that a tripartite meeting bringing together leaders from Barzani's party, Talabani's party, and the Islamic Movement was held yesterday in Irbil to discuss ways of stopping the clashes in the border areas.
