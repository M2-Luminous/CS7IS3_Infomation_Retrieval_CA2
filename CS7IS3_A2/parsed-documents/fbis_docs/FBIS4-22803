Davydov: "Situation is Complex But Under Control: From A Ministry of Railways Selector Conference"] [Text] In opening yesterday's selector conference, Minister of Railways G.M. Fadeyev noted that, notwithstanding the increase in economic difficulties, the railroad workers of Russia are steadfastly carrying out the transporting of freight and passengers. This has been promoted to a large extent by the decisions adopted during the December and March expanded boards, the meeting of railroad chiefs with V.S. Chernomyrdin and also by the results of the regular assembly of railroad chiefs in Yekaterinburg, where basically new approaches were developed for solving a number of questions. Certainly, the continuing decline in shipments and the inoperative payment mechanism are aggravating the status of the railroad workers. The minister stated that the situation is complicated and not under control and he appealed to all worker collectives to calmly and confidently implement the program as developed. The reference point is the same for everyone -- a wage agreement which must serve as a guide. In accordance with this agreement, the average branch wage in March will amount to approximately 291,000 rubles, that is, indexed by a factor of 1.43 (according to the wage agreement -- 1.40). Today's most urgent task -- to reduce expenses and increase income. The decisions handed down by the March board and the conclusions drawn by the assembly of railroad chiefs furnish specific recommendations in this regard. However, not all of the transport subunit commanders are coordinating their actions with these recommendations. It is sufficient to state that nine billion more rubles were paid out during the first quarter owing to the fact that some railroads had indexed their wages higher than the wage agreement. This applies first of all to the Far Eastern, West-Siberian, Kemerovo, Kuybyshev and Southeastern main lines. Nor is full responsibility being displayed in all areas with regard to the implementation of another strategically important decision -- ensuring that the contingent of service personnel is in conformity with the true work volume. Compared to March of last year, the volume of shipments declined by 30 percent, while the work force increased by 16,000 individuals. This factor alone caused a loss of 22 billion rubles. In order to correct the situation, the number of people engaged in carrying out shipments must be increased by 14,000 by the end of the first quarter and by 45,000 before the end of the year. The minister suggested that this could be achieved by utilizing the experience of the Moscow Railroad, where skilful use was made of the mechanism of a natural run-off of people. The situation with regard to the payment of wages on the Trans-Baykal and BAM [Baykal-Amur Main Line] railroads, where they are only beginning to cope with the indebtedness for February, has been evaluated as completely intolerable. Blame has been directed at the Sverdlovsk, Kemerovo and other freight railroads, which are handling their accounts with transit main lines in a very poor manner. The railroads owe approximately 16 billion rubles to the collectives of our plants, as a result of which wages have not yet been issued even for December! The first ruble earned must be used for wages, emphasized the minister and only later -- for remaining payments. Unfortunately, however, only 600 billion rubles of the 1.2 trillion rubles' worth of March earnings were credited to income accounts. The remainder -- mutual credits and the output of enterprises. In touching upon wage policy, the minister once again noted that the railroad workers are being forced to index wages, since the prices for the material resources, fuel and electric power being consumed by transport are increasing at excessive rates. The last indexing of passenger rates and the impending freight rates will in all probability make it possible to compensate for the first quarter losses, which reached 200 billion rubles. But the minister appealed for greater flexibility in this matter in the various areas. It bears mentioning that the attraction of freight has been and remains the chief task confronting the railroad and branch leaders. In March, 14,000 more tonnes were loaded on the whole throughout the network than during February. But this, it goes without saying, was of little consolation. Approximately five million tonnes were declined and this was equivalent to a loss of 80 billion rubles! During the selector conference, serious claims were addressed against the head of the Far Eastern Railroad for arbitrariness displayed in the handling of export freight. Because of him, high quality coal that had been paid for with currency, was burned in the boiler rooms of Valdivostock and Khabarovsk. The losses caused by unprotected shipments continue to remain quite high and just as in the past the fines for delays in freight deliveries are considerable. In summing up the discussion, the minister appealed to the railroad leaders to display greater initiative and to propose and adopt unique solutions that will have a positive effect upon the final result. The chief concern is the need for greater attention and specific work in the labor collectives. Without this there will be no improvement in the situation.
