In spite of two meetings this week, the High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament has not reached a consensus on the appointment of a prime minister. The radical opposition, which has distanced itself from the interim parliament, has not changed its position at all and asserts its support for Etienne Tshisekedi. This is what (Christian Badibangi), the vice minister of external relations in the Tshisekedi government, explains to our reporter Francois-Luc Moukouangui. [Begin (Badibangi) recording] One has the impression that the Sovereign National Conference [SNC] has been forgotten. Our people have been forgotten. We are trying to demonstrate that the people are tired and that it is a matter for Mobutu and the Union for Democracy and Social Progress. The Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allies, composed of several political parties and civil organizations, asserts that Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi is the elected candidate of the SNC. The promulgated law, our Constitution, recognizes that this legal decision is not the responsibility of the opposition, a political family distinct from that of the head of state which cannot present a candidate for prime minister.
