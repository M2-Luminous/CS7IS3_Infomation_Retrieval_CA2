Security Council," Albanian Ambassador to the Russian Federation Arbet Cici told ITAR-TASS. These are the principles," he said, "on which Albania bases its relations with other states in the interests of the region. They rule out political and ideological servility, which had sometimes existed in the past". "During the past three years," the diplomat noted, "the new Albanian-Russian relations were backed up by a consular agreement on mutual trips, by agreements on air traffic and automobile service, on public health and the environment, as well as other inter-departmental agreements in the sphere of education, culture, and the arts. Agreements on the protection of investments, avoidance of double taxation, cooperation in the sphere of education, culture, science and technology, as well as a consular convention and several other documents are ready to be signed.
