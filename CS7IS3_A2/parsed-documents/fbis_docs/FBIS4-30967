Regardless of whether the mosque was blown up by radical Croat nationalists, Muslims seeking a pretext to continue the war with the Croats, or on the other hand Serbs with an interest in demolishing the Washington agreement, military and police authorities of Herceg-Bosna simply should not have allowed such sabotage to occur, especially not in an area so politically delicate. It is worth recalling that politicians of Herceg-Bosna had rejected Drazen Budisa's statement about the mosque demolished on territory under Croatian control precisely by citing the example of Livno, which presumably meant that Livno was one of the rare places in Bosnia and Herzegovina where interethnic relations were tolerant to at least some degree. "Breaches of the Washington agreement are being committed both by representatives of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] and representatives of the SDA [Democratic Action Party]. They sometimes behave as though that agreement had not even been signed," we were told by Professor Ivo Komsic, president of the Croatian National Council [HNV], whom we talked to by satellite telephone on Monday morning, 25 April, before news of the mosque's destruction had been published. Negotiations about who would occupy places of leadership in the federation were taking place simultaneously with demolition of the mosque, and Komsic's judgment about the willingness of the Croats and Bosnian Muslims to actually carry out the Washington agreement. Although those negotiations were to have been completed already, so that the expectation was that on Saturday, 23 April, candidates would be proclaimed for president of the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation and prime minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is obvious that an agreement has not yet been reached on that, and that no one knows when it will be reached. Instead of choosing the highest officials of the joint state, the two sides are once again lodging accusations against one another in official communications, stating, for example, that "the Bosnian Muslim side has not performed certain tasks contained in the Washington agreement." Finally, even in the Croatian media, after giving preference to Bosnia and Herzegovina for a time, are speaking once again about Herceg-Bosna as a legal political structure with almost the rank of a state. "I strongly reproach the Croatian media for perpetuating in this way a quasi-state which the Croats themselves consented to abolish in the Washington agreement," says Komsic, president of the Croatian National Council. Provocation or Reflection of Chilled Relations The Livno case, whether it really was only a successful provocation or on the other hand a manifestation of really bad Croat-Muslim relations, symbolizes most precisely the political situation that has cooled once again between Sarajevo on the one hand and Zagreb and Grude on the other, following a few weeks of public idyll. In Livno itself, which we visited the day after the explosion, the reactions of local Croats were utterly contradictory. While some Livno inhabitants commented on the demolition of the mosque with a smile, saying that the "first Muslim missile had been launched," official representatives of Croatian authorities condemned this act of sabotage in the severest terms. "This vandalism is a direct attack on the honor and dignity of the Croatian people of Livno and the Livno area, on the rightness of its defense of its native places and the 1,000-year presence of Croats in these areas," we were told by Mate Franjicevic, assistant commander for political activity of the Livno Petar Kresimir IV Livno Brigade of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council]. Franjicevic wanted to especially emphasize that in the city of Livno, during the entire time of Croat-Muslim conflicts, while young Croatian lads were dying at the hands of the Muslims, not a single murder was recorded, nor was any Muslim religious building demolished, which in other places occurred on both sides. "This act seems to have been aimed at furnishing an argument to all those who saw demolished mosques in Livno some six months ago, since something to that effect was written in some scenario cooked up who knows where," Assistant Commander Franjicevic believes. Aside from Mr. Franjicevic, other officials of the department for political activity of the Livno Brigade of the HVO did not want to talk about the bombing of the mosque. Instead, the GLOBUS journalists in Livno were constantly under the supervision of the military police. Thus our crew was frustrated in its attempt to photograph the Livno imam Sabir Dizdarevic alongside the remains of the mosque. Two members of the military police escorted the GLOBUS reporters to the chief of the military and civilian police, who already knew all details about their movement in the Livno area that day. The dramatic and shaky atmosphere in Livno, as best indicated by the nervous behavior of the military police, indicates for one thing how difficult it is in the field to reestablish cooperation between Croats and Muslims. It seems indeed that interethnic tensions are now growing in places where there had not been conflicts and that the situation is more difficult than in those parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina which were directly affected by the Croat-Muslim war. The Livno imam, who was willing to talk even after the GLOBUS journalists were detained, testified to that. Has the Washington Agreement Provoked Crimes? "Everything in Livno has taken a turn for the worse since the Washington agreement," is the opinion of Imam Dizdarevic. "I will describe to you a banal example which provides good confirmation of this. Before the agreement was signed, we Muslims had no problems in Livno if we strolled through the city wearing a beret. Now, however, the Croats force us to take it off." Another Muslim, who does not allow us to use his name for reasons of personal safety, says that since the signing of the Washington agreement the Muslims have become slaves in Livno. "We have only one restaurant we go to. It is called `Cincar,'" this man in his sixties says, and continues: "It is already becoming the rule for the soldiers of the HVO to come there at a certain time of the day and order the restaurant closed, and they lead away all the Muslims who are there to do various demeaning jobs for them, from washing dishes in a Croatian restaurant all the way to digging foundations for houses the Croats are building," our informant described the position of Muslims in Livno. "The situation was similar in Podhum, before the mosque was also demolished there in October or November last year," says the Livno imam Sabir Dizdarevic. "That mosque no longer exists at all, nor does anyone dare to recall where it stood. To top off this farce, they force us Muslims to haul away the stones that were left from the demolished mosque," Dizdarevic says, convinced nevertheless that the Livno Muslims are in a much better position than the Muslims in nearby villages, since members of the HVO are said to be taking away their livestock, money, tractors, trucks.... According to the 1991 population census, in Livno Opcina there were about 5,700 Muslims and 940 "Yugoslavs," who were mainly Muslims as well. In the Croatian Defense Council, according to a statement by Maj. Gen. Milivoje Petkovic, there are more than 1,000 Muslims. Nevertheless, on 21 July 1991 the Muslim population was disarmed. There was even fighting in which six Muslims were killed. Since the disarmament many Muslims in the Livno area have been left unemployed; many have been driven out. It is said that little cafes and automobiles are being taken away from the Muslims. The Livno Curcinica Mosque, which was bombed very professionally at daybreak on 26 April (although the mosque was in the center of town, adjoining houses were hardly damaged at all), had been subject to bomb attacks before that. Another particularly important element of pressure on the Livno Muslims mentioned by GLOBUS informants is the ban on the SDA, the leading Muslim party, and the effort to persuade the Muslim population to go over en masse to the Muslim Democratic Party of Armin Pohara, who is suitable to Zagreb. The same morning when the mosque was blown up in the center of Livno, Livno imam Sabir Dizdarevic had his first official visit in nine and a half months with Mr. Bakovic, mayor of Livno, who said on that occasion that "destruction of the mosque is not indicative of the view of Croatian policy towards the Muslims." Speaking about the explosion itself, Mr. Bakovic said that those forces which are resisting the federation of Croats and Muslims as a permanent political solution are most probably behind that sabotage. And while in the field the Washington agreement is mainly being carried out in its military aspect, in that Generals Roso and Delic are really collaborating very well, so that even President Komsic of the HNV, usually skeptical towards the actions of the HVO, believes that at the moment there is no danger that new conflicts will break out, what has been happening between Sarajevo and Grude or, perhaps, Mostar) suggests very skeptical conclusions about the good intentions of the signatories of the agreement on a Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. "The Constitution of the federation is completely clear. It states that the cantons on the area of Bosnia and Herzegovina now free are coming together to form a federation. The federation, then, is a complex state community consisting of cantons, not of two entities with predominantly Croat and predominantly Bosnian Muslim populations. That principle of ethnicity as the main criterion for creation of the state has been rejected in the Washington agreement," Professor Komsic believes. The HDZ Has Gambled Away the Trust of Bosnian Croats Komsic finds the second circumstance that makes it difficult to implement the agreement on the federation in the politicians who are supposed to carry out that agreement: "I am not certain that the politicians in the present leadership of Herceg-Bosna are sincerely willing to carry out the Washington agreement. They have been conducting a secessionist policy, perhaps some of them have even been mixed up in acts like ethnic cleansing. How can they now sincerely advocate an integrated Bosnia and Herzegovina," Komsic reflects. In response to our direct question of whether he thinks that the leadership of Herceg-Bosna still has a political option in reserve aside from the Washington agreement, Komsic replied in the affirmative. The third main problem in carrying out the Washington agreement is the impossibility of achieving consensus on the key people of the federation. Dr. Ivo Komsic believes that it is not necessary for the Croats at the top level of the federation to be represented by a politician from the Croatian Democratic Union, since the Croatian Democratic Union, according to Komsic, has lost its political legitimacy. "The HDZ has betrayed the political conception with which it was victorious in the 1990 elections, when it favored the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ever since it allowed itself to become involved in creating the quasistate of Herceg-Bosna, the HDZ ceased to be the legitimate representative of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The policy imposed by the Washington agreement, which speaks about an integral Bosnia and which protects the interests of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is contrary to the policy which the HDZ has been conducting over the last eighteen months, and that is why I really do not think that the Croats should be represented at the top level of the federation by a man from the HDZ," Mr. Komsic says, himself a candidate opposing Kresimir Zubak, president of the presidential council of Herceg-Bosna, for the highest Croat political position in the federation. Komsic nevertheless does not reject the possibility that Kresimir Zubak will become president of the federation or prime minister, "if a political agreement among all parties is achieved to that effect, and if the background checks prove that Zubak has not compromised himself in what he has done in the executive bodies of Herceg-Bosna." Implementation of the Washington agreement is burdened by many details and several essential political issues. The most important thing, however, is whether the real willingness exists on the Croatian and Muslim sides to implement that agreement, to establish the federation between Bosnian Muslims and Croats, and then also the confederation with the Republic of Croatia. A number of events in the past several days -- among which the bombing of the mosque in Livno is particularly important concerning relations of Croats and Muslims in the field, while the failure to reach agreement on the highest government representatives of the federation is extremely dangerous from the political standpoint -- a number of such events, then, show that the Croat-Muslim agreement is in serious trouble.
