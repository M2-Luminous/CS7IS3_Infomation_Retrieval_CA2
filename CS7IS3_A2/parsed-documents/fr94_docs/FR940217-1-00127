FR940217-1-00127 FR940217-1-00015 Tank vessel owners or operators may find it helpful to refer to ยง155.1030 of the VRP IFR for additional requirements. The VRP IFR allows for the submission of a vessel response plan which complies with both sets of response plan requirements. This proposed regulation would require a combined shipboard oil pollution emergency plan and vessel response plan to be submitted to Coast Guard Headquarters for review and approval. To facilitate compliance, the approval period is the same for both plans. For foreign flag tank vessels operating in U.S. waters, the OPA 90 VRP requirements may be considered a local requirement under section 3.1 of the guidelines issued as Resolution MEPC.54(32), and may be included as an appendix to a Regulation 26 plan. On March 5, 1993, the Coast Guard released Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC) No. 2&hyph;93 to provide guidance to the affected community on compliance before Regulation 26 became effective for new ships on April 4, 1993. The NVIC has no regulatory force; it simply provides guidance pending the issuance of regulations. The Coast Guard also issued Change 1 to NVIC 2&hyph;93 on July 28, 1993, providing shipowners with the current list of national operational contact points adopted by the MEPC. Submission of Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans Owners or operators of all U.S. Ships to which this regulation applies must prepare and submit two English language copies of the shipboard oil pollution emergency plans to the appropriate Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) or Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) for review and approval. Under Regulation 26, owners or operators of new ships should have submitted plans by April 4, 1993. The term ``new ship'' means a ship that has been delivered on or after April 4, 1993. For ships delivered after April 4, 1993, plans must be submitted at least 60 days before the owners or operators intend to begin operations. Owners or operators of existing ships will be required to submit plans at least 60 days prior to April 4, 1995, and must have an approved plan on board by April 4, 1995. The term ``existing ship'' is currently defined in ยง151.05 as ``a ship that is not a new ship.'' Therefore, for the purposes of this proposed regulation, ``existing ship'' means a ship that has been delivered before April 4, 1993. Plans must be resubmitted every five years for review and approval. Owners or operators of tank vessels that must comply with OPA 90 VRP requirements may meet the requirements of Regulation 26 by submitting one response plan, pursuant to ยง155.1030, if the plan addresses the following Regulation 26 requirements in addition to the OPA 90 requirements: (1) Discharges of all oils defined under Annex I of MARPOL 73/78, whether carried as cargo or as fuel; (2) contacts for all coastal state and regular ports of call worldwide; and (3) the procedures and point of contact on the ship for coordinating shipboard action with national and local authorities in combating the pollution. The letter of transmittal should clearly state that the plan is intended to comply with the requirements of both Regulation 26 and OPA 90. Combined Regulation 26 and OPA 90 VRP plans must be submitted to the Coast Guard at the following address: Commandant (G&hyph;MEP&hyph;6), U.S. Coast Guard, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It is not significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A draft evaluation has been prepared and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES. This evaluation is summarized below. This proposal will not result in annual costs of $100 million or more; will have no significant adverse effects on competition, employment, or other aspects of the economy, and will not result in a major increase in costs and prices. The Coast Guard estimates that 1,534 U.S. flag ships must comply with Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78. The Coast Guard assumes that 1,234 existing non-tank vessels will prepare Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans to meet the requirements of Regulation 26. In addition, the Coast Guard assumes that 284 existing tank vessels will prepare and submit combined Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans and OPA 90 Vessel Response Plans. The Coast Guard estimates that 16 ships will be constructed in the U.S. between April 4, 1993 and April 4, 1995. Therefore, the total number of ships which must comply with this regulation will equal 1,534.
