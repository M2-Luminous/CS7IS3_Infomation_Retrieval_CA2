The same source claimed that the alert was later renamed regular training exercise. Chief of the GHQ Colonel Arvo Sirel rejected the claims, declaring that the Defence Forces had held a regular exercise on Saturday [7 May] night in order to train the deployment of officers. There was no alert, he stressed, explaining that the GHQ has a practice of holding such sudden checkups of deployment every month. The date for Saturday's exercise had been agreed upon last December, the colonel said. Russia had also reported the violation of its airspace by an Estonian aircraft. The Border Guard Department denied having alerted its forces at that time, but Director General Tarmo Kduts admitted the exercise and a flight of a Border Guard patrol aircraft. "Our aircraft did fly during the exercise, but in Estonian airspace. I do not know what aircraft the Russians are speaking about," he said. Government spokesman Ain Saarna claimed to have no information about an alert or exercise. "I cannot comment it, this is a matter of the Defence Forces," he said.
