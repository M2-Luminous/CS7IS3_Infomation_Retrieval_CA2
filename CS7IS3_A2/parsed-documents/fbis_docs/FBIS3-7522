In Japan, Kim and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa noted the importance of internationally coordinated efforts to solve the nuclear problem, especially among South Korea, Japan, China and the United States. While the two leaders did not rule out the possibility of UN sanctions, they agreed that the channel for dialogue should be left open. In China, President Jiang Zemin's downright opposition to sanctions turned the process completely around in the direction of negotiations. The crisis over North Korea was reaching a new peak and the voices of hard-liners in South Korea and its allies were getting louder before Kim embarked on his trip, especially after Pyongyang threatened war by turning Seoul into a "sea of fire." The UN Security Council hastily convened to discuss adopting a resolution, setting a deadline for North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. But after Kim's trip, the emphasis is on giving Pyongyang one more chance. Developments here coincide with a turnaround at the Security Council, which now plans to issue a statement in the council president's name instead of adopting a resolution. Officials in Seoul indicated they are willing to go along with the Chinese proposal to ensure Beijing takes part in international action. The participation of China, about the only remaining North Korean ally, is the single most important element in persuading Pyongyang that it can no longer count on Beijing's support and in guaranteeing the effectiveness of sanctions. Japanese and Chinese concerns became clear during Kim's visit -- their fear of armed conflict on the Korean peninsula which would put their own national security and economies at stake. Jiang went as far as saying that peace in the region is a prerequisite to China's continued economic growth. Seoul's and Washington's choice is now to wait a little longer rather than risk China's opposition in case a resolution is put to a council vote. Behind this choice is the calculation that if North Korea continues to refuse inspections, Beijing will then lose all justification in demanding further negotiations. South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu leaves for Washington directly from Beijing to brief U.S. officials on the results of the Japan and China summits. He will apparently convey China's insistence on additional diplomatic efforts and discuss how to get North Korea to come back to the negotiating table. Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said his inspection team has to re-enter North Korea within six weeks. Seoul and Washington, in their attempts at dialogue with Pyongyang, are expected to withhold a decision on staging their joint military maneuvers "Team Spirit" until after the six weeks is up. Now that the international mood is tipping toward further dialogue with North Korea, it is Pyongyang's turn to respond.
