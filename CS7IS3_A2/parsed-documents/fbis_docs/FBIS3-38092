Named Ballot Papers To Be Used To Vote on Constitution"] [Text] With a number of personnel matters smoothly resolved, the next item on the agenda of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet session was the long-awaited report by the prime minister "On the Structure of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus." Vyacheslav Kebich has been promising the reorganization since last November. The parliament had tasked the prime minister with presenting the reorganization plan by 15 December 1993. The prime minister's report, however, has been postponed over and over again for various reasons. This time, too, it was announced at the session that Kebich was sick. It is evident to independent observers that Vyacheslav Kebich will not make his report public until the situation in Moscow regarding the unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and Russia is clarified. The parliament, for its part, turned to what may be the focal point of the current session -- the adoption of the Republic of Belarus' new constitution. Attempts to do so have been inconclusive at every succeeding session for as long as 18 months. Now, Vasiliy Sholodonov, chairman of the conciliatory commission tasked with drawing up a draft constitution, proposed that the fundamental law be adopted by voting with named ballot papers. The vote should be held for three days to adopt the three main sections of the constitution: on the Supreme Soviet, the president, and local authorities. When Oleg Trusov, an opposition deputy, wondered if there has been a historical precedent of adopting a constitution in this fashion, Sholodonov responded: "History is created by people, and only then is it analyzed. If there has not been anything like that in history, then there will be." Another opposition parliamentarian, Vladimir Kakovko, retorted: "You have just fashionably explained to us how we can go down in history, but we may just enter the Guinness Book of World Records instead." Be that as it may, the deputies approved the procedure for voting with named ballot papers and appointed a commission to count votes, which presented a ballot paper design. Upon receiving a ballot paper, a deputy is obliged to sign his or her name and subsequently confirm his vote by affixing his or her signature. According to the vote-counting commission chairman, the ballot papers offer splendid protection from forgery. Under this system, not only will the 250-270 parliamentarians present take part in this session, but also the deputies who are currently absent for valid or not very valid reasons (the Belarusian parliament comprises a total of 346 deputies). By introducing named ballot papers the parliamentary majority expects to win the requisite number of votes -- 231 -- to pass the section on the president first. Meanwhile, a draft Supreme Soviet decree on calling parliamentary elections on 20 November 1994 has already been handed to the deputies. Thus, the "party of power" has embarked on the practical implementation of its strategic plan to adopt the constitution, to elect the president, and only then to hold elections for the Supreme Soviet.
