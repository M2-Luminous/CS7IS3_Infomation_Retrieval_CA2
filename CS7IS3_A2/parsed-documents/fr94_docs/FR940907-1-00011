The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 17) to establish additional Class E airspace at New York, NY. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide additional controlled airspace down to 700 â€™ above ground level for IFR operations at Teterboro Airport, NJ. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that, when promulgated, this proposed rule will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows:
