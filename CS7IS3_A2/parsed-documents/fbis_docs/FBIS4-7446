However, sometimes coincidence is a much more important factor than the planned goal. We first stumbled across Mr. Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in a Washington restaurant, the proprietor of which is a Croat. It was the night before signing the agreement. Mr. Silajdzic and his company sat next to our table where there were five or six Croatian journalists. He promised he would say something, but suddenly got up (it seems that the reason was a child that fell asleep) and went toward the door. We also got up, but too late. We only managed to ask him how to include the Serbs in all that, so, imitating the Zagreb dialect, he said: "We will see." Then there was another coincidence on the Lufthansa flight from Washington to Frankfurt on Saturday night. We spotted Silajdzic again. This time he was with Alija Izetbegovic, in the first class compartment of Lufthansa's Airbus. Silajdzic did not refuse to talk to me. Our conversation was a kind of an unauthorized interview over the Atlantic at three o'clock in the morning, CET. I first asked him what he thought about the agreement. He answered, "I think it is a victory of the natural over the unnatural. The conflict was unnecessary, planned, and imposed. The agreement is a victory of the civilized over the uncivilized. I also think it is a victory of each and every one of us over ourselves. Wounds are too deep and too fresh. It took a lot of energy to do this and it will take much energy to heal the wound." Europe and Reward for Genocide I asked Mr. Silajdzic, "Some think the agreement came about overnight; on the other hand, some say it was initiated a long time ago." He replied "Mr. Granic and myself, of course with the permission of both presidents, have been working on this for months. The agreement is a result of much effort. We must not let the agreement fail because of the interest of individuals who promote radical ideas (there are such people on both sides). First of all, we must not allow more conflicts, for we would then be accused by not only the civilized public, but also by our children and history. The conflict between the Croats and the Muslims has no other foundation but human stupidity, love of power, and greed." Mr. Silajdzic then wanted to state the following: "The United States is both on your side and our side, but I must reproach it for still tolerating the aggression and rewarding the genocide as a means of establishing peace." I thought it logical to ask about his views on the problem of the UNPA [UN Protected Area] zones in Croatia. He said, "Everything must be founded on the UN Charter and on the principles of the London conference, which say that territory cannot be taken by force. President Clinton confirmed that the United States would protect the integrity of all countries in this region, especially that of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. One cannot allow changing borders in the 20th century under the pretext that all members of one nation must live in one country. Serbian aggression is a prism through which we can see all sides of Europe. Europe has hitherto shown one of its darker sides. Fortunately, relations change. Both sides, Croatian and ours, must persist on the Washington agreement for it will significantly improve both our positions." "But what will happen to the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina? The West and Russia have opposite intentions," I asked. Silajdzic answered, "The Serbs will be offered the chance to join the agreement that is supported by the entire civilized world. I would not like to discuss details. I believe a great number of the Serbs want peace, but cannot say it. The problem lies in the fact that the West gives legitimacy to those who destroyed all principles of our civilization, and takes the legitimacy away from those whose rights were violated -- the very rights that are so often mentioned by the West. I am curious to know how many observers Western countries will send to Sarajevo for the Serbian assembly that will take place on 27 March. Continuing the process, we will consider the problem of the union with the Serb entity existing on predominantly Serb areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina." Satanization of Fundamentalism I asked Mr. Silajdzic if he was a Bosniak or a Muslim. He replied "I am a Bosniak who was not allowed to be called that, although we have existed for a thousand years. Unfortunately, due to various circumstances, it so happened that the bond between the name of the country and the nation broke, and we were named after our religion." During our conversation, we broached the question of Islamic fundamentalism. Interestingly enough -- this was not an interview in the usual sense, so I can tell you my impressions -- Mr. Silajdzic took a great interest in the subject. He answered, "Every belief and religion is fundamental by definition. This is a term which is supposed to degrade all aspects of cultural, religious, and social dynamism in Islamic countries in the past couple of decades. The term fundamentalism is used as an ideological alternative that, after the fall of socialism, is taken as a serious competition and opponent. And this is why it has negative connotations." I then asked, "But even if you were right, fundamentalism is very much talked and written about. You cannot disregard that." He said, "The satanization of fundamentalism, which is a result of a long process, definitely does not lead anywhere. This benefits those who do not have much to do with religion, but want to have power. That is the problem." Parting with Mr. Silajdzic, who was then, incidentally, "taken over" by a journalist of STERN who happened to be there, I remembered something I had heard when we were leaving Washington: That the radical change of U.S. views has not been made because of Islamic countries, nor because of Russian penetration onto the territory of former Yugoslavia, but because of domestic politics. If that is the case, then things are not as we thought they were. However, Croatia would not be a loser in that case either.
