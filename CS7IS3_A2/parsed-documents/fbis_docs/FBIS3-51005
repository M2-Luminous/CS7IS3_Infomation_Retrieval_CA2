The Armed Forces inspector general has reported that the helicopter crashed in Colombian territory after being hit by guerrillas. Minister Sanin, you arrived in the country a few hours ago; what information do you have about this incident? [Sanin] I arrived in the country last night from my vacation, but I have been in contact with the president for the past several days. The government is deeply concerned. The president has ordered an investigation from the Defense Ministry and Colombian Foreign Ministry. We are going to present to him the findings this afternoon. The Prosecutor General's Office has conducted a preliminary investigation, the results of which will be presented to the Foreign Ministry this afternoon. I will be going to Venezuela on 12 January to sign a prisoners repatriation treaty, and I will be speaking with President Ramon J. Velasquez, the president-elect, the defense minister, the foreign minister, and the Venezuelan attorney general to present to them the results of the Colombian investigations to improve integration and cooperation efforts to avoid a continuation of criminal activities outside the legal framework of the two countries. I repeat: We are deeply concerned, and this afternoon we will decide, jointly with the president, what to do about this matter. [Garzo] You have already spoken with President Gaviria. When this type of incident occurs, what measures are adopted at the Foreign Ministry level? What type of statement is issued? [Sanin] Investigations are ordered, consuls must prepare a report, and experts go to work on territorial sovereignty, prisons, or whatever matter happens to be the issue. We are then presented with a report from the consuls and experts assigned by the Foreign Ministry. We have to receive reports from both the Defense Ministry and Prosecutor General's Office to then present all the conclusions to the president, with whom we always decide what action must be taken. [Garzo] Can this be seen as a criminal act? [Sanin] This is a very grave action that could involve one or more criminal actions; this matter is also being investigated in Venezuela, according to what Venezuelan authorities have told me. We are on top of the situation and do not want to diminish the seriousness of the incident, because national sovereignty, citizens' lives, respect, personal injuries, and many other factors are involved, and all of this is being investigated in the two countries. [Garzo] Considering the problems that have emerged during recent months due to the guerrilla presence on the border with Venezuela, do you believe the Venezuelan Government really wants to resolve these problems? [Sanin] Yes. We have tried to hold a meeting between the defense, foreign minister, and justice ministers of both countries in recent days, but considering that Venezuela will have a new government on 3 February, we have agreed that the meeting, which will also include the government and interior ministers of Colombia and Venezuela, should take place once the new Venezuelan Government is installed on 3 February. [Garzo] That is, it is urgent that the defense ministers hold a meeting to clear up this situation and draft a common strategy to fight the guerrillas in that zone. [Sanin] Yes. Once there is a new government in Venezuela the government, interior, defense, Foreign Ministry, and justice ministers will hold a meeting to avoid, through cooperation and integration, criminal activities on either side of the border. [Garzo] I want to ask you about another matter before you leave. How is President Gaviria's candidacy for the OAS post progressing? [Sanin] The truth is that all Colombians must feel very proud that several chiefs of state have established contact with our president and asked him to allow them to present him as a candidate for the post of secretary general of the OAS, America's most important forum. The president is analyzing this. We should all recall the golden era Colombia enjoyed with former President Alberto Lleras Camargo in this organization. We are happy about this situation and waiting for President Gaviria's decision.
