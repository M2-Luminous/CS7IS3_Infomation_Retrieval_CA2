He Will Do"] [Text] In March 1990, six months before the Asian Games was due to open in Beijing, the Asian Games Village then under construction was taking shape. Deng Xiaoping, who had been following the village and the entire games project with keen interest, suggested a visit to the capital, stating also that he did not want the tour to be guided by municipal leaders because he was only a common person and an official-conducted tour would not be appropriate. An idea flashed through the mind of his secretary, who said: "Then let Zhang Baifa accompany you." At that Deng Xiaoping said crisply and without hesitation: "The captain? He will do." We need to know that in 1958 Zhang Baifa, together with others, had once briefed Deng Xiaoping on his work in the capacity of a national model laborer and captain of an elite worker contingent. On that occasion Deng stressed to them the necessity of being versatile workers. The "captain" in Deng's mind was naturally a memory from that occasion. However, although Zhang Baifa has risen through the hierarchy to his current position, he still retains the "demeanor of an ordinary citizen," which was probably why Deng Xiaoping remarked that "he will do." Deng Xiaoping was also very much interested in Beijing's architecture; and through his appreciation and concern for the municipality's buildings, he came to understand Zhang Baifa better. In 1979, Deng Xiaoping told Zhang Baifa and other people on a tour of residential buildings on the Qianmen thoroughfare: "The ceiling of each storey need not be too high. This is not because I am short; if I am going to spend the same amount of money, I would rather make the room bigger than increase its headroom. There should also be a shower and other installations for daily use." Deng Xiaoping made another "foray" on 31 October 1993 to take a look at the municipality. "Captain" Zhang Baifa again acted as an escort. The ordinary-looking minibus Deng Xiaoping and his entourage traveled in crisscrossed Beijing's heavy traffic. In the car were also his family and personal guards. Along the way Zhang Baifa explained to Deng Xiaoping the capital's latest buildings and talked with him on the level of moderate prosperity people enjoyed. During last year's autumn excursion to the capital, Deng said that he intended to invite the "captain" to accompany him on another tour of the capital's latest modern shopping malls in 1994. Zhang Baifa is prepared for that.
