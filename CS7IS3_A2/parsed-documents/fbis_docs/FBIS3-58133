This was made clear in Bonn today by Environment Ministers Klaus Toepfer and Thorbjoern Berntsen. Toepfer drew attention to a statement by Moscow that Russia will have to continue sea-dumping liquid waste from nuclear plants until 1995 if Western help with disposal is not provided. By 1995, activities of a Russian processing plant near the Barents Sea pose a particular threat, Berntsen said. According to the ministers, both countries are prepared to help Russia within the scope of the G24 countries' aid program. However, Toepfer says the precondition for this is for the Russian side to undertake a binding program on disposal measures. He implied that concrete assistance has so far failed because of this. Russia intends to submit a technical program for nuclear waste disposal, including costs, by 1 February. As concluded by two Norwegian-Russian expeditions, which assessed risks in the North Sea and included a German scientist, Toepfer said another reconnaissance trip by a German ship should take place this year. It is of vital importance "that we make progress here." Areas posing a particular threat are the reactors from spent nuclear submarines dumped in the North Sea by the former Soviet Union. Other topics covered at the start of the two-day visit to Germany by his Norwegian counterpart were Oslo's negotiations for European Union [EU] membership, the disputed issue of whaling, and the support signalled by Toepfer for Berntsen's candidacy for chairmanship of the UN Commission for Sustainable Development, which will be decided in May. Norway's membership in the EU membership -- which is the second attempt to join after the people voted against such a move in 1972 -- is viewed by Toepfer as important, not least for environmental reasons: "Norway has high standards in the environmental sphere." This could encourage other EU countries, Toepfer said. Whereas Toepfer assumes that Norway will be an EU member from 1 January 1995, Berntsen did not wish to rule out entirely the possibility that his fellow countrymen might once again vote against this in a referendum. His government would regret this, he said. [passage omitted]
