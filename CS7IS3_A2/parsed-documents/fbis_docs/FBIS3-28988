It must solve the conflict in a comprehensive manner rather than merely rescuing Sarajevo, which is only part of the conflict. Speaking to reporters in Kuala Lumpur today, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the United Nations must find a fair, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the conflict. It must also lift the arms embargo against Bosnia to enable Bosnian people to defend themselves. The minister was commenting on an upcoming UN Security Council meeting on Bosnia, scheduled for this week. He described the NATO threat to launch air strikes against Serbian positions as a positive step. Sarajevo is not the only target of continued bombardments by Serbian terrorists; other cities are also under similar attack. Bosnia-Herzegovina is no longer a minor case for Europe, but an international issue involving human rights, democracy, and the right to exist as a sovereign state.
