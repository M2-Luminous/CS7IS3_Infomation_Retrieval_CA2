A North Atlantic Treaty Organisation spokesman said here that NATO and UN forces were conducting a "robust reconnaissance" in the exclusion zone around Gorazde to check for any remaining Bosnian Serb heavy weapons there. "If any (heavy weapons) are discovered, they must be removed immediately or they will be subject to air strikes," he warned. Earlier, NATO announced that the Bosnian Serbs had generally complied with NATO's ultimatum that they withdraw all their heavy weapons from a 20-kilometre (12.5 mile) radius around Gorazde by 0001 GMT Wednesday. The chairman of NATO's military committee, British Field-Marshall Sir Richard Vincent, said: "There are no major incidents to report." He told a press conference at NATO headquarters here: "The freedom of movement for UN personnel (into Gorazde) has for the most part been restored." But, speaking after a meeting of NATO's military committee, Vincent reiterated the alliance's determination to bomb the Bosnian Serbs if they attacked Gorazde or any other UN-declared "safe areas" in Bosnia-Herzegovina. A parallel meeting of the North Atlantic Council comprising ambassadors from NATO's 16 members called on all sides to avoid all "provocative actions" and warned the Bosnian Serbs against any hostile actions directed at UN personnel. But Vincent acknowledged that NATO had no authority to stop the Bosnian Serbs using the weapons withdrawn from Gorazde in attacks on other Bosnian Moslem positions not defined as "safe areas". Military strategists have warned that the Bosnian Serbs could turn their artillery next on Moslem and Croat positions near the narrow "Brcko corridor" in northern Bosnia linking Serbia with its conquests in western Bosnia. Vincent acknowledged the danger of such a redeployment. "We need to keep track of it and we shall do so," he said. But the field-marshal added: "It is not NATO's business to take international law unto itself and go stamping around in other people's territory." NATO could do nothing outside the "safe areas" to oppose Bosnian Serb assaults unless the UN Security Council expanded its air strike mandate, Vincent said. The alliance said earlier that its air strike threats aimed at underpinning current efforts by the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations to bring the combatants in Bosnia back to the negotiation table. "The (North Atlantic) Council welcomed in particular the constructive engagement of Russia in the search for a negotiated settlement," the spokesman said.
