This was a matter of fundamental importance to the promotion of educational development in the motherland, as well as the modernization of society as a whole. In November of the same year, the state again promulgated the PRC Teachers' Law, which officially came into effect as of 1 January this year. This shows that the development of the teaching contingent in our country has been brought onto the tract of legalization and standardization. Conscientiously implementing this Program and this Law has a direct bearing on the training of qualified personnel, and is an important matter of strategic importance for construction in our large special economic zone [SEZ]. This is also a heavy task of the CPC Committees and governments at all levels which are striving to attain their short-term target. Since the promulgation of the Program and the Law, governments and educational departments at all levels in our province have done a lot of work to enforce them. Investment in education has been increased by a bigger margin. In 1993, educational spending covered by our province's budget was 26.8 percent higher than in 1992. Investment in education accounted for 17.7 percent in our financial expenditure, and 3.3 percent in the GDP of our province. This was higher than the average level of the whole country. In 1993, multichannel spending on school buildings for secondary and primary schools throughout the province reached 333.9 million yuan. Special allocation for secondary vocational education reached 39.34 million yuan. All these investments were the highest in Hainan over the years. We have adjusted our educational plans to accelerate the pace of popularizing our nine-year compulsory education. It has been decided that the nine-year compulsory education should be basically popularized throughout the province by 1997, with the exception of some difficult areas inhabited by minority nationalities. We plan to basically wipe out illiteracy among teenagers and youths, and to promote various kinds of educational reforms. New dimensions are being opened up to simultaneously develop various kinds of schools, including schools run by the government, schools run by local people, schools run jointly by the government and local people, and schools based on investment from abroad and lateral links at home, and others. The situation of using varied ways to develop education has been initially created. There have been more units selected to carry out experiments in the reform of schools' internal management system. Conscientious efforts are being made to do practical and beneficial work for teachers. Various cities and counties have done a lot of work with regard to the problems facing teachers, including houses, salaries, medical service, and jobs for their children. They also have done a lot to make teachers in people-run schools become regular teachers, and to improve welfare for teachers in people-run schools, and for substitute teachers as well. However, we also should realize that there still are many problems and difficulties facing our province's education, and we must pay sufficient attention to them. For instance, the fact that our educational system does not conform with our economic structural reform gradually has manifested itself. Training of qualified personnel has lagged far behind the demands of the rapid development in our large SEZ. Our teaching contingent has not become stable enough. To truly solve these problems, on the previous basis of implementing the Program and the Law, we should further sum up our experiences, take more measures, and do a solid job for the implementation of the Program and the Law. With the further establishment and operation of the economic system in our SEZ's market, we urgently need a large number of professionals who have a fine ideological and moral character, have profound professional knowledge, and are good at making policy decisions, doing management work, and [words indistinct] in accordance with market economic law in the interest of the adjustment of our economic and industrial structure. In the meantime, we also urgently need to train a large quantity of middle-ranking and junior skilled technicians, and laborers working in the forefront to thoroughly optimize our investment environment. Governments at all levels throughout the province must have far-sighted views, and must treat the training of qualified personnel as a fundamental project for developing our socialist market economy. We should follow a down-to-earth manner in order to solve some difficulties and problems, and should do some solid work in the interest of education. We should make persistent efforts to grasp well the work of implementing the Program and the Law. The emphasis in implementing the program and the law is laid on basically popularizing our nine-year compulsory education, and wiping out illiteracy among teenagers and youths in the 1990's. Educational departments must do a conscientious job in making budgets and formulating plans involving teachers' salaries, school funds, school buildings, equipment, and facilities. In addition, city and county governments must grasp well the work of implementing relevant plans for developing basic education, and compulsory education in particular. They also must do well the work of ensuring teachers' salaries, and carrying out assessment and examination of educational development. All townships, towns, and villages must be truly responsible for improving local conditions for running schools to ensure that school-aged children and teenagers can start school on schedule, and that the majority of these children will not discontinue their schooling. It is necessary to protect, according to law, the legitimate rights and interests of schools, teachers, and students. It is necessary to speed up and deepen internal management reform in various schools to ensure the establishment of their vigorous and dynamic operational mechanisms. Course content must be based on practice. Schools should be run by various different institutions or individuals. It is necessary to follow different patterns and forms for running schools. It is necessary to deepen the reforms involving the recruitment of new students for universities and colleges, secondary vocational schools, tuition fees, and job assignments for graduates. The responsibilities of the state and of society with regard to education must be linked. It is necessary for us to actively support work-study programs and school-run industries so as to increase income in the interest of the development of education. It is necessary for us to continue to implement the guideline of relying on the people to run education. It is necessary for us to continue the practice of raising funds to run schools on a voluntary basis, and not overrating one's ability. It is necessary to encourage people to donate money to support schools. We must make efforts to enhance the ideological, political, and professional quality of our teaching contingent. We must energetically encourage the practice of respecting teachers and attaching importance to education so as to protect teachers' rights and interests, and to improve their pay and conditions. The key to implementing the Program and the Law lies in taking a matter-of-fact attitude. CPC Committees and governments at all levels throughout the province must proceed from their own local conditions to do some excellent work to make achievements in developing education.
