Consequently Denmark will gradually cease aid. So said Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical Liberal Party) yesterday after a meeting with Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri in Bangkok. This means that Thailand will become the first developing country ever to cease to qualify for Danish aid because its economy is too well developed. "But I have stressed that the country can receive other forms of aid. For example, soft loans and credits for noncommercial purposes," Helveg Petersen said. Thailand will also be able to take $25 million from Denmark's environment and catastrophe fund as compensation for the loss of aid. [passage omitted] During the talks the foreign minister also touched on Thailand's relations with neighboring Burma. "I stressed that every opportunity must be taken to put pressure on the Burmese Government, and that I believe that Thailand must continue to grant residence permits to Burmese refugees," the foreign minister said.
