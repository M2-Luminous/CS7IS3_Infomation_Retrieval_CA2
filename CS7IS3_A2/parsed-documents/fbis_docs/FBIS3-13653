[Mubarak] Despite what has recently happened and despite the difficulties attending the negotiations, which is natural, we consider the peace process a basic issue for all Palestinians and the whole region. I believe that the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque is a terrible tragedy. We were all deeply hurt by it. The person who committed this crime was an extremist and we all know how every extremist behaves. I expect the peace process to continue; in fact, I am confident it will. I also know very well that the Palestinian and Israeli leaders need peace, and extremists in any part of this world do not want peace because they thrive in an atmosphere of extremism. However, the peace process must progress. [Karam] What happens after peace? [Mubarak] There has to be effective cooperation in the interests of the people. The French and the Germans were arch-enemies but common interests imposed cooperation upon them. The issue is not one of friendship, fraternity, and love; that is another issue among the countries of the region. There are mutual and shared interests and we all need to cooperate on them. [Karam] What do you think about the growth of fundamentalism in the region? [Mubarak] Fundamentalism in the region requires the attention of the leaders. It also requires firmness. Fundamentalism has existed for some time. It was never given the attention it merits. This was the case in Algeria, and today Algeria is suffering from this problem. The same applies to Tunisia as well, but the Tunisian leadership under Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has succeeded in muzzling and containing the growth of fundamentalism. This phenomenon also emerged in Egypt, but they are not Muslims in the real sense of the word. They are all a batch of dangerous mercenary criminals manipulated from abroad. They are paid by some people who want to create unrest in Egypt and in the region. These sides are spending large amounts of money to implement their schemes. The Hebron operation is extremism par excellence. Extremism exists not only in our region but in the United States, England, and Australia. I do not wish to mention other countries. [Karam] You mentioned that it should be paid due and careful attention. Does this mean that some leaderships have neglected this problem? [Mubarak] I cannot call it negligence, but the leaders need to realize that some nongovernmental bodies with huge funds at their disposal are carrying out suspicious acts. We need to know how these funds are spent. In the end, extremism will bite the hand that feeds it. Can you believe that the nongovernmental societies that solicit contributions spend these contributions only on building mosques? Bear in mind that these societies use mosques as a pretext to plant extremism in the countries where they build the mosques. They form hotbeds and cells in the various regions. When these hotbeds get stronger, they make their move. [Karam] Don't you think that the lack of remedies for economic problems and poor living conditions are the cause of these movements' growth? [Mubarak] They might be a secondary factor, but not the basic factor. Economic crises and unemployment existed in the past and economic problems have always existed worldwide. Why have these movements appeared only now? I remember we had the problem of a continually rising cost of living during my student days. It is not possible for a government employee to own a villa and a car and live in total comfort on his salary. A government employee's salary is small because it comes from the state's revenue, from taxes and customs duties. [Karam] What is Egypt's attitude toward the new world order? [Mubarak] What order? You should ask what Egypt's attitude is toward the new chaotic system. It is a chaotic system; today's world is chaotic. Is what is happening in Russia a new world order? Is what is happening in the eastern bloc a new world order? Is what is happening in Iran and Afghanistan a new world order? Is what is happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina a new world order? Do the conspiracies we see today indicate a new world order? The term is wrong; I call it the new chaotic system. Today's system is not permanent; it is transitional, and the final shape of the world order is not clear yet. China is still growing stronger, Japan's trade is prospering. There is a conflict between the United States and Japan. Indonesia is still making progress in development. Russia is still living in the shadow of nuclear and nonnuclear conflicts. The process is far from clear and will need a long time to settle down. We must not feel optimistic about the appearance of a new world order in view of the chaos in which we are living today. The international order will come only after the chaotic system ends. [Karam] Your Excellency, as OAU chairman, could you please speak to us about Africa's aspirations? [Mubarak] Development is scant in Africa. The continent is still suffering endless problems and will need great efforts and many years to overcome them. We are trying hard, something we began to do at the last summit, to end the current conflicts and disputes, which are mostly border disputes. Had they abided by the OAU summit's resolution of the 1960's... [sentence unfinished as published] May 'Abd-al-Nasir rest in peace. He used to say all African countries must accept the borders drawn by the colonialists and that they must not be at each other's mercy. Problems persist in Liberia, Nigeria, Somalia, and Sudan. [Karam] What does the South want form the North? [Mubarak] Dialogue. We do not want the North to buy raw materials from the South at cheap prices and sell commodities at exorbitant prices that the South cannot afford to buy. This is only one of several examples. A dialogue must be held between the South and North. It is unreasonable for the North to live in luxury while the South can hardly subsist. [Karam] Egypt is a member of the Group of 15. Is this a nucleus for the South to reach a unified stance? [Mubarak] That is possible, because all members of the Group of 15 are from the South. [Karam] What about reconciliation in Somalia? [Mubarak] There are numerous problems there. The African summit sought to set up a committee to settle the Somali problems. There are problems impeding our work. We hosted a meeting of certain rival Somali factions, but not Farah Aidid, who did not wish to come. As chairman of the OAU, I speak fairly and neutrally and I do not take sides with any party. I do not support Mahdi against Aidid or vice versa. We are working to achieve Somali unity. The rival factions must agree among themselves so that their people can lead a stable life. If the leaders fail to agree, the people will not be able to lead normal lives. Our goal is to work out a way for the rival factions to reach an agreement and form a government that can take care of the people's interests. [Karam] What about Sudan and Hala'ib? [Mubarak] What about Hala'ib? They raised this issue during President al-Sadat's as well as 'Abd-al-Nasir's eras. Now they are raising the issue with me. They want to fabricate a case against us. Al-Turabi wants to trump up a problem. They are free to do what they want, but we have no problems. [Karam] What about the Nonaligned Movement and the Group of 77? [Mubarak] They are all aligned. Small countries need big ones to help them in their development plans. That is what brother Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi said. He is right; all the members are aligned. These days alignment concerns to whom and against whom. The Nonaligned Movement has lost its reasons for existing. [Karam] Will the Hebron Mosque massacre recur? [Mubarak] I pray to God it will not recur against anyone -- be they Muslims, Christians, or Jews. [Karam] And the Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre in al-Zuq? [Mubarak] That was also a painful massacre for all of us. People are getting mad. What have innocent people done? Why has the criminal entered the mosque to kill people? Why have they entered the church to kill people? Worshipers went to holy places to pray to their God, but had a date with death instead. Is this acceptable? If a Muslim makes a mistake, then let us deal with him personally. If a Christian makes a mistake, then let us deal with and punish him personally. If a Jew makes a mistake, let us deal with him personally and not butcher people at random. [Karam] Since we mentioned Lebanon, what about Resolution 425 and peace, especially as Egypt has responded to the Arab League resolution in Damascus to help Lebanon in its dealings with the Arab countries. What is the extent of this help? [Mubarak] We are committed to this aid and the time will come to send it to Lebanon. Regarding the issue of peace, we have been working for peace in Lebanon in all international circles even before the peace process began. When Shim'on Peres was prime minister, I spoke with him about the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. He was convinced and drew up the withdrawal plan. He told me: If you guarantee that not a single Katyusha will be fired at northern Israel, then I will withdraw immediately. Peres also told me: I do not want to stay in Lebanon. An Israeli withdrawal must be provided for in the peace process. [Karam] Is the peace process serious and imminent? [Mubarak] Of course, but it requires some time. Let us not forget that this issue is 45 years old and we should not expect it to be resolved immediately. Of course there are obstacles, but peace is coming. The Palestinian issue is the crux. [Karam] Is the Israeli Government in danger and will extremism triumph in Israel? [Mubarak] I do not believe that extremism will win in Israel. Either Israeli or Palestinian extremism might delay the peace process, but they will not sabotage it because peace is the just demand of the peoples, who want to live. [Karam] What is the fate of the negotiations with Israel? [Mubarak] They are part of the peace process. Israel and the Palestinians are supposed to meet in the United States in order to act on what they decided on in Cairo. They almost ended all the differences. The agreement that they reach in the United States will later be signed in Cairo. [Karam] Will Lebanon and Syria reach a solution with Israel on its withdrawal from the Golan and the south? [Mubarak] I am confident that these two issues will be solved. [Karam] What about Iraq's status; and how are the current ties between Egypt and Iraq? [Mubarak] We feel sorry for the Iraqi people. We are against the partitioning of Iraq. Our stand on this issue is firm and clear-cut. We support the Iraqi people, who cannot eke out their livelihood. What pains us is that the Iraqi people are an Arab Muslim people. Had Saddam Husayn heeded my words and honest advice, nothing would have happened. His position could have grown even stronger and that Iraq's strength could have been an additional force in support of the Arab force. [Karam] What about Egypt's relations with Saudi Arabia? [Mubarak] Our relations with Saudi Arabia and all the other Gulf states are good and fraternal. [Karam] And what about your relations with Iran? [Mubarak] We have no relations with Iran. We were about to exchange ambassadors a year ago. But obviously they differed among themselves. Velayati said he would open an embassy office. I told him: No thank you; we do not need embassy offices. [Karam] What about your relations with Lebanon and Syria? [Mubarak] They are integrated, fraternal relations. [Karam] What do you think of the situation in Algeria, and what about the Lockerbie issue? [Mubarak] I hope that our brothers in Algeria, led by President Zeroual, will end the rancorous extremism that is bound to nullify all the people's potentials. All sides, if they wish to preserve their country, must sit together with the president and talk about solutions that will end the problems. As for the Lockerbie issue, we made strenuous efforts, but the world is currently preoccupied with the security of Bosnia and Somalia. I hope we will find a solution that will enable Libya to end the issue, because handing over citizens is difficult and sensitive. [Karam] Has communism ended? And what about Egypt's relations with Russia today? [Mubarak] Egypt's relations with Russia are very good. It's my policy to establish good relations with all countries. I do not want to be anyone's enemy. Only Iran is hostile to Egypt. We are not hostile to Iran. We did not even sever ties with Sudan, which cooperates with Iran. There are 4 million Sudanese citizens in Egypt, maybe more. President al-Bashir once told me that there are only 120,000 Sudanese in Egypt. I told him: I can send them to you so that you can count them. As for communism, we cannot say that it has ended. It is developing so as to be in line with the new world order, or the new chaotic order. [Karam] Has tourism suffered a setback in Egypt? Have the fundamentalists' acts of violence frightened tourists away? [Mubarak] Yes. The number of tourists visiting Egypt has decreased. The fundamentalists -- whom I call terrorists -- have nothing to do with religion. None of them memorizes a single Koranic verse. Egypt's civilization goes back 7,000 years, so Egypt will not be crippled by a group of terrorists. Egypt is not just Husni Mubarak: There are a million Mubaraks and leaders in Egypt. The terrorists will have no impact on this state, which believes in its democratic course. [Karam] Has the Egyptian economy suffered a recession as a result? [Mubarak] Recession is affecting all countries of the world and not Egypt alone. There is recession in Europe, the United States, and all other countries. [Karam] Those who like you say that President Mubarak is inimitably easy going, that is, his cards are on the table. Despite this, he plays his cards well, puzzling other players. President Mubarak's approach is that he does not despair if there is little hope. He does not show his emotions and always maintains his poise. How have you managed to combine all these qualities? [Mubarak] This is my way of life, since I started work, when I was a pilot. I have always been patient, thought ahead, and planned for the future. I do not look just at what is under my nose but ahead. I not only work for tomorrow but for what comes after tomorrow. If I merely wanted to work for tomorrow, people would stand in line and applaud me, but when I am gone there would be a collapse. I think of the future generations. I do not want to be egoistic, but I want those who come after me to live. I do not just seek my own good. Had the infrastructure been taken care of before, I would not have had to spend 100 billion pounds on rebuilding it. We would have a more prosperous life, but this is our fate. After we finished with war, we began to work to enable our people to live. We built the infrastructure and then the new cities, factories, agricultural projects, and production sites for the Egyptian people. [Karam] What are you doing to resolve the problem of the 1.25 million people born in Egypt every year? [Mubarak] That number is currently decreasing and we are trying to create many jobs for Egypt's sons. [Karam] Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat has repeatedly described Egypt as a full partner of the Palestinians. How does Egypt view its role within this framework? [Mubarak] The Palestinian issue is our own; we have adopted it. We were attacked several times for adopting this stance. We still defend the Palestinian issue; we cannot go back on our support for the Palestinians. [Karam] You played a personal and effective role in concluding the Cairo agreement at a time when the talks had almost failed. Did the problem lie in the Palestinians' refusal to abandon the Oslo agreement or in their bypassing of that agreement? [Mubarak] We tried to help the Palestinians when they reached a dead end and asked for our help. We spoke with the Israelis and solved the obstacle to the talks. [Karam] Some moderate Palestinian parties saw in the Cairo agreement an unwarranted concession on their part. What is the Egyptian view of this? [Mubarak] You have to get a foothold and then ask for more. Public opinion must know that coexistence will happen. [Karam] There is a prevailing belief that the Cairo agreement was lax on the issue of the existence of the settlements and the settlers' freedom of movement during the transitional stage, as this would strengthen their presence even in the final stage. This entails the building of roads and bridges that will cost too much and are unjustifiable. If the transitional period is to last just three years, why build bridges and roads? [Mubarak] We have nothing to do with the details; they are the affairs of the two sides. As to the first part of the question, I say that you cannot demand the removal of the settlements on the first day of your entry. First you have first to enter and settle down. The contacts will lead to a solution of the settlement issue and both sides will reject this issue. [sentence as published] Had they accepted the principles of the Camp David agreement, they would have found that there were only four settlements in 1978, and these were very small. Today there are 180 settlements and they are all very large. The settlement issue is not an easy one, but very difficult. We were late in agreeing to start of the peace negotiations. [Karam] What are the effects of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre on the Cairo agreement? Some people are saying that this agreement is finished now that the failure of the Israeli protection for it has been shown? [Mubarak] The Cairo agreement was an affirmation of some principles of the Oslo agreement. We negotiated here to resolve the details of the issues and were almost finished. I expect the negotiations to resume soon, once things calm down, and that the parties will sign the agreement. I do not pay attention to statements and rumors that come from here or there. The one making a statement might want to sow unrest between the Palestinians and Israelis so that they will become more intransigent. But we are fully conscious of this. I tell the Palestinians: Get a foothold first, and then make further demands. Today the Palestinians are talking while they are outside their territories. When I am on the outside, my words are weaker than when I am speaking on the inside. [Karam] Are you happy with the Palestinian coordination with the Arab sides directly concerned with the peace negotiations? Egypt, and you personally, played a major role in bringing the PLO closer to Syria and Jordan. [Mubarak] There must be cooperation and coordination. I have a mission to carry out, namely: unity. [Karam] If the al-Ibrahmi Mosque massacre is not enough -- as seems to be the case judging by Israeli statements -- to gain vital concessions during the negotiations, do the Palestinians still have a chance to make better gains and to overcome the breaches in the Oslo and Cairo agreements, and how? [Mubarak] I hope that some of the existing problems will be solved. The two sides are discussing the details of the agreement; there is no real problem. We have made a big stride. [Karam] Why is no Arab summit being held to deal with the Arab situation, and what are the real obstacles impeding the convening of such a summit? [Mubarak] We do not do not have an Arab summit absolutely every year. Arab divisions after the invasion and occupation of Kuwait caused a split in the Arab world. At the same time, we see that Abu-'Ammar has visited Saudi Arabia to perform the minor pilgrimage. I expect that King Husayn will make a similar visit. I have talked with brother King Fahd concerning Abu-'Ammar and King Husayn. But when I talk with King Fahd, some people think that I am trying to turn him against them. This is absolutely untrue. I contact Arab brothers and the outside world to serve the Arab nation. I also managed to bring the views of Presidents Clinton and al-Asad closer. [Karam] The Arab delegations have suspended their participation in the peace talks in protest of the al-Ibrahimi massacre. And now that Egypt has asked the UN Security Council to form an committee to investigate the massacre, what, in your opinion, should be done to resume the negotiations and to end the stalemate engulfing them in order to reach a real, all-embracing, just, and comprehensive peace? And are we still likely to see the real beginning of peace in 1994? [Mubarak] I am confident that this year will see the real beginning of peace. The delay in the peace negotiations is regrettable. The Arab countries did not ask for a suspension of the negotiations. Rather they asked for a postponement of the negotiations in consideration of Palestinian feelings. Everyone demands peace. We cannot give up on peace because of the massacre, for this would mean the triumph of brute force. We condemn this massacre and we demand that measures be adopted to prevent any similar massacres. But it is inadmissible to stop the peace process because of this massacre. [Karam] Do you see any links between the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron and the Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre in Lebanon? [Mubarak] I do not have enough information about these two massacres, but both are tragedies. [Karam] What do you believe is the ideal solution for the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina and for ending the Muslims' tragedy there? What role must the United Nations and the big Western powers play to deal with this crisis? Will the intervention of NATO speed up the solution, and in whose favor? [Mubarak] All I can say here is that the isolation of the Muslims in a state on their own is wrong and dangerous. The Muslims and Christians must coexist within the framework of their state. [Karam] It is known that you are a great media man. What role do you feel the Arab media should play at this extremely crucial and sensitive stage in the life of the Arab nation? [Mubarak] I ask the Arab media at this point in time to be realistic and accurate in their reports, because communications in the world are now very fast. The Arab media should do this to avoid harming the Arab nation. Let us be realistic, moderate, logical, and intelligent in our media, whether in presenting our causes or discussing problems. [Karam] Do you believe the Arab world will emerge from the narrow definitions that have been set for it -- namely, that it belongs to the Third World? [Mubarak] If the Arab countries could cooperate with each other on firm and strong bases, and if we could do away with the spirit of scheming and aggression against each other and give up ideas of intervening in each other's affairs, we could become a strong, gigantic entity.
