Yesterday Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, when asked about the legitimacy of his trips to Moscow and the agreements he concluded with the Russian authorities, said that he "does not have to report to the Ukrainian president." Ukraine's parliamentarians and president themselves have long been aware of the unfeasibility of the 24 February resolution. Currently, however, Kiev fears that not only Simferopol, but also eastern Ukrainian regions may demand autonomy, which would be much more dangerous. Sergey Kunitsyn, Ukrainian deputy and chairman of the Union of Support for the Republic of Crimea, said on the evening of 28 February that the Crimean Supreme Soviet would not adhere to the parliamentary decree on the status of Crimea. In his view, "There is no mechanism to enforce the decree" and there are virtually no Ukrainian state structures on Crimean territory except for the army. The most important thing, Sergey Kunitsyn said, is not to give Ukraine a pretext for "rash actions." President Leonid Kravchuk, for his part, is trying to frighten Simferopol with precisely this turn of events. He expressed his confidence that Crimea would not embark on the path of confrontation, "otherwise this will cause harm." He recalled that Crimea is an integral, albeit autonomous, part of Ukraine, hence any actions aimed at noncompliance with this provision will be illegal. Kravchuk attempted to sweeten the pill, however, as he said that "the regions should have greater autonomy, particularly with regard to the economy and culture." Leonid Grach, leader of the Crimean Communist Party, which is growing stronger by the day, believes that the resolution on Crimea expresses "the ambitions of lame-ducks," but the problem concerning the parliamentary decision may be resolved by holding elections for all branches of power. He expressed his hope that Kravchuk will be prudent enough not to enforce the provision on appointing a representative of the Ukrainian president in Crimea so as not to heighten tensions. In the view of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts, tensions over Ukrainian integrity may heighten not only inside the Moscow-Kiev-Simferopol triangle. Even at present the centrifugal forces in eastern Ukraine with its predominantly Russian-speaking population are giving Kiev a headache. By passing strict but effectively unenforceable resolutions on Crimea, politicians in Kiev bear Donbass in mind, too. This consideration will inevitably prod them to demonstrate toughness regarding the "separatists." Harsh statements and resolutions, however, tend to wear out with excessive use.
