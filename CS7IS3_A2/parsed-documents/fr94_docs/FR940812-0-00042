The authority citation for subpart B of part 416 is revised to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 1102, 1110(b), 1602, 1611, 1614, 1615(c), 1619(a), 1631, and 1634 of the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 1302, 1310(b), 1381a, 1382, 1382c, 1382d(c), 1382h(a), 1383, and 1383c; secs. 211 and 212 of Pub.

The undesignated center heading immediately above §416.260 is revised to read as follows: Special Provisions for People Who Work Despite a Disabling Impairment 3. Section 416.260 is revised to read as follows: §416.260 General. The regulations in §§416.260 through 416.269 describe the rules for determining eligibility for special SSI cash benefits and for special SSI eligibility status for an individual who works despite a disabling impairment. Under these rules an individual who works despite a disabling impairment may qualify for special SSI cash benefits and in most cases for Medicaid benefits when his or her gross earned income exceeds the applicable dollar amount which ordinarily represents SGA described in §416.974(b)(2). The calculation of this gross earned income amount, however, is not to be considered an actual SGA determination. Also, for purposes of determining eligibility or continuing eligibility for Medicaid benefits, a blind or disabled individual (no longer eligible for regular SSI benefits or for special SSI cash benefits) who, except for earnings, would otherwise be eligible for SSI cash benefits may be eligible for a special SSI eligibility status under which he or she is considered to be a blind or disabled individual receiving SSI benefits. We explain the rules for eligibility for special SSI cash benefits in §§416.261 and 416.262. We explain the rules for the special SSI eligibility status in §§416.264 through 416.269. 4. The undesignated center heading immediately above §416.261 is removed. 5. Section 416.261 is amended by revising the first sentence to read as follows: §416.261 What are special SSI cash benefits and when are they payable. Special SSI cash benefits are benefits that we may pay you in lieu of regular SSI benefits because your gross earned income in a month of initial eligibility for regular SSI benefits exceeds the amount ordinarily considered to represent SGA under §416.974(b)(2). *␣*␣* 6. Section 416.262 is amended by revising the introductory text and paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) to read as follows: §416.262 Eligibility requirements for special SSI cash benefits.
