Foreign companies, particularly foreign air transportation companies, are allowed to purchase shares of Chinese air transportation companies, or to exchange shares with them to establish air transportation enterprises. At the beginning, one or two foreign air transportation companies will be selected by the CAAC and other concerned departments to invest in establishing air transportation enterprises in China on a trial basis. More foreign companies will be allowed to do so if the trial operations are successful. Foreign companies' shares must not be more than 35 percent of co-invested air transportation enterprises' registered or paid-up capital, and their voting rights at the co-invested companies' boards of directors must not be more than 25 percent.

The percentage of foreign investment shall be decided by the Chinese and foreign investors. Approval should be gained from the CAAC for the establishment of civil aviation enterprises with foreign investment.
