His idea of setting up a Eurasian union -- which has left a big fat question mark over the entire concept of the CIS -- was at the center of attention of the heads of state. But...behind the scenes and at the press conference. Dodging a direct answer to my question, B. Yeltsin said: "Given that Nursultan Abishevich was unwell, we were unable to obtain full information from him and, therefore, we did not officially discuss it." E. Shevardnadze believes that the idea is interesting and thought should be given to how to implement it. V. Chernomyrdin said that it would be good to know what the Nazarbayev proposals consist of. The idea of reintegration was enthusiastically received by the leaders of Belorussia [Belarus] and Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]. Conversely, there was a clearly negative attitude from the Turkmen and Uzbek presidents. S. Niyazov, for instance, agrees only to consultative Commonwealth status and rules out any supranational superstructure. I. Karimov called Nazarbayev's scheme incorrect and populist. Reflecting the official view, KHALQ SOZI, Uzbekistan's main newspaper, noted on the eve of the summit that, "politicians whose repertoire consists of songs about the indestructible Union are reminiscent of doctors who for some reason hold their meeting in a morgue." Admittedly, there is no need to bury the Union -- which lives in our hearts and minds. One cannot fail to notice in Nazarbayev's idea a basic thought which reflects the sad experience of recent years -- any attempts to organize economic ties within the CIS will be ineffective if the countries are not voluntarily strengthened by political bonds. Without having received a clear response to his idea, the Kazakhstani president did not come to Moscow (which was to be expected from his statements in Japan), clearly believing that further discussions on an unprincipled basis would be pointless. The course of the Moscow meeting confirmed Nazarbayev's skepticism. There were no sensations. The only more or less mature scheme to have emerged in two years of intra-CIS waffle -- the economic union -- was confirmed. But let's take a look at events through the eyes of the man in the street. Has life become any easier? Is there more food in the stores? Have prices fallen? Unfortunately, the confusion over the new formation (which does not exist in "reality") is profoundly abstract in nature. Now that the process has become at least slightly systematic the Interstate Economic Committee (IEC) has been set up. A Commonwealth flag has appeared -- a sun set among many hands on a blue background. The first step to unification may possibly be the creation of a free trade zone. Unless the agreement remains purely on paper, customs duties, taxes, and levies will gradually disappear. The Commonwealth countries will be seen as a single international economic unit [subyekt]. But there is little future for the approved concept for a payments union based on diverse national currencies. You will be told that by any Ukrainian peasant who sells his food cheaply at Moscow's Kiev Station, but for rubles! From now on Ukraine is an associate member of the economic union. Among the documents signed we would highlight the concept of safeguarding the rights of ethnic, linguistic, and religious minorities. The initiative was taken by Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] President Askar Akayev, who has sincerely and deeply felt the collapse of the great power and has been making a great deal of effort to protect ethnic Russians. Russia will not be found wanting if it is a question of a united security system, the settling of local conflicts within the CIS, or the rebuffing of foreign enemies. Colonel-General Valeriy Patrikeyev has been appointed the new commander of the collective peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan. Colonel-General Boris Pyankov, who has honorably done his duty, is returning to Moscow as deputy commander of the CIS Joint Armed Forces. Thus, the direction of progress has been chosen -- the recreation of the Union, first as an economic union and later as a Eurasian union. It will not be easy -- building is not as easy as destroying. Many people are convinced that the goal will be attained only by the next generation of politicians, who have not been besmirched by the shame of the Belovezhskaya Forest Agreement.
