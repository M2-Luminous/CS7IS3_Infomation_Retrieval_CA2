Obayashi, Japan's fourth-largest construction firm, passed on the money through timber company President Mitsuo Moriya, 65, a former deputy secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party's Miyagi prefectural chapter and a close acquaintance of Ishii, the sources said. Moriya paid the sum into a bank account he administered for Ishii, they said. The money allegedly came from Obayashi's branch office for Tohoku, northeastern Japan. According to the sources, Obayashi paid the money in a bid to have its status in the city's Kuzuoka waste incineration plant project upgraded from subcontractor to main contractor for all construction works. Plant maker Hitachi Zosen Corp. of Osaka was the main contractor for the project, a 29.2 billion yen incineration plant for ordinary waste and an 8.2 billion yen incinerator for bulk waste. The sources said Obayashi urged Ishii to commission the construction work for the bulk-waste incinerator separately from the orders placed with Hitachi Zosen, so that Obayashi could carry out the work under its company name and reap higher profits. In response, Ishii instructed the city administration to review the contracts, advocating the separation of construction and technological works for the plant, but the changes never materialized, the sources said. The incineration plant is scheduled to be completed by September 1995. A spokesman for Obayashi's Tokyo headquarters denied that the company paid bribes to the mayor or ever asked for separated orders. Usually orders for waste disposal facilities are placed with a plant maker as the main contractor, which commissions subcontractors to do the construction work. Ishii is on trial for allegedly taking a total of 130 million yen in bribes from six general contractors including Hazama Corp., Shimizu Corp., Taisei Co., and Nishimatsu Construction Co. Moriya has been indicted in a separate bribery case involving former Miyagi Gov. Shuntaro (?who has been charged) with taking a 20 million yen bribe from Taisei in late January.
