Bensalem: "FLN's All-Or-Nothing Position"] [Text] The reply of the FLN [National Liberation Front] political bureau to the letter of Mr. Youcef Khatib, adviser to the presidency, asking political parties and associations to declare before 16 April whether or not they will participate in the National Transition Council (CNT) was made public yesterday... No, says the FLN. In its letter, made available to EL WATAN yesterday, it declined the invitation to attend the 20 April meeting at the presidency that was called to allocate seats among those participating in the dialogue. The decision came at the end of Monday's meeting of the FLN political bureau. The FLN position hardly comes as a surprise, given the statements its secretary general has made to the press, recent political bureau communiques, and the latest statements from its central committee, which met on 13-14 January. According to the reply the political bureau sent to Mr. Khatib on Monday, the FLN--which had said often before it was not bound by the decisions of the national conference that it had boycotted--believes "the fundamental questions raised by the FLN and other parties in different forms have not been debated, nor have they been embraced as necessary elements for the reaching of an accord or the real basis of the national consensus..." The FLN political bureau--more specifically some of its influential members, who were alledged to have virtually offered the party to the highest bidder--has returned in its latest statement to the decisions of the last central committee meeting, in order to show it is not acting against the wishes of the party rank and file; it notes, for example, that the party has decided "not to endorse any de facto authority or tarnish the party's good name by lending a fictional legitimacy to such authority," and "not to solicit any positions of responsibility for its militants that lack a mandate of the people." It thus appears very likely the transition will go forward without the participation of Mr. Mehri's party, since the latter does not approve the presidency's handling of the transition period in accordance with the "national consensus platform." According to the political bureau, "prolonging the transition period for three more years to pursue the same policy followed since the interruption of the democratic process, designing structures to implement it, and continuing to ignore the people's will...does not contribute to political pacification or resolve the serious, complex crisis consuming our whole society." The political bureau added nothing to what it has said before about what is needed to resolve the crisis. The only thing missing from the bureau's letter was the party's previous appeal for "an in-depth and broad dialogue." A constant theme in the FLN's earlier statements, it was omitted, curiously enough, from the bureau's letter to Mr. Khatib. In fact, no mention is made of participation by the now-dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] in such a dialogue, despite the fact the FLN has always claimed such participation was a vital necessity in any search for a solution to the crisis. It may be stretching a point to speak of a "change" in the FLN position on the issue, but the question is worth flagging. The expected defection of the FLN, followed probably by other parties that hold similar views about the dialogue, places the presidency in an awkward position as it proceeds to set up the transition structures, beginning with the National Transition Council at the end of this month. A close analysis of the statements of the various political parties--some of which admittedly are resorting to hyperbole in an effort to increase their influence--would suggest the future "assembly" may be composed of little more than the representatives of civil society and a handful of fairly small political parties. Indeed, all indications are the transition process will be carried out with the cooperation of the very same forces that participated in the national conference and adopted the "national consensus platform." Some observers are already raising the question of the "legitimacy" of the transition structures, especially the future CNT, from which the most influential parties, the most obvious candidates for membership, have been excluded. President Zeroual's plans already have been thrown off schedule by the departure of the Redha Malek government; now the presidency has only a few more days to convince all sides to participate in the transition phase.
