The news analyst says: The Amnesty International in a report March 9 on the lapse of one year since the traitor Kim Yong-sam's inauguration said that although he promised "democratization" under the "civilian" veil, "new tortures and harsh practices" have appeared in South Korea. The Kim Yong-sam government has hardly done anything to put an end to human rights violations, added the report. When hanging up the signboard of "civilian government," the traitor Kim Yong-sam waxed eloquent about "liquidation of the leftovers of the past" and "expansion of human rights." The last year, however, has witnessed nothing but murderous strong-arm politics and terror politics in South Korea. The Kim Yong-sam group relies on the one-party dictatorship of the military fascist "Democratic Liberal Party." And such fascist repressive machines as "Security Planning Board" and "Secret Affairs Command," which should have been thrown into the dustbin of history, along with the dictatorship of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics," still stay alive and active in human rights violations, invoking the "National Security Law" that should have been scrapped. This is the stark reality of South Korea. To expect democratic politics and guarantee of human rights from the traitor Kim Yong-sam is as foolish as hoping to see a wolf give birth to a lamb. Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets at a recent meeting of the UN commission on human rights made a tirade about "expansion of human rights" and "progress in democratization" in South Korea and even took issue with someone's "human rights problem." This was the height of shamelessness and a mockery of the meeting and its participants. Only after the ouster of the "government" of the traitor Kim Yong-sam, can true democratic politics and human rights be expected in South Korea.
