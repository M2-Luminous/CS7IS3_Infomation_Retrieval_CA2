Security Council Resolution 904 exemplifies this U.S. tendency, established by consecutive administrations in the White House. Following lengthy discussions and a U.S. delay, the Security Council issued a resolution carefully drafted by the United States. As a result, it lacks any real material or political value that can end the policy of murder and massacre directed by the Zionist enemy against our people. The resolution satisfies the Zionist desire to deny any of our people's rights in their land and even avoids the minimum level of previous resolutions relating to the Palestinians of the 1967 occupied territory. Resolution 904 considered that part of Palestinian territory as merely disputed territory. The PFLP-GC spokesman adds: After three weeks of watering down, the U.S. [as heard] Security Council adopted a resolution designed to absorb the wave of anger that swept through the Arab and Muslim arenas, while at the same time practically encouraging the Zionist settlers to commit further massacres. While the resolution condemns the massacre, and urges the Zionist entity to take measures to ensure the safety of Palestinian civilians, it ignores the fact that the Zionist entity's measures and policies are the arms of the settlers and the canopy that protects their Nazism. We in the PFLP-GC feel that the U.S. [as heard] Security Council resolution confirms the following facts: a. The United States is only an ally of the Zionist entity and cannot in any way be a fair mediator or partner. b. The double standards policy is now governing international resolutions in view of the U.S. hegemony over it and its various standards. While the Security Council denies our people the right to enjoy armed international protection that would guarantee their safety and security from the massacres of the occupation, we see the same council allowing itself to interfere in the affairs of an independent, sovereign state. Under the pretext of protecting the Kurds in Iraq, it sends troops for reasons that have become very well known. c. A host of events that preceded the Madrid-Oslo-Washington course and which were part of the settlement process confirmed that the 'Arafat-Rabin agreement has encouraged the occupation soldiers and settlers to go even further in their disdain of our people and their rights. d. Those who welcomed Security Council 904 and considered it a moral and political achievement for the Palestinian people worked in collaboration with the Clinton administration on drafting this resolution in order to escape their crisis and circumvent the position of our masses, who believe the negotiations and their continuation represent treachery against our people and our homeland. h. As we declare our rejection of Resolution 904, we stress that the real decision is our people's response, awareness, and rejection of all maneuvers and deceptions that aim at continuing the negotiations and entrench the occupation. This is what our people are exercising through their escalating intifadah, which has confirmed the depth of their faith in the inevitability of victory and their understanding of the conflict's nature and reality. We pledge to continue the revolution until the liberation of land and man. [Signed] The PFLP-GC
