According to the spirit of the All-China Conference on Propagandistic and Ideological Work, and with due integration with the actual conditions of Henan Province, we shall resoundingly proclaim the fundamental guiding principle which we shall adhere to in our propagandistic and ideological work: we shall raise high one main propaganda theme and energetically pursue five particular tasks. Comrade Deng Xiaoping set forth the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics, a theory which is to serve as the fundamental directive for all work throughout the party. This fundamental directive must be firmly applied, in particular also to propagandistic and ideological work. Arming all party members and cadres with the weapon of this theory is primary task of the day, a task that must be carried out earnestly and effectively. Deng Xiaoping's theory on the building socialism with Chinese characteristics profoundly reflects the objective law that governs China's socialist construction and succinctly manifests the will and desire of party and people. It is continuation and development of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is the Marxism of present-day China. The said theory is the spiritual mainstay for the entire party and for all nationalities throughout the country. It is the powerful ideological weapon that will win victory in reform, opening up, and modernization. During the past 15 years of reform and opening up, it is precisely under the guidance of this theory, that our undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics was seriously tested and vigorously developed within a most changeable international situation. China's economic construction, the people's living standards, and overall national strength have all reached a new and higher level of development, an achievement that has attracted worldwide attention. It is particularly under the guidance of the said theory that work in all the various sectors of Henan Province also resulted in huge achievements, that the economy could maintain its tendency of rapid growth, and that the strategic objective of "one high, one low" [yi gao, yi di] could have been achieved. Practical experience has made us deeply aware of the fact that whether or not we shall be able to arm all our party members, cadres, and the masses with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics will have a direct effect on success or failure of our socialist modernizations, a direct effect on whether we shall be able to advance united, whether we shall be able to realize the objective of bringing prosperity to Henan Province, and whether we shall be able to implement the tasks set forth at the conference on propagandistic and ideological work. The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a complete scientific theoretical system, in which the various basic concepts and basic principles do not stand alone in isolation, but are inherently linked with one another. To truly grasp this theoretical system, to achieve mastery of it through comprehensive study, is not at all an easy matter. It requires attention to the complete and accurate understanding and mastery of the theoretical system within the overall body of the whole, as well as with respect to the mutual linkages of its parts. Particular attention and effort must be directed to the following three aspects: 1) Great efforts must be expended to attain the basic viewpoints expressed in the said theory concerning the important and fundamental theoretical problem of "what is socialism, how socialism is to be established and developed"; 2) An accurate understanding must be reached as to the inherent connections between the series of fundamental concepts in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's writings; we must completely and accurately understand the fundamental line and theoretical basis of the principle "one central task, two basic points" [economic development plus a) adherence to the four cardinal principles and b) implementation of reform and the open policy; 3) We must firmly grasp the quintessence of "liberation of the mind" and of "seeking truth from facts," and must gain an understanding and mastery of the world view and methodology of dialectic materialism and historical materialism that permeates all of Comrade Deng's writings, while at the same time avoiding and reducing all subjectivism and metaphysics. In the study of scientific theory, emphasis must be on its ultimate linkage with the realities and on the guidance it provides for action. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently emphasized the need for a thorough study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the need to closely link such studies with the overall situation in the work of the entire party during this year, and the need to raise the level of political consciousness as to all action within the present overall situation. The Central Committee has decided on the following to be this year's overall tasks for the entire party: to seize the favorable opportunity to deepen the reform, expand opening up, promote economic development, and to preserve stability. In matters of establishing the socialist market economy system, China has this year accomplished many important reform measures, actions which may be compared to "storming heavily fortified positions." To gain victory in a fight of this nature requires a particularly strong measure of close unity among the broad masses of party members, cadres, and the people, also concerted action of all concerned, breaking new paths, and vigorous advances ahead. Through the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's writings, we shall attain a better unity of thinking with regard to the overall state of the work performed by the entire party, a unity of thinking also with regard to all important policy decisions of the party and the state on improving reform. When linking up with the realities, we must also link up closely with the particular realities of Henan Province in its reform, opening up, and economic construction. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, for instance, has repeatedly emphasized seizing favorable opportunities to accelerate economic development, and has questioned why some regions have always been slow in their development. There may be many reasons for it, but the main reasons, we are afraid, are that they have not truly effected "liberation of minds" and have not conscientiously "sought truth from facts." You, who are in leading positions, have not yet changed your ways of thinking. You have not yet replaced those old "leftist" things and those traditional concepts, formed under the conditions of the planned economy, by the new ideas and new concepts suited to the socialist market economy. You have not yet become fully conscious of reform and opening up, of market economy, and of the spirit of arduous pioneering work. How, then, can you expect that your districts can spread the wings that would lift them up? If you who are in leading positions will not do a solid job, if you are afraid that your actions may result in "political merits," and if you, in the end, go in for formalism, put on false airs, even go so far as to resort to deception, deceive those above and bully those below, is that not running in the opposite direction to "seeking truth from facts"? Through the study of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, all regions and all agencies are to find out the strong points and deficiencies of their regions and units, should reason out their developmental paths, and should determine their particular development plans according to actual conditions, seize favorable opportunities, and accelerate economic development. There a common saying: If the cadre does not lead, the water buffalo will fall into the well. It is the same with theoretical studies. Leading cadres at all levels, especially those of department [chu] and higher rank in the counties, must set an example, take the lead in studying and applying, and by their own model actions motivate and influence all party members and cadres toward studies. At the same time, they should start out from the realities of their district or unit, meticulously arrange and well organize -- in a planned way, with points of emphasis, and level by level -- the study of all their many party members and cadres. Best material for the study of the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics is Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. It is now a necessity to effectively organize the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. This should be combined with the study of the documents from the 14th NPC and the decisions of the Third Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as a thorough study of the theory and basics of the socialist market economy. These studies should furnish full knowledge of the necessity, urgency, and arduous nature of establishing this new economic system, should strengthen political consciousness as regards the reform, and this should ensure, through concerted effort by high and low throughout the entire province, the ultimate success in the reform, a victory in what appears like "storming of a heavily fortified position."
