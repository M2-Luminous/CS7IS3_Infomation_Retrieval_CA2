The two sides considered ways to resolve the Karabakh conflict in the light of Russia's mediatory initiative and the peacemaking mission of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Araktsyan said the Armenian side, as a gesture of goodwill, stated its readiness to ensure the transit of all freight by rail across Armenian territory from Turkey to the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic and the transmission of electric power for Nakhichevan through the Armenian power grid. At the close of the meeting, the Armenian parliament chief said the Azerbaijani side is inclined to recognise Nagorno-Karabakh as a full-fledged participant in the talks. The meeting was held in an atmosphere of mutual understanding and constructiveness, Guliyev pointed out. He agreed with his Armenian counterpart that the crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh can be resolved only politically, not militarily. Bilateral consultations will be continued, the chiefs of two parliaments said, according to the spokesman.
