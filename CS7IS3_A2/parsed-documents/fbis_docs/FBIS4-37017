According to these sources, the agreement was preceded by exhausting negotiations in which 'Arafat repeatedly raised his request to visit Jerusalem escorted by armed Palestinian policemen. The Israelis initially refused his request, but finally agreed to allow 'Arafat to hold a ceremonial visit to Temple Mount, perhaps even accompanied by flag-bearing Palestinian policemen. Peres stated yesterday that Israel had not received a request from 'Arafat to visit Jerusalem. "We do not rush to give answers to unasked questions," said Peres, who is currently visiting Ukraine. Sources in his entourage noted that to the best of their knowledge the reports about an agreement reached between Peres and 'Arafat during their meeting in Bucharest concerning the PLO chairman visiting Jerusalem escorted by flag-bearing Palestinian policemen are not true. [passage omitted] Security sources noted yesterday that Jibril al-Rujub, head of the Palestinian secret service in the territories whose activities have been confined to the Jericho area, visited East Jerusalem and the Old City on several occasions over the past few weeks. The sources expressed their concern about this occurrence, noting that these visits might cause security damage. [passage omitted]
