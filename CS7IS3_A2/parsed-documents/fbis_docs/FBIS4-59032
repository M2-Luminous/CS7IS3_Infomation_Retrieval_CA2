These people had gathered around the president's house hours before the arrival of the Iranian delegation, expressed their appreciation for Iran's selfless compassion and the unstinting assistance of our people. During the visit by 'Ali Akbar Velayati to Bosnia-Herzegovina, the first Iranian ambassador was introduced in Sarajevo, and brief talks were held between the officials of the two countries. In his meeting with Dr. Velayati, President Alija Izetbegovic said: Had it not been for the support of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the struggles of the Bosnian Muslims would certainly have had a different fate. In this meeting, Dr. Velayati described the resistance of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina as inspiring pride. He added: The Islamic Republic of Iran is on the side of the Bosnian Muslims with all its might. It may be mentioned that the visit of the Iranian delegation lasted 10 hours in all and at present, Dr. Velayati is in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. In his first round of talks with the Croatian prime minister, Velayati stressed the common stances of Tehran and Zagreb as regards the need for greater seriousness on the part of the United Nations for resolving the crisis in the Balkan region and he criticized the procrastination and inattention of the Security Council. Dr. Velayati described the UN's procrastination and failure to implement the Security Council's resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina as unprecedented in the history of the organization. Dr. Velayati also participated in a press conference along with the Croatian prime minister. The latter hailed Iran's support for a federation between the Bosnian Croats and Muslims and expressed his appreciation for Iran's efforts to resolve the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. In this press conference, Dr. Velayati referred to the Croatian prime minister's visit to Tehran last week and deemed the tripartite session of Tehran-Zagreb-Sarajevo, useful and effective for the establishment of peace and security in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It may be mentioned that last week, on the invitation of Iran, two high-level delegations from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia had visited Tehran and important talks had taken place to resolve the crisis in the Balkan peninsula. The current visit by the Iranian diplomatic delegation to this area is in fact considered a continuation of the talks in Tehran.
