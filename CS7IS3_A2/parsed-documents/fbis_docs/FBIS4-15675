FBIS4-15675 "drsov069_u_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Latvia Official: Policy Enforces Russian Influence Official: Policy Enforces Russian Influence WS0804134494 Tallinn BNS in English 1022 GMT 8 Apr 94 WS0804134494 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Riga, Apr 07, BNS -- The current Latvian foreign policy promotes the strengthening of Russia's influence in Latvia, Saeima (parliament) Deputy Speaker Andrejs Krastins said Thursday [8 April] at a conference in the Academy of Science. The initialed agreements on troop withdrawal is only one of the examples of the tendency, Krastins said. The world community is unlikely to help Latvia substantially if Russia uses military force against it and this will be a result of the present Latvian foreign policy, Krastins noted. To prevent this, Latvia should distance itself from Russia both economically and politically because "Russia is our sole potential enemy," Krastins said. Unfortunately, Krastins said, many Latvian politicians fail to understand this truth partly because of inertia and party because of exaggerated liberalism. Krastins described the initialed Latvian-Russian agreements as intentions of the ruling coalition to attribute all merits for Russian troop withdrawal to itself. Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decision to build military bases in the CIS and Latvia and the following excuses with "a technical error" stand "just another ordinary sample" of Russia's foreign policy, Krastins said. On the other hand, the incident convinced part of the Latvian community that Latvia needs the troop withdrawal agreement with Russia to avert the setup of Russian bases here, Krastins said. The Skrunda radar station, however, is and will remain a military base though there are attempts to call it differently, Krastins added. Krastins summed up his address saying that Latvia vitally needs to integrate into Europe. Krastins is one of the leaders in the oppositionary Latvian National Independence Movement. The meeting was organized by the Baltic Center for Strategic Studies and the Academy of Sciences.
