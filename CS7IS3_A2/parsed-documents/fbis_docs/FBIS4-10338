The Buenos Aires district winner said that Menendez -- second on the Justicialist Party ticket -- represents "an example of the saturation felt by a good part of the capital's people." He added that despite his victory he will not forgive the government for "everything it did" to "disqualify him." Alvarez said the campaign "was not traditional and did not include the debate of ideas or the exchange of proposals" because the ruling party "carried out a very harsh campaign below the surface." He said that "part of the political game's cynicism" is due to the fact that "when the aggression ends everybody pretends to love each other again." Alvarez denied that the reports of alleged bribes in PAMI were "low punches" because "knowing where the money comes from is as serious as discussing proposals." "The people said it was enough and wanted to put a limit on abuse and corruption in government. The FG was the instrument citizens from different political and ideological groups used to show this, which proves that no one has a captive electorate in the capital," Alvarez said on the radio. The legislator questioned "the government's insults and low punches against the FG during the campaign," adding that "the incidents created a tense situation because we knew the information services were looking for any excuse to attack us." "When the government saw our growth through the surveys it started attacking us from all sides. Government officials linked us with the issue of the super gang. Then they said I was being financed by the SIDE [Secretariat for State Intelligence]. They paid two mercenaries who came from the south to say that I wrote letters from Congress to former political prisoners, which is totally absurd," Alvarez added. According to the FG leader, "there were various government operations, one after the other, to hit us below the belt. They gave people the impression that they could not accept the possibility of losing democratically." Alvarez said the reports on possible bribes inside PAMI "were not low punches, because to speak of kickbacks or bribes is as serious as to discuss proposals." Alvarez concluded by urging "a continuation of the investigation because the report was not presented for electoral reasons."
