FR940503-0-00052 FR940503-0-00012 This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424) in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Any economic impact, whether on small entities or large, would be beneficial, in that it would seek to compensate property owners for extraordinary expenses incurred that are not compensated by the annual rent adjustments. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. Specifically, the requirements of this rule are directed to private owners of Section 8 projects and do not impinge upon the relationship between the Federal government and State and local governments. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. Nothing in this rule changes the amount of rent paid by tenant families, which is based on the income of the family.
