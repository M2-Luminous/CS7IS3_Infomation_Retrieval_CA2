At the conference over 250 experts and scholars in the fields of economy and trade, arbitration and the legal profession from 30 countries will discuss the latest developments in international arbitration, arbitration legislation and practice. It is the first time that such conference has ever been held in a developing country. Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing sent a letter of congratulations to the conference, which is co-sponsored by the International Council for Commercial Arbitration (ICCA) and the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Committee (CIETAC). Zheng Hongye, president of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and chairman of the CIETAC, said at the opening ceremony that China has solved many international commercial conflicts through arbitration in the past 40 years, and its arbitration system has steadily improved. China has become one of the major centers for international commercial arbitration, he said. Zheng said that China will spare no efforts to make its economic laws come closer to international standards, especially those of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. Not long ago, he noted, China adopted a foreign trade law, and laws of arbitration and commerce are now under discussion. Earlier today, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with the foreign delegates attending the conference. He said during the meeting that the Chinese Government always supports not only the development of arbitration in China, but also exchanges and co-operation between Chinese and international arbitration circles. Since China adopted the open policy in the late 1970s arbitration has played and will continue to play an important role in supporting the constant development of China's economy, Li said. It is learned that so far China has included arbitration regulations in 14 laws, 82 administrative regulations and 190 local laws.
