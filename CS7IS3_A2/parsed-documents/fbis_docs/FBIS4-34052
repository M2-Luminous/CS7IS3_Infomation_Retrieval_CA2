The agreement was made yesterday by Planning Minister Beni Veras, PFL [Liberal Front Party] senator for Paraiba Raymundo Lyra -- the president of the Budget Committee of Congress -- and TSE President Sepulveda Pertence. The government chose this solution because the $160 million that was to have been used for repaying the debt can be resupplied in August, once the budget bill has been voted on. "If it needs the funds, the government can submit a message to Congress asking for inclusion of a supplemental credit in the budget. The budget will have been voted on by August, and there will be no problem," Lyra said.
