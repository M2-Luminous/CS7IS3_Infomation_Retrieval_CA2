Discussion of Situation in Russia's Economy Has Been Postponed"] [Text] The latest session of the Russian Federation Government Presidium yesterday began with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin proposing that it not discuss the implementation of the Council of Ministers resolution On the Situation of the Russian Economy and Prospects for Its Development for 1994 but, "owing to its special importance," devote to this subject a special session set tentatively for 3 May. Therefore the ministers had to consider a draft federal program titled Reducing the Level of Radiation of Russia's Population and Production Personnel from Natural Radioactive Sources in 1994-1996 (radon program) and map out urgent measures to protect forests and reindeer pasture lands as well as preserve the sheep breeding and processing industry. There are two federal programs in Russia to protect forests from fire and on reforestation, said Valeriy Shubin, chief of the Russian Federation Forestry Service, but due to a shortage of funds preparations for the summer period "have practically been thwarted," in spite of the fact that some 600 pockets of forest fires (approximately 6,000 hectares) have been identified. The Forestry Service was to get 135 billion rubles this year to implement the programs, but so far has received only a small portion and managed to conclude contracts with only six out of 19 air units -- and even those have only 11 percent of the required fuel stocks. Mr. Shubin demanded, in addition to funds, the creation of a "rapid reaction" fire fighting reserve and to provide forestry employees with firearms and ammunition. The government presidium deemed these demands quite reasonable and decided to finalize the draft resolution on measures to protect forests and reindeer pastures from fires and present it for signing to the government in three days. It was also decided to finalize and submit to government approval the radon program. To protect Russians from radiation (sources: radon gas and construction materials, primarily granite slates), whose aggregate dose exceeds by 300 times the level produced by the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, the first stage of the program calls for research to be conducted, technological charts to be drawn up, and standards worked out. The second stage envisions a campaign of public awareness and training in methods of protection against natural radiation. The overall cost of the project is 41 billion rubles, including 20 billion from the federal budget. The presidium related with full understanding also to the draft resolution moved by the Agriculture Ministry on urgent measures to preserve the domestic sheep breeding and processing industry. Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha said that the sheep population in Russia has been halved compared to 1990, while woolen fabric production has fallen by 80 percent. At the same time agricultural producers, according to him, cannot find a market for 60,000 tonnes of wool, to which amount the upcoming sheep shearing will add another 70,000 to 80,000 tonnes. Therefore Mr. Zaveryukha asked the government to help market the surplus wool because "this is a matter of survival for those Russian Federation ethnic groups that traditionally engage in sheep breeding." First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets supported the country's number one agrarian and called on the ministers not to shun agrarian questions and "not stigmatize the agrarians as anti-marketeers, but let the Agro-Industrial Complex into the market."
