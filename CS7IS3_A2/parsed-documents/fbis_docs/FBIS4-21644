Mr S.K. Chatterjee, Managing Director, Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), who is also the Chairman of the site selection committee, said here on Saturday that he would recommend to the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) for locating the nuclear plant at Nagarjunasagar. Speaking at a function organised by the Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC) in connection with the production of 1,00,000th [as printed] fuel bundle used for pressurised heavy water type reactors, he said Nagarjunasagar was the most suitable site in the country for the establishment of the multi-crore project to be taken up during the Ninth Five-Year Plan. He said that a part of the project cost of Rs2,000 crore would have to be shared jointly by Andhra Pradesh Government and the NPCIL. Raising of funds for the project was an uphill task and all efforts would be made in this regard. The cost per MW would be Rs 4 crore for the project, which would have 2 x 500 MW stations. The Andhra Pradesh Government gave a positive response for establishing the plant in the State, he added. He, however, hastened to add that there was still a long process for the finalisation of the project, which among other things required environmental clearance. The NPCIL was in touch with the Andhra Pradesh Government and the State Electricity Board, he said. Stating that the programmes of the NPCIL had slowed down due to paucity of funds, he said the NPCI is now concentrating on joint ventures with the States. In this regard, the NPCIL would have a joint venture with Karnataka for establishing two projects at Kaigah and Mysore. Dr R. Chidambaram, Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), who inaugurated the NFC's productivity week celebrations, lauded the organisation's achievements in the nuclear fuel cycle and its dominant role in the country's peaceful nuclear programmes. He asked the NFC to make all efforts to bring down the cost of production and to adopt innovative methods to help produce cost-effective material. "We have to improve the technology. We will not be able to get nuclear technology from outside. There is no dearth of talent, capability and commitment. But what we lack is the speed. We now have to do things faster to keep pace with the developed nations." The NFC Chief Executive, Mr K.K. Sinha, who welcomed, said the NFC had crossed yet other milestones in its cherished goal of excellence by producing the 1,00,000th fuel bundle. Stressing the need for accelerating the production, he said there was a general feeling that the output from public sector units was not commensurate with the investment on it and the fruits were not reaching the people. Dr N. Kondalarao and Mr K. Balaramamoorthy, former chief executives of the NFC, said that the organisation grew from strength to strength over the years and carved a niche for itself in the area of excellence. Dr Ravi Mallu, MP and president of the NFC Employees' Association, urged the AEC chairman, Dr R. Chidambaram to consider the demands of the employees which included risk allowance, insurance coverage and nutritious food to those working in the uranium unit and washing allowance to workers. Later Dr R. Chidambaram handed over the 1,00,000th fuel bundle to Mr S.K. Chatterjee.
