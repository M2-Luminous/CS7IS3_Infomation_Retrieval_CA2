In the session, the Central Committee discussed ways to reform the current tax system and adopted a platform supporting the future raise of the indirect tax rate to secure financial resources for social welfare security in a society of senior citizens. With regard to Rengo's response to the future realignment of political parties, the Central Committee decided to create "a Rengo politics and policy forum" in July that will become a key body to rally liberal political forces, including the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and the ruling Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. The Central Committee also approved a package of plans for the spring labor offensive and the study of the possibility of Rengo discontinuing the traditional demand for uniform wage increases. With regard to reforming the current tax system, the Central Committee adopted a "basic guideline for reforming the current tax system" and set the ceiling of the people's tax burden rate at 50 percent. During the session, the Central Committee called on the government to increase public spending for basic pensions and medical treatment of the aged and emphasized that "Rengo would pay attention to how the indirect tax will be handled." Several attendees argued against raising the indirect tax, saying: "Our support for raising the indirect tax rate may be interpreted as our approval of consumption tax hikes," but their argument was overridden by the Rengo leadership. Explaining how Rengo plans to promote the reform of the current tax system, the Rengo leadership said Rengo would propose that: 1) unfair taxation be addressed; 2) a comprehensive taxation and a taxpayer numbering system be introduced; 3) the consumption tax be revamped so as to abolish profit tax [ekizei] and shift to invoices [shiokurijo]; and 4) the retrogressive tax be eased. The Rengo leadership was not specific about how it will promote the reform of the current tax system. The platform did not clearly indicate the shift of the consumption tax to an earmarked tax that the SDPJ has advocated, but only said: "The priority shall be given to spending the budget for the social welfare." The platform accepted a proposal from the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union for the "creation of a local consumption tax." Rengo Central Committee decisions made during the session will centrally affect debates of ruling parties and the SDPJ on reforming the current tax system. The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is moving closer to what Rengo is advocating in connection with the reform of the current tax system and how the LDP responds to those decisions will draw attention. The forum will be organized by politicians of political parties that have supported, cooperated with, and maintained friendly relations with Rengo, and opinion leaders and representatives of organizations that can cooperate with Rengo. Rengo will call on "politicians who participated in forming the Hosokawa government to join the forum," (according to a senior Rengo official). The forum is likely to be formed in tune with the tripolar theory expounded by President Yamagishi, who has described the LDP as a conservative A, and Komeito and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] as a conservative B.
