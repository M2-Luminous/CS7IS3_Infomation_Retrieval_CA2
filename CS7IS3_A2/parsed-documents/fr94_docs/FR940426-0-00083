FR940426-0-00083 FR940426-0-00018 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 032194G] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Apportionment of reserve. SUMMARY: NMFS is apportioning reserve to certain target species in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to allow for ongoing harvest and account for previous harvest of the total allowable catch (TAC). EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), April 20, 1994, through 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Martin Loefflad, Resource Management Specialist, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, (907) 586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the U.S. BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the initial TACs specified for pollock and Greenland turbot in the Bering Sea subarea (BS), for Pacific ocean perch, Greenland turbot, and pollock in the Aleutian Islands subarea (AI), for Atka mackerel in the combined Eastern Aleutian District and BS, and for Pacific cod in the BSAI, need to be supplemented from the nonspecific reserve to continue operations and account for prior harvest. Therefore, in accordance with ยง675.20(b), NMFS is apportioning from the reserve to TACs for the following species: (1) for the BS_99,750 metric tons (mt) to pollock and 700 mt to Greenland turbot; (2) for the AI_1,635 mt to Pacific ocean perch, 350 mt to Greenland turbot, and 4,245 mt to pollock; (3) for the combined Eastern Aleutian District and BS_2,021 mt to Atka mackerel; and (4) for the BSAI_28,650 mt to Pacific cod. These apportionments are consistent with ยง675.20(a)(2)(i) and do not result in overfishing of a target species or the ``other species'' category because the revised TACs are equal to or less than specifications of acceptable biological catch. Pursuant to ยง675.20(a)(3)(i), the apportionments of pollock are allocated between the inshore and offshore components: (1) for the BS_34,913 mt to vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component and 64,837 mt to vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component; (2) for the AI_1,486 mt to vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component and 2,759 to vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component. Pursuant to ยง675.20(a)(3)(iv), the apportionment of the BSAI Pacific cod TAC is allocated 573 mt to vessels using jig gear, 12,606 mt to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 15,471 mt to vessels using trawl gear. This apportionment was proposed in the Federal Register (59 FR 14383, March 28, 1994), requesting public comment. The public comment period ended on April 7, 1994. No comments were received. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined, under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, that good cause exists for waiving the 30-day delayed effectiveness period for this action. Fisheries are currently taking place that will be supplemented by this apportionment. Delaying the effective date would be disruptive and costly to these ongoing operations. This action is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 675 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: April 20, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
