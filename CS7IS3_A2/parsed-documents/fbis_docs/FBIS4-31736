It was established that the team of negotiators should include State Ministers Mircea Dan Popescu and Florin Georgescu, Government General Secretary Viorel Hrebenciuc, and Octavian Partenie, state secretary and government representative for relations with employers associations and trade unions. It was also decided that discussions should take place in the presence of mass media representatives. Unfortunately, the government offer was not honored because the demonstrators did not display the same willingness as the government in establishing a reasonable number of trade union leaders to form their group of negotiators. At the time of this broadcast, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, together with Mircea Dan Popescu, Florin Georgescu, Viorel Hrebenciuc, and Octavian Partenie, are holding talks with a trade union delegation that includes Bogdan Hosu, Victor Ciorbea, and Florin Diaconescu and are trying to reach a solution regarding the number of members to be included in the trade union delegation. The government proposal that the trade union group should include 15 people, considered to be sufficiently representative for the entire trade union spectrum participating in the demonstration, has been rejected by trade union leaders, who propose a delegation that includes no less than 40 people. However, the Romanian Government continues to maintain its willingness for a sincere and constructive dialogue with trade unions for a thorough examination of all real problems facing them, certainly in accordance with the real possibilities that the national economy can currently offer. As a matter of fact, as is known, the claims of trade unions have been discussed on several occasions. Most of those claims are specific to a controlled, directed, and centralized economy that is no longer in line with the current stage in Romania's development, the communique sent to us by the spokesman of the Romanian Government reads in conclusion. A few minutes before the start of our broadcast, our correspondent at the Government Headquarters informed us that the two sides have not reached a joint accord on the major issue under discussion, namely the number of participants in the negotiations.
