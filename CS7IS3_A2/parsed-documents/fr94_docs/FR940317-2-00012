FR940317-2-00012 FR940317-2-00009 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [I.D. 030394A] Marine Mammals AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Receipt of application for a public display permit (P462G). SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that Ervin and Sonja Strong, dba/The Dolphin Connection, 215 Bridgeport Avenue, Suite 4, Corpus Christi, TX 78402, have applied in due form for a permit to take marine mammals. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: The application and related documents are available for review upon written request or by appointment in the following offices: Permits Division, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1315 East-West Highway, room 13130, Silver Spring, MD 20910 (301/713&hyph;2289); and Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, NOAA, 9450 Koger Boulevard, room 206, St. Petersburg, FL 33702 (813/893&hyph;3141). Written data or views, or requests for a public hearing on this application should be submitted to the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NMFS, NOAA, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910, within 30 days of the publication of this notice. Those individuals requesting a hearing should set forth the specific reasons why a hearing on this particular request would be appropriate. The holding of such a hearing is at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries. Concurrent with the publication of this notice in the Federal Register , the Secretary of Commerce is forwarding copies of this application to the Marine Mammal Commission and its Committee of Scientific Advisors. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The subject permit is requested under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq. ) and the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216). The applicants request authorization to approach, harass, observe, and feed Atlantic bottlenose dolphin ( Tursiops truncatus ) in the wild in Corpus Christi Bay, for purposes of public display. It should be noted that on October 14, 1993, the NMFS published in the Federal Register (58 FR 53320) a Proposed Rule to Revise Regulations for Public Display, Scientific Research and Enhancement Permits which would clarify that public display activities may occur in captive settings only. Thus, if this rule becomes final as proposed, it will not provide for conduct of the type of activity being requested by the applicants. In addition, NMFS regulations define the term ``take'' as including feeding wild populations of marine mammals due to increased incidental interactions with commercial fishing vessels, alterations in feeding behaviors and migratory patterns, and vulnerability to disease transmission. [See Final Rule published in the Federal Register March 20, 1991 (56 FR 11693&hyph;97).] Dated: March 10, 1994. William W. Fox, Jr., Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6211 Filed 3&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
