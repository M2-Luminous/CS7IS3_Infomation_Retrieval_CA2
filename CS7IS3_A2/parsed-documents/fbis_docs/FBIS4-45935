Indeed, Mr Narasimha Rao's remark that "there is no pressure from the United States (and) hence there is no question of yielding to it" is unlikely to satisfy everyone, considering that the Americans have made no secret of their deep displeasure with India's experiments with rocket technology and have been trying their best, including compelling Russia to renege on the cryogenic deal, to force India to abandon its various projects. The U.S. pressure has been there even before the time of the first launch of the Agni in 1989 when India claimed success in joining an exclusive club of the Big Five and Israel by mastering the intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) technology. What has led to the renewed speculation about American intentions is obviously the fact that the reports about the capping of the Agni programme have followed close on the heels of the Strobe Talbott visit during which the Americans tried to persuade India to join a regional nuclear disarmament conference which carries the threat of imposing restrictions on various technological experiments. It would have been better, therefore, for the government to be more explicit about the Agni project during the Rajya Sabha debate. The observation of the minister of state for defence, Mr M. Mallikarjun, that the flight of the Agni "was only a technology demonstration" and that it was "yet to be decided whether it should be converted into a missile programme" was no more than a reiteration of what is known. In the present context, the government might have clarified whether it would persist with the experiments. This is all the more necessary because the third test-firing of the Agni last February was also described as the final launch which had reportedly met all the requirements of the objectives set for the mission. As Dr Abdul Kalam, director-general of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, said, "so far as technology is concerned, we have demonstrated our capability" and it was now "for the government to take a political decision for its induction in the armed forces." According to some reports, the government is considering three options: to develop Agni as a weapon of war or to continue perfecting the IRBM technology but not using warheads as evidence of India's peaceful intentions, or to drop the programme altogether. Given the conditions in India's immediate neighbourhood, there is no question of opting for the third alternative, but whatever the government's decision, it must be seen to have been taken purely on merit and not under any compulsion.
