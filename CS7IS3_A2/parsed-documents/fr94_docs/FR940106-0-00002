FR940106-0-00002 FR940106-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 7 CFR Part 201 [Docket No. 93&hyph;164&hyph;1] Federal Seed Act Regulations AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: We are amending the Federal Seed Act regulations to remove the origin staining requirements for seed of alfalfa and red clover grown in Mexico and imported into the United States. The removal of the requirements is necessary to make the regulations conform to the amendment of the Federal Seed Act by the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. The effect of this action is to relieve a restriction on importation of alfalfa and red clover seed from Mexico. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Polly Lehtonen, Botanist, Biological Assessment and Taxonomic Support, Operational Support, Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, room 626, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8896. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background We are amending the Federal Seed Act Regulations in 7 CFR part 201 (referred to below as the regulations) by removing the requirement that 10 percent of each container of alfalfa or red clover grown in Mexico be stained red. On December 8, 1993, President Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to become effective January 1, 1994. To implement this agreement, Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the Act) (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). The statutory amendments included in the Act become effective coincident with NAFTA. The amendment in this final rule is mandated by section 361(a) of the Act, which amended section 302(e)(1) of the Federal Seed Act (7 U.S.C. 1582(e)(1)) by providing that the provisions requiring certain seeds to be stained red shall not apply to alfalfa or red clover seed originating in Mexico. (See Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). This final rule is being taken to conform the regulations with the amendments to the Act, by amending ยง201.104 of the regulations to remove the origin staining requirements for seed of alfalfa and red clover grown in Mexico and imported into the United States. Emergency Action The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that good cause exists to publish this final rule without prior notice and opportunity for public comment. Certain regulatory actions must be taken as a result of the statutory amendments discussed in the `` Background ,'' and must become effective with NAFTA to avoid inconsistency between the regulations and their statutory authority. Removal of the origin staining requirement for alfalfa and red clover seed imported from Mexico is one of the regulatory changes that must become effective at the same time as NAFTA and the Act to avoid this conflict. This action relieves a restriction on the importation of alfalfa and red clover seed from Mexico. Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this final rule are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest, and since this regulatory change is mandated by Congress, there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 for making this final rule effective as of January 1, 1994. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The Act, as amended, removes the requirement that alfalfa and red clover seed that is imported from Mexico be stained red. This final rule conforms the regulations to the Act. We have no record of any alfalfa or red clover having been imported from Mexico in the past 5 years, and we anticipate no importations in the foreseeable future. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12278 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 201 Advertising, Agricultural commodities, Imports, Labeling, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Seeds, Vegetables.
