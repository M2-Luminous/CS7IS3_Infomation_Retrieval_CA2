Minister Han Sung-chu said that the government is planning to make an official inquiry to the U.S. State Department through diplomatic channels about the background and intent of Deputy Assistant Secretary Hubbard's remark. Minister Han said that although the U.S. side referred to the National Security Law in connection with the human rights issue in the ROK before the civilian government was launched, no such reference has been made since the start of the civilian government. Moreover, the U.S. State Department's human rights report notes drastic improvement in the ROK's human rights situation.
