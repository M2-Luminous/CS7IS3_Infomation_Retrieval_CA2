While the new prime minister has announced, apparently without giving many details, that he will seek to "restore authority to the state," the Permanent Mission of the Tshisekedi government in Brussels (a kind of alternative embassy) told LA LIBRE BELGIQUE what it sees as Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo's "real strategy." Personal Fortunes According to Mr. Dungia and Mr. Bakima, the next government intends to make a big show in the social and economic fields to "counterbalance the popularity of Etienne Tshisekedi" by supplying drugs to hospitals (where the situation is critical), by paying the military so that they no longer need to plunder and demand money from their citizens, and by relieving the overcrowding in their camps. "They also want to give $50 million a year to the [Zairian] president so that he will leave them free to run the Central Bank." The two men stated that this money and that to be used to pay ministers, and pay them well, will come from a fund set up by Mr Kengo Wa Dondo's party, the financially well-endowed UDI [Union of Democratic Independents], thanks to the personal wealth of its members. "In 1991, the UDI claimed it was ready to repatriate $900 million to help the (radical) opposition" of which it was a member until the spring of 1994, Mr. Bakima remembers. And why should such a sacrifice be open to criticism? "Because it is an imposture" Mr. Dungia replies. "What they really want is to prevent those who have been caught out by the "Committee for illegally acquired assets" of the Sovereign National Council from being judged. They want an amnesty to be able to keep what they have already got." Our interlocutors stated that on 8 June, Mr. Tshisekedi was visited by a delegation from the moderate opposition which "again asked for special guarantees to safeguard its assets. He refused." On 9 June, officials of the HCR-PT decided that the prime minister would be elected. On the 14 June, with Tshisekedi's candidacy rejected, Kengo Wa Dondo was elected. Government Whatever the situation, Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo's first job will be to form his government. By the terms of the "special arrangement for fair and balanced power-sharing during the period of transition," the government will consist of 46 members: 28 ministers (including four deputy prime ministers) and 18 deputy ministers. Ministries must also be shared out "on an equal basis" between the radical opposition and the allied parties on the one hand, and the presidential party on the other, "to avoid a single political group from having exclusive control over national interests." The options open to Mr. Kengo Wa Dondo are therefore relatively limited, which is not necessarily going to make his job any easier as, according to one Zairian observer: "Everybody seems to want to be a minister. The wrangling is going to increase rivalries within the alliances."
