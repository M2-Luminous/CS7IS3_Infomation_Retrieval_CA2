FBIS3-32157 "drlat023_k_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-023 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Feb 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Breakaway Unions Form Movement To Oppose Economic Policy PY0202225694 Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD in English 2 Feb 94 pp 1, 11 PY0202225694 Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD Language: English Article Type:BFN [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- The group of separatist General Labour Confederation [CGT] unions spearheaded by the secretary-general of the powerful UGTT transport workers confederation Juan Manuel Palacios and by former CGT head Saul Ubaldini yesterday launched the Argentine Workers Movement (MTA) umbrella group that pledged to oppose President Carlos Menem's economic policy. "Only the workers will save the workers," the MTA said in its nine-point founding document presented during an assembly staged in the Eva Peron auditorium at the Federal Capital headquarters of the UTA [Motor Transport Workers Union] transport workers. The organizers said that the assembly was attended by representatives of 80 dissident unions -- including the large food workers union -- that decided to quit the CGT last week after the umbrella group's leadership announced it was lifting a general strike called for January. The MTA is flatly rejecting the government's labour reform bill and is demanding the collective labour bargains "to be put into total effect." The rebel unions announced that they will participate in the 100th weekly pensioners demonstration scheduled to take place on March 2 and that it will launch a nationwide plan which could lead to a general strike. This is the second major split in the CGT in the last two years. The ATE [Association of State Workers] state workers union, the CTERA [Confederation of Education Workers of the Argentine Republic] teachers union and others walked out of the organization in 1992 to launch the staunch antigovernment Congress of Argentine Workers umbrella group. The CGT is currently led by a five-man general secretariat. One of those secretaries, Raul Amin called on the MTA "to stop messing about so we can launch a joint action, because there is a campaign to kill the labour movement." Amin defined the MTA as "an internal line that is not leaving the CGT." Palacios said yesterday that his faction had decided to name itself "only to be identified because we are not prepared to give up the glorious initials of the CGT." He stressed that the division in the CGT was not final and called on those present at the assembly not to criticize the current leadership. But he added that the MTA "will occupy the place to fight left vacant by the CGT." [passage omitted]
