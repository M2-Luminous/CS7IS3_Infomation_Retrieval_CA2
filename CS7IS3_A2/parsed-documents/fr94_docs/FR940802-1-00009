SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 24, 1994, the Commission issued Investment Company Act Release No. 20313 [59 FR 28286 (June 1, 1994)] (``Release No. 20313''), which proposed rule 17f&hyph;6 [17 CFR 270.17f&hyph;6] under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a]. The proposed rule would permit registered management investment companies to use futures commission merchants and commodity clearing organizations as custodians of their assets in connection with futures contracts and commodity options regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. 1&hyph;25]. Since Release No. 20313 was issued, the Commission has received a request from an interested person for an extension of the comment period. In light of the importance of the safekeeping of investment company assets and the benefit to the Commission of receiving carefully considered comments, the Commission believes a 60-day extension is appropriate. The comment period for responding to Release No. 20313 is extended to September 30, 1994. Dated: July 28, 1994. By the Commission. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
