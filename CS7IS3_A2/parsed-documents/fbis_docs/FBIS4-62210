He will be replaced be Nikolay Yegorov, who is currently administration chief of Krasnoyarsk Kray. Mr. Shakhray will retain the post of deputy prime minister, however. All his deputy ministers -- particularly, Messrs. Kotenkov and Abdulatipov -- have also been fired. Observers infer that Sergey Shakhray's removal may have been prompted by the increasing clout of the Federation components' political elites following local elections. In addition, Sergey Shakhray's successful efforts to obtain funds to implement programs for the North could not but encounter stiff resistance on the part of southern Russia's lobby.
