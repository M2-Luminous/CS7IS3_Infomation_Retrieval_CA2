Dellums, from California, has expressed support for the mission of the group "Freedom to Travel," which has defied U.S. restrictions impeding U.S. citizens from traveling to Cuba. During a news conference today in this capital, Medea Benjamin, the group spokesperson, read a letter from Delluns in which he views as unconstitutional and senseless the limitations on travel to Cuba. The letter reads: "I greet with clear understanding those who visit Cuba, and I reject the official White House policy. I join you in the continuous legislative efforts made to lift this historic Cold War foolishness, and I bid all of you success." According to U.S. laws, U.S. citizens who visit Havana without a special permit may be fined up to $250,000 or face 10-year prison sentences for violating the 1917 Trading With the Enemy Law and the economic blockade imposed on Cuba more than three decades ago. Benjamin said the note, which she views as unusual from a representative of the U.S. Congress, reached her two days after the Treasury Department froze a $43,000-account established to cover expenditures of the project. The letter reads: Our prohibition policy toward Cuba harms us, and it harms the island much more. The letter calls for a strengthening of the ties of friendship and cooperation between the two countries. According to Benjamin, Delluns said the U.S. media welcomed the recent lifting of the restrictions on travel to and trading with Vietnam, and she called for the adoption of similar actions regarding Cuba. The letter reads: We are definitely engaged in a post-Cold War struggle, and we support our old enemies now, as in the case of Russia. Delluns views the Freedom to Travel Movement's 90-mile trip to Cuba as an act of courage. The trip, she said, is a manifestation of the desire of the two nations (Cuban and the United States) to establish communication and to learn from each other.
