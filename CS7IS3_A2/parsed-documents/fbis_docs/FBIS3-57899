"Occhetto? We will never form an alliance with him, neither before nor after the coming elections." [Guiglia] According to a recent opinion poll, businessmen have more confidence in the "Pact" than in Occhetto's progressive alignment. Do you consider that a confirmation or a surprise? [Segni] I consider it extraordinary that a mere month after its establishment almost one-third of the businessmen interviewed name the Pact as their favorite electoral grouping. But it does not surprise me: The much vaunted and presumed support from industrialists for the PDS is absolute nonsense, fabricated by a few journalists and promptly publicized by Occhetto's party. In any case, you do not need opinion polls to see that the whole of Italy's industrial sector identifies by a large majority with the liberal-democratic alignment. [Guiglia] But industrialists would prefer Ciampi to Segni as prime minister. How do you explain that? [Segni] Ciampi deserves confidence, and this is obviously a possible result when an opinion survey is carried out in the financial and business environment -- that is, the very environment from which the former governor of the Bank of Italy himself came. However, leaving surveys and forecasts aside, the time has come to make things clear. For several weeks Ciampi has been presented as the ideal candidate of the PDS and the Democratic Alliance for the premiership. Hitherto the prime minister has said nothing about this suggestion, thus giving the impression that he might accept it and effectively playing into Occhetto's hands. But a prime minister that is the result of a majority different from that envisaged by Occhetto and that has a duty to remain impartial cannot remain silent. Before the 12 January parliamentary debate Ciampi has a duty to clarify whether he considers himself the candidate of the front headed by the PDS. And whether he considers his own political position compatible with that of the left-wing alliance. His silence on this point is no longer acceptable: It would be tantamount to believing that Ciampi has become Occhetto's "shadow candidate." A reply from the prime minister is crucial to the imminent parliamentary debate and the subsequent election campaign. [Guiglia] Actually Ciampi has already said that he does not want to stand as a candidate. Why is it so important that he repeat it? [Segni] Just a moment: Ciampi stressed that he does not want to stand as a parliamentary candidate, but he did not say that he does not want to be put forward as prime minister by one or another of the fronts. I would add that this clarification is essential for one simple reason: A possible "yes" to the PDS would bring about an unacceptable situation, because a prime minister brought in by a particular majority would become the candidate of the opposite font. I do not believe that Ciampi accepts this possibility. But he must say so. [Guiglia] One clarification deserves another: Who will guarantee that your "Pact" will remain an alternative to the PDS not only before the elections, but afterwards too? [Segni] I guarantee it, and we all guarantee it unequivocally in the very manifesto of the Pact, which was created as an alternative to the PDS and not in order to help Occhetto or with a view to governing with him. If we are victorious, we will govern. Otherwise we will engage in opposition and plan for a victory in the next elections. The Pact is the only national force that represents an alternative to the PDS. [Guiglia] Why is it that the PDS can ally with Communist Renaissance but the "Center" cannot do the same with the MSI [Italian Social Movement], which is in any case evolving into the National Alliance? [Segni] Because we are responsible, and the PDS is not. The first-past-the-post electoral law is not enough to make profound political and ideological differences disappear by magic. It is up to Occhetto to explain why his alliance with Communist Renaissance is supposedly modern and progressive and in what way he and [Communist Renaissance Chairman] Cossutta differ from the old PCI [Italian Communist Party]. I urge the friends of the Democratic Alliance to remember the inalienable principle -- no agreements with Communist Renaissance. Will they at least have the courage to break away? I hope that they will realize that the only reformist and liberal-democratic reality is that of the Pact. [Guiglia] But even the Pact is not immune from contradictions. You are in favor of national unity, but in Friuli you have "opened up" to the League. The League's Maroni has said that "an alliance is possible" with Segni. Is this a turnabout? [Segni] No, it is no turnabout. Perhaps some representatives of the Northern League are beginning to realize that their most extreme political stances are untenable. I hope that this will be understood first and foremost by the voters. [Guiglia] [Christian Democratic Party (DC) Secretary] Martinazzoli, Segni, [MSI Secretary] Fini, and [Northern League leader] Bossi say: Berlusconi can talk about politics, but it is better for him not to engage in politics personally. Are you afraid that "Rooting for Italy" could win over copious support from your moderate voters? [Segni] Frankly, no, I do not fear any problems of "competition," so to speak. I think that he can do a great deal for the liberal-democratic front -- but only if he keeps out of the arena. However, if he decides to become personally involved, he will ultimately increase the fragmentation. [Guiglia] Now that you are no longer a Christian Democrat, tell me honestly: Do you have the feeling of founding, as Martinazzoli is doing, a "People's Party" at the very time when the electoral law is prompting Catholics to divide between the progressive and moderate fronts? [Segni] I have always maintained that the presence of organized Catholics is essential. This presence will largely be oriented, almost automatically, toward the liberal-democratic area. The People's Party makes full sense within the broader alliance of the Pact. [Guiglia] Can President Scalfaro stay on after the elections or would it be better to replace the last figurehead of the First Republic? [Segni] According to the Constitution, the chief of state remains in office for seven years. I am in favor of full observance of our Constitution. [Guiglia] You have criticized Ciampi's latest economic package. Do you really think that the economic policy pursued by the prime minister could some day coincide with that advocated by Occhetto? [Segni] As governor of the Bank of Italy, Ciampi did a great service to the national economy -- apart, perhaps, from his desperate defense of the exchange rate in autumn 1992, which cost us a huge amount of currency. His international prestige has facilitated the recovery of Italy's credibility. But there are several points to be made about economic policy. First, we must not forget that the government that had the courage to reverse the trend toward the explosion of the public deficit was Amato's, which made sharp cuts, thus risking unpopularity. Ciampi could, and should, have continued along this path, reducing public spending. Has he done so? Frankly, not enough. The Finance Bill was presented to us in this light. But here we have another package worth 7 trillion lire and the announcement of another financial package after the elections, despite the reduction of interest rates. Clearly the promised reduction of expenditure has not happened, as confirmed by the interventions to salvage RAI [Italian State Broadcasting Corporation] and the administrative bodies of the government holding agencies. It is difficult to know to what extent this was the result of objective difficulties or of a decision in favor of a soft Finance Bill that could win Occhetto's approval. The Pact's philosophy is the opposite of this: The constraint on reducing public spending is that taxes must not increase by a single lira.
