FBIS4-48092 "drafr091_c_94015" FBIS-AFR-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 11 May South African Press Review for 11 May MB1105113094 MB1105113094 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Now Time for Tackling Reconstruction -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 11 May in a page-14 editorial says the inauguration ceremony of President Nelson Mandela and the accompanying festivities shows firstly, "the widespread and genuine interest which the international community takes in the reborn South Africa, and its anxiety to make it work." Secondly, it shows how "South Africans can put ancient differences aside to express a common joy and a common loyalty to the country." Thirdly, it shows that "even if South Africa's record in organising first-time all-race elections is a bit spotty, we can hold our own with anyone when it comes to staging a really five-star wing-ding." The editorial also says it hopes President Mandela, and everyone, "understands that this has to be the last of an unnatural run of non-working days. After this it's sleeves up and on with the tasks that lie ahead. Ours is a country that needs a lot of construction and reconstruction." Liberation Movement Lets Down Coloreds in Western Cape -- In an article on page 14, Frank Meintjies, who is a director of the community-based Development Program, and a former media spokesman of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, writes that "it is surprising that so many people are taken aback at the election outcome in the Western Cape where the predominantly colored electorate voted the National Party [NP] into regional power." Meintjies contends that it was not the NP that won colored support, but "perhaps it is the coloureds who can claim to have been let down by the parties in the `liberation movement' camp. The ANC for example: -- Failed to adequately answer concerns of coloured voters as to how affirmative action will apply. --Until recently, imposed a more Africanist political strategy in the Western Cape at the expense of the more pluralistic style of the UDF [United Democratic Front]. -- Hailed De Klerk a man of integrity even before he had apologised for excesses of apartheid." The liberation parties also "insisted on the 'so-called' prefix when using the word coloured. This was intended to undermine the classifications of apartheid; instead it fed coloureds' negative self-image." "In the end, the Western Cape coloured community -- without much else to go on -- turned to De Klerk, the sinner turned 'man of integrity'. Faced with uncertain times, they sought a home with the party they saw as culturally closer in terms of language and religion and understanding of their marginal position." As for the future of the colored people, Meintjies believes that in the short term colored people "will have to stand back in favour of the advancement of African people." BUSINESS DAY Opportunity To Generate Economic Growth -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 11 May in its page-16 editorial notes that economically, South Africa "has everything going for it -- and the presence of leaders from 160 countries illustrates this. And yet, confidence in our new-found national purpose remains fragile. The slide in out gold and foreign reserves need not be a worry if we remain on our present track, but it underscores the uncertainty of investors and businessmen whose decisions will determine whether South Africa's economy takes off or falters." BUSINESS DAY points out that aid packages and improved trade relations "will not solve our economic problems alone. Our own efforts will be far more important. We should not forget that aid and trade concessions are generally granted because they serve a donor nation's self-interest, not because of any innate generosity. While, for example, South Africa's precipitately negotiated access to the United States' Generalised System of Preferences is to be welcomed, we have not won terms any more favourable than those extended to most other developing countries. The new duty exemptions on 4,000-odd items announced last week should make a big difference to producers of those goods. But it does little more than bring us into line with most non-OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries, and leaves us less favoured, in terms of access to the U.S. market, than countries of South and Central America and Israel. Nevertheless, an opportunity has opened -- the opportunity to generate strong economic growth without fear of the foreign exchange constraints that nipped previous expansions in the bud." SOWETAN Call To Limit Availability of Guns -- "We hope the new Government will live up to its promise to limit the availability of guns in South Africa," declares a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 11 May. The paper calls for a curb on the "illegal inflow of guns from neighbouring states and the large number of weapons in the hands of rightwingers. For instance, efforts must be undertaken by the new National Defence Force to retrieve weapons issued to commando units."
