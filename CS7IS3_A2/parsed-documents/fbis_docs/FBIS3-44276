The negotiators have given themselves an extra three days to resolve a number of outstanding constitutional issues. The extension results from "technical problems" that have delayed the promulgation of the election expected on Friday. ANC negotator Mohammed Valli Moosa said the problems had nothing to do with the discussions involving the Alliance. Mr Valli Moosa said the ANC had given the Alliance a set of proposals which took into account most of its legitimate demands. The alliance wanted until Monday to take the proposals back to its principals. He said there was a possibility that the Alliance would accept the interim constitution even at this late stage. "The talks did not break down. Our proposals were not rejected out of hand. That indicates that the show is still on the road," Mr Valli Moosa said. He said the ANC's proposals were an attempt to come to terms with Alliance concerns about regional constitutional and fiscal powers. Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said the ANC and the Alliance remained at odds about the extent of powers of regional governments. He said talks had also been held with a kwaZulu royal delegation and that these could lead to a constitutional amendment involving the position of traditional leadership. The talks with the royal delegation and other talks with the Afrikaner Volksfront [AFV, Afrikaner National Front] were not necessarily interrelated, but the trilateral negotiators had taken note of earlier discussions on a Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland], he added. But the volkstaat issue had not been resolved, and a new hitch on the volkstaat issue had arisen, Mr Meyer said. AFV leader Gen Constand Viljoen left the meeting reportedly on his way to the Bophutatswana Embassy in Pretoria, where Alliance leaders were waiting to be briefed on the constitutional proposals presented by the ANC. SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reported this could be an indication that the Alliance was considering the proposals seriously.
