Administrative departments for industry and commerce and courts at all levels are authorized to investigate, handle and hear cases of trademark counterfeiting and infringement. Foreigners who think their trademark rights are being infringed upon can lodge their complaints with either the court or administrative authorities. "The system has proven efficient in resolving trademark disputes," Zhao Gang, an official with the trademark office under the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), told CHINA DAILY. Presently, SAIC has designated six offices to handle complaints from foreign enterprises. These include the Patent and Trademark Agency under the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, China Trademark Agency, Shanghai Patent Agency, China Patent Agent (Hong Kong) Ltd, NOD Patent and Trademark Agent Ltd and China Sinda Intellectual Property Agent Corporation. Professionals With professionals familiar with the country's laws and proficient at foreign languages, these offices are believed to save the time and energy of foreign trademark registrants. The SAIC is now designating more "representative offices" throughout the country, with priority given to the relatively developed coastal regions, said Zhao. Statistics show that administrative authorities for industry and commerce handle some 13,000 trademark cases annually, among which about 500 involve foreign trademarks. The SAIC and its local branches also undertake regular market supervision to stop trademark infringement in its early stage, said Zhao. This large amount of work is being done by some 6,000 full-time employees at the SAIC head office and local divisions. On the judicial front, the country's courts are playing an important role in protecting intellectual property rights including foreign trademarks. In large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, relevant departments have been set up at either the higher or intermediate courts for that purpose. And more can be expected in many coastal cities. Co-operation between the administrative authorities for industry and commerce and procuratorial departments are fruitful, Zhao said. Statistics from the SAIC show that in the last two years, the authorities have handed over more than 3,000 suspects to judicial offices, where the criminals have been sentenced. Zhao said infringement of intellectual property rights is almost omnipresent. In the West, many infringement cases deal with patents and copyright. Infringement of computer software copyright has been a decade-long headache in the United States. "China is willing to co-operate with foreign countries in protecting intellectual property," said the SAIC official. By the end of last year, the country had registered a total of 411,000 trademarks; nearly one-seventh of them belonged to foreign companies, a 10-fold increase over 1979. This indicates that foreign traders are confident about the country's economy and the protection of intellectual property rights in China, Liu Minxue, Director of SAIC, told a press conference last month. Convention Liu said his administration provides special protection to well-known trademarks in line with the Paris Convention for Protecting Industrial Property Rights. China joined the Convention in 1984. It also joined the Madrid International Registration in 1987, the Berne Convention and Universal Copyright Convention in 1992. At the press conference, Liu exposed 14 major cases involving the infringement of foreign trademarks registered in China. Most cases have to do with enterprises from the United States, including the Eastman Kodak Company, Levi Strauss Company and the Coca-Cola Company. China put into effect its first Trademark Law a decade ago. And the State revised the law and its implementing regulations last year to be in line with the market economy. According to the revised law, fines on trademark infringers have been raised from less than 20 percent to 50 percent of the total amount of the illegal trade volume or from twice to five times the illegal profits. The longest imprisonment term for trademark counterfeiters has been raised from three years to seven years. Several criminals involved in trademark infringement have been sentenced to death during the past few years in the country. The Patent Law, the Copyright Law and the Anti-Unethical Competition Law have also been promulgated during the past decade. Difficulties However, the SAIC admits to existing difficulties in implementing the laws. In some areas, the laws are not strictly carried out, SAIC officials say. They call for a unified organization to manage the protection of trademarks and improve work efficiency at local branches. As China is trying to resume its status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this year, its performance in protecting intellectual property is now one of the key focuses for GATT decision-makers.
