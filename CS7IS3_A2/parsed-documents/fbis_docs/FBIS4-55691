We asked Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec to assess the elections in Hungary: [Zieleniec] The Hungarian elections and their course and results reflect the complexity of the changes taking place in Central and East Europe. I think that the consistency of government policy in the Czech Republic will stand out better against these elections and also against the elections in the other countries of Central Europe. Although we have a distinct "plotted" course, a direction in which our state's transformation should proceed, we are also pursuing a policy that will not lead to social tension and social crises. I think that it is terribly important that the outlook, which a state undergoing our country's kind of transformation has, is clear and credible to the voter. On the other hand, the chosen path must be viable. And there are things a responsible politician must know how to balance. He must know how to maintain credibility even under the conditions of complex political decisionmaking, which concerns not only the far-off vision but also the immediate future. Perhaps this sounds a little like praising our policy to the skies. But, believe me, during the whole of the period I have been in politics, our discussions have always concentrated on how to go straight after our vision of society and, at the same time, maintain the prospect of realizing this vision. This means, among other things, conducting the kind of policy that will not bring about an upsurge in left-wing forces, especially the extreme left wing. [CESKY DENIK] The Hungarian elections, in which the socialists triumphed, will certainly mean a slowdown in the reforms in Hungary or, in any case, a shift from a more right-wing policy to a more left-wing one. We have already seen something like this in Poland and elsewhere to the east of our republic. Do you have the impression that we are now isolated? [Zieleniec] I would not say that we are isolated. I would like to emphasize one thing: The vision is important for us, as I have said, and we must measure our path toward it by our potential. It is the same for the parties now in power in Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia--their vision is important to them, and they are choosing the means to achieve it. From the short-term point of view--that is, for this day, month, and year--the differences between the Polish, the Slovak, and the Hungarian, and also, to a certain extent, our policies, do not have to be of a fundamental nature. Political differences tend to crop up in the longer-term outlook. If we take economic development, differences will perhaps crop up in two or four years, not in a few months. [CESKY DENIK] The differences between the states will not perhaps be of a fundamental nature, but our republic will obviously proceed faster in transformation than Poland or Hungary... [Zieleniec] This is the situation regardless. The principle methodical approach for our reform was always the endeavor to proceed as fast and as simply as possible. Speed is important because the faster we leave the transformation stage, the faster we rid ourselves of its burdens. Otherwise, there is a danger that these burdens will turn into an avalanche that will crash down on reform. Simplicity is important from the point of view of social acceptance of reform. It is possible to think up all sorts of complex privatization procedures that, in certain theoretical considerations, may be a bit more convenient. On the other hand, however, the transparency and intelligibility, for example, of coupon privatization have made it politically acceptable to our voters, as opposed to the very complicated, often dubious privatization schemes being applied in other countries. From this point of view, the policy of "quickly and simply" is a recipe we stand by.
