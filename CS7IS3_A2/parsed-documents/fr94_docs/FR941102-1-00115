Section 1079.61 is amended by revising the heading, introductory text, and paragraphs (a) and (e) to read as follows: §1079.61 Producer price differential. For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight for Zone 1. If the unreserved cash balance in the producer settlement fund to be included in the computation is less than 2 cents per hundredweight of producer milk on all reports, the report of any handler who has not made the payments required pursuant to §1079.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the producer price differential. The report of such handler shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until he has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the aforementioned conditions, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner: (a) Combine into one total for all handlers: (1) The values computed pursuant to §1079.60 (a)(1), (a)(2), and (b) through (j) for all handlers; (2) Add values computed pursuant to §1079.60 (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) and subtract the values obtained by multiplying the handlers' total pounds of protein and total pounds of other solids contained in such milk by their respective prices; and (3) Subtract the value obtained by multiplying the difference between the Class III price and the Class III-A price times the pounds of product determined pursuant to §1079.43(e); * * * * * (e) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents from the price computed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The result shall be known as the ``producer price differential.'' 7. Section 1079.62 is revised to read as follows: §1079.62 Announcement of producer prices.
