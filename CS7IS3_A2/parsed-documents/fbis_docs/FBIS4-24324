FBIS4-24324 "drafr126_e_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-126 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia ULIMO Faction Denies Stockpiling Weapons ULIMO Faction Denies Stockpiling Weapons AB2906150594 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 28 Jun 94 AB2906150594 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] The ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction in Liberia, headed by Alhaji Koromah, seems to be heading for a confrontation with ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] forces. On Saturday [25 June] the two sides exchanged fire in a shoot-out in a suburb of Brewerville. ECOMOG say they were forced to shoot back in self-defense. Then on Sunday, a cache of weapons was seized from Koromah's house in a joint raid by ECOMOG and Liberian Defense Ministry forces. ULIMO were protesting strongly about the raid, and say they have been singled out unfairly, and today their military spokesman, Kales Dumbuya, phoned us up from Monrovia to complain. On the line, Josephine Hazely asked Mr. Dumbuya what they were unhappy about. [Begin recording] [Dumbuya] The house of the national chairman is not something hidden; it is not somewhere hidden. We were rather surprised to see the ECOMOG going there to say that they are going to search. They once searched the place and the arms and ammunition that was there they were not hiding. They were open. The field commander has visited that area before with those arms there, so we were rather taken aback by the fact that they had to loot computers and money and other valuables from the house under the pretext that they have gone to search for arms. [Hazely] Why did you have that quantity of arms and ammunition in the residence of Alhaji Koromah? [Dumbuya] Those things are fallacies. They took only four arms from the chairman's residence, four arms with some ammunition that was to be used for the protection of the national chairman, a signatory to the Cotonou Accord. We were not.... [Hazely, interrupting] They say, the ECOMOG says that these arms were being moved to destabilize Monrovia. [Dumbuya] Josephine, that is another fallacy. That is fallacy to the large extent. There is nothing like moving on to Monrovia. We have kept these arms and ammunition for the protection of the national chairman. ECOMOG is aware of that. [Hazely] If you say the arms and the ammunition were for the protection of your chairman, Alhaji Koromah, how come you had so many? According to ECOMOG, they said they have seized 26,000 rounds of ammunition along with assault rifles, rocket propelled grenades and launchers, and communication sets. [Dumbuya] Josephine, that is another fallacy as I said. There was a communication set that ECOMOG and everybody was aware of, because when we want to contact the front we go to that communication set and contact the front. So it was not hidden, as I said. The arms and ammunition that was there, they were overstated. They were overstated to make us look bad. ECOMOG is aware that arms and ammunition were there in the chairman's compound. They have gone there. They have seen armed men holding them -- the two squad [word indistinct] protecting the national chairman of an organization that is signatory to the accord here, for Heavens sake. So there is nothing like having anything under our sleeves to attack Monrovia. What are we going to attack, to do what? [Hazely] But you realize also that the house of your chairman, Alhaji Koromah, was not the only one raided. Also they went to the home of Roosevelt Johnson. [Dumbuya] That is another fallacy. There is nothing like searching Roosevelt Johnson's house, and even if they really went around there, they gave him enough chance to move his arms and ammunition. They just gave him chance to move these things in the barracks, so I mean, don't let them fool you, my sister. [end recording]
