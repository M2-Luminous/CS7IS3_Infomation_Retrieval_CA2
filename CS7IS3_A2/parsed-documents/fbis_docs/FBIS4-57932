The diplomat and scholar, who has been Ministry spokesman since April, said his appointment was due to a "need that had been felt for a long time." The Foreign Ministry spokesman is virtually the only official of his kind in the Cuban Government. Alfonso said that during the meetings with reporters, he will brief them on the activities of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and other Ministry officials as well as comment on events in the area. He did not say, however, if officials in other ministries would assume a similar role. The Foreign Ministry spokesman began his duties in April during "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference, which was attended by Cuban officials and approximately 200 exiles. On that occasion, Alfonso was introduced as a conference spokesman, but in ensuing weeks he continued as spokesman for the Foreign Ministry's routine activities. The Ministry spokesman is a professor at the Higher Institute of International Relations and until last year was a member of the Cuban delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission based in Geneva, Switzerland.
