"We do not make visits conditional upon someone being released," the Cuban foreign minister told AFP upon arriving in Harare, the third leg of his African tour. He declared that he was not aware of Madrid's effort but added: "I believe there is someone interested in certain cases in Spain." "The Spanish leaders have enough relations and experience to know how we have studied and treated this type of case in recent years," Robaina continued. "First, it would be necessary for me to personally receive their request so I can later tell them what I think of it." Last Thursday, Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana gave Isabel Allende, Cuban deputy foreign relations minister, a list of prisoners accompanied by a request for their release. Allende is on a working tour of Spain.
