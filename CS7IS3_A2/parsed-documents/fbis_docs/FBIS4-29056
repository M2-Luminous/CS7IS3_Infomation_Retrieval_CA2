Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), distanced himself from bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno, who said Monday the economy has moved "one step toward a recovery." "I cannot confidently say the economy has entered a recovery phase, although I do feel much better about it," Terasawa said at a press conference after a morning cabinet meeting. He said he will wait before declaring an economic recovery, citing capital spending and foreign exchange rates as his main concerns. "My concerns will dissapear if capital spending firms up," Teresawa said.
