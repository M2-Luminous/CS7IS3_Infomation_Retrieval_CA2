FR941005-1-00029 FR941005-1-00006 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 51 [FRL&hyph;5082&hyph;1] Air Quality: Revision to Definition of Volatile Organic Compounds_Exclusion of Volatile Methyl Siloxanes and Parachlorobenzotrifluoride AGENCY: Envrionmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to revise EPA's definition of volatile organic compounds (VOC) for purposes of preparing State implementation plans (SIP's) to attain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone under title I of the Clean Air Act (Act) and for the Federal implementation plan (FIP) for the Chicago ozone nonattainment area. This revision adds parachlorobenzotrifluoride (PCBTF) and volatile methyl siloxanes (VMS) to the list of compounds excluded from the definition of VOC on the basis that these compounds have negligible contribution to tropospheric ozone formation. In the final rules section of this Federal Register, the EPA is approving this definition revision as a final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the final rule. If no adverse comments or requests for a public hearing are received in response to the final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments or requests for public hearing on the final rule, the final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The 30 day comment period established by this notice will be the only comment period instituted by EPA. Any requests for extensions of the comment period will be considered. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested in commenting on this notice should do so at this time. DATES: Comments may be submitted until November 4, 1994. Requests for a public hearing must be received by November 4, 1994.
