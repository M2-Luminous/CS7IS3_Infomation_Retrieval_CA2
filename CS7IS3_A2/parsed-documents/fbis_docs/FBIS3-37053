He has arrived at the city on the Neva at the head of a group of LDPR deputies of the Russian parliament. He asserted that the LDPR was already prepared to form a new government since it "did not need to look for candidates for the top posts". In his characteristic manner, the LDPR chairman warned journalists that they would be held responsible for attacks on his party and for discrediting its program and methods of work. He also threatened to take their television and radio microphones and their newspapers. In order to strengthen the position of the LDPR, its leader again tried to exploit the problem of the position of the Russian-speaking population in the republics of the former USSR and also the foreign political aspects of the party's activities. In particular, Zhirinovskiy stated that he viewed relations with Japan and India as priorities. India, he asserted, "is prepared to feed and clothe the whole of Russia if it is allowed to have the products of the St. Petersburg military industrial complex."
