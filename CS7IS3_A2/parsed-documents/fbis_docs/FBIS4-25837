The province will also hold an exhibition of poverty-relief achievements made in the mountainous areas in the past ten years. Guangdong has 50 mountainous counties, making up 65 percent of the whole territory of the province and 42 percent of the province's population, and among which 31 counties are below the poverty level. To help these areas shake off poverty, the provincial government has granted broad preferential treatment to the most destitute areas. From 1985 to 1993, the total agricultural and industrial product value of the 50 mountainous counties has increased by four times and the average annual income of the farmers has doubled to 1,250 yuan. The investment environment of the mountainous areas has also been vastly improved in the past few years. Several railroads and highways have been built across the areas. Roads through the 50 mountainous counties now total 33,000 km. Meanwhile, all 50 counties have installed program-controlled telephones. These areas are also rich in labor and natural resources, such as forests, minerals, rocks and hydropower.
