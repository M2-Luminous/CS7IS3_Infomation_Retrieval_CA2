The Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), which declared a 48-hour strike beginning on 18 May, also reject the governmental plan, which must be studied by the (unicameral) Congress this week. Local authorities confirmed a large number of protesters peacefully occupied the Ibarra Cathedral this morning in the capital of Imbabura Province, 75 km from Quito. The peasants and Indians presented a manifesto asking the church to mediate to ensure the government withdraws its agrarian restructuring plan. They reported the government is trying to implement a "privatization wave" and "to eliminate the right to own land, the communal properties of the Indian peoples, and the agrarian reform law." In this document, the protesters demanded the deputies reject the governmental project, because it is "unconstitutional and antidemocratic and represents the interests of a small group of large landowners." Meanwhile, members of the Imbabura Indian and Peasant Federation and other similar organizations blocked the roads in the northern part of the country. The police maintained they controlled the protests without any incidents. The Conaie followed through on its call to hold a number of protests on 18 and 19 May. The Indian and peasant organizations that oppose the agrarian project even warned they would promote an "uprising" that could halt the country. Obstructing the transportation of products from the countryside to the cities, blocking roads, and staging nationwide street protests are among the first actions of the "preventive" event organized by Conaie. The protests include a gathering in front of the National Congress in Quito. The main Ecuadoran workers union, the United Workers Front (FUT), the Teachers National Union, and student and public employees organizations today announced they will support the Indian and peasant uprising. The National Congress, which must issue a ruling at the latest on 19 May, must analyze the controversial agrarian project. Meanwhile, the Duran-Ballen administration stated it will go on with the modernization project and warned it will take the necessary steps to maintain peace and order in the country.
