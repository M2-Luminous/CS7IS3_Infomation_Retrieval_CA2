The terroristic and shattering incident which resulted from the Monafeqin [hypocrites--pejorative term for Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, MKO] planting a bomb in the holy shrine of the eighth imam, peace be upon him, which has resulted in over 100 martyred and injured, has greatly wounded the religious and human sensitivities of the Iranian people and the Muslims of the world. It has generated a wave of abhorrence among the people and the officials and is being condemned at home and abroad. The question that arises here is: What was the objective behind this unprecedented crime? Why did the cold-hearted Monafeqin choose a holy site such as the hallowed shrine of Imam Reza--peace be upon him--for this crime and why violate its sanctity? According to political observers, the firm bond between the people and the Islamic system is the most important objective that the criminals have targeted in this latest atrocity. Right from the onset of the [Iranian] sixties decade, when the misanthropic visage of the Monafeqin was revealed, the bond between the devout Muslim people of Iran and the Islamic system has constantly been the target of their attacks. However, due to the popular bias of the Islamic system which is endowed with an extensive popular base as well, all the plots of the Monafeqin against this system were foiled. Following the demise of Imam Khomeyni, the great leader of the Islamic Revolution--may God's peace be upon him--the powers of world arrogance have sought to drive a wedge between the people and the Islamic system by resuming their plots. The grand ceremonies on the anniversary of the demise of the imam a few weeks ago and the extensive support and allegiance of the people for the lofty status of the Velayat-e Faqih [supreme jurisconsult], once again inflicted defeat on the powers of world arrogance. Failure to undermine or change the course of the Islamic Revolution has aroused the ire of the powers of world arrogance and its hypocrite agents to the extent that on the anniversary of Husayn's 'Ashura [tenth day of Moharram, when Prophet Muhammad's grandson, Husayn, was martyred], they attacked a group of mourning people of Iran in the holiest site in our country. This atrocity, however distasteful, has been endured with Husayn-like revolutionary fortitude by the Muslim people of Iran. Similar crimes by the blind-hearted [kurdel] Monafeqin, which include their attacks on worshipers at Friday congregations, the martyring of some Friday imams and people, have not been able to disrupt the bond between the people and the system. On the contrary, these crimes have served to further consolidate this bond and thus to disgrace the enemies of the people and Islam, more than ever.
