As Bonn's Transportation Ministry spokesman Veit Steinle reported on Monday [21 February], transit traffic is a European problem. The Federal Government realizes Switzerland's special traffic situation, but a purely national solution cannot be justified. The Transportation Ministry, however, does not think that current transit traffic in Switzerland is endangered by the referendum. There is a treaty binding under international law according to which truck transit has been guaranteed since 1993 for another 12 years. However, the EU bodies have to deal soon with the result of the referendum, it was stated. Michael Mueller, environmental policy spokesman of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] Bundestag Group, said the result of the Swiss referendum is a victory for ecological reason. The SPD Group called on the Federal Government to support the "Alpine Initiative" and follow it by reorienting its traffic policy. The vote also met with agreement from ecologically oriented groups.
