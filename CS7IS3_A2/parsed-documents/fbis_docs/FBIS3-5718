The author of the article notes: Keeping independence in foreign relations means to establish and develop relations with other countries on the basis of complete equality and mutual respect for sovereignty, to fully exercise sovereignty in external relations and to resolve all the questions by one's own judgement and decision in the interests of the revolution in one's country. Adhering to independence in foreign relations is a fundamental principle that must be maintained consistently, first of all, because independence is the life and soul of a country and a nation. Independence is the first criterion of an independent and sovereign state. If a country acts under the baton of others, losing independence, it cannot be called an independent and sovereign state, though it has power. If independence is ignored in foreign relations, unequal relations of domination and subjugation appear and the sovereignty of the country and the nation is encroached upon and violated. Keeping independence in foreign relations is a fundamental principle that must be consistently maintained next because only when independence is maintained can a successful contribution be made to the cause of global independence, the common cause of mankind. An independent world is one free from domination and subjugation, interference and pressure, a world where all the countries and nations fully exercise the sovereignty as masters of their destiny. If the people of each country are to contribute to the realization of global independence as a member of the international community, they must always adhere to independence in foreign relations. Only then there will be in the world neither commanding and submitting countries nor ruling and ruled nations, and full equality and freedom of the countries and nations will be ensured. The main target of the struggle for making the world independent is the imperialists and other dominationist forces. If all the countries and nations firmly maintain independence, totally reject all forms of interference of outside forces and do not dance to other's tune nor blindly follow others, dominationism will become impotent and strong-arm action and the baton will not work.
