Early yesterday morning, the seven-party coalition finally reached an agreement on the basic policy to be pursued by the new cabinet. It was decided that Tsutomu Hata, currently deputy prime minister and foreign minister, will succeed Hosokawa as prime minister. The post, which had gone unfilled for two weeks, was finally manned. After repeated considerations, the ruling coalition still decided to select Hata. It is expected that when the two houses of the Diet vote next week, the opposition Liberal Democratic Party will nominate its leader Kawano to contend for the post, but it is certain that Hata will win majority support in parliament. In the past two weeks, the Japanese political situation has been volatile, and political disputes have arisen again and again. The main problem is that the ruling coalition did not reach agreement on the basic policy it will pursue in the future. When the bickering became fierce, those involved even threatened to break with each other. The seven political parties within the ruling coalition are divided into two major factions. One faction is the mainstream faction headed by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] (Hata, Ozawa) and Komeito (Ichikawa), and the other faction is the non-mainstream faction formed by the Social Democratic Party (Kubo), the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Sakigake [Harbinger] party's Masayoshi Takemura (chief secretary in Hosokawa's cabinet). The two sides refused to concede on two major issues, namely, the new cabinet's tax policy and nuclear developments in Korea. In the end they made reciprocal concessions to each other in consideration of their overall interests and an instant split was prevented. At present, the consensus reached by the ruling coalition on the taxation issue is an agreement to reduce direct taxes, improve or remove current consumption taxes, and greatly increase indirect taxes while calling for the nation's understanding. The Social Democratic Party originally strongly opposed the option of substantially raising indirect taxes and held that this meant no tax reduction at all. It insisted that the new taxation system must be endorsed by the nationals. At present, the compromise is: The new taxation system being endorsed by the nationals is changed into "being understood by the nationals," and the bill concerned will be formulated by June this year. As for the issue of nuclear development in Korea, both sides also reached a compromise. They agreed that according to the specifications of the Japanese Constitution, preparations be made against emergencies, and "close coordination be made with the United States and the ROK" and at the same time "cooperation be carried out with the Asian countries concerned if necessary." The Social Democratic Party originally stressed "cooperation between Japan and China" on the Korean issue and opposed Japan's participation in sanctions against Korea. It worried that Japan might follow the United States, and once U.S. forces carried out a maritime blockade against Korea, the Japanese Self-Defense Force would support U.S. military action from the rear. Because the United States and Japan have signed a security treaty, if the United States acts recklessly, Japan could be entangled by events. Shinseito's Ozawa proposed that Japan should take part in military missions by the United Nations. This evoked an outcry in society. Therefore, the Korean "nuclear mystery" is very sensitive in Japan. Because of the U.S.-Japan security treaty, if the United States or the United Nations takes action, Japan will have to make a choice. Since Clinton took office, the United States has often overreacted to some local disputes in the world. Clinton once mentioned the option of taking preemptive action on Korea's nuclear mystery, and this has naturally aroused Japan's nervousness, causing the Social Democratic Party to call for cooperation with China. After Hata takes office, the weak points of the Hosokawa cabinet and such serious issues as political reform, the new taxation policy, Japanese-U.S. trade frictions, the new budget, and stimulating domestic demand will all be put before the new cabinet. It is expected that the Hata cabinet's workload will be no less arduous.
