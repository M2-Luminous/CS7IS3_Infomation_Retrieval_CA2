[Basyuni] Good morning. [Abu-al-Majd] The timing of Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa's visit to Israel is significant. It is part of extensive Egyptian activity to promote the Middle East peace process and coincides with the start of Arab-Israel talks in Washington. What were the results of this visit? [Basyuni] Actually it was a successful visit, during which all the outstanding problems concerning the borders, crossing points, the area of Jericho, security arrangements and movement on the roads in Gaza were reviewed. [Abu-al-Majd] Specifically, was there any response from Israel on meeting the Palestinians' demands as far as these issues are concerned? [Basyuni] There is response from both sides, because both are doing their best to overcome the difficulties. Thus, there is a mutual desire to reach an agreement. It is not an easy problem. The path is not strewn with roses, but is full of problems. But with effort, perseverance, and mutual desire, Egypt is trying to reach solutions satisfactory to both sides. The problem has persisted for a very long time, and we are trying to find a solution to it so that we can start implementing the agreement and begin the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Then, the Palestinian authorities can begin to assume power on the ground. [Abu-al-Majd] Minister Musa naturally has brought back Israel's views to convey to President Mubarak and the Palestinian leadership... [Basyuni, interrupting] Minister Musa has managed to bring the views closer over the crossing points themselves and the procedures to be followed there, while maintaining the dignity of the Palestinians passing through them. He discussed very minute and complicated details and tried to solve these problems; he discussed the best way to cross, and how to increase the area of Jericho as much as possible. All these issues were discussed in detail by Minister Musa. [Abu-al-Majd] You said Minister Musa was successful in his discussions of these issues. What tangible effect this will have? [Basyuni] Both sides accept the Egyptian views. As you know, we are not negotiating on behalf of the Palestinians or Israelis. We are trying to bridge the gap in views, offer new ideas, and use our past negotiating, security, and administration experience to give advice and try to overcome the problems in a bid to achieve the desired goal. As for the talks themselves, president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres will resume them in Switzerland on Saturday night [29 January]. [Abu-al-Majd] Let us move to the Israeli-Syrian track and Rabin's proposal to hold a referendum on withdrawal from the Golan. How do the Israeli parliamentarians and ordinary people view this proposal? [Basyuni] Actually I do not want to interfere in Israel's internal affairs or political map. I will give you my own personal views. Proposing a referendum is very shrewd. The objective is to gain the support of those who object to a withdrawal from the Golan, whether they are from the ruling coalition or the opposition. Concerning the ruling coalition, there are approximately seven Labor MK's [Knesset members] who object to full withdrawal from the Golan. There are also six MK's from the Shas religious movement who back the government but are not part of it. Rabin said that should an agreement involving a major withdrawal from the Golan or abandonment of settlements be reached, he would opt for a referendum. This means that Prime Minister Rabin intends to take steps and make decisions that go far beyond the Labor Party's electoral program. Thus, his promising a referendum indicates that the decisions he is about to make will far exceed the electoral program. In such a case, the opposition cannot continue to object to a full withdrawal from the Golan until an agreement is reached, because Mr. Rabin promised he would opt for a referendum if an agreement involving a substantial withdrawal from the Golan is reached [sentence as heard]. I believe that if an agreement is reached, it will be a package deal based on a comprehensive solution. By this I mean that it will not be an agreement with Syria alone, but there will also be an agreement with Lebanon, Jordan, as well as on full self-rule for the Palestinians. Thus, Israeli citizens will be voting in a referendum on a comprehensive peace deal -- full peace with Syria, with Jordan, with Lebanon, and full self-rule, as well as mutually acceptable security arrangements in exchange for their full withdrawal from the Golan and the other occupied Arab territories.
