Zheng Bijian said: It is very important to energetically strengthen the ties with social sciences, literature and art, and press and publication circles because we all shoulder a common historical responsibility, that is, to carry out the following four tasks forwarded by Comrade Jiang Zemin: "to arm the people with scientific theory, to guide the people with correct public opinion, to mold the people with noble spirit, and to encourage the people with fine works." We should stress the importance of spiritual civilization construction. In the light of the new historical stage our country has entered in our drive of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization and in consideration of the unprecedentedly severe competition of the overall national strength in the world including spiritual and cultural strength, such contacts, communication, and friendship become even more important. "The most important thing for cultivating friendship lies in understanding other's feeling." The Propaganda Department will try to "make friends with more people by winning their hearts." It will try its best to help them solve difficulties and problems existing in their work and daily life. Liu Zhongde, deputy head of the Propaganda Department and minister of culture, also spoke at the meeting. He said: We are living a great historical period. Propaganda and cultural workers should perform their duties commensurate with the great epoch. We should spare no efforts to achieve this goal.
