The ROK ranks among the 10 leading trading powers in the world and, in some economic sectors, is even a serious competitor to the West. Furthermore, a number of experts believe that South Korea's experience is more appropriate for Russia than America's or Europe's. If you take into account the geographical proximity of Russia to South Korea, too, it is perfectly possible to talk about the highly favorable opportunities for cooperation between the two countries. Despite that fact, business contacts between Moscow and Seoul have been developing less successfully than expected after the establishment of diplomatic relations in September 1990. And the plans were ambitious. The sides gave each other most-favored nation trading status, established telegraph and telex communications, and opened direct air communication between the capitals and sea communication between Vladivostok and Pusan. As a result trade turnover increased rapidly. However, in 1992 it had already begun to decline and in 1993 South Korea's total volume of trade with the CIS countries amounted to just $2 billion. Russia, meanwhile, exports mainly raw materials and the South Koreans, despite having a high regard for its high-tech goods, are in no hurry to buy them. As a result, a series of highly promising projects have not been implemented. For example, Hyundai and Lucky Goldstar International proposed taking part in oil exploration work in Kalmykia, in laying an oil pipeline from Yakutia via the DPRK to South Korea and China, in modernizing the Izhorskiy Plant in Leningrad Oblast, and in investing $53 million to create a number of joint ventures with Soviet partners. In addition, there was a proposal to build a business center and a large hotel in the region of Nakhodka and Vladivostok ($50 million) and a polypropylene plant in Tobolsk ($30 million), and to develop a coal mine in the settlement of Yelginskiy ($200 million). And so on. Now Seoul's decision to allocate the former USSR $3 billion is viewed in South Korea as a mistake by the then President No Tae-u. And part of that money remains frozen. This topic was discussed at the Institute of the Far East and the following aspect was noted. When it established official contact with us, the ROK expected that Moscow would be able to put pressure on the DPRK in the ROK's interests. Seoul would also have been happy if Russia had made a statement on the USSR's involvement in the launching of the Korean War of 1950-1953. But those hopes were not fulfilled and interest in Russia began to wane. "Life shows that mutual relations with Seoul cannot be built without taking into account Pyongyang's opinion," Roald Savelyev, acting director of the Center for Korean Studies, believes. "Bias in favor of one of the partners could weaken our position in the region as a whole." Roald Vasilyevich stresses in this regard that observing balance in mutual relations with the two Koreas is especially important for Russia. Take, for instance, timber procurement work in the Far East. For a long time North Korea's forestry workers treated our timber reserves quite barbarically. Thus it was decided to entrust this work to the South Koreans. The logic behind it was this: The South has more sophisticated timber felling techniques and has a more solicitous attitude to nature. That was indicated by the following fact: Just previously the ROK leadership had suspended the activity of Dusan Elektro Matriyel [name as transliterated], a leading firm in the microelectronics and computer industry, for dumping over 300 tonnes of phenol in the Naktong River. A country which takes such care to protect the natural environment, it was thought, will set a good example to all timber producers. In fact it all proved otherwise. The international environmental organization Greenpeace, which monitored the work of the South Koreans, sounded the alarm: Russia's forests are still being plundered. Of course, facts such as these are not meant for analysis at top level. We have the relevant articles in the criminal law which are supposed to prevent excesses of this kind. But the example is instructive. It testifies eloquently how dangerous illusions can be. Political confusion also slowed down the construction of the oil pipeline from Yakutia via North Korea to South Korea. Pyongyang took a highly negative view of the fact that the USSR established diplomatic relations with Seoul. As a result the North Koreans sharply curbed their relations with us. Moscow played its part here, too, which led to the creation of a certain tension on the borders and in the region as a whole. Today Russian diplomats tend to blame it all on the USSR Foreign Ministry. However, in recent years they themselves have been pursuing the same line. "Our interests, first and foremost the interests of security," Roald Savelyev says, "demand very precise and verified actions in dealings with the two Korean states. Yes, Pyongyang has North Korean interests to care about, Seoul has South Korean interests. But Moscow too must defend Russia's national interests. In the past we gave the North strenuous support in the spirit of internationalism but then we began to support the South equally determinedly. And as a result we reduced our ties with Pyongyang without acquiring new ones with Seoul." The breakdown in economic relations was especially painful for us, my interlocutor believes. We built quite a few industrial facilities in North Korea, including battery-production and miniature electric motor plants, in the expectation of receiving output for our own needs. Now the agreements have been suspended and in Russia there is a shortage of vehicle spares, miniature motors, and many other products. Are improvements possible? Undoubtedly. For that to happen, in the opinion of our experts, it is necessary to remove the seat of tension on our borders where there is permanent confrontation, not just political but military, too. There is a 35,000 strong U.S. corps in the South, and Patriot missiles are being brought in there now. There are also disputes over Pyongyang's nuclear program. The unification of the two countries, not as "total" as in Germany, of course, would lead to an improvement in the situation in the region. But even before that Russia must not lose the positions that it has won both in the north and the south of the Korean Peninsula. I should like to hope that Kim Yong-sam's forthcoming visit will take place in the spirit of the establishment of truly equal and mutually beneficial relations. There is a Korean proverb: "They dug the well together, but only one drinks." We must make sure that we are not the partner who is left out.
