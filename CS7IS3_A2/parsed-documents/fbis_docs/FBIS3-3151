Speaking at a press conference, Li said that China has no difficulty servicing its debt. Liu said that China's state foreign debts amounted to 80 billion U.S. dollars, while its annual exports come to over 100 billion U.S. dollars. The ratio of its total debts to its annual export value stands at 90 percent and its debt service ratio, 7.6 percent. Both are much lower than international warning levels. China has always had a good credit rating since it began implementing an open policy, he said. Though China will incur a domestic debt of more than 100 billion yuan this year, Liu was optimistic about a prospective treasury bond issue to pay the debt. He said last year's difficulty in selling treasury bonds was caused by a financial disorder and an irrational fund flow. After rectifying measures were taken, the financial order has turned around. This year, he said, the state will offer a preferential interest rate on bonds and improve the methods of their issue. Bonds will be mainly underwritten by dealers of financial institutions. The state will also adopt measures to enable individuals to trade bonds at any time. "Therefore, the issue will go ahead smoothly," he said. The finance minister said that China will adopt two measures to reduce deficits. First, it will control the scale of capital construction; second, the central government will increase its revenues through implementing a newly-introduced tax-revenue-sharing system. However, it will be a long time before the government can eliminate deficit. In two or three years to come, the scale of domestic debts may remain relatively big, he admitted. He also said that, as the bankruptcy law has come into force, banks have set aside bad-debt reserve to reduce financial subsidies to enterprises running at a loss. But, the state treasury will continue to subsidize those enterprises that suffer losses because of policy reasons.
