According to him, the first delivery of the "super" dinar is expected during the day, in sufficient quantities for the pensions of about 70,000 Montenegrin pensioners. [passage omitted] Mirko Paroski, the manager of the central post office in Novi Sad, has said that postmen could not distribute pensions to more than 15,000 pensioners today because the Financial Transaction Service has not yet sent out the new dinars. The service should have sent out 585,000 new dinars today and tomorrow. Consequently, Paroski says, the post office will only start delivering pensions tomorrow. [passage omitted] The new dinars have not yet appeared in the busiest post office in Belgrade either, and the payment of pensions has been postponed until further notice, a TANJUG reporter was told today by Milan Radulovic, the manager of the Belgrade-3 post office. According to him, transactions in old dinars function as normal. [passage omitted] The initial implementation of the federal government's new measures failed to meet the expectations in eastern Serbia too. This is the inevitable conclusion resulting from reports from commercial banks in Zajecar, Bor, Pozarevac, and Smederevo, which stress that this morning they could not pay part of January pensions due to a shortage of cash.
