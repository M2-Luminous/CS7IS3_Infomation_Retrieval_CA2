Perhaps this was justified by certain circumstances and by bilateral relations that did not require constant contact in order to be developed. Moreover, the political situation in Iraq at that time allowed it to achieve successes at the UN because of the Iranian rejection of any peaceful settlement to the Iraqi-Iranian conflict. This is in addition to the fact that most other countries understood Iraq's stand, except for major and Western countries, which had selfish interests and sought to prolong the conflict on the ground, taking advantage of the United Nations as a political forum that provided them with an opportunity to avoid a peaceful solution. This is similar to the present situation, but with a different form and method aimed at keeping Iraq in its current situation for the longest time possible so that these countries can meet their agenda in the region. This was clear in their alternating support for Iraq and for Iran. It is also obvious that the means available to Iraq at the time were no longer available after 2 August 1990 and the subsequent barbaric aggression against Iraq. On the contrary, the United Nations became a field for political confrontation against Iraq, through the use of all its institutions, as a main tool to break the will of and destroy Iraq. This restricted the role of Iraq in terms of influencing these institutions and the UN member states because of U.S., Western, and Zionist hegemony. This fact led to the conclusion that all of Iraq's efforts at the international organization's level would not achieve their objectives even though Iraq mobilized all legal, political, and factual arguments to support their case. In light of this situation, I believe that Iraq should no longer deem it enough to work with the United Nations alone -- although this is something that has been imposed on Iraq and Iraq has been given no other choice. In order to support and render its work a success, Iraq should intensify its bilateral contacts, not only with UN member states, but also with all countries of influence within their particular geographical groups, based on a plan created by the Foreign Ministry. If this is achieved and we are able to realize tangible progress in those relations that were greatly harmed, then our stand in the United Nations will improve and our proposals and views will have an effect on friends and just nations. This is especially true if we take into consideration that the current international situation has changed and that there has been an emergence of many countries that could express their viewpoint in a manner different than that during the Kuwait crisis. I note, regrettably, that we have ignored our continuing ties with our friends. Our moves were confined to certain periods of time, after which we forgot about such moves until major events on the level of our relation with the United Nations occurred. Even if we made a move toward one of these nations, such a move basically ended up in New York because we did not have many ambassadors in many important countries that could have influence on a case such as ours. Based on my study of the developments in countries' stands toward us, I find it appropriate that the Foreign Ministry's action plan should cover many fronts: Within the framework of inter-Arab relations, it is necessary to continue our contacts with the countries whose stands toward us continue to be relatively positive. As for the Gulf countries, it has become clear to every observer that there has been a change in their stands toward Iraq. Some are even publicly announcing their stands and their sympathy with us without any fear from the media. These developments should be an incentive for us to intensify and broaden our contacts with these countries. We also find that stands on the international level are tangibly improving. Even though it did not make a declared stand exactly as we wanted, Britain is no longer raising the banner against Iraq as it did before. Mr. Tariq 'Aziz's meeting with the British ambassador at the Security Council may not be considered a bad step. What applies to Britain also applies on other European countries, including France, Italy, Spain, and former socialist states, led by Russia. If we are able to reach out to these countries and talk to them in the language of interests that they understand, then I am confident that we can reach good results. It is important not to restrict our moves toward certain countries. There are countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America that have influence in the international arena and at the same time have economic interests and problems that Iraq can help solve.
