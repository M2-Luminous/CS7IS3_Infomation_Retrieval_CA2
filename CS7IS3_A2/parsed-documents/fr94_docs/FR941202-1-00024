FR941202-1-00024 FR941202-1-00004 Awards Based on a Percentage of Salary Commentators have raised the question whether a compensation formula based on a percentage of salary or base pay involves impermissible discretion to increase the amount payable under the formula upon attainment of the goal because, by increasing salary, the amount payable may be increased after the goal has been established. Section 1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(iii) has been amended to provide that, if the terms of an objective formula or standard fail to preclude discretion merely because the amount of compensation to be paid upon the attainment of the performance goal is based, in whole or in part, on a percentage of salary or base pay, the objective formula or standard will not be considered discretionary (and thus §1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(iii) will not be violated) if the maximum dollar amount to be paid is fixed at the time the performance goal is established. Of course, a formula or standard based on salary or base pay might fail to meet the requirements of §1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(iii) for reasons other than the fact that the formula or standard is based on salary or base pay. If that is the case, the relief described in the preceding paragraph will not prevent the performance goal from failing to meet the requirements of §1.162&hyph;27(e)(2). A conforming amendment has been made to §1.162&hyph;27(e)(4)(i) to provide that, when the amount to be paid is based on a percentage of salary or base pay, the material terms of a performance goal that must be disclosed to shareholders include the maximum dollar amount that could be paid. Earnings on Deferred Performance-Based Compensation In the case of a deferral of a payment of compensation beyond the date on which it would otherwise be payable, §1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(iii)(B) provides that an increase in the amount of the compensation is not treated as an increase in the amount payable under the performance goal if the increase in compensation is based on a reasonable rate of interest. (Of course, this rule assumes there is no constructive receipt of the compensation at the time it is deferred.) Commentators have asked whether this deferral rule also applies to increases in compensation that are determined on reasonable bases other than by reference to a rate of interest. The purpose of the rule is generally to permit a reasonable adjustment in the amount of compensation to account for the delay in payment. Consequently, the rule is amended to permit the adjustment to be based on the actual rate of return on a predetermined investment (including any decrease as well as any increase in the value of an investment) during the deferral period (whether or not assets associated with the amount originally owed are actually invested therein). New Examples 14, 15, and 16 have been added to illustrate the application of this rule. Impact of Corporate Transactions on Performance Goals Section 1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(vi) provides that compensation attributable to a stock option or stock appreciation right does not fail to be performance-based to the extent that a change in the grant or award is made to reflect changes in corporate capitalization. In response to commentators' suggestions that this relief for changes in corporate capitalization be expanded, the current provision has been expanded to apply to all stock-based compensation, not only to stock options and stock appreciation rights. Thus, the provision has been moved to new §1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(iii)(C). In addition, new Example 13 in §1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(vii) indicates that the adjustment of a performance goal to reflect a change in accounting standards will not be considered an exercise of impermissible discretion, provided that the adjustment is made pursuant to the terms of the plan or arrangement. Clarification of Rule Viewing All Plans and Agreements in the Aggregate Section 1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(iv) provides that all plans, arrangements, and agreements that provide for compensation to an employee will be taken into account for purposes of determining whether, under the facts and circumstances, compensation is only nominally or partially contingent on attainment of a performance goal. Compensation is only nominally or partially contingent on attainment of a performance goal if the employee will receive all or part of the compensation regardless of whether the performance goal is attained. Section 1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(v) provides that the determination of whether compensation satisfies the requirements of §1.162&hyph;27(e)(2), and thus is performance-based, is made on a grant-by-grant basis.
