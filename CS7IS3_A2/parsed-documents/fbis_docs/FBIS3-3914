The film "Ghost in the Painting" [hua huan 3973 7609] was never approved, although it was revised many times. Its showing could have been allowed had the segments containing nudity been removed. The film "Red" [hong fen 4767 4720], a co-production between a mainland film company and one from Hong Kong, was a story adapted from a novel under the same title by Su Tong. Based on a novel under the same title, the Guangdong Zhongshan Television Arts Center had originally planned to make "White Deer Wilderness" [bai lu yuan 4101 7773 0626] into three films and 40 television shows. Since the film had many depictions of sex acts, the plan was finally dropped after the filmmaker was "internally dissuaded from making it." The film "Jinpingmei" [jin ping mei 6855 3910 2734], a 40-part television series approved by the Jilin Broadcast and Television Department and to be made by the Jilin Culture Department, was banned because it contained a great deal of sex, which presented a very difficult situation from the visual perspective, although the film is based on a classical Chinese work and is of a very high academic value. If the film totally avoided the topic, it would not be the real "Jinpingmei." If it depicted the story as it is written, it would be unsuitable to China's national conditions or as a television series and a film. A certain film-making unit in Anhui had planned to produce the "Sai Jinhua," which depicts the sex life of deluxe brothels during the Qing Dynasty. As the news got around, their film-making license was immediately revoked by the relevant authorities.
