FR940606-1-00039 FR940606-1-00008 (a) Aqueous. Aqueous cleaners contain at least 80 percent water, are non-flammable and non-combustible, and are completely soluble in water. Other components may include corrosion inhibitors, alkalinity builders, organic surfactants, and bioenzyme mixtures and nutrients depending on the desired soil removal properties. Aqueous cleaners have been used in non-critical areas where strict cleanliness requirements do not have to be met, or where there are no confined spaces that may trap residues of the cleaner. (b) Hydrocarbon-Based. Hydrocarbon-based cleaners are nonsemi-aqueous cleaners that are composed of a mixture of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons. These cleaners have a maximum vapor pressure of 7 mm Hg at 20 ○C (3.75 in. H 2 O at 68 ○F) and contain no HAP or ozone depleting compounds. (c) Non-chemical. Several aerospace facilities have demonstrated the viability of using non-chemical methods such as dry media blasting for cleaning operations. These methods are typically used to remove dry, scale-like deposits such as carbon residue on engine components. Dry media blasting can usually be used only on components that can withstand the force of blasting without deformation. b. Equipment changes. The aerospace industry has implemented several equipment changes that directly reduce the level of HAP emissions. While there are equipment changes that affect emissions from every process, the three changes predominantly used in the industry are high transfer efficiency spray guns, enclosed spray gun cleaners, and proportional paint mixers. Each of these equipment changes are discussed below. (1) High transfer efficiency spray guns. Emissions from spray coating operations can be reduced through the use of spraying systems with higher transfer efficiency than conventional spray guns. Transfer efficiency, expressed as a percentage, can be defined as the ratio of coating solids actually applied to the surface of the component being coated to the amount of solids released from the spray gun. Spraying systems with a higher transfer efficiency can coat the same surface area using less coating. Therefore, the HAP emissions resulting from the use of this equipment are reduced compared to applying the same coating with conventional spray equipment. High volume low pressure (HVLP) and electrostatic spraying systems are the primary high efficiency spray methods used by the industry. HVLP spray guns use high volumes (10 to 25 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm)) of low pressure (2 to 10 pounds per square inch gauge (psig)) air to deliver the paint. The lower air pressure creates a lower particle speed, resulting in a more controlled spray pattern with less overspray and bounce back from the substrate. With electrostatic spray systems, atomized particles of coating acquire an electric charge as they pass through a high voltage field at the end of the spray nozzle. This electric charge causes the particles to be attracted to the parts being painted, which are electrically grounded. (2) Enclosed spray gun cleaners. Spray guns are typically cleaned at the end of every job, as well as between color changes. Manual cleaning of spray guns involves disassembling the gun and placing the parts in a tray containing an appropriate cleaning solvent. The residual paint is brushed or wiped off the parts, then the cleaning solvent is sprayed through the gun after it is reassembled. Enclosed spray gun cleaners, however, are completely enclosed units that spray the cleaning solvent through and over the spray gun. The enclosed unit eliminates most of the exposure of the cleaning solvent to the air, thereby greatly reducing the organic HAP emissions from evaporation. (3) Proportional paint mixers. The majority of coatings used in the aerospace industry are multi-component mixtures, consisting of a base component and one or more catalyst components. The components must be thoroughly mixed in the proper ratio immediately before application. When this mixing is performed manually, a greater volume of coating is mixed than will actually be used to ensure that there is enough coating available to complete the job. In contrast, proportional paint mixers pump each component of the coating directly to the spray gun, where it is mixed and immediately applied. This results in reduced coating waste and, consequently, reduced emissions. c. Work practice standards. Work practice standards are changes in the method of operation that do not affect the products used in the process or the process itself, but result in a reduction in emissions. The aerospace industry has implemented work practice standards programs for housekeeping measures and managed chemical distribution systems. Emissions of organic HAP compounds, particularly solvents, can be reduced by limiting both the amount of the material exposed to the atmosphere and the length of the exposure. The emission reductions can be achieved by implementing housekeeping measures whereby solvent-soaked cloth or paper used for hand-wipe cleaning are placed into bags or containers that are kept closed. This eliminates the continual evaporation of the solvent from the cloth or paper when they are not in use. The bags or containers can then be collected and disposed in such a manner (e.g., by incineration) to eliminate any further solvent emissions. Managed chemical distribution systems centralize the distribution of solvents and coatings and control the amount of these materials allowed to be used for a particular task. In this way, waste solvent and coatings are reduced, and emissions from these waste materials are reduced.
