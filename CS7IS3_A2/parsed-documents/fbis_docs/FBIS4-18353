Mr. Venizelos stressed that he was struck by the lack of historical basis in the text and how far away it was from the actual facts. It is obvious to everyone who has an elementary knowledge of the area and its history, Mr. Venizelos noted, that Greece is the basic guarantor of security, stability, and normalcy in the southern Balkans. It is well known, the government spokesman added, that Greece is the most friendly state toward Skopje; this is proven by our proposals submitted to Cyrus Vance on finding a solution to the problem.
