Therefore, specialists of the IMF and the International Bank do not always believe our leaders who give assurances that Russia is not in a position to either pay debts or do without outside assistance in the structural restructuring of industry. How is the money flowing abroad to be returned? The answer to this question is supposed to be given by the Federal Service on Currency and Export Control. Aleksandr Garyevich Nuzhnikov, the first deputy director of the service, talks about this. "It must distress you as well, and many others. It will hardly be possible to return the dollars that have already accumulated in foreign banks to improve our economy. There are no domestic mechanisms or international agreements for this. We will have to build a normative-legal basis that henceforth will not allow even one Russian kopek to accumulate anywhere whatever except in the state treasury." [Ostrovskiy] Aleksandr Garyevich, this means once again rules, instructions, methods... But specialists assure: Even without this, we are swamped by controlling and regulating documents! [Nuzhnikov] I agree. The amount of paper is growing like a snowball. But the state of affairs, unfortunately, is almost unchanging. Many instructions, especially departmental ones, duplicate each other. At the same time, they do not provide answers to other questions. Do you know who works today on control in the currency-export sphere? The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economics, the Main Customs Administration, and the Central Bank. But too many cooks spoil the broth. Inspections show that there are many holes in the legislation through which money flows past the treasury. [Ostrovskiy] For example? [Nuzhnikov] The splitting up and transfer of quotas. Even though this is forbidden, quotas for the export of strategically important raw materials are endlessly transferred from intermediary to intermediary until the possibility of monitoring the transaction vanishes. And accounts get blurred because of the great number of banks. There is no reliable control over the returnability of the currency to the country. [Ostrovskiy] Can you propose another procedure? [Nuzhnikov] There already are outlines for new rules. The right to export strategically important commodities will be granted only to major exporters. Strong, qualified, authorized banks will handle these operations. On government instructions we will verify the fulfillment of quotas allocated last year for the export of oil and the export operations of the Magnitogorsk, Cherepovets, West Siberia, and Norilsk metallurgical combines. We will examine conditions of contracts, their fulfillment, and the return of the share of currency belonging to the state. When we finish the work, a lot will be clarified, and we will be able to make the new documents more accurate and reliable. [Ostrovskiy] There are a lot of commercial structures in the country that are engaged in currency operations without the right to them. Will they also fall within your field of vision? [Nuzhnikov] What is first and foremost for us here is not so much punishment of the guilty as creation of a legal base. You, for example, know about the discussions concerning the firm GMM, which accepts hard currency and rubles at interest from physical and juridical persons without having a bank license. A lot can be done today, there is no legal base. However, it is not only this firm, but any commercial bank can cash any amount of hard currency and give permission for its export. [Ostrovskiy] But are you not afraid of being accused of restoring a state monopoly in currency-export operations and thereby of hampering market reforms in Russia? [Nuzhnikov] State control is compatible with the market. In France, currency control is a function of the customs service as a subdivision of their finance ministry. England had strict control over currency-export operations until it created an orderly system of laws that protected the interests of the state. I think that we will take specifically the English experience as a basis. [Ostrovskiy] Will there be a long wait for the new legislation? [Nuzhnikov] In the near future, we will submit to committees of the State Duma drafts of supplements and amendments to laws: "On Currency Regulation, Banks and Banking Activity," and to the Criminal Code and the Civil Code. After all, there is nothing in today's legislation except for the notorious Article 80, according to which anyone can be made answerable. Or there is also this kind of a passage: Violations and those guilty have been found. Who will recover that which belongs to the state? Who is confiscating property and selling it? In our opinion, such powers should be assigned to tax police. [Ostrovskiy] In a word, the immediate task is to perfect the legislation. Where will you get the people for such work? [Nuzhnikov] There are no specialists with this kind of profile in the country. We are learning and learning. Primarily specialists of the former Gosplan [State Planning Commission] and other state services come to us. Former state employees who have experience in work in commercial structures are especially valuable. Russia undoubtedly needs a federal service that is capable of weaving a dense net from the laws and rules in order not to let even one kopek into foreign borders. But there is something in the plans of the managers of this service that compels one to ponder. First of all, the desire to subordinate all and everything that concerns currency and export to the state and its structures. Has the experience of Ukraine really not taught anything, where a similar practice could only aggravate the crisis in the economy and finances? Also not understandable are the hopes for future legal acts as a means of fighting violators. After all, even today's legislation makes it possible to make criminally answerable firms that work with finances and currency without a license of the Central Bank. God forbid that the new structure sees its purpose only in petty control and guardianship over exporters, banks, and businessmen.
