One can evidently bank on a positive decision on this problem after the Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed his support for the idea of the creation of a space test-range during his visit to Blagoveshchensk. The sum of four trillion rubles specified by Boris Yeltsin as being necessary to upgrade the former missile division at Svobodnyy is the equivalent of approximately $2 billion dollars, while the continued operation of Baykonur for 20 years on the terms of its lease from Kazakhstan will cost 2.3 billion. If one considers that in its version of the lease agreement for Baykonur Kazakhstan has raised the price of its lease to $480 million a year, 2 billion will be "run up" in just a few years. In addition at the expiry of the period of lease the Kazakhstan side will be left with all the launching pads, since there is no question of the equipment being dismantled and removed. A number of experts consider therefore that it would be more beneficial to invest the same funds into the creation of Russia's own cosmodrome within its own territory, since it is hardly likely that anyone could make territorial claims on Amur Oblast. The oblast itself is according to Vladimir Polevanov, its head of administration, "all for the cosmodrome." Indeed Svobodnyy-18 could right now accept 10,000 people to start its full-scale construction. In all the space port would provide 56,000 people with jobs. Meanwhile, prior to the convening of the "council of professionals", which will involve designers, producers and operators of space rocket equipment, planning work is already under way at Svobodnyy-18 to upgrade the rocket silos for the launching of Rokot carrier-rockets, the first of which is due to be launched in early 1996.
