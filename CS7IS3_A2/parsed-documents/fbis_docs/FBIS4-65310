[Grachev] We have been waiting for a political decision by the Federal Government for a long time -- for me, this was the most important item on the agenda of our visit to Bonn. Chancellor Kohl himself said that our troops should withdraw in a festive and friendly atmosphere. This will happen, on 31 August in Berlin. This decision is only just. It is a gesture of goodwill, which will hopefully be a symbol for future German-Russian relations. [DER SPIEGEL] The devil is in the nuts and bolts, and Berlin is quite big. Are you dreaming of a military tattoo at the Brandenburg Gate? [Grachev] We will have to discuss all the details with the Berlin mayor and the Brandenburg minister-president now. We are thinking of a wreath-laying ceremony at the Treptow Park memorial. A special meeting in the Reichstag would be desirable -- although we will not insist on it -- and so would a public ceremony in Berlin's city. [DER SPIEGEL] Many Germans will not like this idea very much: They remember the Russians not only as liberators, but also as occupiers. [Grachev] Of course, I can understand this. There are also many people in our country who remember the Germans as fascists -- people who wanted to overrun and destroy Russia. But the Germans also experienced the horrors of air raids, the destruction of their cities -- both by our troops and those of the allies. It is quite obvious that we are also considered as occupiers. But most people will know who is really to blame for all that. [DER SPIEGEL] Are you disappointed with your former allies -- the Americans, English, and French -- because they were opposed to a joint farewell ceremony with the Russians in the first place? [Grachev] It is not true that we were dreaming of a joint farewell ceremony. I would not talk of a misunderstanding or even a provocation either. The agreement on our withdrawal by 31 August was signed much earlier. But, as to the allies' event in Berlin in September: We were allies in 1945 when we met at the Elbe River. It would, therefore, only be logical for the other three allies to invite Russian military representatives and politicians to participate in their ceremony. We would react positively to such a decision. [DER SPIEGEL] You threatened that the withdrawal of your troops from the Baltic states might be delayed because there are not enough apartments available for your soldiers returning to Russia. The Germans do not have to fear anything of that sort, do they? [Grachev] Housing for the returning troops continues to be the biggest problem for us. But I am very grateful to the Germans. They have kept their financial promises: 7.8 billion German marks [DM] and another DM550 million for the construction of officers' apartments. But in my talks with State Secretary Schoenbohm of the Defense Ministry I presented claims against several construction companies, including four German ones: They are up to nine months in arrears with housing construction in Russia. Of course, this also goes for South Korean and Indian construction companies. [DER SPIEGEL] What made you change your plans and make a surprise visit to the Western Group of Russian Forces at Wuensdorf during your visit to Bonn? [Grachev] Time is running out. Detailed discussions must be held with Supreme Commander Burlakov and all the other parties concerned on the last phase of the troop withdrawal. I have to present a detailed schedule to President Yeltsin on 16 May, who will then pass it to Chancellor Kohl to endorse. If our proposals are accepted, there will be no more obstacles to a complete withdrawal of the last Russian troops.
