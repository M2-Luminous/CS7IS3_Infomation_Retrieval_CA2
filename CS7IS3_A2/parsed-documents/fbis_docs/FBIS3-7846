Security Council resolution on a no-fly zone, but the world media persist in accusing the Bosnian Serbs that the planes belonged to them although it is unclear exactly who was taught a lesson. Twenty-four hours after two U.S. F-16s shot down four fighters over Bosnia early on Monday [28 February] morning, there are still no answers to pertinent questions such as: whose were the aircraft, from where did they take off and where did the two surviving aircraft land. Despite this, the world media continues accusing the Bosnian Serbs by citing unnamed sources and presenting types of the downed planes allegedly in the possession of the Bosnian Serb Air Force only. Compared to Monday's unison chorus, the world media are on Tuesday taking a somewhat more cautious view of the NATO action, maybe because NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said he is not certain that the downed aircraft belonged to the Bosnian Serbs. U.S. Vice-President Al Gore said something along the same lines, thus indirectly denying a statement by President Bill Clinton who first said that in question are Serb planes, but later omitted the word "Serb." NATO, who has monitored the no-fly zone over Bosnia since its imposition on October 1, 1993, has data showing a total of 1,400 violations. U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) information clearly shows that the Bosnian Serbs are responsible for the least number of violations and that no aircraft have taken off from the sole Bosnian Serb airport, Banja Luka, since last October. A number of mysteries have yet to be solved. Firstly, how is it possible that NATO does not know from where the aircraft took off because it is hard to believe that its AWACS planes failed to record this. If this is not the case, it is surprising that NATO has not announced what was filmed. Despite this, a number of world agencies "uncovered" that the downed planes belonged to the Bosnian Serbs. They support these claims by unconfirmed reports that these aircraft attacked Travnik, although even neutral observers say that the Serbs have no reason to bomb this city in central Bosnia. All these unresolved questions create the impression that NATO itself does not want to attach special meaning to the action over Bosnia.
