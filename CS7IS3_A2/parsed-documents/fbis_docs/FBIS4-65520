Now that La Malfa and Amato left, the Segni Pact will remain Segni and that is enough. More than a political movement, it is an abstraction given form by a name and aimed at a new Italian political absurdity: opposition from the Center! Hence, Giulio Tremonti, Berlusconi's finance minister, lent official status to the final farewell to the referendum leader by announcing the birth of the "Liberal Democratic Foundation," which has paid a lot of attention to Berlusconi and which held its first, crowded meeting yesterday at the Antonianum. Segni's reply was extremely tough: "Now that Tremonti has become a minister, it is obvious because he embraced Berlusconi. It is displeasing to see deputies who, after 20 days, back away from the programs for which they were elected and betray the electorate." Joining Tremonti (absent due to one of his ministerial duties) are Alberto Michelini and two other former Pact deputies, Ernesto Stajano and Pietro Siciliani. They want to become an important point of reference for the liberal world within the Center-Right coalition, yet want to remain distinct from Forza Italia. Referring to Segni, Michelini condemned "the lack of clarity" and felt that now it is "more than likely" that there will be a fresh division in the PPI [Italian Popular Party]. "I am convinced that at the time of the confidence vote, six or seven PPI senators will not be present. No matter what Ciriaco De Mita says about it, not everyone wants the government to fall."
