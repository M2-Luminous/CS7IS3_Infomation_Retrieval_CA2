This initiative falls within the framework of an agreement signed by the National Resources Ministry, Canadian Cooperation, and a private foundation interested in studying why this specie grows in an unfavorable environment. The reason for this initiative is the intensive exploitation of this resource by wood mills that use the lenga tree to produce chips [preceding word in English]. [Begin recording] [Alvarado] The idea is to carry out a scientific investigation that will tell us why this specie grows in such an unfavorable environment. What we want to do is build two sites on which this laboratory will be located. [Unidentified reporter] Does this require a law? [Alvarado] No. There is a direct agreement between the National Resources Ministry, Canadian Cooperation, and a private foundation. We estimate the research will take four to five years before the lenga tree can be grown in nurseries. [end recording] If this initiative proves fruitful, Chile will be able to grow lenga forests and thus have a new resource to exploit, according to Alvarado, who is visiting the 12th Region.
