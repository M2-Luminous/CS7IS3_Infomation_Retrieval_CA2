[Belgian Prime Minister] Jean-Luc Dehaene, encouraged by his still fresh popularity and international credibility, has warned the PS against trying to turn the government to the left. Dehaene does not have the least intention of deviating from the line he established for himself or from the white paper. "There is no question of making the same mistake as in 1988 and reducing our efforts," he said. "Any `return of heart' [reference to PS election slogan] which is not based on a good diet leads straight to a cardiac arrest. Having a healthy economy and public finances is good for the heart." The CVP [Christian People's Party] Budget Minister Herman Van Rompuy had already made an initial warning to the PS. The prime minister, who is planning to stay, "I intend to go through to the end of my term of office and to ask for a mandate to continue," confirms this. Dehaene had the following message for those who, following Jose Happart, want to break up the Austerity Plan and review privatization: "The electorate wants us to stick to our guns. It is the best strategy to counter the extreme right: People need to cling to something. There is no question of changing direction every time, otherwise we will have a boomerang effect." The 1995 budget, which must be elaborated in July, will not be an easy job, Dehaene confirmed after Van Rompuy. "Wage moderation is making companies more competitive but reducing state revenue and social security payments," he said. Where will the difference be found? In the pocket of the people? While not brandishing a tax veto, Dehaene wants to be reassuring. "We have already asked people to make very considerable sacrifices," he said. "Additional taxes or charges are not the first option. That is the easy solution." Will the social sector be excluded from the negotiations? "I do not rule out new measures for employment, even if the budgetary margin is tight," he said. On the "Clarification" news show, Dehaene went out of his way to explain that the measures of the Austerity Plan would give the hoped-for results, as long as "time is allowed to take its course and the government is stable." Dehaene is planning to strengthen the initial measures so that the burgeoning recovery can translate into jobs. Dehaene also has singled out the results of the youth employment plan (40,000 jobs). However, there is no reason to hope that wage moderation will automatically lead to jobs. The 1995-1996 interprofessional negotiations will start under unfavorable auspices. The employers do not intend to let themselves be tied by any employment constraints, and they seem to consider that the agreement is still-born. But in Philippe Busquin's circles it was confirmed yesterday that the PS only demanded to adapt social measures regarding employment. It judges that all the social problems causing the rise of the extreme right are linked to unemployment and is demanding additional measures to help people return to work: A local employment plan, increased security contracts, multiservice checks and lower working times. Can these paths be taken without compromizing the convergence? The negotiations will give the answer.
