The removal of former Deputy Prime Ministers Gaydar and Fyodorov, whom Ryabov sees as having been "marginal figures in the cabinet," from the cabinet of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin in no way means the end of the reforms: "Those are guaranteed by Yeltsin and the Constitution." However, Ryabov, who was vice president of the Supreme Soviet under putsch leader Khasbulatov last year, makes it perfectly clear that radical reforms, especially those involving the privatization of state plants, do not have much of a future. In the future, social considerations must come first. The privatization of state plants is also one of the main problems for Ryabov. Thus, the property ownership issue also has not been resolved: Which elements of a plant (the land, the machinery) belong to whom (the local community, the province, or the federation)? The parliamentary elections in December did produce surprising results, but the many votes for the radical right-wing Liberal Democrats did not reflect political reality, they do not, above all, permit a general conclusion to be drawn that there is a radical nationalist trend in Russia. In his opinion, too much importance is being attributed to LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader Zhirinovskiy, especially abroad, although Ryabov also concedes that "in view of their history, Germans react with more sensitivity to political anomalies than other Europeans." Whereas Zhirinvoskiy was not that well-known among the Russians before the elections, "today, most Russians are not that indifferent." According to Ryabov -- whose function roughly corresponds to that of the German federal election manager -- following the elections, his authorities began to check how parties' and groups' election campaigns were financed. He is familiar with Western media reports about the LDP election campaign being financed from abroad, and the LDP will also be questioned. "Should the investigation reveal any irregularities, then that will appear in a report to be given to parliament, and it is then up to parliament to pass resolutions on measures to be applied against the parties concerned." That will happen before June of this year, because provincial and municipal elections are to be held in June. Ryabov defends unreservedly the foreign policy course being pursued by the government and President Yeltsin, who in recent months has pursued a massive campaign against admission to NATO for the Baltic states as well as the Central and East European states of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. The Partnership for Peace formula that the Western side has now come up with is also satisfactory for Russia, whereas admission to NATO for those countries would constitute "a threat to Russia and its interests." He termed the demands for NATO protection the product of "a hysterical campaign against Russia in the Baltic and East Europe countries."
