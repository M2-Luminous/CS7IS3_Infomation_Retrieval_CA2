In an article today entitled "Ekeus Talks in Baghdad, the Unjust Blockade, and the Responsibility for Prolonging it," the paper says that any procrastination or deliberate delays will increase the suffering of millions of Iraqis and will stain Ekeus' reputation in Iraq. He himself has acknowledged that Iraq has cooperated with him in a positive manner to help him fulfill his mission despite all its complications and difficulties. The paper recalls an announcement made by Hans Blix, chairman of the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iraq has done what it was required to do and that what is left to be done is the part concerning the work of the Special Commission under Ekeus. He also noted that this commission was slow in accomplishing its mission. The paper says that Mr. Ekeus should prove that he has not gone beyond the limits of his mission, which is technical in nature. He should not be influenced by the wishes of this or that party. His mission is technical, not political. It is wrong to link Part C or Paragraph 22 to other paragraphs, because this paragraph is independent and has a clear meaning. The paper brands the attempts of the Clinton administration and those following suit to make strange interpretations of Paragraph 22 for clear political purposes as unacceptable. The paper also says that it is unacceptable for Ekeus to submit to these attempts. It notes that this is not in line with the technical nature of Ekeus' mission and runs counter to the principle of neutrality, honesty, and sincerity, to which he often stresses commitment. The paper adds that honesty makes it incumbent upon Mr. Ekeus to announce now the starting date for the monitoring as agreed upon, provided that this period is not in excess of six months, after which he would announce that his mission has been fully completed. This means that the UN Security Council would be compelled to implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, which means lifting the economic blockade. The paper adds: Mr. Ekeus should specify the starting date for the monitoring period during his current talks in Baghdad and he should do it as soon as possible. It would be fair to say that this period should have started last July when Iraq agreed to install two monitoring cameras in two different positions in Baghdad, and when Iraq declared its approval of Resolution 715 in November. The paper says that Iraq approved the (?proposed) trial period in order to dismiss all the pretexts that are being floated by some influential UN Security Council members, specifically the United States. Iraq's approval, the paper says, was in order to make it possible to implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, which means lifting the economic blockade against Iraq. The evil powers want to prolong the blockade to achieve tendentious political objectives that have nothing to do with the UN Security Council resolutions. Concluding its article, AL-JUMHURIYAH says that the current round of talks with Ekeus has special importance because it will discuss an important issue pertaining to the suffering of an entire people. Its results will negatively or positively affect the credibility of the United Nations and the Security Council, specifically the credibility of the permanent big powers and the extent of their commitment to the implementation of the resolutions which they have voted for, especially since Iraq has honored its obligations, especially with regard to Part C of Resolution 687.
