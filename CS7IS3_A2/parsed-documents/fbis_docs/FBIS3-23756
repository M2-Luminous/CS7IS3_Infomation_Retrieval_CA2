As MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS found out, the Northeast Administrative Okrug has begun an unusual experiment to introduce a new form of cooperation in housing construction. The idea of this experiment is that persons on the list who do not want to wait endlessly for housing may organize themselves into collectives and seek investors or organizations which may want to undertake the construction of housing units. An indispensable condition for this kind of construction is that the investor must allocate 50 percent of the living space to persons on the housing waiting list. Persons on the waiting list will look for housing construction areas themselves and will have to coordinate their activities only with the local prefecture. If this experiment proves successful, this kind of construction cooperation will take place in every part of Moscow.
