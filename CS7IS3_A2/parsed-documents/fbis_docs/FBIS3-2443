In their reports to be delivered after the National People's Congress opens to morrow, senior cadres, including Prime Minister Li Peng, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and State Planning Minister Chen Jinhua will underscore traditional themes such as bolstering the state sector, bailing out poor regions, subsidizing agriculture, and controlling prices to ensure political stability. The three senior ministers have also mothballed the radical exhortations that patriarch Deng Xiaoping recently made in Shanghai to speed up the introduction of a market economy. Moreover, Mr Li and his colleagues have given strong hints that the three-month-long austerity measure last autumn will continue in the coming year. Sources close to the legislature said yesterday Mr Li and other State Council stalwarts had bowed to last-minute lobbying from the sectors of the polity that stood to lose from the implementation of Mr Deng's radical reforms: Entrepreneurs and workers in state enterprises, impoverished heartland provinces, and the agrarian lobby. In his Government Work Report, Mr Li highlights Mr Deng's theory of the construction of a socialist market economy as well as the need to proceed with just announced reforms such as therestructuring of the ailing state enterprises. However, Mr Li and finance chief Mr Liu, who will deliver a Budget report on Friday, have made provisions for shoring up government-run enterprises as well as boosting aid to workers laid off in the interest of improving the efficiency of state firms. For example, Mr Li indicates that "for the sake of helping large and medium-scale enterprises get out of their plight," Beijing will exempt such units from levies including contributions to funds for the construction of energy and transport projects. The premier also discloses that the central Government will set up special funds for the relief of laid-off workers. In deference to the old goal of "taking grain as the key link", Beijing will assure the agrarian sector a new deal including raising the procurement price for rice, wheat, cotton and oil-bearing crops. State subsidies will be vouchsafed 500 counties specializing in producing "commodity grain" as well as 150 counties specialising in cotton. Mr Li pays a lot of attention to the plight of the rural sector and the growing hardship of the 900 million peasants. He acknowledges that the rate of growth of agriculture has fallen further behind other sectors in the past few years. The senior leader also pointed to bad harvest in the past few months which is set to put addi tional strain on the supply of grain and staple foods this year. Sources said Mr Li has promised to boost the annual growth of agriculture to at least five percent. The reports by the three senior ministers spell a temporary end to price reform, a key component of Mr Deng's strategy for economic liberalization. Mr Li and Mr Chen, who will address the NPC on social and economic development in 1994, endorse measures announced over the past week concerning the strict policy of controlling price levels by state price administration bureaus. Moreover, the premier says that Beijing will introduce a "mayor responsibility system" whereby leaders of municipalities will be asked to guarantee the stability of prices in their cites. Mr Li indicates that the central authorities will continue to use economic tools to control prices. "Prices of commodities have to be supervised. We should seek further lifting of control in the process of supervision. We cannot lift all controls over price in one go," the premier says in his report. Informcd sources said the State Council had succumbed to intensive lobbying from heartland and western regions to ensure a more equitable distribution of national income, particulally increasing central-government aid to the poorer provinces. The reports of Mr Li and Mr Chen will play up the centre's willingness to provide equal opportunities for laggards in the open-door policy. For example, a segment of the increased contributions to central funds will be distributed to the less well-off areas in the form of transfer payments. NPC members who have read the reports said Beijing will continue to implement a tight money policy this year to curb speculative activities and avoid hyperinflation. In spite of protests from coastal provinces, Mr Li is expected to insist that the strict control over money supply and credit imposed since mid-1993 will have to stay. Unregulated loans for investment in real estate will face severe curbs under the Government's development strategy for 1994. The freeze on development zones, high-technology districts and industri al parks imposed last year will remainintact. Sources said Mr Li's Government Work Report spoke positively about last year's austerity programme, which had been attacked by liberal economists as a "plot" by central planners to reimpose control in the name of curing economic dislocations. The macrolevel adjustment and control measures have helped tighten control over the surge of money supply and credit last year, Mr Li's report says. Greater government control will be imposed in order to establish "effective supervision" over the property market, the report says. According to a copy of the report the central Government will make further efforts to push ahead with the drastic fiscal reform whose details have been laid down by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji at the national financial work conference in mid-1993.
