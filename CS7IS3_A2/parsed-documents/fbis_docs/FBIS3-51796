Without implying a reduction in educational budgets, workers are seeking solutions that would allow consolidation of classes in several schools, establish multidisciplinary principles, and fill the entire teaching and work schedule of the personnel. This will undoubtedly result in the elimination of a number of positions. However, according to preliminary analyses, only 2,500 workers out of 22,000 will lose their posts. These workers will take retraining courses, sabbaticals, or other forms of education, including informal education alternatives, to maintain their ties with the education sector even if they end up working in a sector such as the minibrigades. Ninety-eight percent of the children in Matanzas are enrolled in school, with one teacher for every 14 students in all grades and subjects. Highly developed countries have one teacher per 30 or more students. The state budget for education for 1994 is 75 million pesos; in the decade of the eighties, it reached 82 million pesos, proving that education is a priority despite difficulties.
