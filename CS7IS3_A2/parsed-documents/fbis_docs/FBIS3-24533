The findings showed that none of the antibodies inhibited LT binding to rat brain synaptosomes, but may interfere with channel-forming and/or secretogenic functions. Calcium permeability of synaptosomes was not affected by 2 antibodies (A15, A19), but completely abolished by 3 (A4, A6, A24). Two antibodies (A6 and A24) blocked GABA release from synapsomes, while one (A4) was only partially inhibitory. In addition, A15 and A19 did not affect GABA release. In combination with studies on channel formation in BLM (in no case was insertion of LT into BLM completely abolished by an antibody), these observations demonstrated that binding and channel-forming functions of LT can be uncoupled. Therefore, the data indicate that LT possesses several functional sites. These include a receptor-binding site, a site for channel formation with calcium-dependent secretogenic effect, a site for calcium-independent secretogenic effect, and a site promoting channel formation in BLM.
