The proposal by a working group of the Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, a think tank affiliated with the Finance Ministry, will be part of a package of recommendations on how to create a more environmentally friendly society through fiscal and monetary policy. In a final report on the theme, to be issued in late June, the group will also urge the government and private firms to be more concerned with environmental conservation in their activities. The proposed indirect environment tax would be added to the prices of manufactured goods, with the tax ratio set depending on the amounts of energy used to make the products. The group will also recommend that private firms disclose data relating to their activities both benign and harmful to the environment, such as the amount of industrial waste generated and the amount of investment made for ecology preservation. It will also ask the government as well as private banks to lend more to ecology-protecting projects and less to those focused only on economic interests. Other ideas to be included in the report are the introduction of garbage-collecting fees and a review of the current farming methods that depend heavily on chemicals.
