It is impossible to say how many solutions to this problem have been devised over the years. However, not many of these solutions ever made it further than the drawing board and, eventually, all the designs disappeared without trace. Engineers at the Innas engineering bureau in Breda designed and built two interference-free prototypes of a "free piston unit" which has every chance of being the first produced on a large scale. When asked, experts are unanimously enthusiastic and impressed. Volvo and Daf Bus [Department of Daf which manufactures buses] have said they are "very interested." It would not be true to say that the Innas "free piston unit" operates noiselessly. Even if the heavy door of the sound-proofed cell in the hall where the machine is set up is closed and the piston frequency is reduced to an impressively low level, simply by turning a knob, it remains impossible to hold a normal conversation. Peter Achten, rounding off a long technical explanation with the noisy demonstration, wears an "I couldn't care less" expression. Either he no longer hears the racket or he no longer wants to hear it. In the exhaustive measuring and optimization program which he ran through with the spiritual father of the machine, Theo Potma, no attention has yet been devoted to sound production. For ease of research, the machine is running with no muffling worth mentioning. It is expected that the unit will make less noise than the diesel hydraulic engine which it is intended to replace. It will not be difficult to mount the unit free from vibration. The Innas free piston unit appears to be a compact machine, smelling pleasantly of oil, of which precious little can be seen, least of all moving parts. What is most exciting is the picture that the computer monitor gives of the piston movement. Free piston movements look very unusual -- in no way comparable with the smooth sinusoidal movement of the piston in a crankshaft engine. Noise measurements and life cycle trials are virtually the only tests to which this machine, the second operating prototype built by Innas, has not been subjected. For over four years, an average of four people have been measuring vibrations, emission, output, controllability and response speed. It has thus been established that the unit could prove a worthy replacement for the regular diesel hydraulic drive in forklifts, mechanical scoops ("shovels" as they say on television), street cleaning machines, garbage trucks, and city buses. The theory is that the Innas unit is considerably more economical and cleaner than the drives it can replace and, furthermore, will only require approximately half the space. In addition, it offers flexibility of control and low purchase and maintenance costs. [passage omitted ] The output of the diesel engine within the unit is estimated at 50 percent, while in regular diesel hydraulic units it is approximately 45 percent. The absence of the mechanical intermediate stage between diesel engine and hydraulic pump (where roughly 10 percent of the loss occurs) is obviously just as important. The maximum overall yield of a conventional diesel hydraulic unit is estimated at 36 percent -- that of the Innas unit at 45 percent. The differences between average consumption outputs could be even greater. So far, two working prototypes of the Innas unit have been built, the second "pre-production prototype" was finished this year and already seems a considerable improvement on the initial type. The maximum stroke frequency of the piston (which determines the delivery of the hydraulic pump) has been increased from 23 to 35 hertz, the hydraulic output from 60 to 90 percent (by restricting leakage and current losses) and consumption by peripheral equipment has been cut from 7.5 to 5 kw. Efforts are being made to improve the modest cylinder output (the extent to which combustion gases are replaced by a fresh fuel/air mixture). The number of sensors can perhaps be reduced. "The concept still has a great deal of room for development, there is still a lot left to perfect," says Achten. An operational free piston unit is now available, with a maximum capacity of 20 kw (27 Horsepower) which is almost half the size of a conventional diesel hydraulic unit of the same capacity. NOx [Nitrous Oxide] measurements taken by the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research [TNO] in Apeldoorn have shown that the emission of combustion gases will be below the future Euro III standard. (The emission of particles has not yet been measured.) [passage omitted] Meanwhile, four new patents have been applied for with regard to the main discoveries. This summer, the BV Innas Free Piston Engine (IFP) was founded in order to "market" the unit. Novem [committee which counseled the project] thought it was time to look for a partner in industry. Achten and Potma found this no easy task -- remember the Wankel syndrome and the gloomy example of Van Doorne's Transmission. As Van der Does of Projectbureau Warmte/Kracht (PWK) says: "The problem is that the Netherlands lacks an industrial climate." The design of the Innas unit is so simple that it will certainly be no problem finding sufficient companies in the Netherlands to manufacture the engine. With the exception of the piston and the engine block, it can be assembled almost entirely using existing products. The problem is that the companies approached can only start production once there is a firm order for the sale of the machines. Potential customers such as Daf Bus, Volvo and the German company Linde (forklift manufacturer) only want to order when production is guaranteed. The young company IFP is still hesitant about the nature of the contracts which it wants to conclude with the business community. One promising aspect is that Daf Bus has expressed lively enthusiasm about the new engine, which product planning manager G. Batterink refers to as "very daring and very innovative." "This defies all recent thinking in the field of combustion engines." Volvo Flygmotor of Sweden is following developments very closely and has already sent delegations to Breda on four occasions, offering far-reaching collaboration. It is claimed that the Innas unit could not be put to better use than in city buses equipped with Volvo's controversial Cumulo system for recycling brake energy (which Daf Bus could also buy). Cumulo buses have a heavy conventional diesel hydraulic drive which could very profitably be replaced by an Innas unit.
