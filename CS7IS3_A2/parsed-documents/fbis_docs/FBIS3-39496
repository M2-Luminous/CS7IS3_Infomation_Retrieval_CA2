Bonn announced this Tuesday [15 February] after an investigating magistrate of the Federal Court applied for an arrest warrant for a Serb living in Munich suspected of complicity in genocide, murder, and serious assault. This is the first time that the "international principle" of the criminal code has been employed. Human rights organizations have reported for some time that a considerable number of "suspected torturers" at Serbian concentration camps were residing in Germany. Law enforcement agencies have indications of links between Serbian criminal organizations in Germany and perpetrators of human rights violations in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
