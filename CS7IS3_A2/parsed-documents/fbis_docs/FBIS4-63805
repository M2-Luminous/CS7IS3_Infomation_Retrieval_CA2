The NSF Political Council said a dramatic conflict was about to erupt in Crimea and the Ukrainian leaders would be to blame for it. The Crimeans' quest for the protection of the age-long ties with Russia have been threatened by Kiev, the Council said. The Russian president and government were equally responsible for what was happening on the peninsula. Now that Ukraine was running up an enormous debt to Russia, the NSF Council said, the Russian leaders could resort to absolutely reliable and peaceful means of averting violence in Crimea. The NSF Council declared the Crimean developments to be a test of the patriotic declarations made by many local political parties and movements.
