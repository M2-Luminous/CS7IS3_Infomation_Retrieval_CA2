[Luca] There is an aspect that has to be pointed out to provide a correct answer. The population, that is the foundation of trade unions, is desperate and dumbfounded. At this point, no one in Romania understands anything -- neither the people, nor the electorate, and not even the leaders of various parties involved in the political game. To quote just one example: In a country that is extracting 8 million tonnes of crude oil a year, the oil industry is suffering from financial blockage and is on the brink of bankruptcy. [passage omitted] The disaster continues and no one seems to be responsible for what is happening. Thus all efforts go into the silly game of acquiring power and the problem of tangible solutions to justify this portfolio- and position-hunting is not posed. [Buligan] What is the situation of financial blockage at this point? [Luca] If you could have frank discussions with the big shots in industry you would be surprised to note that they are totally confused. No one knows who is his leader and what strategy or program he has to implement. On the one hand, the Vacaroiu government is accused by everyone, including us, the trade unions, of not doing anything; on the other hand, what can he do as long as he does not have the economic levers in his hand and has no freedom to make decisions? [Buligan] Who is holding these economic levers? [Luca] Under the law, the head of the State Property Fund [FPS] is the holder of these levers, while the executive, however, belongs to the prime minister. Under the Privatization Law, an illogical situation has emerged in which decisionmaking is divided in such a way between the FPS and government that neither can do anything. The situation is such that we do not even know for sure how many powers there are in the state, thus even the country's integrity is questioned. Consequently, the population is fed up to such an extent that they confuse democracy with the crisis and almost are expecting a reorganization of sociopolitical structures, even if this would mean a military dictatorship. At this time, such notions as freedom, democracy, and reform are compromised in Romania. [Buligan] What is the explanation of the fact that recently trade unions firmly demanded a broad national coalition government, meaning that they got involved in "politics," as some public figures say? [Luca] We demanded the participation of the democratic opposition in government for at least two reasons. First, an economic one. Under the current single leadership of the Social Democracy Party [PDSR], the former communist nomenklatura is consolidating its positions in the economy, thus becoming a very rich, though small, segment of, let's say, 5 percent. As for the rest, there is great poverty. A country with no prosperous middle class, but with catastrophic economic differences is not a stable country. Through the participation of the other parties in government, the segment of the privileged would expand and our society would become a normal society. [passage omitted] Returning to the financial blockage, an easy solution would be if oil producers concluded their contracts directly with refineries; that would eliminate financial blockage. Despite all our efforts, however, this is not possible. In their naivete, the trade unions thought that this problem would belong to the competence of the Ministry of Industry and the prime minister, but we were wrong because these authorities have no decisionmaking power. Thus we have to ask the question: Which are the dark powers behind those appointed to govern? [passage omitted] [Buligan] Is there any solution to this blockage? [Luca] In the oil sector, the blockage amounts to 160 billion lei. Halting payments or, differently put, the application of the Bankruptcy Law is the only way out. Normally, such a financial blockage cannot last long; but maybe what is pursued is to exasperate people and ruin the economy in order to prove that Romania is unsuited for the market economy. [passage omitted] [Buligan] Do you believe in the efficiency of a new government? [Luca] No, because the country does not have the time needed to form and break in another government team. [Buligan] Do you think that the legitimate power is experiencing an authority crisis? [Luca] Yes, an authority crisis coupled with an outrageous lack of responsibility vis a vis national interests. The political forces have abandoned the nation, but the nation has also abandoned and isolated them in their silly game to win power. Thus, the country is split. [passage omitted] [Buligan] What is your opinion about President Ion Iliescu in the current situation? [Luca] His main asset is an outstanding resilience. At a recent meeting with trade union leaders, he emphasized the need for consensus through the participation of all in a government coalition, but, as you well know, even the road to hell is paved with good intentions. [Buligan] What will the trade unions do next? [Luca] We will continue to heed our responsibilities. [passage omitted] The problem of responsibility is a tangible and strict problem with us.
