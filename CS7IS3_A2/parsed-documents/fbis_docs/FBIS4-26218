A survey shows that a mere one third of respondents have not yet changed their jobs. There was so much transfer of jobs last year which hit a record in the history of employment in China. --Sense of value regarding employment strengthens to a certain extent and income differences widens. Employees tend to choose business entities which show great economic results and put emphasis on value of human resources. --Autonomy of job seeking is rather strong. Individuals tend to choose career according to one's own desire and ability, reversing the job allocation employed under the planned economy. --Quality of employees improves at a rapid pace. Vocational schools across the country offer job training while special training is also available for workers who want to find a job in another field. --The number of employees working for enterprises of non public ownership hit the record high. There were about 24.67 million workers with individually run business and 2.318 million workers with private business by the end of the previous year. The total number of such employees made up 4.5 percent of the gross work force across the country. Employment in individual and private business tend to go upwards this year. --Competitiveness for employment tends to increase. The employment rate rose as the result of rapid economic development. Consciousness of stiff competitiveness for a job is therefore strong [sentence as received]. --Sideline career becomes popular and such trend grows at a fast speed. There is nearly half of the work force in some main cities in southeastern part of China having sideline career. --The wave of labour work force sees no sign of recession while the job seeking consciousness stands high in urban area. Those jobs in which work force is in great demand for their job nature and for low income offer more chance to labour workers. -- Unemployment rate is low in southeastern part of China and high in northwestern area and such a gap tends to grow bigger. Nearly half of 500 cities across the country saw an unemployment rate not more than two percent in 1992 but there were some 50 cities having an unemployment rate of over four percent and seven others even registering an unemployment rate as high as over ten percent. High unemployment rate is mainly centred on northwestern area. --Re-employment of workers who were made redundancy by state-owned enterprises has become a serious problem.
