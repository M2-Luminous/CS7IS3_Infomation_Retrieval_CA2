At Monday's [7 February] session held by the Duma's Council (which includes the speaker, his deputies and the leaders of all factions), he said that the Duma must evaluate the situation in the former Yugoslav republics based on conclusions made by its official delegation, not on the impressions of "a tourist," even if that tourist is the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party faction, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. On Wednesday Zhirinovskiy intends to brief the Duma on his recent trip to Yugoslavia. In the meantime the leader of the Russian Unity and Accord faction in the Duma, Sergey Shakhray, told journalists on Monday that the proposed bombing of Serb positions surrounding the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sarajevo, will lead to nothing. The issue of bombing Serb positions by NATO aircraft was raised following Saturday's explosion in Sarajevo's market place in which 68 people were killed. Bosnian Muslims laid the blame for the barbarous terrorist act on the Serbs. "Bombardments cannot resolve such problems -- they can only delay solution to the conflict," Shakhray pointed out. If the situation is further aggravated and Serb positions around Sarajevo are bombed, his faction will make an official statement in the Duma, he said.
