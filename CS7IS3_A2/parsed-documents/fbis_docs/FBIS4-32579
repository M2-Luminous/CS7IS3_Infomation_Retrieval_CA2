It is being said that the corruption revealed to date is only the tip of the iceberg. Will you be launching any kind of investigation? [Horn] People are talking a lot about this, and it is not certain that all of it is true. But it is true that there is a huge amount of corrupt deals, or suspected corruption. Just take a look at the press. Not a day passes without a report about some kind of scandal or a report about suspected corrupt deals. The MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] has committed itself to reexamining the privatization decisions made during the period between 1 April and the formation of the new government. The coalition agreement also contains things relating to this. There is the exact text, here is the exact text relating to this. What I would like to stipulate is this: We do not have any intention of initiating any kind of calling to account vis-a-vis the present administration or government officials. But when there is a well-founded suspicion, a report, or anything else of that kind, in other words, if it becomes necessary for us to investigate, or to order the investigation of some kind of suspected corruption or illegal deal, then I do not think that the government, or the organs belonging to the government, will for a single minute hesitate to investigate it. These things have to be investigated. If need be, in given cases, ad hoc investigating committees will have to be set up. This is demanded not only by a sense of justice, but also because there is a need once and for all to create order. A government that does not declare war on corruption, on abuses, is not a government. [passage omitted] [Forro] There has been a huge amount of speculation about where changes will take place. [passage omitted] When will you decide about these, and what kind of changes have you in mind? [Horn] Excuse me, let us take them in order. [Forro] The Hungarian National Bank [MNB]. [Horn] Yes. Here we will consider necessary a change at the head of the MNB. [Forro] Incidentally, let me ask if you have already had discussions with people, have requests been made, or has the person already been found? [Horn] Yes, we have held discussions, we have held discussions, yes, we do have our nominee for this office. [Forro] Can this be made public yet? [Horn] It still has to be coordinated, but for the time being I do not want--I would not like....[sentence incomplete as heard] [Forro] All right, then all I will ask is has there been agreement on the nominee? [Peto] Coordination will occur in every important personnel issue. At the MNB, as is known, there is a legal problem, if you like: The mandate of the present chairman of the MNB is no longer the mandate of the government that appointed him. It is also known that earlier he was a party politician. According to some opinions--I would now hasten to distance myself from this opinion--but there are opinions to the effect that if a politician becomes the chairman of a bank, then in accordance with the rules of political etiquette, if there is a change of government then it would be seemly for him to resign. [Forro] MNB Chairman Peter Akos Bod has said he will not resign. [Peto] Obviously, I also heard that was what he said. [passage omitted] [Forro] Institutions responsible for privatization? [Horn] At any rate, our opinion is that the privatization institutions have to be amalgamated because the present situation cannot be maintained. What is more, if possible it should be done on the basis of the Assets Handling joint-stock company. As for how and in what way its form will be resolved, that is the experts job. [passage omitted] [Forro] Peter Boross has already announced that he will shortly be dismissing--or that he will be proposing the dismissal of -- Laszlo Csucs and Gabor Nahlik. Have you talked about who are going to be the new leaders of radio and television? [Horn] Consultations were held about this between experts, and also between Ivan Peto and myself. Several candidates came into question. As far as my opinion is concerned--because it is possible that consultations will continue about this in the coming weeks-- well, the prime minister has announced that he is dismissing the two deputy chairmen. I will add that after this steps must be taken also in the matter of the dismissal of Elemer Hankiss and Csaba Gombar. This falls within the competence and sphere of authority of the president of the Republic. What we would like is that afterward, during the present extraordinary term, the committee hearings and appointment of the leaders of the two media should take place. Naturally, in coordination, in agreement between the two parties, with regard to the people. [passage omitted] I consider the following extremely important: The first thing is that this coaltion will at all events like to give greater weight and support to those areas--apart from the social welfare areas--which are of fundamental importance from the viewpoint of the country's situation, the population's situation, such as culture, education, public education, in strategic taskss, sport, and other areas. Here obviously, as Ivan Peto also said, the financial resources could mean very harsh restrictions. But at all events the situation has to be improved. There is a possibility that we can lead and maintain the differences of views in appropriate channels. By this I mean that our intention from the outset has been--and the coalition partners agreed on this--that the realization of the most important tasks designated by the government will be entrusted to the economic cabinet. So, we want to give the economic cabinet a much more important role than it has played up to now. The economic cabinet will have to decide on these issues, and if that does not succeed, then there will be further government forums where coordination can take place on these issues. What pains me is that the country's financial opportunities are fairly narrow. Just one other thing -- I am sorry, forgive me for going on -- I would just like to add one more thing: I consider it extremely important, extraordinarily important, that sometime in the autumn, let us say in September or October at the latest, there should be concluded an economic-social agreement in which the participants will be the government, the employers, and the interest representation organs of employees. In other words, a kind of economic-social pact that will guarantee self-moderation and at the same time the realization, the fulfillment of demands that are considered just and fulfillable. This is a key issue from the viewpoint of the coming period. [Forro] [passage omitted] What sort of relationship will the prime minister and the Foreign Ministry have? What I am thinking is that former Prime Minister Jozsef Antall practically directed foreign affairs himself. [Horn] I do not expect any kind of conflict. The Foreign Ministry must be given the opportunity for independence. We also agreed that in the case of such a small country, a decisive task of the Foreign Ministry is to promote the solution of economic and social problems. So, in foreign affairs activity we ascribe very great importance to economic diplomacy. It is not with macroeconomics that we have to deal--beyond the necessary limits--but above all with helping the country to be able to step onto the path of modernization as soon as possible. [Forro] Who will make up the team that will work directly alongside the prime minister. Can we have the names? [Horn] I have asked Elemer Kiss to lead the Prime Minister's Office; he has experience in this area, he has already carried out excellent work. [passage omitted] There is one more thing that I consider very important, and that is that we should be thrifty with numbers. This will have to be a cheaper government and this applies equally to the ministries and the Prime Minister's Office. [passage omitted]
