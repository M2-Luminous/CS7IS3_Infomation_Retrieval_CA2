FBIS4-67204 "jptdd021__l94057" JPRS-TDD-94-021-L JPRS Narcotics 10 May 1994 EAST ASIA THAILAND Money Laundering Law Under Consideration To Combat Money Laundering Law Under Consideration To Combat `Lucrative' Drug Trade BK1005091794 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 10 May 94 p 1 BK1005091794 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] The Government is considering drafting an anti-money laundering law as part of stepped-up measures against the lucrative drug trade. The disclosure, made by an anti-narcotics agency chief yesterday, follows the United States accusation last week that prominent Thai businessman and Opposition Chat Thai MP Thanong Siriprichapong is involved in exporting marijuana to the US. Pol Gen [Police General] Chawalit Yotmani, secretary-general of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board [ONCB], said his agency was in the process of coordinating with government organizations to draw up the law. The legislation would empower government officials to check into the financial records of individuals suspected of involvement in the narcotics trade and to confiscate any money found to have been derived from drug sales. The ONCB earlier successfully pushed for the law empowering the Government to confiscate the assets of people convicted of narcotics offenses. "The planned legislation is expected to help effectively deal with the lucrative narcotics business," said Pol Gen Chawalit. The ONCB chief said he believed government agencies responsible for financial matters such as the Finance Ministry had the capability and methods to trace the financial records of suspected drug traders. Pol Gen Chawalit, emphasizing the urgency of the legislation, said he had discussed the matter with government leaders and many had supported its early implementation. Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan, while confirming the proposed law was in the making, said the Government would have to be careful in enacting such legislation as it could contradict the principle of basic human rights. The Government will have to study past problems in solving the narcotics problem before deciding what measures should be incorporated to enhance efficiency. Finance Deputy Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri said he fully supported Pol Gen Chawalit's proposal as the measure would enable officials to fight the narcotics trade more effectively. "We must help eradicate dirty money from the drug business," said the outspoken politician. He said the proposed legislation, if implemented carefully, would not violate individuals' rights. The checking of financial records could be limited to people on official blacklists only or to those suspected of involvement in the narcotics trade about whom the ONCB lacks evidence to press charges. The Finance Ministry is ready to support the ONCB's proposal, he said. Pol Gen Chawalit, when asked to comment on Mr Thanong's case yesterday, refused to offer any statement. He said on Mr Thanong's claim that he had not been contacted by the US Drug Enforcement Agency concerning the accusation that the MP could say anything he wanted. "I personally have no comment on that," he said. There have been reports more politicians have been blacklisted for narcotics involvement, but Pol Gen Chawalit said only: "I cannot make any comment even if I know anything about it. We just don't have enough evidence." Mr Thanong is due to appear before the House Parliamentary Affairs Committee to answer the US allegations. Committee member Pricha Suwannathat said the panel would ask the US Embassy in Bangkok to supply all documents related to the allegation. House Speaker Marut Bunnak yesterday dismissed as groundless an unpublished paper alleging that there were eight other MPs from the Northeast involved in drug trafficking. "I can not give this thesis any credence," said Mr Marut. The media has publicized a so-called "secret" Chulalongkon University paper by Chumphon Phongsuwan which states there are eight other MPs involved in the drug trade. The paper, entitled "Marijuana Politics: a Power Structure Case Study of Local Politics" earned the special agent with the Office of Narcotics Control Board the best thesis award of 1987. "There are both good and bad people in every organization including the House. But no rumor should sling groundless mud to dirty the House," said Mr Marut. He said the paper did not specify when the MPs allegedly involved in the drug trade sat in Parliament and the lack of detail led him to disbelieve the allegation. He also praised the Chat Thai Party for setting up a five-man committee to investigate the allegations against Mr Thanong. "I believe the Chat Thai probe committee will be thorough in their investigation. The members are all competent statesmen and lawyers." Chat Phatthana Party secretary-general Prachuap Chaiyasan said about the paper: "We have to be openminded. The thesis did not mention any name in particular. The official has to investigate and show proof so that our country can clear this drug trafficking image." Mr Prachuap said he did not believe the Chat Thai Party would protect Mr Thanong. Any member which brings notoriety to the party should act responsibly. He said the House has the burden of proving the allegation and must make the information public. "Every MP should be aware of the importance of his own reputation and history, and that is why Mr Thanong's case should be investigated," he said.
