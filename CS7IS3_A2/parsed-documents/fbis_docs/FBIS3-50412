After the news conference, Zuzana Stukovska asked KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky for an interview. [Begin recording] [Stukovska] Your colleagues said at a news conference today that cooperation between the castle [the president] and the government is not functioning. [passage omitted] [Carnogursky] As to President Kovac's visit to Poland, it is obvious that the government did not cooperate with the president as it should have. I think that Prime Minister Meciar's statement yesterday [26 January] that he had learned about the visit too late is not an excuse. The visit was agreed during the Visegrad summit in Prague. Economics Minister Ducky was present at the talks between President Kovac and President Walesa and therefore it was his duty to inform Prime Minister Meciar. Meciar cannot use the excuse that some of his ministers knew something but did not tell him. He is responsible for the whole government. The visit must have been organized with the help of the Slovak Embassy in Warsaw, which is under the control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs--part of the government. If, in spite of this information and the preparation, the government failed to prepare documents on the agreements that were expected by the Polish side, this casts doubt on Prime Minister Meciar's claim that Prime Minister Pawlak did not want any meeting between ministers this month. The agreements ought to have been ready, and, when the presidential office voiced the wish that Minister Ducky should accompany the president, I think it was the duty of the government to organize his participation. [passage omitted] [Stukovska] If tension accumulates, there is danger of an explosion. What can be done? This is a question for you as a parliamentary deputy. [Carnogursky] This latest affair with the president's visit to Poland is an obvious failure of the government; therefore, the deputies of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia should draw its' own conclusions. Sooner or later, the issue of a vote of no confidence in the government will come to the fore. [Stukovska] Do you think that this could happen during the current session of parliament? [Carnogursky] It is not likely. [Stukovska] [passage omitted] What are the chances, in your opinion, that the bill on large-scale privatization, which has been discussed and criticized so much, will be passed? [Carnogursky]] [passage omitted] The Slovak papers have been saying for a few days that, if the government bill on large-scale privatization is passed, this will mean that political and economic power will be concentrated in the hands of the government--that is to say, in the hands of one man, Prime Minister Meciar. Commentaries in these papers, which are not in the hands of the KDH, do not welcome the adoption of this law. We agree with them. [end recording]
