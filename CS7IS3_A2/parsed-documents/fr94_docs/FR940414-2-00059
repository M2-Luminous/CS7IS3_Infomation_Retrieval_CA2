FR940414-2-00059 FR940414-2-00041 [Docket No. 93&hyph;55] Michael D. Lawton, M.D.; Revocation of Registration On April 16, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Michael D. Lawton, M.D., 1751 West Romneya, Suite C, Anaheim, California 92801. The Order to Show Cause sought to revoke Dr. Lawton's (Respondent) DEA Certificate of Registration, BL2125068, and deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged that such action was proper in light of the fact that on June 19, 1992, the Medical Board of California, Division of Medical Quality (Board), revoked Respondent's state medical license. Respondent, therefore, was no longer authorized by the State of California to handle controlled substances. On July 2, 1993, Respondent filed a request for a hearing on the matter. The matter was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. On August 2, 1993, the Government filed a motion for summary disposition. Attached to and in support of its motion, the Government filed a copy of the Board's Decision ordering the revocation of Respondent's California Physician and Surgeon's license effective July 19, 1992. The Board revoked Respondent's license based on its finding that Respondent was guilty of, inter alia, gross negligence in his treatment of patients, furnishing controlled substances without a prior good faith examination and without medical indication, prescribing and administering excessive amounts of controlled substances and gross negligence and unprofessional conduct arising from sexual relations with patients. On August 23, 1993, the administrative law judge issued his opinion and recommended decision granting the Government's motion for summary disposition and recommending that the Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, BL2125068, be revoked. On August 31, 1993, Respondent filed a request for reconsideration of the administrative law judge's recommendation alleging, inter alia, that the Board's decision was an ``obvious forgery.'' Respondent denied that the Board had ever revoked his medical license. Respondent further stated that the Board ``has never initiated any discipline of [my] license.'' In response, on September 15, 1993, the Government filed certified copies of the Board's decision, dated June 19, 1992, and of the Board's accusations, dated January 23, 1992, and April 14, 1992, all relating to Respondent's California Physician and Surgeon's Certificate. By order and recommendation dated September 16, 1993, the administrative law judge noted that Respondent's allegation of falsity of the Board's decision was a collateral attack and was not a matter appropriate for consideration in the Federal proceeding. The administrative law judge added that Respondent failed to offer even a ``scintilla'' of evidence to support his argument that the Board's order had been forged. The administrative law judge therefore ruled that his prior recommended ruling granting summary disposition would remain unchanged. It is well established that the Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he does business. See 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The DEA Administrators have consistently held that practitioners who lack state authorization to handle controlled substances cannot be registered with the Drug Enforcement Administration. See Ramon Pla, M.D., 51 FR 41168 (1986); George S. Heath, M.D., 51 FR 26610 (1986); Dale D. Shahan, D.D.S., 51 FR 23481 (1986). Consequently, the Administrator concludes that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration should be revoked based on lack of state authorization. Accordingly, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BL2125068, issued to Michael D. Lawton, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications for registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective May 16, 1994. Dated: April 7, 1994. Thomas A. Constantine, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9024 Filed 4&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
