This Islamic awakening is growing and surging, thanks to our Lord and His care, despite the attempts of the enemies of Islam, here and abroad, to harm and wipe it out. Even after their war against Russia and the collapse of communism, the enemies in the West consider Islam and the Muslims the enemies that must be fought with all efforts. They have kept NATO and are currently trying to bolster it and increase its members. Several regimes in our Arab and Islamic countries responded to this tendency by world enemies. Those regimes persecuted and subdued the Islamic trend and tortured and intimidated its members in a bid to terrorize this trend and prevent the public from cooperating with it. But the Islamic nations, which adhere to their religion, have discovered that the sincere Islamic trend is rallying those who are most devoted to their homelands. It has been proven that the Islamic nations are making sacrifices, shouldering burdens, and enduring afflictions without entertaining any covetous designs. But they are doing so for the sake of God and their countries. At the same time, the Islamic nations are seeing how some of those in power are benefit-seekers and how they are plundering public funds and receiving bribes from big-time thieves. We read about these grotesque crimes in the press every day. But all these crimes are forgotten with the passage of time and the criminals never stood trial or were punished, to avoid scandal. Those who reveal the crimes are tried and condemned, while the real criminal is acquitted. At a time when the widely popular Islamic trend is harassed and prevented from performing its public function on the grounds that its activities are illegal, we see that some parties that are not popular among the people are allowed to perform activities through papers and magazines. Those parties even receive funds and are presented as the representatives of the people. All this is taking place on the basis of a wrong premise. Some ruling regimes resort to this premise to create a balance between the existing powers. Those regimes try to harass the strong Islamic trend to allow antifreedom forces to perform activities in a bid to minimize the people's cooperation with this strong Islamic trend. But no matter how the defeated secular forces and remnants of communism try, they would not be able to influence this religious Muslim people. Perhaps it is useful for the younger generations to know some historical facts about the past: In 1964, Russian Prime Minister Khrushchev came to Egypt to inaugurate the second phase of the High Dam. He insisted that all communist prisoners be released before he arrived in Egypt. He also said that the communists should be allowed to work in the entire Egyptian media service. This is what indeed happened. The communists, who were with us in the same al- Wahat prison, took control of the media and exploited the whole service to spread their ideas and cast doubts in Islam. When al-Sadat assumed power and jumped from the Russian bed to the U.S. bed, he tried to lessen the leftist presence in the media. But the leftist remnants continued their activities. The rulers, however, thought that it would be in their interest to keep the leftists to confront the growing Islamic trend. We now see that the present regime is giving those writers whose hearts are imbued with hatred and rancor against Islam and the Islamic movements free access to the national papers to inject their poison against Islam and describe it with violence and terrorism, using some acts of violence and the killings and counter-killings between some youth and security and police force as their pretext. These acts did not exist before, but came as a result of the policy of suppression and intimidation, economic crises, unemployment, increase in prices. These acts, in addition to the government's policy of meeting violence with violence, add fuel to the fire. The government's tolerance of sinful practices such as drinking alcohol, gambling, usury, prostitution, immoral media, and drugs seems to be an intentional policy to create a balance between religiousness and moral decadence. We have been reading for some time now about planned campaigns against some parties that are trying to protect society from those who seek to spread corruption, cause disintegration, and cast doubt on the faith. We notice that the campaign harms the holy al-Azhar and its ulema, who over the ages stood up against malicious campaigns against Islam, the Egyptian nation's official religion according to the Constitution. Have the remnants of communism forgotten that Russia considered religion the opiate of the people and that it punished anyone in possession of a Koran or anyone who advocated any religion other than communism? Where was the freedom of opinion? Why didn't they object to this kind of suppression? Islam, the righteous religion that God has chosen for his people, is a religion of peace, freedom, justice, security, and safety. Islam does not approve of any injustice by any party against another and is unique in the sense that it promotes virtue and suppresses vice. It is the duty of the nation's ulema to balance things according to Islam's accurate scales and to caution about what is good and what is bad. If a controversy arises over an issue, it should be referred to God's book and to the tradition of his Prophet, may God's prayer and salutation be upon him. There is no human being who knows more about what is good and what is bad for us than God and his messenger. These malicious campaigns are launched by those who are called the vanguard in enlightening public opinion about Islam's darkness and shackles and who claim that religion has no authority over art and literature. We should stand up to these campaigns and refute them with unequivocal arguments. In the first place, reality requires these bats to hide in their holes and in the places of darkness and suppression where communism lived, now that they cannot survive in the age of light in which nations demand freedom and true representation. The people should listen to each party's propaganda and then decide what is right and what is wrong and what is beneficial and what is corrupt. We accept what society decides in genuine, fair elections. But to devise laws marginalizing the Islamic trend and barring this trend from actual participation in legislative elections or to intervene by committing forgery and so forth contradicts the creed of the much-abused democracy. Had the ruling regime not encouraged this approach, no magazine would have dared to publish this stuff, defying the authority of law and the Constitution and even practically annulling them and denigrating al-Azhar's role in protecting society against any attempt to harm it. A society's value depends on its adherence to virtuous principles and keeping away from depraved morals. God, our creator, has laid down these limits for us and explained what is good and what is bad; but to confuse these limits is corruption itself, and we do not trust the intentions of those who advocate such behavior. We know that the enemies of Islam promote such ideas and find people among us who will cooperate with them in the name of freedom. This magazine's challenge, by publishing material unanimously deemed corrupt and mean by the judicial authorities, should not be tolerated in silence by the holy al-Azhar and the Government if they truly mean good for this country. The magazine's publication of excerpts from the book "The Satanic Verses" despite the proven fact that the book attacks Islam and Islam's prophet, is a flagrant declaration of war against Islam, the faith of this Muslim nation. Demonstrations and sacrifices were made in some countries where parts of this book were published. Does the Government realize the danger it poses when at a time when we need help to stop acts of violence, the magazine is fueling the fire? The government should have taken the necessary measures to help create calm and stability by lifting restrictions on liberties and releasing those who have not been incriminated. The government should also stop the sinful practices such as drinking alcohol, prostitution, and usury. It should rectify the government media, which are full of corruption. The government should be firm with both large-scale and small-time thieves and should bring up generations on educational and ethical methods. The Cairo international book fair is approaching. We hope it will be utilized to reform those with corrupt ideas, and not to draw up a plan to harm values and ethics or give an opportunity to those hiding behind the facade of the so-called enlightenment. Let's review the scenes of struggle between the Muslims and others so that we can see who is responsible for the acts of violence and terrorism. Are they Muslims or others? Who are the terrorists in Palestine? Is it the Zionists or the stone-throwers who are defending their land, which the enemy has usurped by means of force, killings, deportations, and displacement? Who are the terrorists in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Is it the Muslims, who are defending their land and who are deprived of weapons, or the Serbs and Croatians, who have killed hundreds of thousands, raped tens of thousands of women, and evicted hundreds of thousands? Who are the terrorists in Kashmir? Are they the Muslims, who have been defending their usurped freedom over the past 40 years, or the Hindu soldiers, who are committing atrocities similar to those being committed in Bosnia-Herzegovina? In Cambodia, the Buddhists are killing hundreds of thousands of Muslims and no one is doing anything to protect the oppressed there. These tragedies are a lasting disgrace for the whole world, which remains silent about these acts. It is also a lasting disgrace in the history of the Arab and Islamic world, which has not taken the appropriate stand dictated by the creed of their peoples--a creed that calls for unity. If we look at the international situation, we will find that the oppressed Muslims are standing fast, enduring, and remaining firm; they have not relinquished their creed or their land. Those Muslims are hopeful that God will support them and will grant them victory ?one day. Here in Egypt we see that despite the harassment of the Islamic trend, the Islamists won victories in the elections in the professional associations and various university faculty clubs. The Islamists scored victories despite the government's unified trade union law, which is difficult to surmount. But the Islamists were prepared for the elections and managed to surmount the obstacles. Perhaps the government is thinking of another solution or of placing more difficult obstacles. But we tell all these people [not further specified] not to swim against the current. We are full of hope that God will not abandon his faithful people and will support righteousness and will destroy falsehood and its advocates. And God hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not [Koranic verse]. Out of sympathy, I advise them to reconsider their position because they will not be able to impede this Islamic awakening. Nor will they be able to dissuade the Egyptian people from demanding the adoption of God's law. God will uphold righteousness and will destroy falsehood. This is God's way and it will not be thwarted. It is better for them and for the country to save their efforts and not to stir up tension, because we need calm and cooperation. I only desire your betterment to the best of my power; and my success in my task can only come from God. [Koranic verse]
