Amendment $130 1Fees will not be charged for orders issued by the Commission pursuant to §2.202 of this chapter or for amendments resulting specifically from the requirements of these types of Commission orders. Fees will be charged for approvals issued under a specific exemption provision of the Commission's regulations under Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (e.g. §§50.12, 73.5) and any other sections now or hereafter in effect regardless of whether the approval is in the form of a license amendment, letter of approval, safety evaluation report, or other form. Fees for licenses in this schedule that are initially issued for less than full power are based on review through the issuance of a full power license (generally full power is considered 100 percent of the facility's full rated power). Thus, if a licensee received a low power license or a temporary license for less than full power and subsequently receives full power authority (by way of license amendment or otherwise), the total costs for the license will be determined through that period when authority is granted for full power operation. If a situation arises in which the Commission determines that full operating power for a particular facility should be less than 100 percent of full rated power, the total costs for the license will be at that determined lower operating power level and not at the 100 percent capacity. 2Full cost fees will be determined based on the professional staff time and appropriate contractual support services expended. For applications currently on file and for which fees are determined based on the full cost expended for the review, the professional staff hours expended for the review of the application up to the effective date of this rule will be determined at the professional rates established for the rules that became effective on June 20, 1984, January 30, 1989, July 2, 1990, August 9, 1991, August 24, 1992, and August 19, 1993, as appropriate. For those applications currently on file for which review costs have reached an applicable fee ceiling established by the June 20, 1984, and July 2, 1990, rules but are still pending completion of the review, the cost incurred after any applicable ceiling was reached through January 29, 1989, will not be billed to the applicant. Any professional staff-hours expended above those ceilings on or after January 30, 1989, will be assessed at the applicable rates established by §170.20, as appropriate, except for topical reports whose costs exceed $50,000. Costs which exceed $50,000 for any topical report, amendment, revision or supplement to a topical report completed or under review from January 30, 1989, through August 8, 1991, will not be billed to the applicant. Any professional hours expended on or after August 9, 1991, will be assessed at the applicable rate established in §170.20. In no event will the total review costs be less than twice the hourly rate shown in §170.20. *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ * 4Fees will not be assessed for requests/reports submitted to the NRC: 1. In response to a Generic Letter or NRC Bulletin that does not result in an amendment to the license, does not result in the review of an alternate method or reanalysis to meet the requirements of the Generic Letter, or does not involve an unreviewed safety issue; 2. In response to an NRC request (at the Associate Office Director level or above) to resolve an identified safety, safeguards, or environmental issue, or to assist NRC in developing a rule, regulatory guide, policy statement, generic letter, or bulletin; or 3. As a means of exchanging information between industry organizations and the NRC for the purpose of supporting generic regulatory improvements or efforts.
