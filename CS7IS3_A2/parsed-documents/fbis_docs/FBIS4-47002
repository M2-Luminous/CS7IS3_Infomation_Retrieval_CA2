The court found in favor of the plaintiff in this lawsuit. The essence of this case lay in the fact that on 2 December 1993 the Russian Federation Ministry of the Press and Information sent an official warning--signed by V.F. Shumeyko--to the editors of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. This warning asserted that, by publishing in the 30 November 1993 issue a draft edict by the president of the Russian Federation on the administrative-territorial unification of the city of Moscow and Moscow Oblast, the editors had "used the mass media for the purpose of committing a criminally punishable act," and that "the information is false inasmuch as no such draft exists." The warning was incorrect both in substance (the draft edict did exist) and in form; the reference to Section 59, Part 2 and Section 51 of the Russian Federation Law on the Mass Media had no legal force inasmuch as these sections do not provide for intervention by a ministry in the form of a warning. Nor did NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA violate Section 4 of the Russian Federation Law on the Mass Media, i.e., it did not "use the mass media for the purpose of committing a criminally punishable act." The court agreed with the plaintiff's arguments. The decision recognizing the illegality of the warning issued by the Ministry of the Press took effect on 1 May 1994. The Press Committee did not appeal it. Attorney Raisa Tyurina defended NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's interests in this case.
