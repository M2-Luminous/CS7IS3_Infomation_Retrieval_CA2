In each party bloc new leaders are gradually occupying leadership positions at the side of others with more experience. -- PSDB -- Leader Jose Serra appears in all important negotiations, from discussions on the presidential succession to talks on constitutional revision, thus consolidating the prestige he earned when he participated in the Constituent Congress. The figure who represents the party is Senate leader Mario Covas (SP). Deputy Sergio Machado (CE) operates as a bridge between Congress and Ceara's powerful party wing. When economic questions appear, negotiations always include newcomer (and alternate member) Jose Anibal (SP), who has direct access to Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and the ability of a veteran politician. -- PPR -- The party's star is its president, Senator Esperidiao Amin (SC [Santa Catarina]), but Senate PPR leader Epitafio Cafeteira (MA [Maranhao]) is a rare case of a callous politician who still has influence within the party. As a blessing for the party bloc, the CPI multiplied the prestige of Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PA [Para]). In the Chamber of Deputies, new bloc leader Marcelino Guilherme Romano (SP) is the voice of Mayor Paulo Maluf. At times, when moral values are on the spot, the prestige of Deputy Adylson Motta, of Rio Grande do Sul, increases. He is the champion of diligence, so much so that he opens the doors of the plenum auditorium every day. The most promising newcomer is Fetter Junior (RS [Rio Grande do Sul]), who formulates the party's proposals for the constitutional revision. -- PFL -- Marco Maciel (PE), party bloc leader in the Senate, maintains his traditional influence in the party bloc and participates in all important negotiations. In the Chamber of Deputies, Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes showed great ability and is one of those rare figures who can really speak for the party bloc. Roberto Magalhaes and Gustavo Krause, both from Pernambuco and newcomers to the Chamber of Deputies, have increased their influence in the past few months, thanks to the CPI on corruption in the case of Magalhaes, and the constitutional revision in the case of Krause. -- PMDB -- The collapse of [Orestes] Quercia's support group split the party bloc. Several PMDB followers must be consulted for any negotiation. Leader Tarcisio Delgado (MG [Minas Gerais]) speaks with the accent of an old MDB [former PMDB party name] authentic wing member. He has to add his voice to the voices of party President Luiz Henrique da Silveira (SC) and Deputy Odacir Klein (RS) to be heard. Deputy Roberto Rollemberg (SP) inherited Quercia's representation because he was an investigator -- and not investigated -- by the CPI on the budget scandal. The rest of the party follows regional leaders. -- The left -- PT leader Jose Genoino (SP) and Paulo Delgado (MG) form a supra-party group of the left that has the support of Miro Teixeira (PDT-RJ [Democratic Workers Party-Rio de Janeiro]) and Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB-DF). Besides their personal affinities, they almost form a new political party in Congress and work as a communication channels between the left and pressure groups outside Congress. The CPI served to bring to the fore a skillful politician from the PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil] bloc, Deputy Sergio Miranda (MG), but created problems for a well- known star: PT leader Aloizio Mercadante (SP), who came out tarnished together with Congress's so-called "low clergymen" [congressional leaders indicted by the CPI].
