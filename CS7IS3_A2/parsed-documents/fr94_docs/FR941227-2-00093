ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Richard J. Smith (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant to Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned Permit Number PRT&hyph;787880. The requested permit, which is for a period of 5 years, would authorize the incidental take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler ( Dendroica chrysoparia ). The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction of a single family residence at Lot 37, Section 4, Block D, Jester Point 2, Travis County, Texas. The Service has prepared an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not be made before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). DATES: Written comments on the application and EA/HCP should be received on or before January 26, 1995. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the application may obtain a copy by writing to the Assistant Regional Director, Ecological Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 1306, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87103. Persons wishing to review the EA/HCP may obtain a copy by contacting Joseph E. Johnston, Ecological Services Field Office, 10711 Burnet Road, Suite 200, Austin, Texas 78758 (512/490&hyph;0063). Documents will be available for public inspection by written request, by appointment only, during normal business hours (8:00 to 4:00) at the Southwest Regional Office, Division of Endangered Species/Permits, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 1306, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87103, or the Ecological Services Field Office (9:00 to 4:30), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 10711 Burnet Road, Suite 200, Austin, Texas 78758. Written data or comments concerning the application should be submitted to the Acting Field Supervisor, Ecological Services Field Office, Austin, Texas (see ADDRESSES above). Please refer to Permit Number PRT&hyph;787880 when submitting comments. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph E. Johnston at the above Austin Ecological Service Field Office. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``taking'' of endangered species such as the golden-cheeked warbler. However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at 50 CFR 17.22. Richard J. Smith plans to construct a single family residence at Lot 37, Section 4, Block D, Jester Point 2 Subdivision, Travis County, Texas. This action will eliminate one half acre of, and indirectly impact one additional acre of golden-cheeked warbler habitat. The applicant proposes to compensate for this incidental take of golden-cheeked warbler habitat by placing $2,000 into the City of Austin Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Fund to acquire/manage lands for the conservation of the golden-cheeked warbler. Alternatives to this action were rejected because selling or not developing the subject property with federally listed species present was not economically feasible. James A. Young, Acting Regional Director, Region 2, Albuquerque, New Mexico. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31734 Filed 12&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;M
