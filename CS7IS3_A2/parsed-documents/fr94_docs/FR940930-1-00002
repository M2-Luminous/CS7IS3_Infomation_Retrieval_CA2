Comments on the proposed rule were required to be received on or before August 29, 1994. During the comment period, we received a request from a State Department of Agriculture that we extend the comment period. The commenter stated that additional time was necessary to allow interested parties and agencies within the State to evaluate fully and respond to the proposed rule. In response to this comment, and so that we may consider comments received after August 29, 1994, we are reopening and extending the public comment period on Docket No. 87&hyph;090&hyph;1 until 60 days after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register .
