Sha'ul Gutman said their main policy plank would be transfer of the Arab population. He claimed the existing party, under Rehav'am Ze'evi, no longer represented this policy. The new group is to be led by Miryam Lapid of Hebron, who lost her husband and son in a terrorist attack. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 25 January adds that "the new movement is called Peace Guard [mishmeret shalom], and transfer is its motto."]
