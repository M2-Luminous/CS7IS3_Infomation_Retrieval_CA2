FBIS4-37104 "drnes117_k_94006" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 IRAQ Paper on Saudi `Military Buildup' on Yemeni Border Paper on Saudi `Military Buildup' on Yemeni Border JN1706102094 Baghdad INA in Arabic 0800 GMT 17 Jun 94 JN1706102094 Baghdad INA Arabic BFN [Text] Baghdad, 17 Jun (INA)--An Iraqi newspaper has asserted that the new Saudi military buildup on the Yemeni border is no surprise for those who have been following the Saudi regime's policy and planned roles, which basically aim to destroy all constituents of the Arab nation's strength and unity. In an article today, AL-THAWRAH adds: This buildup is another link in an aggressive conspiratorial chain. Saudi Arabia has already implemented links in this chain by expelling more than half a million Yemeni workers from Saudi Arabia. It was also behind most of the assassinations and disturbances that took place in Yemen following Yemeni unity. Moreover, the Fahd regime refrained from addressing the border problem with Yemen. Afterward, the most obvious link became clear with the arms and financial support that Saudi Arabia provided to the secessionists, in addition to the Saudi political and diplomatic moves in this regard. AL-THAWRAH points out that the Saudi policy against Yemen is part of an imperialist-Zionist conspiracy designed to fragment the Arab homeland. This policy complements the 30-state aggression on Iraq, exploiting the regional and international situation created as a result of this aggression. The paper wonders: Would the agent Fahd's regime dare to undermine Yemen's unity and harm the Yemeni people if the Arab situation were different, a situation that resulted from the wounds the Arabs caused to Iraq and from their unjust embargo imposed on it? The paper also wonders: Would this regime be able to do what it pleases and rally the positions of the traitors, agents, hirelings, and renegades against Yemen's unity if there were sound logic governing the concept of Arab solidarity? It adds: The policy of agentry, treason, and aggression, which has blindfolded the Saudi rulers, must eventually lead them to a terrible end. This is because the power they are relying on is not their intrinsic power in the first place; they are only implementing an imperialist scheme. One who relies on a foreigner cannot be safe in the long run. AL-THAWRAH adds: The political opportunity that has pushed the Fahd regime toward both recklessness and brandishing force against all that is a genuine Arab is actually a transient opportunity. The Saudi rulers should learn a lesson from Iraq's steadfastness and from Yemeni unity, knowing that the need for this unity was unanimously emphasized by the Yemeni people. These rulers should also learn from what is taking place inside Saudi Arabia itself where decay, scandals, and collapse are spreading.
