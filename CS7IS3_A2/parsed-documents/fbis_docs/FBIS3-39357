Then, too, the world counted down the time to the moment when the deadline would expire, and then, too, the deadline led to increased diplomatic activity to try to avoid a fatal explosion. For the time being most Western governments are assuming that military action will not be necessary. They are counting on the Serbs and the Bosnian Government Army to hand over their heavy weapons to the United Nations within the deadline. Such positions show again -- in so far as that was still necessary -- that no one is burning to really intervene. That is the big difference with the Gulf war. Then, Western leaders were determined to join battle with Saddam Husayn, no matter what the consequences. The Bosnian tragedy soon will have unfurled itself before everyone for two years and no one has ever shown the same determination. Despite the far more serious human rights violations, the bloodbaths, the "ethnic cleansing," the destruction of everything a Western democracy claims it believes in, no Western leader has ever taken action to make it clear that enough was enough. That is not simply linked to a painful lack of courage, but has just as much to do with a lack of strategy. The truth, which no one likes to hear, is that this crisis has demonstrated the limits of the West's power and possibilities in the most painful way. The West has allowed itself to be dragged into a swamp from which it was impossible to escape. The only way out of the policies followed up to now is ever greater involvement at an ever higher cost, with diminishing chances of a real solution. It is strange to hear Foreign Minister Willy Claes now admit this. Even at the time of the Bosnia conference in London in August 1992, everyone who had followed the crisis could unerringly predict this scenario. By carrying out air strikes against Serb positions, NATO hopes to break through this spiral. And much is at stake for the organization. The Western military alliance also shares the impotence of the European Union and the United Nations. What it comes down to for NATO is restoring its credibility. Air strikes may achieve this goal, but they will contribute nothing to the real goal, namely a just solution to the crisis. The idea underlying the NATO threat is that the Bosnian Government will be forced to agree to the division of the country. If the Serbs give up their siege of Sarajevo, they will be able to negotiate from the strongest position. They will no longer have to fear attack and therefore will be rewarded for their aggression. The Bosnian Government could then do nothing else but give in. If it did not do so, then it would isolate itself. Indeed, then the victims of the war would be regarded as an obstacle on the way to peace. As NATO understands, its air strikes provide no guarantee that the Serbs will not restart the struggle or that they will not move it to Tuzla or Srebenica or another safe area. Nor are they any guarantee that the crisis will not break out in Kosovo, where a time bomb has been ticking away for a long time. NATO, the EU, and the United Nations are now in the situation where no intervention of any kind will provide any kind of solution. Air strikes are no way out, but no one could bear to look on any further, and no one wants to send even more UN troops into a hopeless situation. Everyone is now learning the bitter lesson that the chances which were lost right at the beginning are now taking a huge revenge. By intervening earlier, the Serbs could have been curbed, the parties could have been forced to negotiate seriously, and thousands of people could have been saved. The West is now paying a high price in Bosnia for its lack of courage and short-sighted policies. And everyone fears that the price has not yet been paid in full.
