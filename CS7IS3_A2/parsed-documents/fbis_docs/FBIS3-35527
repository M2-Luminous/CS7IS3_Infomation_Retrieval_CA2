In an exclusive statement to MENA, he added that the massacre was carried out with the cooperation and oversight of the Israeli Army. This constitutes a dangerous turning point in the peace process. At a time when Israel has been trying through the negotiations to get control of the crossings, under the pretext of security, it leaves the occupied territories flooded with arms, especially in the hands of the obsessed settlers. This constitutes an abnormal danger for the march to peace. He said Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who does not want to respect the dates [for implementing the agreements with the Palestinians], does not consider them sacred, and is in no hurry to implement the peace process either in letter or spirit, is opening up opportunities to such murderers to commit such ugly crimes. He added that this heinous massacre affirms once again the importance of moving the settlements, which were established through aggression and against the legitimate international resolutions and international law. He insisted that the responsibility for this massacre falls on the shoulders of the Israeli cabinet and its prime minister, Yitzhaq Rabin. They are also responsible for preventing repetitions of similar acts and for punishing the murderers and stopping them from committing further such crimes.
