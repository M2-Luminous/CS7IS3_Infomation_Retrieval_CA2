The attacks are particularly concentrating in the region of Gradina on the right bank of the Drina River, from the direction of Foca and Cajnice." As correspondent from Gorazde Fahrudin Bekcic then reports, "eight injured and one killed is the final outcome of the chetnik rampage over the last 24 hours. The artillery attacks that had started yesterday stopped briefly just after midnight, to be continued with even greater ferocity at 0510 this morning. More than 2,000 shells of various calibers have landed in a matter of only a few hours. The aggressor is displaying the most intense attacks in the direction of Cajnice. They are attacking the entire defense line on the right bank of the Drina River between Osanica and Ustipraca with howitzers, tanks, mortars of all calibers, antiaircraft machine guns, self-propelled antiaircraft artillery, and hill guns. Another 10 trucks with fresh enemy forces arrived in this area at approximately 0500 hours. Perfectly reliable information claims that there are numerous Montenegrin reservists and mercenaries among them." As Bekcic continues to report, "the situation is equally dramatic on the other side, in the part of the battlefield toward Rogatica and in other directions." He concludes that "according to the reports from the field, this is the most powerful attack in this region" so far. A report by Smajl Terzic from the information service of the 7th South Operative Group of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army claims that "the aggressor has been attacking the defense lines in the zone of responsibility of the 7th South Operative Group from all available arms overnight. The situation was the most stormy near (Buzno Groblje) and (?Plane), where the united units in a counteroffensive pushed the chetniks back and conquered domineering elevations from which the enemy had been pounding the free territory day and night. Plenty of ammunition and arms were seized in this action. In retaliation for numerous losses in manpower and military hardware, the chetniks shelled the civilian targets in Mrkotic where one woman died. They are constantly attacking the Pejici-Bandera defense line, as well as (Krh and Svijakovac) from Dedovo Brdo."
