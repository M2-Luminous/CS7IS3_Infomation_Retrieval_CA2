In the hour-long call placed by Kim at 11:08 A.M., the two presidents agreed that U.N. Security Council sanctions hold the key to settling the nuclear row with North Korea and that they would seek sanctions through cooperation among Korea, the United States and Japan, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said. Clinton promised to see to it that the Security Council refrains from taking steps opposed by South Korea, saying what is most important for North Korea now is to alter its stance toward atomic power development. On former President Jimmy Carter's plan to visit North Korea, the incumbent American president said Carter would be going to Pyongyang as a private individual having nothing to do with him or the U.S. Government. Carter will not carry any U.S. Government messages to Pyongyang, Clinton said, stressing that his support for U.N. Security Council sanctions against North Korea would not swerve even if Carter brought back a message from Pyongyang. When he meets Kim Il-song in Pyongyang, the former president will explain the feelings and concerns of the international community about North Korea's nuclear development program. Kim, explaining the outcome of his Russian trip including Russia's decision to suspend arms sales to Pyongyang, kill the Pyongyang-Moscow mutual assistance pact and hand over Russian documents on the Korean war, said the Kremlin appeared to have made a decisive change in its policy toward North Korea. Kim and Clinton also exchanged views on China's position on Security Council sanctions against North Korea, while agreeing to hold another telephone talk on the nuclear issue. On June 3 when Clinton was touring Europe, he phoned Kim in Moscow to discuss joint measures the two countries should take on the nuclear standoff. Before his departure for Moscow on June 1, Kim called up Clinton to discuss the same issue.
