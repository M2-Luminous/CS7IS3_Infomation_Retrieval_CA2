The president's recent message to the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State" laid special emphasis on the duty of all organs of power to create conditions conducive to improving the environment. After all, environmental safety is an integral part of Russia's national security. For a long time our country fought vigorously with nature, subjugated it, and transformed it, and now the time has come to settle the accounts. We are paying with our health and the future of our children. If we were to calculate the monetary equivalent, ecologists estimate that our country would need fantastic sums of money to bring the environment up to Western standards. Many readers write and ask who exactly in Russia watches over citizens' constitutional right to clean water, air, and soil. The question is more than relevant. Everyone has heard of the "Green" movement, "Kedr," and similar social organizations, but we also have state structures. How many are there, what do they do, and what are their responsibilities? We will discuss this under our new rubric, "Nature and Power." The Russian Federation now has an established system of bodies responsible for environmental protection: a federal ministry, territorial subdivisions for the protection and rational use of natural resources, and a number of state bodies whose functions include monitoring and inspecting the use of certain natural resources and pollution of the environment: the State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision; committees for land resources and land management, geology and the use of mineral resources, fisheries, and water resources; a federal service for hydrometeorology and monitoring of the environment; and a federal forestry service. A Higher Environmental Council is being formed in the State Duma. In addition, a Council for Environmental Policy has been set up under the Russian Federation president, and the Russian Federation Security Council has an interdepartmental commission for environmental safety. The General Prosecutor's Office has a department for supervising implementation of environmental protection legislation. In fact, there are special subdivisions responsible for environmental protection in the organizational structures of every branch of power. We will start by acquainting ourselves with the country's main environmental department: the Ministry for Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources. It enjoys the status of a federal ministry in the structure of organs of executive power approved by presidential edict in January. However, the work of the ministry, whose objectives are incorporated in its name, is not very well known to a broad audience. Moreover, the social status of our environmental department does not correspond to the status of similar structures in Western countries. The structure of the ministry's central apparatus is as follows. The leadership forms the upper level. Below are the main administrations: environmental expert assessment; mineral reserves; science and technology; environmental safety; use of natural resources; environmental programs; nature reserves; natural biological resources; international cooperation; legal normative regulation; financing and development of materials and equipment; protection of the atmosphere; protection of the water table; the environmental protection maritime service; protection of soil and land resources; and protection of the environment from industrial and consumer waste. A federal environmental fund and a public reception center are attached to the ministry. As a whole, the structure of the central apparatus corresponds to the main areas of environmental protection activity. There are also shortcomings typical of state bodies in our country: the organization and administration department, for example, whose staff is more than double that of far more important subdivisions. I should point out for the sake of objectivity, however, that it is proposed to improve the ministry's structure. Protection of the environment is one of the main national priorities of developed countries, where state environmental services have been in operation for decades. In our country, however, the environmental department is still in its infancy, as the RSFSR State Committee for Nature Protection was set up only in 1988; this was later transformed into a ministry, and the law "On Protection of the Environment," which is essentially the basis of the ministry's activity, came into effect only in 1992. Our main environmental protection department has undergone several reorganizations in the last five years, apparently whenever the ministry has been finding its feet and starting to monitor monopolistic departments responsible for pollution. Clearly, such reorganizations are not conducive to resolving environmental problems at state level and prevent the environmental protection department from fulfilling its basic tasks. The Ministry for Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources should be responsible for general coordination of the activity of ministries, departments, enterprises, institutions, and organizations in the field of protection of the environment and natural resources; conduct an integrated science and technology policy in this sphere; develop and improve economic, legal, and administrative mechanisms for the use of natural resources; organize and set in motion state commissions of environmental experts; and much more. The ministry has a sufficiently sound research base: Under its jurisdiction it has more than 20 institutes and centers, whose main function is to form science and technology policy in the field of environmental protection. In addition, it can enlist the scientific potential of the Russian Academy of Sciences and state universities. The ministry draws up specially targeted environmental programs. The best known is the federal science and technology program entitled "Russia's Environmental Safety," the drafting and implementation of which have had strong repercussions in environmental circles. Environmental protection problems are also reflected in other major programs: "The Revival of the Volga," "The Oka -- a Clean River," "Waste," "Conversion -- Ecology," "Radon," "Dioxins," and others. First Deputy Minister Professor A.F. Poryadin has highlighted the following priority areas of the ministry's activity: First, it is vital to secure legislative and normative support for environmental protection activity and to adopt a complex of laws and legally binding acts in this sphere. The law "On Protection of the Environment" has undoubtedly played a positive role, but it is impossible to improve the environment in Russia without the system of environmental legislation that exists in Western countries. Second, there must be financial and economic support for environmental protection activity, so that the thin, constantly interrupted stream of budget funding is augmented by resources received on the basis of the principle "there are no free natural resources" and "polluters must pay." Finally, optimum organizational and structural support based on Russia's specific features will have considerable importance for the efficiency of all environmental protection activity in our country. There is no developed system of organization and collaboration between all the structures functioning in the environmental protection sphere. There are no clear responsibilities, while at the same time, for example, territorial environmental protection bodies are subordinate to the ministry, on the one hand, and to the local administration, on the other. In such cases there is always "confusion and hesitation," financial complications, a lack of responsibility, and the possibility of arbitrariness. Ecology is part of the economy and politics, so drawing up a strategy in the environmental protection sphere is the state's prerogative. In this sense, the recent presidential edict "On the State Strategy of the Russian Federation To Protect the Environment and Ensure Its Stable Development" is more than topical. Having said that, it will require colossal efforts -- mainly on the part of the Ministry for Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources and territorial environmental protection bodies -- to achieve a breakthrough in the environmental situation in our country. We will continue to acquaint you with various environmental protection structures and talk about their work and the problems facing them in coming issues.
