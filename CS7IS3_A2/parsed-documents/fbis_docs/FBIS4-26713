The blast wrecked the Hong Kong-invested Huaxin Chemical Company Ltd factory at 7:45 am while the seven people were mixing a solvent adhesive in the workshop, according to Yang Wanlu, an official from Beijing's Municipal Labour Bureau. "One of the reasons for the accident was the joint venture's poor management and improper operation," said Yang. Since June last year, a number of major industrial accidents with fatalities have hit the headlines, particularly from the southern coastal areas. Many of the disasters have been attributed to slack management and lax safety procedures.
