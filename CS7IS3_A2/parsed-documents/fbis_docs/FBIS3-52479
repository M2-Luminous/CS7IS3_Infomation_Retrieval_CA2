The controversy comes five months ahead of a planned visit by Pope John Paul II. Shaykh Ja'far al-Sayigh, a Shiite Muslim cleric in Qana, said over the weekend that a mosque should be built above a cave there which many Lebanese revere as the site where Christ changed water into wine during a wedding. His call has also revived a centuries' old debate on whether the biblical Qana was located in Lebanon, east of the southern port of Tyre, or in the Galilee region of what is now northern Israel. House Speaker Nabih Birri said that he took proof of the Lebanese claim when he was received by the pope in November at the Vatican. Birri condemned the shaykh's call saying it was "very far from our traditions, our habits, our Islam and our Christianity." "Qana is a symbol for us and we refuse to let it become a meeting place for extremism and fanaticism," he said. Muslim clerics and Christian dignitaries have rallied to Birri's side. "We must preserve the historical sites in the region of Qana al-Jalil, which represents a meeting place for the Christian and Muslim religions," said Shaykh Ali al-Amin, president of the Imam al-Sadr Institute for Islamic Studies. He called on the inhabitants of Qana "to close ranks" against the mosque proposal. "Land where Christ walked becomes sacred and we must preserve it," the cleric said. The head of the Catholic Church in Tyre, Monsignor Yuhanna Haddad, praised Birri's position. And the parish priest in Qana, Mikha'il 'Abbud, said troops were deployed around the cave over the weekend to protect the site. The pope announced on December 21 plans to visit Lebanon in the first half of 1994. Vatican sources said the visit might take place in May or June. The pontiff is expected to visit south Lebanon during his visit. [Beirut Radio Lebanon at 1630 GMT on 4 January adds the following: "Sidon's Ja'farite mufti Sayyid Muhammad Hasan al-Amin called on Shaykh Ja'far al-Sayigh and his aides to reconsider their decision to build a mosque in front of the historical cave of Qana to safeguard national coexistence, especially as the south has always embraced both Christian and Muslim values." [In a related item in the same cast, the radio adds: "Chamber of Deputies member Muhammad Qabbani has denounced recent incidents that occurred in the south and the north under the guise of religion, stressing that they were provoked by ignoramuses, not people of faith." [Elsewhere, Beirut Voice of Lebanon in Arabic at 1715 GMT on 4 January reports: "Minister of State Jean 'Ubayd today praised Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri's opposition to extremism and to what Birri described as waves of insanity. ["'Ubayd said Speaker Birri's stand against overzealousness and extremism expresses his patriotic and pan-Arab policy. Minister 'Ubayd called for reviving wisdom, strength, unity, and dignity in this country and nation. He called for silencing such voices and all those involved in schemes to partition the country and provoke infighting. 'Ubayd said he believes the state must prepare to confront such schemes by forging greater solidarity among its institutions and acting firmly and sternly against anyone who threatens the state's security, the homeland's unity, and the country's sanctities, liberties, and taboos."]
