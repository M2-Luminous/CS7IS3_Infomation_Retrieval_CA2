According to news release from Geneva available here, the spokesman said the NATO's shotdown of four of the six aircraft over central Bosnia early this morning was clearly authorized by UN Security Council Resolution 816, which was aimed at ensuring compliance with the ban "proportionate to the specific circumstances and the nature of the flights." "Today's action was entirely justified and should not be used by any of the parties to distract from the pressing need to negotiate a settlement to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina," he said. According to the information director of the UN Protection Force in the Former Yugoslavia (Unprofor), the NATO planes were patrolling the "no-fly" zone over Bosnia when the incident occurred. It was the first time that NATO warplanes have taken this action since the "no-fly" zone was declared in October 1992. The Unprofor said the NATO aircraft encountered six Galeb aircraft. They challenged them and warned them twice that they were flying in violation of the Security Council resolution on the issue.
