Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion of reunification. The statement scathingly denounces the traitor Kim Yong-sam's fascist step as an intolerable insult to the patriotic spirit of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a grave infringement on the compatriotic feelings of the entire youth and students and people in the North and a total denial of ethics and morality. The statement says: "It is outrageous of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique to talk about `organisation benefiting the enemy' and `nuclear issue' for justifying their act this time. "Denying the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon) means denying great unity of the nation, and the latter means denying national reunification. "The entire youth and students in the northern half of the country will become flames burning injustice and immorality and standard-bearers of great national unity, punish the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique seeking a way out in dependence on outside forces and North-South confrontation and achieve national reunification which was the lifelong wish of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic martyr for reunification, rallied around Pomchonghaknyon, the vanguard of Pomminnyon."
