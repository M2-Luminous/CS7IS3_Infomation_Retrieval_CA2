FBIS3-37944 "drsov037_b_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-037 Document Type:Daily Report 24 Feb 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political Issues Yeltsin Addresses Nation, Federal Assembly 24 Feb LD2402101594 Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network in Russian 0800 GMT 24 Feb 94 LD2402101594 Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network Language: Russian Article Type:BFN [Speech by President Boris Yeltsin to the Federal Assembly in Moscow -- live] [Text] Esteemed chairmen of the Federation Council and the State Duma, esteemed members of the Federation Council, esteemed deputies of the State Duma: It is with special feeling that I have stepped to this podium. Today's address is an extraordinary event in my life and in my political career. It is the first time that the new Russian parliament is to hear the president's address. Russia begins to chart its policy in a new way. Writing this address was not an easy task. The difficulty was because I wanted to put too many things into it. We need to accomplish still more. Therefore, it is important not to dissipate our efforts and concentrate everything--our resources, political will, intellectual potential, and the people's enormous desire to live better--on the key areas in order to achieve the results together. This is why not only the present situation but also the ideas for the future proposed by you--including those put forward during the election campaign--are reflected in this address. Regrettably, in 1993 a lot of energy was expended on tough political confrontation. Extreme measures could not be avoided, either. But we prevented civil war. People could see for themselves that there would be no winners in an irreconcilable struggle. It can have only one result--the destruction of Russia. The time of internecine strife has expired completely for Russia. There were successes and profound disappointments on the path of reforms. But if you ask me today if I would start these difficult changes again, the answer will be unequivocally yes. Both then and now I am convinced that there was no other path. In January 1992 we were forced to start something we could not avoid. We are gradually learning lessons during every month of our lives. It is impossible to transform a country like Russia in one attempt. What is needed is a flexible, long-term, anticipatory policy that takes into account Russia's peculiarities, the national character, and changes in the public interests and moods--the mentality of the people of Russia--which for decades was being molded in a different direction. In the last few months we have come to understand better one important truth: In order to achieve success, we need to bring into play tremendous and so far almost unused reserves--the reserves of cooperation in constructive work. This is an indisputable requirement for all of us, for those who have entered parliament, for those who are prepared to share the responsibility for Russia's destiny. Let us be realistic and let us acknowledge that a part of the opposition still wants to take revenge by force. On both sides there are those blinded by the need to take revenge on their ideological opponents. However, hatred and the thirst for vengeance can only worsen Russia's serious illness. I want to say another thing: Social accord is not forgiveness for all. Compassion is compassion only when it does not contravene the law and moral standards. There is a foundation for accord in Russia today: the Constitution--adopted by a popular vote. Let us ask ourselves: Is there another, more solid foundation? There is not. No one party, no one movement, no one group of intellectuals, no one politician or statesman has the same degree of support today as the Constitution. It won the votes of people of the most varied convictions and outlooks. Having lost faith in many things, they nonetheless went to the polling stations and gave to the state a law that is binding, above all, on those who are in power. Our country is experiencing today one of the most complex moments of its history; however, Russia did not begin with Peter the Great or the October Revolution of 1917. It does not end with the collapse of the communist superpower. The empire that not long ago intimidated all of mankind while suppressing real life for the Russian people and all of its other peoples is no more. The Russian state, however, has still not taken a worthy place in the world community. We no longer have the state that acted as a strict supervisor and ruthless judge toward its subjects. We should also acknowledge, however, that there is still the absence of a fully democratic and lawful state in Russia. Most people are constantly worried about what tomorrow will bring, about the future of their children and their elderly parents. But the authorities, both in the center and in the regions, seem not to notice the rapid stratification of society. One has to act responsibly and acknowledge that we are underestimating all the dangers this stratification brings. I am not calling for a return to universal egalitarianism in poverty, to the notorious dispossession of the kulaks. But in this matter, in this extremely fine matter so painful for society, one should not allow the process to be totally spontaneous and uncontrolled. We are painfully learning that a bureaucratic and self-devouring economy, in which 10 people are doing what one person can normally do, has no future. But so far we do not have a normal market economy either. It is those who cheat and use violence who are at ease. The honest, enterprising people who are not afraid of working and taking risks find it extremely difficult today to start their own business and grow. All these are today's realities, however hard it is to admit it. True, our country has greater freedom, but this is not enough. Our task is to ensure that Russia has greater justice, security, and confidence in today and tomorrow. We have already seen that it is impossible to build Russia properly at the will of some manager, party, or individual. The time has come for a new political style of trust and constructive cooperation, mutual understanding, and agreed action. The time has come for a nationwide action that can unite efforts of all of us. We have such an action. It is the strengthening of statehood, the strengthening of the Russian state. Let's acknowledge at last: As long as we have a weak state, there is no basic law and order in the country. All residents of the country and all peoples of Russia are interested in a stable and strong state because all of us, irrespective of our nationality or place of residence, need civil peace and not interethnic conflicts. All parties and political movements and all factions of the State Duma should be interested in strengthening the state. It is only in a sound and strong state that they can count on an honest implementation of the interests of their supporters. Our closest neighbors have a vested interest in the Russian state being stable and strong, for it is precisely a strong Russia that is the most reliable and realistic guarantor of stability for the whole territory of the former USSR. The world community also needs a strong Russia; otherwise, it will be a permanent source of threat to security and to mankind. A strong and vigorous state is a most important condition for the continuation of transformations in our country. A healthy and civilized market will not gain a firm foothold without such a state; nor will democracy reveal its true worth or the great Russian culture and morality be reborn. The strengthening of our state is an indisputable goal that can and should unite all Russian people in this dramatic period the country is going through. The strengthening of the state is a task for us all. It will make it possible for the president, the Federal Assembly, the government, and the constituent parts of the Federation to all channel their energy for the good of Russia. We began this work many times over the past few years; however, until now it had no legal basis to underpin it and was carried out in a chaotic and inconsistent manner. The state, in its current configuration, fails to cope with its most important functions. This pertains, above all, to safeguarding order and the rights and safety of citizens. The country is being engulfed by crime. To this day, the existing state structures are permeated by a spirit of irresponsibility and arbitrariness. Life in our country is still bound up in innumerable petty restrictions and limitations. The work of both central and local authorities suffers from much confusion and incompetence. The army of bureaucrats is rapidly growing. In a situation of heightened financial tension, the federal authorities, with amazing ease, are spending vast sums of money on themselves. This growing appetite is doing more to undermine the state's reputation than any mistakes or miscalculations. This is not to mention the taxpayers' pocket: It is their money that supports all of us. All this testifies to the fact that a new alienation between the authorities and the everyday needs of the people is appearing and has appeared. If bureaucracy previously stood between them and the nomenkatura caste, then today money must be included as well. It is precisely the disgrace of corruption that is increasingly often the gulf preventing a solution to many issues. This is what I was speaking of: the grave illness of Russian statehood. The task to unite us today--the president, parliament, and government--is to stop these destructive processes. We do not have to create anything. We have only one effective medicine and that is to strengthen the state on the basis of the Constitution. This will produce a result if we work together. We need a common program of state reforms in the Russian Federation. Its strategic aims are: First, the state authorities should work not for themselves but for the precisely identified and formulated interests of Russia and its citizens. This means a shift away from the policy of impulsive reactions toward a strategy of considered anticipatory actions. Second, power should be effective. This means the desire and ability to finish off what has been started and to assess very toughly any possible shortcomings in the decisions made. Judicial reform occupies an important place here. A strong third estate does not weaken but, on the contrary, strengthens the other estates. I attach particular importance to the Constitutional Court, which should objectively interpret the Constitution. Local self-government needs to be developed and provided with legislation. In this connection, perhaps there could be joint consideration of the timing of elections. Serious attention needs to be paid to reform in the army, to regulating the state border regime, and much more. Third, an end must be put to the apparatus free-for-all, in which any sensible decision or initiative is stifled in the death grip of the apparatus. The method is known: the clear regulation of functions and responsibilities. Unfortunately, this is absent thus far. Fourth, power must become open and understandable for people. This means that dialogue needs to be developed, the formation of a civic society needs to be promoted, and we should not cut ourselves off from the mass media, but rather help them to pursue the policy of constantly removing state control from the press--although, there needs to be moderation here as well, of course. The television channel that, via the Orbita system, preserves the integrity of the Russian information zone and encompasses the near abroad and European countries, should have the state as its proprietor. A strong state is essential, above all, to combat crime. This is the most important issue of the year. In this respect, our cooperation is especially necessary. The public awaits from the Federal Assembly laws on which the state can rely to defend their safety and tranquillity. I think that it is correct to combine two ideas here. The first is to continue preparation of new criminal legislation. The current legislation is hopelessly out of date, and it is increasingly difficult for the law-enforcement agencies to use it to oppose criminality. The second is to adopt laws designed to resolve urgent issues of providing the law-enforcement agencies with the essential statutory documents. Rapid drafting and adoption by parliament of a law on extraordinary measures to suppress crime should be the first move in this direction. Russians will accept such a decision with understanding. The law-enforcement system is also ready for its implementation. Our mutual task in this area is not to sink into a state of affairs in which extraordinary emergency measures are again becoming institutionalized. We should not allow any infringement of citizens' rights. We should give necessary powers to the law-enforcement agencies. We should also mobilize all the state and public institutions for fighting crime and clearly define their tasks and their responsibilities. Tired of waiting in vain for the federal legislative acts, authorities in a number of regions have already started implementing similar measures themselves. By doing this, they have succeeded not only in putting criminal situation securely under control, but also in improving it. We have no right to economize on ensuring a secure environment for our people in the present day situation. However, we should finance only the clearly-defined areas and programs aimed at fighting crime. A number of these have already been drawn up and adopted. Together with long-term, wide-scale measures, it is urgently important to implement measures to combat street violence. Organized crime needs special attention. Today its aim is to strangle the country. Only by joint, decisive, and consistent actions will it be possible to protect Russia from it. Specialists have been suggesting such actions for a long time. One of those measures are enshrined in law is to allow law-enforcement bodies to use the potential amassed in the last few years to launch sustained blows on organized crime and corruption. For all the people of Russia, strengthening the state has an additional profound meaning. We are talking about preserving the country. Russia is too dear to us to even think about its disintegration. Unity cannot be ensured by force or deceit. It cannot be preserved by setting some peoples against others. A path of federalism is a path toward truly strengthening Russia. It is clearly outlined in the Constitution. This does not mean, however, that a federation has already been built. The delimitation of powers and property between the federal authorities and the constituent parts of the federation is proceeding extremely slowly. During this year, this matter must be sorted out. Another no less important task is to build the vertical structure of federal power in Russia. It is in the interests of the federation that regions are granted maximum opportunities in governing, but the functions retained by the federal authorities must be performed in a coordinated manner throughout the country--be it the system of national security, in the power engineering complex, in the communications network, in the information network, and so on. It is the task of the year to surmount the clear injustice with regard to regional benefits and privileges. Standard criteria for the extension of benefits from the federal taxes and credits are needed as the very air we breathe -- the clearer they are, the less abuses there will be. Interethnic conflicts, both within the country and near its borders, pose a real threat to the stability of the Russian Federation. Such conflicts are the result of previous injustices and mutual grievances. Internecine strife and the number of such conflicts grow day by day, hour by hour -- and the longer this goes on, the more complicated it becomes to find a way out and to heal the new and deep wounds. Our country is more interested than anyone else in eliminating interethnic conflicts. For as long as Russia feels that it is a frontline state, there will be neither peace nor prosperity in Russia. Practice has shown that apart from Russia, no one is ready to take upon themselves the heavy burden of peacemaking in this area of the world. Hence, our country's role is all the more important and responsible. Time is inexorably moving on. It is already 50 years ago that one of the most monstrous crimes of the Stalinist regime was committed -- repressions against whole peoples. Deportations added shameful pages to our country's history. On behalf of the Russian Federation, the successor of the former Soviet Union, as head of state, I apologize to all the citizens of Russia and their families who suffered from the deportations. It is our civic duty to eradicate the consequences of those terrible events. This difficult and delicate work should unite and not divide, us. It should bring people together and not breed further strife. It is our duty to make 1994 a year of undivided attention to the problems of the people of Russian origin who are living in neighboring states. We have at our disposal a great number of facts that are clear proof that our compatriots are being subjected to discrimination. It is Russia's obligation to strive -- not in words, but in deeds -- to ensure that such practices are stopped. If one is talking about an infringement of the lawful rights of the Russian people, it is not the exclusively internal affair of one country or another, but it is our own, state, national affair. I ask -- I even demand -- of all branches of Russian state power that they follow this principle rigorously. I would also like to speak about our compatriots who are returning to Russia from the new neighboring states to their permanent homes. For the present they are not the children but the stepchildren of Russia. There is no let-up in the flood of settlers and refugees, but this means that one must no longer accept the fact that no one takes their problems seriously or carries true state responsibility. This is an immense problem. A special program has already been worked out, and it will be submitted by the government for endorsement by the Federal Assembly. But in order for it to be implemented, what is necessary is a pooling of our efforts and a concentration of means. Esteemed members of the Federation Council and deputies of the State Duma: We have learned from our own experience that we will not overcome the economic crisis or ensure the genuine market order or make the economic situation predictable or create prerequisites for the economic growth without a strong, able state. I know that after the December elections and changes in the government, people both in Russia and abroad became worried about the country's future economic course. I want to dispel these worries. As long as I remain the president I will defend and maintain the policy of economic transformations. In 1994 a continuation of the economic reform will be one of the most important directions of Russia's domestic policy. Some important elements of market relations have already emerged, such as economic freedom, the right to own property, and working markets of goods and services. However, it is too early to say that the Russian economy lives by laws of the market. Now we have a combination of new market trends, which are still weak, and of old command levers. The system of administration and distribution has not disappeared without trace: It has reshaped itself. Bureaucrats who used to deliver plans and allocate funding have now entered the market and are now distributing and often even trading in centralized credits, export quotas, and licenses. There is a continuing and strengthening trend toward lobbying. Reform of the economic mechanism is proceeding very unevenly. The result is well-known; the crisis is abating slowly. Output is continuing to fall, viable enterprises are closing down, the country is tormented by inflation, and tension in society is consistently high. The greatest mistake that could be made today is to offer the public false alternatives: the previous state-run command economy, or the so-called pure market that is absolutely independent of the state. Both options are ruinous for Russia and for the Russian economy. The task is to find a sensible correlation between the speed of reform and the realistic social price to be paid for it, to enlist the powerful but as yet poorly used reserves within the reforms, and to seek the optimum form of state involvement in economic processes. The past two years have shown that not only reform incurs a social price. Still greater damage is being done by an economic mechanism that is long overdue for change. It is time to establish an effective state regulation that is compatible with market mechanisms. This is one of the most important threads of the current phase of the reforms. The state should treat the state sector of the economy as an owner, otherwise the confusion will not be overcome and the squandering of the state sector by certain economic managers will not be halted. The policy toward liberalization of exports needs to be continued while, at the same time, state control over the export of strategic raw materials and energy resources from the country needs to be toughened. It is vital that the government strengthen currency controls and sanctions against offenders who are illegally concealing currency resources abroad. Legislation needs to be changed. Standards designed for an economy of centralized planning and financial autonomy [khozraschet] are of no use now. Russia needs an up-to-date and effective civil code. Its general section has already been prepared, but I would ask the government--which is conducting this work--to take account of the provisions of presidential decrees, primarily those concerning the economy. I intend to send the draft civil code, as a whole, for examination by the Federal Assembly this year. The year 1994 should be the year of the start of real structural reorganization of the Russian economy. Russia should only produce what is required by the individual, state, or world market. The country should stop producing products nobody needs. Of course, this is a very complex and costly task. It cannot be solved in a short period of time, and especially, by bans. This does not mean, however, that one should keep avoiding it. Can it be that the government is still not convinced that the absence of structural policy will bring about structural degradation? It is already happening. We are gradually losing modern technological infrastructure and most valuable productions--first and foremost, hi-tech productions. We are lagging behind not only world achievements, but we are already lagging behind ourselves. The principle that says that those will survive who can survive is ruinous. It is not those who produce the best-quality output with the consumer in mind who currently survive in Russia, but those who enjoy the most perks and privileges, those who enjoy the authorities' protection, and those capable of beating money out of the government. If this tendency continues, the Russian economy can and will become a market-based economy, but it will be primitive and inefficient at the same time. It is high time the government decide on structural priorities and act proceeding from this. Is there anything that prevents us from clearly defining the membership of a group of producers which are of strategic and great social importance to Russia, producers which are highly competitive in the world markets? Specialists estimate that this kind of group would not account for more than 10 percent of what is produced in Russia. It is precisely such producers that must be given normal state support over the next few years, while others should find this support substantially cut within specific limits. It is time to define what output is needed by the state and in what volume. I have here in mind defense orders, too. Directors of major enterprises have repeatedly put the same request to me: to influence the government, so that the government may let it be clearly understood to them whether or not to produce this or that kind of output. It is just a yes or a no. A yes means that financial obligations taken upon oneself are fulfilled; a no means that no impediments are placed in the way of the process of conversion. A demonopolization of production in Russia is a most important reserve of reforms. You cannot have normal economy while one enterprise dictates to others its own conditions, just because it happens to be the only one of its kind, producing its particular line of goods. Monopolism in Russia took decades to take shape. It was, in fact, a state policy, costing gigantic sums and resources. Demonopolization will, likewise, require tremendous effort and time. It must be started in real terms. Investment policy can also be implemented during reform. There is talk of an investment crisis and a lack of state money to support industry, yet vast sums are being pumped into selected sectors and enterprises. Meanwhile, as before, there is no real investment activity. Order can be imposed only on the basis of a clear investment policy, the role of which is greatly magnified in conditions of crisis, inflation, and the state's highly restricted financial possibilities. It is high time for the government to establish a single procedure for the granting of state support and to strictly monitor how such support is used. We hear endless talk about inflation being incompatible with the process of investment. With so much talk, there is almost no time to form the necessary institutions and structures to develop legislation in this sphere. Little practical work is being done to create real conditions for attracting foreign investments. This is the criticism I hear at every meeting with foreign businessmen, be it in America, in England, in Japan, in China, or elsewhere. At the same time it is obvious that as long as our own entrepreneurs do not start to invest in Russia's economy, foreign partners will refrain from making major investments. The Russian state has to be consistent in defending the interests of Russian companies in the domestic and world markets. There are other reserves. After the completion of the voucher stage, privatization has to be taken resolutely into a new mode. It should attract investors, both Russian and foreign. This year the privatization should give the economy much more than before. The year 1994 should become the year in which the state gives real support to the producers. In a system like this, any honest enterprise or entrepreneur can only die a painful death. It is impossible to live honestly. Nor is it possible to collect all that is due to the state. Last year, the budget revenue was to have been between 24 and 25 trillion rubles, but in actual fact it amounted to 17 trillion. That's what high taxes have achieved. The system of taxation should become simpler, easier to understand and, most importantly, stable -- at least in the next couple of years. In 1994, it is time to embark on drastic changes in state support for the agricultural sector. Rather than meeting all the demands from the sector, the main principle should be a real reform of its economic mechanism, above all ensuring the right of private ownership of land. The country has been living for a long time in the conditions of constantly high inflation. Until the inflation is curbed, the crisis cannot be overcome. Any actions by the federal authorities in the area of economic policy must undergo an inflation safety test. The maximum allowed level of inflation must not be exceeded. This demand will be ensured also by the constitutional powers of the president. The economic reform is never painless. Its social cost is significant. We should focus on poverty, on striking inequality, and employment. They cause the greatest concern. The president, the Federal Assembly, and the government should constantly keep in mind hardships experienced by workers of enterprises coming to a standstill--who may become unemployed tomorrow--the poverty experienced by many scientists and staffs of higher educational establishments--which makes unbearable the lives of many young families--and also difficulties experienced by a significant proportion of farmers. Millions of people in our country are living below the poverty line. It is unacceptable to adopt for implementation state programs that cause a further decline of essential standards of living. However, we have such programs. Esteemed members of the Federation Council and deputies of the State Duma, everything I am describing is part and parcel of tense, day-to-day work that should now be seriously addressed. There is vast room for action here for ministers, deputies, and staff of the apparatus--for everyone, in a word. If we really come to grips with it, then all political discord, offenses, and empty disagreements will be forgotten. Everyone will benefit from this, and primarily Russia. The main thing is not to stop and not to waste time. In strengthening the Russian state, we should all pay particular attention to culture, science, and education. These are vital conditions for our country's progress. One has to admit with bitterness that this area has become a disaster zone today. Without strong state support, spiritual freedom turns into the destruction of talent and into intellectual poverty. It is time to admit that culture will not survive without the state actively participating in its future. It is the state that should preserve the common cultural heritage in all its wealth and diversity, and it is the state that should provide a specific program for the development of the multinational Russian culture. Yes, there is an acute shortage of funds today; however, the state should pursue the kind of policy that would make the spiritual sphere one that powerfully attracts financial and material resources. In 1994, this sphere should become a zone with most-favored status. Federal, regional, and local authorities, and any entrepreneur should receive real incentives to providing active backing for this. I support setting in motion a system for capital to flow into culture, education, science, and health care and, let me add, ecology. Not only we will benefit from this. Above all, it will be our descendants and the Russia of the future that will benefit. To continue reform of Russian foreign policy is one of the guidelines for strengthening Russia. Over the latest period, it is not only Russia that has changed beyond recognition. The whole world has become more complex and unpredictable. Consistent promotion of Russia's national interests is the main task of our foreign policy. Openness and cooperation are prime means for achieving it. But if required to protect the state's legitimate interests, Russia has a right to act firmly and tough when it is really necessary. Until recently our foreign policy lacked initiative and creative approach. Russia's prominent peacemaking initiative in the Bosnian conflict has been an exception, regrettably, so far. Meanwhile, the present-day world needs a novel look at the global problems and goals of the 21st century, and Russia is capable of generating new major original ideas. We like to repeat that it is a great country, and this is a fact, indeed. So let us always maintain this lofty standard in our foreign political thinking as well. We have clear priorities in international policy--the most important being the prevention of a new global war, either cold or hot. It is for this purpose precisely that we are coming out unequivocally in favor of strengthening the regime of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the latest military technologies. We share this principle as one that is mandatory for all--not only for Russia, as some people would like to believe. In 1994, we have to put an end to the vicious practice of unilateral concessions. This also relates, inter alia, to the defense budget. One should not forget the fact that defense expenditures are something totally different from expenditure on war. These resources are being used to finance a major part of our science sector, these resources are being used to build housing for homeless officers' families, these resources are being used to provide for our children serving in the armed forces. There must be order in international arms trade. The most important condition for this is observance of Russia's commercial interests. They have suffered considerably in recent years. We are for being realistic when dealing with the problems of European security and we are for the Partnership for Peace, open to all states of great Europe without any exceptions. However, while respecting the sovereign rights of states and organizations, Russia is against the expansion of NATO through some or other countries of the European continent without Russia itself. This is a path toward new threats to Europe and the world. Russia is not a guest in Europe, but an equal participant in the community of Europe, interested in its prosperity -- and it is this premise that we will proceed from. We are for developing partnership with both West and East. But for us, partnership is not an exchange of niceties during negotiations but real cooperation and interaction, in all spheres from high politics to friendly social contact between people of different countries, in all spheres at state and national level, at the level of enterprises, companies, organizations, and individual citizens. The obstacles to such wide-ranging partnership should be removed as soon as possible. Russia did not take part in the race to be the first to leave the USSR and to become the most independent state. Now many are gradually being cured of the euphoria of being able to swim in the raging sea at will. We are returning to one another within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia is for the strengthening of the Commonwealth, above all through the establishment of an economic union, a common CIS market, and the establishment of a system of collective security and the strengthening of guarantees of human rights. However, there exist factors which it is always essential to take into consideration. Integration should not damage Russia itself, nor should it be effected at the cost of our forces and resources, material and financial alike, being stretched to breaking point. This would only entail new disappointments and it would not bring our states closer, but pull them apart from each other. Russia's foreign policy will be strong and effective if interaction between various state bodies in its implementation is secured as something tangible. I address this request, in equal measure, to the relevant departments of the executive authority and to the Federal Assembly -- we have one country and it will only gain from this kind of interaction. Esteemed members of the Federation Council and deputies of the State Duma, I regard it as essential to spell out the most essential things, on which concern, including my concern, will be focused this year. First: Law and order must gain a firm foothold. We are not just talking of adopting high quality laws; we must also aim at their implementation. Without that, it will not be possible to put an end to official abuses, nor will it be possible to ensure guarantees for people's legitimate rights. Two: the fight against crime. We won't make life more peaceful for the people of Russia if we confine ourselves to emergency half-measures. We need a complex of legislative, economic, organizational, and social measures. To fight crime, one has to change conditions in society and in the state as a whole. Three: the economy. I intend to resolutely continue and develop the reform started in 1992, using its reserves to the maximum, fully keeping in mind the price that has to be paid on this path. Four: concern for the country's spiritual future. The current state of culture, science, and education is, as I have already mentioned, extremely alarming. This year an upturn should be ensured in these spheres. Five: Support for the regions and territories and the protection of their interests. Much has already been said on this matter. I can add that last year the drafting of the principle of a new regional strategy in Russia began. This year the strategy will be actively implemented. It is on this basis we shall be able really to ensure the unity and integrity of Russia. Six: the future of Russians in the near abroad. This problem requires constant and painstaking work, combining firmness with delicacy, being consistent and reacting precisely to the changing situation. I believe it is my duty to defend the prosperity and dignity of our fellow countrymen wherever they may live. Seven: stepping up Russian foreign policy. Here the qualitative parameters of equal partnership are coming to the forefront. The key area is strengthening the Commonwealth of Independent States. We have established normal relations with the majority of world states and have joined the main international organizations. Now the main thing is, proceeding from national interests, to make the potential of these ties fully effective in Europe, in America, in the Asia-Pacific region and in other areas. Russia has the opportunity for beginning a qualitatively new stage of its development. The period of total destructive processes of the previous system is ending. We are laying the economic, legal, and social foundations of a new Russian society. Having received your proposals in response to my message, I am addressing you with a specific plan of my actions to put it into practice. I know that there are those among you who doubt whether we will be able to cope with these tasks, given the spiritual and ideological discord that reigns in society and in our hearts today. But we must provide an answer to this question together -- not in tedious and fruitless debates but in real collaboration. Only in common work will we be able to overcome mutual suspicion and bring back trust in one another. Only by common work will we be able, once and for all, to push back from Russia the threat of confrontation and to achieve stable civic accord. Only in common work will we be able to tear through the black shroud of uncertainty and restore spiritual balance and find ourselves in the new conditions. Russian citizens expect cooperation from us. I am confident they will support us because they want security on the streets and in their homes; they will support us because they want Russia to be peaceful and prosperous. I hope that in a year we will all be able to look those who elected us in the eye and say: Things were difficult for us, but we did in the space of this year all we could, and it is not in vain that we lived during these past 12 months. For my own part I will do all I can toward this end. Thank you for your attention.
