The two countries have eliminated the legacies of the past mischievous history during the last 40 years of the Cold War confrontation, and are moving ahead hand in hand, building a solid basis upon which bilateral friendship and cooperation are further strengthened and multilateral peace and prosperity are promoted. It was under these sets of relationships where active, co-operative exchanges in various areas between the two countries has grown by leaps and bounds. In 1993, the trade volume between the two countries reached $8.2 billion, marking a 52 percent increase from the previous year, and the accumulated approved amount of ROK investment to the PRC has been doubled each year since 1990, reaching $1 billion. The same phenomenal exchange took place in cultural as well as academic fields . However, our times demand us to do more than what we have achieved so far. Both countries have to look forward to the coming age of the 21st century and Asia-Pacific cooperation. Both countries find themselves at a historical juncture calling for not merely promoting horizontal cooperation, but also developing a vertical structure of co-operation upon which the two countries build a basis for Northeast Asian regional cooperation conducive to the Asia-Pacific age of cooperation in the 21st century. The visit of President Kim Yong-sam to the People's Republic of China is well-timed to witness and review the ongoing flows of cooperation the two countries are now pursuing, and consider and design the future scheme of joint undertakings the two countries will pursue in furtherance of the common interest and engagement for a better two-way Sino-ROK relationship and expanded East and Asian Pacific multiway co-operation. The visit will provide an excellent occasion for the people and business communities of both sides to recognize the sentiment of peace and stability prevailing between the two countries and among this region. The two countries are destined to share fate of partnership in promoting prosperity of people and the peace of nations between ROK and China and among the East and Asia Pacific countries. I sincerely wish the visit and stay here of President Kim is most successful and enjoyable and his meeting and dialogue with the leader and the people of the People's Republic of China most fruitful and rewarding.
