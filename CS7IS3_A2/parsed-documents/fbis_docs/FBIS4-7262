By rupturing [kyolyol] the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks that envisaged the prospect for a satisfactory solution to the problem of DPRK-U.S. relations, the United States is now deploying armed forces on a large scale on the Korean peninsula and its surrounding areas. The United States finally brought new-type Patriot missiles into South Korea in defiance of the unanimous rejection of our people and the public opinion of the world. It has been learned that the United States will deploy Patriot missiles for an actual war [silchon paebihada] by the end of April and will even stage the Team Spirit 94 joint military exercise--a nuclear war exercise--in November of this year. The United States, which has already reinforced the Apache helicopter battalion in South Korea, is going to bring various one brigade-class combat equipment in the future. The U.S. Marine forces, which have been concentrated on areas around our country, have not been removed. Thus, the United States itself showed that it totally abrogated [pagi] the Korean Armistice Agreement reached with us in the name of the United Nations. A basic condition for maintaining the armistice status on the Korean peninsula is to not bring operational materials from outside and not reinforce armed forces. Nevertheless, the United States has unilaterally abrogated what was agreed upon in the agreement since it signed the Korean Armistice Agreement in July 1953, and has brought modern weapons, including 1,000-odd nuclear weapons, into South Korea. In the past, the United States brought numerous armed forces, including nuclear weapons, into South Korea in a secret and concealed manner in fear of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Today, however, it openly brings in and deploys new-type of missiles and combat technological equipment in broad daylight. This illustrates that the United States does not recognize the validity of the Korean Armistice Agreement and is ignoring its existence. Contrary to its duty as a real party to the Armistice Agreement [chongjon hyopchongui silchejogin tangsajaroso chinin uimue paechidoege], for over the past 40 years, the United States has not only systematically violated and obliterated [chegyejoguro yurin malsal] the provisions of the agreement but it has even paralyzed the organization in charge of supervising the implementation of the armistice [chongjon kamsi kigu majo mabisikiotta]. When the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams disclosed the U.S. violations of the Armistice Agreement after the agreement had been signed, the United States unilaterally and forcibly had removed [ilbangjoguro kangje cholsu sikyossumyo] the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, which were organized under Paragraph 3 of Clause 2 of the Armistice Agreement, from its area in June 1956. And, it appointed a general of the South Korean Armed Forces, who is not legally suitable or qualified [amuron bomnyulchok tadangsongdo chagyokto omnun] in view of the Armistice Agreement, as senior member of its side in March 1991 and, thus, made the armistice organization incapable of performing its function. Because of these unreasonable acts [pudanghan chosa] of the United States, the Korean Armistice Agreement has today turned into an empty sheet of paper that cannot guarantee peace on the Korean peninsula, and the Military Armistice Commission has become an organization in which no one is in charge and turned nominal [chuini omnun kigurodo yumyongmusirhage toeotta] as a matter of fact. The United States has so far systematically abrogated [pagi] the Armistice Agreement and is now threatening us with the force of arms [himuro], while building up massive forces on a large scale on the Korean peninsula and its vicinity. In view of this, we can more clearly see that its hidden intention [soksim] is to crush [apsal] the socialist countries in Asia, including our country. The United States is bringing forces and armed equipment into South Korea as it pleases [maumdaero] and aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula as it pleases [chemaumdaero], thus, bringing the situation to the brink of war. Nevertheless, the Armistice Agreement cannot fulfill its role as a systematic device [chedojok changchi] in preventing this. This is a reality. Under these circumstances, the question of what in the world [todaeche] the Armistice Agreement or the armistice organization is necessary for arises. Under the present circumstances in which the Korean Armistice Agreement and the armistice organ [chongjon kigu] can take no responsibility in bringing stability to the situation on the Korean peninsula and stopping military buildup [muryok chunggangul mangnundeso] but are used to shield the U.S. policy of crushing our country [urinarae taehan migugui apsal chongchaegul karinunde iyongdoegoinnun], it is natural that we can no longer hold any expectations of such an agreement and institution. The state of armistice has been maintained and peace has prevailed on the Korean peninsula up to the present because of our Republic's patient peace-loving policy and volition. A series of complicated and acute problems, including the nuclear issue, are raised today on the Korean peninsula. This is connected with the continuation of the armistice system which defines us and the United States--the actual parties to the Armistice Agreement--as the two warring opponents [choktae ssangbang]. The state of armistice of the fifties remains intact today after 40 years have elapsed. This is abnormal in every respect. The developments [cheban sate] created on the Korean peninsula demand that the Armistice Agreement be replaced by a peace agreement without fail and that a peace-guaranteeing system that substitutes the present armistice organ be established in order to eliminate the hostile relations between the DPRK and the United States, to achieve reconciliation, and to guarantee genuine peace and security on the Korean peninsula. In this connection, the DPRK Government proposes to the United States that negotiations be held for the establishment of a new peace guaranteeing system, which can prevent military buildup and the recurrence of war on the Korean peninsula, stabilize the situation, and practically and reliably guarantee solid peace and security. The United States should discard the concept of confrontation and the war mentality [taegyol kwannyomgwa chonjaeng simni] and respond to this peace proposal we are making.
