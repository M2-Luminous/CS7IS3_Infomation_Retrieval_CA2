"Every country has its own position on short and long term interests," Mr Surin said. "We have a burden of proximity. We stand to face repercussions from neighbours in terms of refugees, narcotics or weapons. "Western countries, wherever they are, have the luxury of distance," he said. "They can make pronouncements without having to consider the repercussions." Clinton's decision came under pressure from U.S. businessmen who did not want to be excluded from participation in China's economic development, Mr Surin said. Fierce competition for trade and investment demanded a broadening of outlook, a balanced consideration of principles ideals and realities, he claimed. Differences of views between countries of the East and West on questions of human rights, democracy and the environment are "complex" and "delicate". Clinton's decision would serve as a good example and help the U.S. and other countries in the West to understand Thailand, he said.
