The talks were attended by Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, and Borislav Mikelic, prime minister of the republic of Serbian Krajina. Churkin also met delegations of the republic of Serbian Krajina and the republic of Srpska today. Here is a report by Snezana Rodic on how today's talks were held and how they were assessed: [Rodic] How would you briefly assess the second round of talks with President Milosevic? [Churkin] We were summarizing the overall talks we held today and I think that the Serbian side is serious and that it is seriously going to attend the Geneva meeting with a view to agreeing on the cessation of hostilities. They are preparing themselves for the second round of negotiations with the contact group. This will take place soon. I think that all this was worthwhile. We in Moscow are planning a very busy month of June as regards the matters that will have to be done urgently. [Rodic] Did you talk about sanctions with President Milosevic? [Churkin] If I had not mentioned them, he would have mentioned them to me. This issue is usually mentioned at our talks. [Rodic] (?Would) you say something more about that? [Churkin] We have this position that I think is a very good one. It is included in the ministerial communique. Therefore, a solution to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina will lead to the suspension of sanctions. I think that this is an encouragement to the Serbian side to reach a solution. [Rodic] In the Russian Embassy in Belgrade, Vitaliy Churkin first met a delegation of the Republic of Serbian Krajina which included Milan Martic and Borislav Mikelic. They discussed the continuation of negotiations with Croatia. It was pointed out that the Republic of Serbian Krajina is an equal partner and that it has respected the peace agreement on cease-fire, something which was also confirmed by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. The main problem is where the peace negotiations are to be held. [Martic] Our stand is that this should be a neutral venue, outside the territory of either Croatia or Krajina, although Croatia insisted that the venue be exclusively in Croatia or Krajina, thereby prejudging the political solution that Krajina is within Croatia and wanting somehow to reduce this to its internal problem. We are still insisting that this should be a neutral place. It can be a Russian embassy in any foreign country. However, we still remain open for negotiations, but of course should hold consultations within our ranks, that is, in the parliament and the government. [Rodic] Churkin then had talks with a delegation of the Serbian Republic, Dr. Nikola Koljevic and Momcilo Krajisnik. This was a consultative talk on the eve of the Geneva negotiations that have been convened by Yasushi Akashi. The Serbian side pointed out that a new Croatian-Muslim federation must not turn into an anti-Serb coalition. [Krajisnik] (?I) informed Mr. Churkin that our negotiating team will go to the meeting to conclude an agreement on the cessation of hostilities and that we are going to take part in the next meeting of the contact group. We have also discussed certain (?disputable) issues. Maps are always (?disputable) issues. There has been no special progress. Muslim proposals presented to us are already known. This is east Bosnia, western Bosnia, they are all questions demanding great attention and effort in order to reach the final solution. [Koljevic in English with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian] We think that the cessation of hostilities is by far the most important thing. We are prepared to discuss territories. We do not think that percentages are a good approach to the beginning, but we are ready to discuss territories, albeit with arguments about the maps -- quality, infrastructure, communications are much more important things than percentages. [Churkin] I am encouraged that my talks with Mr. Martic were very useful. I think that everything is moving forward, toward the beginning of the talks about economic matters, so I expect that before too long we shall find a way to begin these talks about economic normalization between Knin and Zagreb, that is, about the second stage of their difficult road toward a normalization of relations. I also had useful talks with Mr. Krajisnik and Mr. Koljevic. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Koljevic told us half an hour ago that one should talk about the quality of territories. Would one have to redefine the 49-51 percent relation? [Churkin] No, that will stay. They have to talk about these details within the framework of the concept approved by foreign ministers of the key countries. This was not a frivolous decision, but one based on the months of very long discussions and talks between all sides. They will have to stick to that concept.
