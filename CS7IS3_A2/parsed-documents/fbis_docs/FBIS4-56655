Diplomatic circles in Beijing said that they had evidently reached another crossroad in their relations, pointing out that the PRC lodged a strong protest to the United State's adoption of a congressional ruling that contains stipulations against China. According to reports, legislation of foreign relations for 1994 and 1995 assumes a position toward Taiwan and Tibet different from those included in the communiques signed by Beijing and Washington to regulate diplomatic relations. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei pointed out that the ruling was a deliberate attempt to frustrate reunification and that it goes against the commitment of recognizing only one China, which includes Taiwan.
