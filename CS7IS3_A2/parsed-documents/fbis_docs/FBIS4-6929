FBIS4-6929 "dreas080__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-080-A Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Sanyo Expands Lithium Ion Battery Production Sanyo Expands Lithium Ion Battery Production 942A0133A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 Apr 94 p 11--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0133A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] The domestic market for batteries is expected to reach 480 billion yen in fiscal year 1993, including 200 billion yen for nonrechargeable batteries and 280 billion yen for rechargeable batteries inclusive of automotive batteries. Future demand for rechargeable batteries is expected to grow 2.5-fold by the early 2000's to an annual sales rate of 700 billion yen primarily because of lithium ion batteries to be shipped to information communications markets. According to Sanyo Electric, the reason why the electrical equipment makers have positioned lithium ion batteries as "equal to a second liquid-crystal device" and have launched full-scale mass production is not only that growth in sales is expected, but because such batteries are a key device in controlling the operation of portable computer terminals playing a critical role in multimedia systems. Already, advances have been made in the miniaturization, reduction in weight and adaptation of cordless versions of electrical equipment such as cellular phones, and the usable time in settings such as outdoors before recharge of such batteries determines the success or failure of marketing efforts. Overseas makers are still in the development stage for lithium ion batteries and since supply sources for such batteries is expected to be limited to Japanese companies for the foreseeable future, reports indicate inquiries for possible future orders are increasing at such companies as Sony from companies engaged in the development of multimedia hardware such as IBM and Apple Computer. In response, various domestic firms are expected to strategically position lithium ion batteries on a level paralleling liquid crystal displays and devote resources to the development of high-capacity, next-generation batteries. It takes one to two years for office automation and communications equipment makers to reach a decision on new equipment application of new types of sample power sources furnished by battery suppliers. The decision for Sanyo Electric's announcement, in the face of plans by Sony and AT Battery to expand production capacity and announcements by Matsushita Electrical Industries and Nippon Battery to produce lithium ion batteries, was based on the judgment that failure to make an announcement in fiscal year 1994 would make it impossible for Sanyo to compete effectively for market share in the area of portable computer terminals used in multimedia systems. Sanyo Electric President Yasuaki Takano states, "Sanyo will aggressively invest in the expansion of its lithium ion battery operations in order to strengthen its position as a top maker of batteries such as the nickel cadmium type." Lithium ion batteries have been considered the high-capacity, next-generation battery, but the industry is positioning fiscal year 1994 as the "first year of commercialization" and has embarked on development and production competitions to win customers.
