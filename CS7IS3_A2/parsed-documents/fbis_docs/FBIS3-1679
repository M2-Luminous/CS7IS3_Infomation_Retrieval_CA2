[passage omitted] Last year was one in which we, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, emancipated our minds, invigorated our spirits, and seized the opportunities to win victories in in-depth reform, economic construction, and social undertakings. It was also a year in which a major step was taken toward the goal of establishing a socialist market economy set at the 14th National Party Congress. Like the rest of the country, Anhui witnessed an unprecedentedly good situation in reform, opening up, and modernization. The province enjoyed political stability and social progress. Its economy continued to develop with a strong momentum. Its overall economic strength improved notably. It was a year of unprecedented growth in Anhui's history. Its gross output value reached 94 billion yuan, an increase of 22 percent over the previous year, giving Anhui the third highest growth rate in the country. Its total industrial output value was 140.2 billion yuan, a 44.6 percent increase. Of the total industrial output value, industries at and above the township level produced 94.9 billion yuan, an increase of 26 percent, seventh in the nation. Its agricultural output value totaled 41.7 billion yuan, an increase of 8.5 percent, fifth in the nation. Large increases were also reported in revenues, export, and peasants' per capita income, all of which had not seen rapid growth in previous years. Revenues rose 32.8 percent to 7.32 billion yuan; exports grew 16 percent to $964 million; and peasants' per capita net income was up 26.3 percent to 724.5 yuan. In step with economic growth, the province also made substantive progress in enterprise, rural, and other reforms and opened itself wider to the outside world. It also made major progress in party building, spiritual civilization, and other social undertakings. [passage omitted] The year 1994 is critical to China's efforts to accelerate modernization and build a socialist market economy. It is also vital to Anhui's development. For the province, the task of achieving a fairly comfortable standard of living and basically establishing a socialist market economic structure by the end of this century is extremely arduous. To accomplish this arduous task, we must work hard not only to raise the major economic norms but also to improve our overall strength; to ensure not only higher quality but also higher efficiency than the previous year; and to seek not only faster economic growth but also comprehensive social progress. To achieve this, in the new year we must use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as a guide to comprehensively implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 10th Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial CPC Committee, further emancipate our minds, and seize opportunities to actively but prudently press ahead with reform; constantly seek to open ourselves wider to the outside world; correctly handle well the relationship between reform, development, and stability and between material and spiritual civilizations; and elevate our work in all fields to a higher level. [passage omitted] Comrades, friends: Building a modern socialist country with special Chinese characteristics is our magnificent goal. Our future is bright, even though our tasks are arduous. Let us rally more closely around the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, work with one heart and one mind in a pioneering and enterprising spirit for China's and Anhui's revitalization! In conclusion, I wish you and your family happy New Year and good health!
