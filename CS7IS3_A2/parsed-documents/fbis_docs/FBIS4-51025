He made the remarks at a National Assembly session in an apparent effort to calm the hot discussion stemming from remarks he made in Costa Rica that he has a dream "to transfer power to somebody else peacefully before my death". "The constitutional system is my dream and I would like to hand over political power to the next president after he is elected," Li told the assembly. On whether he will seek re-election, President Li said that he would not answer the question since the National Assembly has not begun its discussion of the proposed change in the method of presidential elections. The National Assembly began its three-month special session in Yangmingshan on May 2 to consider proposed amemdments to the constitution and nominations by President Li of the grand justices and the head of the judicial yuan. In their respective proposals on constitutional change, both the ruling Kuomintang and opposition Democratic Progressive Party have in common only one point: that the election of the president should be done by popular vote rather than by the vote of the National Assembly, as has been done in the past.
