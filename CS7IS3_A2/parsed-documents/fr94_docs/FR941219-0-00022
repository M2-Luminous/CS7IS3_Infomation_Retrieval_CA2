FR941219-0-00022 FR941219-0-00013 Section 1607.3(c) The rule includes a number of changes in the language that relates to client board members. The principal revision addresses the ambiguity of the language of the current regulation that has caused problems for some LSC recipients. This revision codifies the current LSC interpretation of the language to require that client board members be selected by client groups that have been designated by the recipient. The revision also adds language that more accurately reflects the kind of groups or organizations that would be appropriate client groups for purposes of selecting eligible client members. Most comments applauded the language broadening the types of client organizations that may make appointments. Comments were not uniform, however, on whether recipients or client groups should have authority to appoint client board members. Numerous comments supported the clarification and the policy choice that it represented, while other comments stated that it is very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to comply with the requirement that client members be appointed by client organizations. According to these comments, often there are no organized client groups within the service area and, even when there are, it is not necessarily true that client groups speak for the client community. Other comments noted that recipients often come into contact with program clients or other financially eligible individuals who would make good client board members but who, for one reason or another, are not involved with any client group. No change was made by the Board in response to comments on the proposed language. With the addition of ยง1607.3(h), permitting consultation with the appointing organizations, and the waiver provisions in ยง1607.6, the rule attempts to strike a reasonable balance among these concerns by (1) giving local programs as much input as possible into the selection of board members and (2) providing for waivers for special conditions. Section 1607.3(d) With respect to the other board members, i.e., those that are neither attorney members nor eligible client members, the rule makes it clear that recipient boards are permitted to fill these slots. This gives recipients flexibility to include board members who can help them with fundraising, community relations, coordination with other social service providers, or any other locally identified need. Law school professors who cannot count as ``attorney members'' because they are not admitted to practice in a state within the recipient's service area, could be selected for this category of membership. Although there is no comparable language in the current regulation, this provision is consistent with longstanding LSC interpretations. Section 1607.3(e) This provision is revised by adding language to the ``domination'' provision in the current regulation to make it clear that the provision is not intended to prevent recipients from designating a single regional or statewide client council as the appointing organization for client board members, as long as that client council represents numerous smaller client groups. One comment suggested that coalitions may not always be broad-based and that there might be competing coalitions of client groups within a service area. The regulation, however, does not require that recipients use coalitions as the appointing organizations; it merely gives recipients the choice. Section 1607.3(f) This paragraph and paragraph (h) have been amended from the proposed rule. This section now deals only with the method of selection and is intended to revise the current rule by deleting language which could be incorrectly interpreted to give LSC authority to veto particular methods of selecting local board members. The rest of the proposed paragraph (f) has been amended and merged with paragraph (h). Section 1607.3(g) This section establishes a standard for dealing with recipient board vacancies by requiring recipients to make reasonable and good faith efforts to insure that governing body vacancies are filled promptly. Implicit in this standard is a recognition that recipients often have no control over the appointment process other than to change the groups that they have designated to make the appointments if a particular group fails to make an appointment in a timely manner. Comments generally favored this provision. One comment noted that the existence of a few vacancies on a large board would have no influence on the ability of a recipient to conduct its business. Several cautioned, however, that recipients ``should be expected to exercise due diligence in the filling of board vacancies'' and others proposed specific timeframes for compliance. The Corporation retained the proposed language as a reasonable and realistic approach to problems with vacancies; but the Corporation also recognizes that there are alternative approaches to deal with vacancies. For example, through their own bylaws or board policies, recipients could take a number of actions when appointing organizations are slow in making appointments, refuse to make them, or are unable to make them for whatever reason. Thus, a recipient board could adopt bylaws that would permit its members to hold over until replacements are appointed, or could allow for short-term interim appointments, if necessary, until regular appointments could be made. Section 1607.3(h) This section has been revised from the proposed rule. It incorporates and amends the consultation provisions in the proposed ยง1607.3(f) and the provisions in the proposed ยง1607.3(h) that would have explicitly permitted a recipient to veto an appointee to its board. As adopted by the Board, this paragraph now states affirmatively that recipients may recommend names to bar associations and other appointing groups and should consult with those groups to insure that appropriate appointments are made. The Board adopted this consultation provision because it recognizes that bar associations or other groups may wish to request information from recipients on who would make a good legal services program board member and that appointing groups would benefit from recipient input in making their appointments. Most comments, including those from several bar associations, approved of this proposal, as long as it is clear that appointing bodies are to make independent judgments about whom to appoint to recipient boards. It is the intent of the Board that appointing organizations are to make independent judgments and retain their status as the decision makers for recipient board members. The consultation provision is meant to be an aid, not an impediment, to the appointing organization's decision making process.
