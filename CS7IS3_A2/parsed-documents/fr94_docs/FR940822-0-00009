FR940822-0-00009 FR940822-0-00004 Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing Amendment 39&hyph;8785 (59 FR 4555, February 1, 1994) and by adding a new airworthiness directive, Amendment 39&hyph;9006, to read as follows: 94&hyph;17&hyph;11 Teledyne Continental Motors: Amendment 39&hyph;9006. Docket 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;44. Revises AD 94&hyph;01&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8785. Applicability: Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM), formerly Bendix magnetos: S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, and S&hyph;600 series magnetos with red or black Bendix (not TCM) data plates having serial numbers (S/N's): Lower than 2000000 without any letter prefix; or S/N's lower than A16058 having the letter ``A'' prefix. S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, and S&hyph;600 series magnetos with blue Bendix (not TCM) data plates marked ``REMANUFACTURED'' having S/N's lower than 901001. S&hyph;1200 series magnetos with red Bendix (not TCM) data plates having S/N's: lower than 2000000 without any letter prefix; or S/N's lower than A132844 having the letter ``A'' prefix. S&hyph;1200 series magnetos with blue Bendix (not TCM) data plates marked ``REMANUFACTURED'' having S/N's lower than 901001. These magnetos are installed on but not limited to reciprocating engine powered aircraft manufactured by Beech, Cessna, Maule, Mooney, and Piper. Note 1: Yellow Bendix or TCM service spare data plates may have been installed during a field overhaul; use model and S/N to determine applicability. Note 2: No action is required for those magnetos in compliance with AD 94&hyph;01&hyph;03. Note 3: Magnetos built by Bendix in Jacksonville, Florida, and Magnetos built by TCM in Atlanta, Georgia, as indicated on the data plate, are not affected by this AD. Note 4: The paint on some early data plates may have been obliterated and the data plate will appear silver in color; use model and serial number to determine applicability. Note 5: The FAA has received reports of some confusion as to what is meant by S&hyph;20, S&hyph;200, S&hyph;600, and S&hyph;1200 series magnetos as referenced in TCM Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) No. MSB644, dated April 4, 1994, and this AD. A typical example is S6RN&hyph;25, where the S designates single type ignition unit, the 6 designates the number of engine cylinders, the R designates right hand rotation, the N is the manufacturer designator (this did not change when TCM purchased the Bendix magneto product line), and the number after the dash indicates the series (a &hyph;25 is a S&hyph;20 series magneto, while a &hyph;1225 is a S&hyph;1200 series magneto).
