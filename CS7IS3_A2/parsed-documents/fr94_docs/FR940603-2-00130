FR940603-2-00130 FR940603-2-00083 SEI proposes to continue to engage in preliminary project development activities (``Development Activities'') relating to the potential acquisition and ownership of independent power facilities, including QFs and facilities to be owned or operated by EWGs and FUCOs, and other power production facilities located within the service territories of the Operating Companies or the service territories of other members of the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council, together with facilities and equipment that are ancillary to the foregoing, such as may be used for fuel production, conversion, handling and/or storage; electrical transmission; and energy management, recovery and efficiency (hereinafter referred to collectively as ``Projects''). With the exception noted below, in any case in which SEI's Development Activities culminate in a proposal to acquire the securities of or other interest in any EWG or EUCO, it is intended that Southern, rather than SEI, would consummate the acquisition in an exempt transaction pursuant to section 32 or 33 of the Act, as applicable, subject to complying with all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Any acquisition by Southern or SEI of an interest in any other type of Project, and any related financing, would be the subject of separate filings with this Commission. SEI requests authority to acquire the stock of and provide needed working capital to one or more foreign subsidiaries through which SEI would conduct its project Development Activities. SEI represents that in no case will any such subsidiary, directly or indirectly, acquire, own or operate any significant assets or facilities, other than a bank account, leased office space and related office equipment, issue or acquire any securities, other than common shares issued to SEI, or provide services or sell goods to any associate company. The sole function of any such subsidiary would be to engage in Development Activities on behalf of SEI in a foreign country or countries whose laws would subject SEI to significant restrictions or penalties if SEI were itself to maintain a legal presence in any such country. The capitalization of any such subsidiaries is expected to be less than $50,000. SEI also proposes to render project development, engineering, design, construction and construction management, operating, fuel management, maintenance and power plant overhaul, and other similar kinds of managerial and technical services to both affiliated Project entities and to non-affiliated developers, operators and owners of independent power projects and foreign and domestic utility systems. SEI proposes to render such services utilizing its own work force, and personnel and other resources of SCS and the Operating Companies obtained pursuant to service agreements (``Service Agreements'') as described below. SEI also proposes that in conjunction with providing services to non-affiliates, it may enter into separate agreements to sell or license intellectual property it has created or acquired from non-affiliates in connection with its authorized business activities. All services rendered by SEI to non-affiliates will be based upon the fair market value thereof. SEI also proposes to provide such services and sell goods to any Project entity that is an associate company (including but not limited to any EWG, FUCO, or QF) at fair market prices, and requests an exemption pursuant to section 13(b) from the requirements of rules 90 and 91 as applicable to such transactions in any case in which any one or more of the following circumstances shall obtain: 1. Such Project entity derives no part of its income, directly or indirectly, from the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric energy for sale within the United States; 2. Such Project entity is an EWG which sells electricity at market-based rates which have been approved by FERC or the appropriate state public utility commission, or a QF which sells electricity at the purchaser's ``avoided cost'' determined in accordance with the regulations under PURPA, or sells electricity at rates negotiated at arms'-length with large industrial or commercial customers purchasing such electricity for their own use and not for resale; 3. Such Project entity sells electricity at rates based upon its cost of service, as approved by FERC or any state public utility commission having jurisdiction, provided that: (i) the purchaser of such electricity is not an associate company of SEI within the Southern system, and (ii) the terms and conditions (including price) of the contract pursuant to which SEI agrees to provide such services or goods have been expressly approved by the holders of a majority of the equity interests of such Project entity other than Southern or any associate company of Southern. SEI owns the exclusive rights to a proprietary computer-based remote generator dispatch and control program, known as ``Standby Capacity Network'' (``SCN''). The SCN program enables a utility company remotely to access the capacity associated with stand-by or emergency generators owned by its large customers, such as hospitals, factories, and office buildings and operate the generators in parallel with its own grid. An SCN program could be implemented pursuant to a contract between a utility and SEI under which SEI would agree to install certain equipment (primarily controls) incorporating its proprietary software program and interconnection equipment and to act as the utility's agent in operating, maintaining and fueling the customer's standby generator. Under such an arrangement, SEI would be compensated by the utility. SEI would not seek to acquire any interest in the customer's generating equipment, and would not take title to the electricity generated. SEI would retain all right, title and interest to the proprietary software used in SCN.
