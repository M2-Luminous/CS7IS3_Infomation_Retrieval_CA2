In the meantime, a two will appear before the decimal point in the current rate. Such a favorable figure will, however, not be the rule. The Bundesbank's inflation projections are based on the assumption that the oil price will not increase considerably. Nothing indicates at this point that it will. In addition to the oil price, the exchange rate constitutes another short-term factor of uncertainty. If no problems emerge here, further progress on the inflation front is likely, because wage policy in particular is currently moving in the right direction, says the Bundesbank chief economist. Issing compared the German national economy with a large unwieldy tanker that needs a lot of time to change course. In 1991, the tanker moved in the totally wrong direction. With business and industry booming, the problems that were known at that time were not reflected in the pay settlements. As a result of German unity, the labor-capital ratio has dramatically changed in favor of the factor of capital. Acting against economic realities will, in particular, be punished with higher unemployment. In 1992, the corrections made were also inadequate. Meanwhile, the groups involved in the economic process have recognized the symptoms of our times. Corrections are being made everywhere. So the tanker has set course. The upcoming pay negotiations for civil servants will have a signalling effect. Additional Wage Costs! In view of the costs involved of approximately 80 percent, one should not speak about ancillary wage costs but about additional wage costs, said Issing. The Bundesbank already uses this more accurate term in its monthly reports. Given the high additional costs, nothing can be expected over the short term. On the contrary, in addition to an increase in old age pension contributions, there is a possibility of nursing care insurance. All sides concerned must be deeply aware that the introduction of the nursing care insurance means that the end of the pole has been reached for this decade. Regarding burdens through additional wage costs, the other direction must be pursued again. Stabilizing Services According to Issing, the cycle has probably reached the nadir. The service sector is increasingly gaining in importance as a stabilizing factor. In certain industrial branches, however, the picture is still very gloomy. In interpreting the current economic data, one should not exaggerate. In many cases, a number of positive signals are interspersed with negative ones. For instance, retail trade sales declined in October. Export orders increased, whereas inland orders decreased. Above all, the German labor market will show a downturn for quite a while. The Bundesbank will continue to keep to its potential-oriented money-supply policy, which has an implicitly stabilizing effect. With a weak economic cycle, a policy that is oriented toward the growth of the potential will always lead to a good money supply. However, when capacities are fully used, the lack of money will have a decelerating effect -- especially on the price level. The Bundesbank assumes that high investment activities in eastern Germany will continue in 1994. This will also clearly increase the potential of the eastern federal laender. The Bundesbank is taking the new money supply target for 1994 seriously. Even though it expected to miss the target, it also took the planned money supply target for 1993 seriously, said Issing. Regarding individual interest policy measures, the considerable credit expansion has always made caution advisable. The Bundesbank's money supply policy has above all proved successful in difficult times. With a decrease from clearly over 7 percent to 6.8 percent in October, it seemed that M3 was moving along the right track. However, the November result, with a plus of 7.2 percent on an annual basis, was a flash in the pan. Revival of Savings Bank Books Among all the factors influencing M3, credit expansion, which has been unusually high for a recession, plays the most important role. This credit expansion is above all attributable to subsidized credits for eastern Germany and credits for housing construction. In addition, the development of savings deposits with a three-month term of notice has played a major part since the summer. Because savings certificates are virtually dead, owing to the interest yield tax, savings bank books have become attractive again. Banks have an interest in keeping savers, above all with a view to Principle II of the Credit Law. This is being done through savings deposits on which bonuses are granted. Eastern Europe Increases Circulation of Cash The development of the circulation of cash corresponded to Bundesbank estimates until the summer. Subsequently, it increased steeply, showing a monthly rate of over 15 percent. Very many things indicate that this is attributable to an increased use of the German mark in Central and Eastern Europe. Presumably the fact that the new German mark notes are more forgery-proof than the dollar also plays a role. This increase in the circulation of cash could distort the short-term result; over the long term, the effect distorts little, because contrary to the previous indicator -- the Bundesbank money supply -- the share of the circulation of cash in M3 is rather small. Keeping To M3 Without intervention in the European Monetary System [EMS], there was a swing from October to November of 40 billion German marks [DM] in the net foreign position. In this respect, it could have been of importance that national, private, and public institutions (not the Federal Government) built credit stocks [Vorratskredite], parked them in the Euro market, and repatriated them in November. This example shows the close substitute relationship between Euro deposits and M3 in the traditional delimitation. However, the Bundesbank notes that M3 expanded is inferior to M3. This is, however, a point where every money supply delimitation has become more sensitive. Breach in the System Because the Federal Government is no longer obliged to deposit funds with the Bundesbank, there will be a new situation regarding the M3 system next year. Since the federal assets, which so far have not formed part of the money supply, will now be invested in the money market, there will be a basic effect of half a percentage point with M3. Statistically, it can be easily coped with. However, M3 monthly rates could be influenced by the Federal Government's way of acting. The question above all is what the Federal Government will, in the future, be doing with its cash funds. The Bundesbank will watch M3 in its traditional delimitation and M3 including Federal Government assets. Many factors make it advisable to keep federal assets out of M3. The Bundesbank will deal with this problem in its monthly report of January. Issing said that this is a technical rather than a monetary policy problem.
