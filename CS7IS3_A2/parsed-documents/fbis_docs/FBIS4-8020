But, before the meeting takes place, the coalition's representatives should take an unambiguous stand on Lech Walesa's rejection of the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati," said Andrzej Drzycimski, the president's spokesman, after Thursday's [7 April] meeting between Lech Walesa and Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy. According to the Sejm speaker, a meeting between President Lech Walesa and the governing coalition will take place next week at the latest. "I am hoping for that, and I want to be convinced of that," the Sejm speaker said. A. Drzycimski stated that the president wants to talk with serious politicians, who take the country's problems seriously. The spokesman explained to journalists that there is a precondition for L. Walesa's meeting with the coalition--namely, it is that common themes exist, and one of those is a unanimous stand by the coalition regarding Dariusz Rosati, who was a candidate for finance minister and deputy prime minister but who was later rejected by L. Walesa. The conversation should take place within constitutional provisions. "According to the president, a National Security Council would be an appropriate, constitutionally allowed place for such consultations," Drzycimski stated. The council would include the president, the prime minister, Sejm and Senate speakers, and the chiefs of key ministries. The spokesman stated that Oleksy failed to present the president with a new candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister [preceding sentence published in boldface]. As the Sejm speaker said, the meeting at the Belweder was an opportunity to talk about all things that concern the country and raise public concern. Among the topics discussed were the issue of L. Walesa's nonsigning of the budget law, and doubts concerning the president's signing the electoral law to gmina [small administrative units] councils. "I was trying to persuade the president to sign the budget," J. Oleksy admitted. Conditions for effective functioning by the government and the coalition in different areas were also discussed. The Sejm speaker stressed that he is in favor of the president talking to the coalition without the media playing the role of an intermediary, but, instead, in a direct way, with the participation of people occupying some posts at the central level. Such a meeting, which, as J. Oleksy stressed, would not have to be in the form of negotiations, would serve the goal of better communication and also of defining methods for a better functioning of the state. "I presented my views. I think they were the average of the views circulating in parliament; such is my role there," the Sejm speaker said. The conversation at the Belweder was also an opportunity to evaluate the results of a Sejm delegation's visit to Russia, and also to define the goals of a new, breakthrough strategy with regard to relations with Japan. A delegation of our parliament headed by J. Oleksy is going to Japan on Friday. According to a communique by the Belweder's press office, the Sejm speaker agreed with the president's suggestion that Walesa should be consulted over international visits by politicians on the highest level. This would serve to assure a uniform image of Polish foreign policy. NOWA EUROPA asked Jerzy Szmajdzinski (Democratic Left Alliance), chairman of the Sejm National Defense Commission and a secretary general of Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, to comment on the president's proposal: "I cannot answer the question before the meeting of the coalition. Personally, I do not share the president's arguments by which he disqualified Professor Dariusz Rosati. That is why I cannot be sure whether the next candidate would agree to be `dissected' over several weeks in all possible ways, only to be informed three minutes into the prime minister's visit to the president that, either he has been in Poland too long or he is not involved in any affair, and these reasons disqualify him from being deputy prime minister and finance minister. I am sure the coalition will hold a session before the meeting with the president, and, during the session, appropriate decisions will be made."
