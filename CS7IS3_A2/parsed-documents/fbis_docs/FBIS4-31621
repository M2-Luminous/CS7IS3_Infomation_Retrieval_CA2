Zdenko Vranjes reporting: [Vranjes] Speaking about the Geneva talks, Kresimir Zubak, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and president of the Presidential Council of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, said the most important thing agreed was that the question of corridors would be resolved in such a way as to give equal right to the use of corridors, i.e. to the linking of territories, to all three sides. The new proposals also contain ideas about gray zones and blue paths, i.e. the territories and paths that will be under international control until the final solution is reached. Making the resumption of talks conditional upon the withdrawal of Serb forces from Gorazde turned out to be a good thing. They had to withdraw from Gorazde and give in and accept a one-month cease-fire--which was Croatia's proposal, said Zubak. He also said that the united Croat-Bosniak stand at the talks turned out to be successful. Zubak added that the political platform that the federation's delegation advocated in Geneva implied the survival of the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would be organized as a federal [slozena] state, consisting of the federation and the part presently under Serbian control. In such a federal state the constituent status of the Croatian people will be reflected both in the federation and in all the parts of the federal state. This option could be proposed by the Contact Group, together with the maps, according to the take it or leave it principle, said Zubak.
