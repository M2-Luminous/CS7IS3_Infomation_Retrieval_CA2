Today, these iniquitous, savage acts are being perpetrated against the areas of al-Dali Province and the districts of Karish and Mukayris, which are the areas that were on the borders before Yemeni unity. In the al-Dali area, forces of the adventurist gang of the al-Ahmar clan continued to shell al-Dali town and its neighboring villages with heavy artillery, rockets, and aircraft in the tenth attempt to penetrate the defenses of our valiant forces which are confronting these iniquitous forces with total bravery and audacity. The defenders of this province, in cooperation with the masses of the people which began to arrive in this province (?from) various provinces of Lahij Governorate, are displaying a valiant resistance and splendid heroism, which reflects the spirit of the original struggle between our forces and the masses. Despite the intensive random shelling against the peaceful villages and houses by the forces of the al-Ahmar gang, our defending forces continued their resolute confrontation, inflicting on the hostile forces heavy loss of life and equipment. In another former border area, the adventurist Sanaa clique tried to capture (Kathbub) District in the direction of Bab al-Mandab [word indistinct], but our heroic forces repulsed this abortive attempt and the attacking forces of the al-Ahmar clan returned to where they came from, suffering losses. As for the capital of Abyan Governorate, our forces have almost imposed their control of this area after units of the al-'Amaliqah forces retreated and scattered in all directions, while many of these units, officers and other ranks, surrendered and joined our forces. The Defense Ministry appeals to Arab and world public opinion, particularly the bodies and organizations concerned with defending human rights, including the Yemeni Red Crescent, the Arab Red Crescent organizations, and the International Red Crescent, to condemn the murderous campaigns against captives who fell into the hands of the gang of the al-Ahmar clan in the northern governorates, as well as savage acts and random shelling of villages and houses of citizens, particularly in al-Dali Province and in Karish and Mukayris districts, and the forceful detention of these citizens. It calls on these organizations to intervene to rescue the wounded and provide first aid to them, particularly among the civilians. While the Defense Ministry conveys to our people and to the Arab and world these facts, it expresses full confidence that all the abortive attempts of the bloody gang of the al-Ahmar clan will fail. Their deeds will crash on the rock of our armed forces' steadfastness whose number increases daily by hundreds and thousands, in addition to the masses of people who increasingly support our forces, the forces of unity, democracy and modernization.
