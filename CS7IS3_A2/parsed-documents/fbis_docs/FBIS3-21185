The Institute aims to do R&D on technology useful for resolving environmental problems and to contribute to the world through environmental technology. This newspaper questioned Tsutomu Yamaguchi, managing director of RITE, about its goals. -- This is the real beginning of RITE's activities, isn't it? -- RITE is a key institution for developing revolutionary environmental technology for implementing the ``Earth Revitalization Plan'' (plan for comprehensive development of new energy technology and other earth conservation technologies). This is the only industry-government-academia partnership to grapple with these issues. We have a grave responsibility. -- What will be the focus of RITE's research? -- RITE will tackle three areas of fundamental research. Five researchers have been hired for five years on the annual salary [nembo] system. First, in the area of biology, RITE will do things such as using genetics to create plants that can be grown in deserts and searching for microorganisms which fix carbon dioxide, the cause of the earth's warming. In the area of chemistry, research will be conducted on topics such as developing catalysts that can remove hydrogen from water, developing a computer system that can design catalysts, and using a high polymer film to separate hydrogen dioxide. In the systems area, research will be conducted on using computers to evaluate technology for fixing carbon dioxide and for putting a price tag on environmental pollution. -- Internationalism will be another mainstay of RITE, won't it? -- RITE will take an international perspective on forming a network [for research cooperation]. There are plans to invite researchers from the Institute for International Applications Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Vienna to come as senior researchers for two months. They'll be the vanguard. In the future we want to have regular research exchanges between the two institutes. There is currently a Russian scientist on the catalyst research team. The chief researcher in the systems area is a Japanese who is concurrently an associate professor at Harvard University. An Italian chemical company is participating in the hydrogen production project and we're sounding out a large French chemical company on the possibility of research exchange on the fixing project. -- What method will be used for receiving the foreign countries? -- We're aiming to be an internationally open research institute. Research has no meaning if it is not actually used. Since it's no good if Japan goes by itself, international participation is being sought from the R&D stage. Foreign countries simultaneously feel impressed and fearful about Japan's industry-government-academia effort in environmental technology. America and Europe fear that Japan will monopolize environmental technology. But it's also true that no country other than Japan is pursuing the same vision. RITE is calling for the countries of America and Europe to open their minds to participation. -- Why will many corporations participate in projects to develop environmental technology? -- That is because environmental problems are a constraint on growth, so corporations can't survive if they don't consider the environment. However, it's a basic truth that most companies pursue environmental research by themselves. The national project has to get by with a small contribution from industry. The results will be owned by its funders, the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and RITE. However, patents can be transferred to corporations according to a stipulation providing for return in the event that the research results are not used within a set period. This is to provide an incentive for corporations to participate. Viewpoint: Topic of Networking Research The cities of Yokkaichi in Mie prefecture, Munekata in Fukuoka prefecture, and others tried to attract RITE, but, due to the active efforts of its business community, the Kansai area won RITE's headquarters headquarter for the Kansai Science City. It is hoped that RITE will become the core facility of the city. RITE was established in 1990 and has already spent three years working on projects entrusted to it by NEDO. These include carbon dioxide fixing, biodegradable plastic, and others. Research sites for carrying out research are scattered around the country among participating corporations and national research institutes. Only 30 of the approximately 400 researchers connected to RITE will go the headquarters to conduct fundamental research and to work on the environmental catalyst project. There will probably be discussion of linking the scattered research sites in a network.
