The long queues of vehicles witnessed during the fuel crisis have been eliminated, improving the movement of vehicles in the state. Meanwhile, the military administrator, Colonel Mohamed Wase, has directed the reconstituted task force on the fuel scarcity to report daily to his office on the supply and movement of fuel tankers. During an unscheduled visit to the depot, the administrator directed the task force to discourage touts from besieging the premises of the depot. Col. Mohamed Wase then lifted the order prohibiting the sale of more than 100 naira fuel to motorists.
