This follows discussions between the union and ANC leader Nelson Mandela this morning. According to the ANC's plan, black farmers should own 30 percent of agricultural land within 5 years. The agricultural union says this means that about 25 million hectares will be handed over, leading to the large-scale disruption of agricultural production.
