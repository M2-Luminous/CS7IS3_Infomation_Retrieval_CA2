ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends the regulations governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The FFEL Program consists of the Federal Stafford, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the Federal Consolidation Loan programs. These amendments are needed to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325). Public Law 102&hyph;325 added new section 428J to the HEA which authorizes the Secretary to establish a demonstration program for loan forgiveness for certain types of professional or public service. Under section 428J of the HEA, the Secretary is authorized to forgive portions of Federal Stafford Loans incurred by a student borrower who performs volunteer service or works in certain teaching or nursing areas. Minor changes to section 428J were made by the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;82). Section 428J was also recently amended by the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208). Those additional statutory changes are also reflected in these regulations. This program is not currently funded.
