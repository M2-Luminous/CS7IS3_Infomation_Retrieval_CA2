The high tribunal ordered the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to desist from implementing the temporary restraining order on the meeting, which will discuss alleged human rights violations in East Timor. President Ramos directed all government agencies to immediately comply with the Supreme Court ruling. However, the government will still enforce the ban on foreign participation in the conference. The Immigration Bureau canceled the visas of foreign nationals attending the conference, but President Ramos removed the name of Japanese Bishop Aloisius Nobuo Soma from the list of 34 foreigners banned from attending the East Timor conference. The president's decision was announced following a closed-door meeting of the Cluster E which advises the president on political and security matters. Malacanang [presidential office] was forced to say that the government will prevent the conference from turning into a political platform that would undermine the political integrity of Indonesia. The speeches and other public statements of the foreign delegates will be closely monitored, particularly those that would affect the national interest. Twenty-five foreign delegates who were able to slip through a dragnet thrown by immigration authorities at the airport attended the meeting which opened yesterday. No arrests have been made in the UP campus as of press time. Surrounded by human chain of students, nuns, and priests, the foreign participants march inside the Diliman campus going to the conference site.
