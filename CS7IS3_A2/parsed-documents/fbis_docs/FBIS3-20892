As one of the "Blue List" institutes, it is financed half by the BMFT and half by the Free State of Saxony (annual budget for 1993: 26.3 million German marks). With its 232 employees, the institute is one of the largest and most productive polymer research facilities in the Federal Republic of Germany. The institute's work focuses primarily on application-oriented basic research, major fields being: -- polymer synthesis and characterization; -- interface phenomena in polymers and multiphase systems containing polymer matrix (with particular reference to polymer blends and reinforced polymers); -- polymer surface modification; and -- shaping, processing, and inspection of polymeric materials. The institute is already working with numerous firms in the plastics, automotive, and lacquer industries, mainly on the development of environment-friendly lacquers for automobile bodies. It is also working jointly with AKZO AG on the further development of dialysis membranes for artificial kidneys and the monitoring of their production. Professor Hans-Joerg Jacobasch, a scientist of international renown, was appointed scientific director of the Institute of Polymer Research, thus acknowledging the value of his work to date as head of the IPF in a commissary capacity.
