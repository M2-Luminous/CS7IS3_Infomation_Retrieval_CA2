FR940725-0-00026 FR940725-0-00007 Several commentators requested that the regulations provide a simpler method of allocating and apportioning DASTM gain or loss for small taxpayers. This suggestion has been adopted. Section 1.985&hyph;3(e)(2) provides that a taxpayer with a QBU having an adjusted basis in assets of $10 million or less (taking into account assets of related QBUs resident in the same country) may elect to allocate DASTM gain or loss ratably to all items of the QBU's gross income (determined prior to adjustment for DASTM gain or loss). Thus, for purposes of the foreign tax credit, DASTM gain or loss is allocated on the basis of the relative amounts of gross income in each separate category described in section 904(d). Similarly, for purposes of section 952, DASTM gain or loss is allocated to subpart F income in a separate category based on the ratio of gross subpart F income in the separate category to total gross income in that category. Commentators also requested a simpler method for taxpayers with one or two section 904(d) separate categories (or a de minimis amount in a second category). This suggestion was not adopted because the allocation rules in §1.985&hyph;3(e)(3) more accurately reflect the income of large taxpayers. The prior final regulations under §1.985&hyph;3 provided for the allocation of DASTM gains and losses to section 904(d) separate categories based on foreign source gross income in each category. There was no attempt to identify DASTM gain or loss with specific assets or liabilities. However, in the proposed regulations under §1.985&hyph;3, DASTM gain or loss was identified with specific assets and was directly allocated to specific section 904(d) separate categories based on the income those assets would generate. With respect to liabilities, the proposed regulations provided that DASTM gain or loss should be allocated to the section 904(d) separate categories in the same manner as the allocation and apportionment of interest expense. The proposed regulations applied this method of allocation to all liabilities. Some comments suggested that DASTM gain or loss on certain non-interest-bearing liabilities, particularly short-term non-interest-bearing trade payables, should be directly allocated to the same section 904(d) separate category as the income produced by the purchased good or service to which the payable relates. The suggested rationale for this approach is that in a hyperinflationary environment the purchase price for deferred payment of goods or services reflects a premium for inflation expected to occur prior to payment. This overstated purchase price is reflected in cost of goods sold, distorting the taxpayer's income in the pertinent section 904(d) separate category. Therefore, in order to compensate for this distortion, commentators recommended adjusting cost of goods sold by the DASTM gain on the trade payable. In response to this suggestion, §1.985&hyph;3(e) now provides different rules for allocating and apportioning DASTM gain or loss with respect to interest-bearing liabilities (under §1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(vii)) and non-interest-bearing liabilities (under §1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(viii)). Section 1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(vii)(A) now provides that the amount of DASTM gain on interest-bearing liabilities reduces interest expense generated by such liabilities; any DASTM gain in excess of interest expense is sourced or otherwise classified in the same manner that interest expense is allocated and apportioned. Any DASTM loss on interest-bearing liabilities is allocated and apportioned in the same manner that interest expense is allocated and apportioned under §1.861&hyph;9T (without regard to the exceptions to fungibility in §1.861&hyph;10T). Section 1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(vii)(B) provides rules with respect to the allocation of DASTM gain or loss on debt that gives rise to related person interest expense under section 954(b)(5). Section 954(b)(5) requires that related person interest expense must first be allocated to foreign personal holding company income that is passive income to the extent thereof and therefore to the section 904(d)(1)(A) separate category for passive income for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation. To prevent distortion, any DASTM gain or loss arising from such related person debt must also be allocated for purposes of sections 904 and 952 in the same manner that the related person interest expense of that debt is required to be allocated under the rules of section 954(b)(5). One commentator suggested that, in applying the modified gross income method under §1.861&hyph;9T(j) to allocate and apportion the interest expense of a controlled foreign corporation, the gross income in each section 904(d) separate category should first be adjusted by the amount of DASTM gain or loss allocated to assets under §1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(v). Section 1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(vii)(C) of the final regulations adopts this suggestion and requires that, before applying the modified gross income method under §1.861&hyph;9T(j), an adjustment to gross income must be made for DASTM gain or loss attributed to assets under §1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(v) and DASTM gain or loss on short-term, non-interest-bearing trade payables under §1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(viii)(A). In accordance with comments described above, §1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(viii)(A) provides that DASTM gain or loss on short-term, non-interest-bearing trade payables is allocated to the same category or type of gross income as the cost or expense to which the trade payable relates. For this purpose, a short-term, non-interest-bearing trade payable is a non-interest-bearing liability with a term of 183 days or less that is incurred to purchase property or services to be used by the obligor in an active trade or business. Under §1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(viii)(B), a similar rule has been provided for excise tax payables. Under §1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(viii)(C)( 1 ), DASTM gain or loss on other non-interest-bearing liabilities is allocated under §1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(ix) (i.e., on a gross income basis). However, under §1.985&hyph;3(e)(3)(viii)(C)( 2 ), the taxpayer may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the district director, or the district director may determine, that application of the gross income allocation method would result in a substantial distortion of income. In that case, DASTM gain or loss on such liabilities may be attributed to the same section 904(d) separate category or subpart F category as the transaction to which the liability relates. The temporary regulations under §1.954&hyph;2T have been amended in this Treasury Decision and will be finalized as part of a separate regulation. An accompanying proposed regulation provides rules that would require a taxpayer to change from DASTM to the P&L method when the currency which otherwise would be its functional currency ceases to be hyperinflationary. Effective Date These regulations are effective for taxable years beginning after August 24, 1994. However, a taxpayer may elect to apply §1.985&hyph;3 to any open taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986 (whether or not DASTM has been previously elected for some or all of those years). In order to make this election, the taxpayer must apply §1.985&hyph;3 to that year and all subsequent years. In addition, each person that is related (within the meaning of §1.985&hyph;3(e)(2)(vi)) to the taxpayer on the last day of any taxable year for which the election is effective and that would have been eligible to elect DASTM must also apply §1.985&hyph;3 to that year and all subsequent years.
