In Drammen on the other hand, the number of such deaths has doubled. So far this year 42 people have been found dead in Oslo from overdoses. During all of last year 76 such deaths were recorded. There is no clear explanation of this development. The head of the overdose team in Oslo, Rolf-Dieter Cron, thinks that the increase in drug interdiction during the past year has played no part in this positive development. Fewer Emergencies The police are also hesitant to draw any solid conclusions about what impact large drug confiscations have had on the availability in the illegal market. The overdose team has had fewer emergency calls than in the previous two years. At the same time one has had to give antidotes to several people to save their life. Last year about 60 percent of those who had taken an overdose were given an antidote, and this year this has risen to almost 80 percent. "Of the 42 deaths recorded this year we see a trend that many of these do not belong to the typical inner-city environment. Many of these have been visitors. I am now anxious to see if the decline in the number of deaths will also take place in other large cities like Copenhagen, Bremen, and Stockholm," Cron says. He thinks that if there is no decline in the other cities, the overdose team's efforts are an important reason for the decline in Oslo. He thinks that the increase in confiscated sedatives will also have an impact. Police this year have confiscated 30,000 pills compared to about 10,000 last year. Dramatic in Drammen "We know that the mixture of heroin and sedatives is a life-threatening combination. When it is more difficult to obtain pills, this situation will have an effect on the number of overdoses," Cron says. Drammen has had a tremendous increase in the number of drug deaths this past year. So far 21 deaths have been recorded. In all of last year the city had 13 such cases. The cities of Stavanger and Bergen have also had a higher number of overdoses and deaths. Because of the increases there the number of deaths in the entire country will probably not decrease this year compared to last year. Then a total of 97 deaths were recorded. Police Lieutenant Kristian Sather at Drammen police station is quite worried over this development. "It is increasingly younger people who are being recruited into the drug scene. Drammen is a burdened city, and we have much to fight against." He points out the fact that the police alone cannot prevent people from being drawn into the drug scene. "The ambulance service in Drammen has done a great job and saved many lives," Sather says.
