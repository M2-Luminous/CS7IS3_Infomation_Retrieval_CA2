The supplementary budget submitted earlier by the government will extend for 40 days a 50-day provisional budget worth 11.05 trillion yen that is nearing expiration. The revised stopgap budget totaling 21.94 trillion yen for 90 days was endorsed at an extraordinary cabinet meeting in the morning. The rare supplement on a stopgap budget -- the first since fiscal 1990 -- followed the continued political turmoil involving the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the selection of Premier Tsutomu Hata. Diet deliberations for the 73.08 trillion yen full budget for fiscal 1994, submitted to the Diet unusually late on March 4, were finally begun Tuesday, but uncertainties over a speedy passage still prevail with the ruling coalition holding a minority of Diet seats. It normally takes about two months for a full budget to pass through the Diet.
