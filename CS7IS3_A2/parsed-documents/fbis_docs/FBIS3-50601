It further stated that it condemns any interference in matters that come under its sole jurisdiction. The foreign minister made this public after reporting that he had received a letter from the U.S. Embassy, bearing seal number 466, in which the U.S. Government expressed its disagreement with the alleged granting of a pardon to a person implicated in terrorist crimes. Aranibar stated that it is incumbent upon the Bolivian Government, to the exclusion of everybody else, to grant or not to grant a pardon to persons involved in some crimes, and that all the different levels of the judiciary abide by the country's legislation. The foreign minister further stated that last 29 November he had received a verbal note from the U.S. Embassy, in which it voiced its opinion about the alleged granting of a pardon to a Bolivian citizen, Marcelo Oliva, who was implicated in an attack on the U.S. "Marines'" residence. "We answered them through another verbal note, as appropriate, stressing that that was a matter that comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bolivian Government," he explained. He thus indicated that the different levels of the judiciary will respect the country's rules and legislation, which establish with striking clarity the independence of the three branches of government and the duties of each of them. According to the foreign minister's statement, the long and the short of it is that the Foreign Ministry has made it clear that "the Bolivian Government acts and will act pursuant to the country's legislation." He went on to say that the Bolivian Government likewise condemns any interference in matters that come under its sovereign decision. With regard to the "not too friendly" tone of the letter issued by the U.S. Embassy, Aranibar said that the Foreign Ministry's response to it was couched "in the tone, terms, and firmness suitable to the occasion." In its letter the U.S. Embassy states that "the traditionally excellent relations existing between our countries may be adversely affected if a pardon is granted to terrorists or if any other measure is taken to release them." To this effect, it points out that "the United States will hold responsible any individual who, directly or indirectly, supports terrorist actions against U.S. citizens or U.S. interests." The letter openly accuses the Pro-Amnistia group for its activities toward obtaining a pardon for citizens who have been taken into custody on terrorist charges. It even threatens with applying all sorts of retaliatory measures if a pardon is indeed granted to these people.
