The representatives of the military and civilian space departments who spoke there wasted many words trying to persuade those present -- for which there was not the slightest need -- that the Baykonur cosmodrome is a unique scientific and technical facility and that Russia needs it to attain its strategic goals in space exploration and to improve its rocket technology. Expenditure on its upkeep, which has been agreed with the Kazakhstani Government, should come this year to 37 billion rubles [R]. Kazakhstan's share of this is R5.8 billion, but in actual fact the republic has appropriated R1.9 billion. Specialists estimate that at least R169.9 billion will be required next year to ensure the facility's normal operations. Who will bear the cost? Russia, of course, as it has the primary interest in the space programs being carried out and in using this facility. But what then is Kazakhstan's interest in this? Nobody at the conference could provide a comprehensible answer to this key question. Nor could they propose a package of measures which would offer any social guarantees at all to the people working in the harsh conditions at Baykonur today. It is clear that, unless these questions are answered, the draft memorandum the Russian side is preparing for discussion by the two states' presidents may also become unviable or even useless. At least three such documents on the cosmodrome have been signed, but in the meantime the boiler houses are shutting down, the living quarters are going unheated, ultramodern equipment is being spoiled, and, most important, specialists are leaving. So will the destruction of this unique space facility come to an end? There is some hope that it will, but with one small proviso: If we finally learn not to impose our conditions on our partners but come to an agreement with them.
