FBIS4-27614 "dreas106__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-106-A Daily Report 28 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Further Reportage on On-Going Framework Talks Further Reportage on On-Going Framework Talks Tokyo Worried About Objective Criteria OW3105131694 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 28 May 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3105131694 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] It was learned on 27 May that during negotiations on the resumption of the framework trade talks, the United States rejected a Japanese definition of objective criteria. This was learned when the draft agreement drawn up by Japan was compared with the final agreement on the resumption of the trade talks, which was disclosed on 27 May. The Japanese Government has so far evaluated the results of the negotiations highly. A government source said: "It is now clear that objective criteria are not numerical targets." But after the details of the negotiations were disclosed, the same government source expressed concern, saying: "Washington will interpret objective criteria as something similar to numerical targets." Another government source said the Hata administration, which is in a precarious position, "might have given priority to `reopening' the trade talks in an attempt to earn diplomatic points to strengthen its power." A government source who participated in the recent unofficial negotiations with Washington considers the final agreement to be advantageous to Japan. Stressing that the demand for setting numerical targets was averted, he said: "Japan is not bound by numerical targets and will not be criticized [for not achieving such targets]." However, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, a top Japanese negotiator in the talks with the United States, said: "Although objective criteria are not numerical targets, Washington will put forward a demand very similar to that for setting numerical targets." As such, there is strong concern about Washington's future moves. Japan and the United States have agreed that objective criteria should be defined as "qualitative and quantitative standards." A government source expressed concern that Washington might give much weight to quantitative yardsticks, saying: "In sectorial trade talks, Tokyo and Washington will argue over what quantitative yardsticks should be, whether they should use total trade volume or market shares as yardsticks. Each side will try to adopt benchmarks advantageous to itself." Some government officials are critical of the recent agreement. One official said: "Although trade is a two-way act, the recent agreement includes only demands on Japan and makes few references to what the United Stats should do." Both Japan and the United States have reasons for having made the hasty agreement. President Bill Clinton needs to promote cooperation with Asia, because there is criticism within his administration against his Asia policy. Meanwhile, the Hata government has to take some measures to strengthen its power. A government source said: "It is highly possible that in the resumed talks, the two countries will again confront each other over objective criteria. It is very questionable to say that it was right for Japan to have made that heavy concession."
