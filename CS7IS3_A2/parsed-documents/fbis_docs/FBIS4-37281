We have been closely following the developments in the Korean Peninsula. We trust that all the parties concerned will exercise the maximum restraint so that peace and tranquility can be maintained in the region, and existing tensions can be eliminated. 2. We follow with great interest the current mission being undertaken by former president, Jimmy Carter of the U.S. and hope that the positive first steps which have been achieved can be further built upon. 3. India abstained on the resolution adopted by the board of governors of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] last week, our view being that punitive measures adopted in the United Nations or elsewhere could exacerbate matters at this stage, making a resolution of the issue more difficult. We hope that negotiations will continue through which a way will be found to peacefully resolve this crisis.
