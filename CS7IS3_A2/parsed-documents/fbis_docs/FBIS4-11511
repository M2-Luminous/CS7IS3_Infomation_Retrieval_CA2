They were found in the central and the decentralized administration, in governors' offices, legislative assemblies, city halls, and municipal councils. Cases of misapplication of funds (used for purposes other than those intended) have been observed in the central administration for more than 664 million bolivares; the fractionalization of construction contracts to avoid prior review, for 450 million bolivares; irregularities in the Daily Care Homes program for 4.7 million bolivares; and a number of irregularities in the rental of equipment for the 1992 elections for 164 million bolivares plus $136,000. There was a diversion to other purposes of funds allocated for the modernization of the Treasury; a quantity of merchandise abandoned and with evidence of pilferage, amounting to more than $9 million and located in customs and warehouses; lack of accountability of vehicles belonging to the state and the assignment of some of them to retired military officers; and the blockage in commercial banks of 287 million bolivares allotted to the Milk Fund and Food Fund programs. According to the report, 91 warnings were given during the period for lack of documentation and wrongful payment for 37 million bolivares. Employees were fined 606,500 bolivares for violating the regulations. Thirteen investigations were begun of presumably irregular acts, and five accusations were sent to the state prosecutor for civil and criminal charges. With regard to tax receipts, the comptroller's report describes delays and frequent requests for postponements, to the extent that information on 1992's accounts is available. In addition, the organization reports shortcomings in accounting operations and defects in conducting collections. In the area of customs, the report says that airport customs at Maiquetia has not turned in its accounts for 1990, 1991, and 1992, while customs' accounts at La Guaira and Puerto Cabello for 1992 are still pending. The Comptroller's Office says that, with regard to Tax Stamp fees, none of the Finance Ministry's regional offices has turned in its accounts. As for the Value Added Tax, the office inspected the customs' posts to oversee compliance with requirements, the truthfulness of declarations, the determination of the tax base, and billing and payment of taxes, following which it concluded that existing deficiencies have created the conditions for the commission of irregularities and impede the proper oversight of billing and collecting taxes. With regard to liquor taxes, it was noted that 1.184 billion bolivares that were declared were not paid within the legal time limit and late fees were not collected. States and Municipalities The report says that the Comptroller's Office conducted 19 inspections, of which the field work was concluded for nine, and another three were still being conducted at the end of 1993. It is noted that the inspection plan was suspended for a time due to activities providing advice to new governors and mayors on such matters as the changes in budget laws and ordinances, and the role of municipal comptrollers. The organization began 18 administrative investigations and declared 66 regional and local officials to be responsible. In addition, 32 charges were substantiated and forwarded to the prosecutor, with evidence of civil and criminal responsibility. Decentralized Administration The Comptroller's Office carried out its responsibilities with the decentralized agencies by means of inspections, financial and administrative audits, and supervision, for a total of 512 actions. The majority of these dealt with oversight of the Program Law for Financing the Investment Plan; surveillance of the privatization process and use of funds from the so-called social megaproject; and inspection of the austerity program ordered by the government in 1992. The organization confirmed the existence of attitudes contrary to fiscal discipline and to the efficient management of public services, and of disrespect for legal procedures "with no sign of a desire to remedy the situation and to apply suitable sanctions against the officials responsible, with the aggravating circumstance of the high social and financial cost which, in the country's current condition, the erratic and inefficient performance of public institutions entails." The report states that these situations were promptly brought to the attention of the pertinent authorities so that they could take the required corrective measures. Decentralized organizations and activities investigated by the comptroller included the indebtedness of the PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.], the situation in Pequiven [Petrochemical Company of Venezuela, Inc.], construction contracts of CVG [Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana], public credit obligations of Bauxiven [Venezuelan Bauxite, Inc.], payment of interest at Edelca [Caroni River Electrification Project], the sale of products at less than international prices at Fesilven [expansion not given], verification of the terms of sale of Bandagro [Agricultural-Livestock Development Bank], oversight of the austerity programs at the national universities, evaluation of zero-coupon bond operations at the Central Bank, review of obligations undertaken and use made of funds received by the Workers Bank of Venezuela, analysis of the financial situation of the Industrial Bank, evaluation of the privatization program of the Investment Fund of Venezuela, study of the restructuring process at Corpoindustria, inspections at Cadafe [Electrical Administration and Development Corporation], evaluation of the John Paul II program, of the Simon Bolivar Center, analysis of losses at the National Institute of Race Tracks, the financial situation of the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security, and analysis of investments by INCE [National Institute of Cooperative Education].
