FR940922-1-00018 FR940922-1-00006 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 538 [Docket No. 94&hyph;35; Notice 1] RIN 2127&hyph;AF37 Minimum Driving Range for Dual Fueled Electric Passenger Automobiles AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Request for comments. SUMMARY: This document announces that NHTSA is considering the proposal of a minimum driving range for dual fueled electric passenger automobiles, otherwise known as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The purpose of establishing the range is to encourage the production of HEVs. An HEV which meets the range would qualify to have its fuel economy calculated according to a special procedure that would facilitate the efforts of its manufacturer to comply with the corporate average fuel economy standards. Comments are requested to assist the agency in developing the proposed range. DATES: Comments must be received by November 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on this notice must refer to the docket and notice numbers set forth above and then be submitted (preferably 10 copies) to the Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 5313, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. (Docket hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Yolene Young, Office of Market Incentives, NRM&hyph;21, Room 5320, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;6349. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (AMFA), as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, has two essential purposes: (1) To encourage the development and widespread use of methanol, ethanol, natural gas, other gaseous fuels, and electricity as transportation fuels by consumers; and (2) To promote the production of alternatively fueled motor vehicles. To achieve those purposes, the AMFA provides that alternatively fueled motor vehicles that meet an appropriate minimum driving range qualify for special treatment in the calculation of their fuel economy for purpose of their manufacturers' compliance with the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The inclusion of electricity in the list of alternative fuels covered by the AMFA necessitates that a minimum driving range be established for dual fueled electric passenger automobiles for fuel economy credit purposes. The AMFA specifies a minimum driving range of 200 miles for dual fueled passenger cars (other than dual fueled electric) when operating on the alternative fuel, but allows the Secretary of Transportation to establish the minimum driving range for dual fueled electric passenger cars. The purpose of this notice is to seek public comments about HEVs that would aid the agency in developing a proposed driving range. The AMFA and Energy Policy Act provisions, which are codified at 49 U.S.C. sections 32901(c) and 32905, require the Secretary of Transportation to establish a minimum driving range for dual fueled electric vehicles. This minimum range requirement applies to passenger automobiles only. It does not apply to dual fueled light trucks. In seeking to carry out its goals, the Act attempts to balance two competing objectives: (1) Encouraging the production of alternatively fueled vehicles by offering CAFE standard compliance incentives; and (2) Encouraging the purchase of alternatively fueled vehicles by consumers by providing the incentives to only those vehicles whose range of operation is large enough to meet consumer needs. The setting of a minimum driving range for dual fueled electric automobiles must balance the needs of the consumer with the technical and economic considerations that are faced by the manufacturers. A low minimum driving range eligibility criterion might encourage the production of dual fueled cars, but lead to dual fueled electric vehicles being designed with such a low alternative fuel driving range that consumers do not buy them or, even if they buy them, infrequently operate them on the alternative fuel. Conversely, an excessively stringent minimum driving range eligibility criterion might discourage the production of dual fueled electric cars and unnecessarily compromise other vehicle attributes and aspects of performance. Manufacturers would be discouraged by an overly-stringent minimum range because a vehicle which does not meet the minimum driving range for its type is unlikely to be built since the manufacturer would not receive any of the benefits or incentives provided by the Act. From the viewpoint of the consumer, the necessary driving range may be dictated by the convenience of a range that permits a typical workweek travel distance, or a daily travel distance for a fleet car. Also, if the majority of consumers would use a dual fueled electric vehicle in an urban area with more recharging stations or in a fleet application with a central recharging station, a large driving range may be less critical. Whether the range is large or small, the agency will need a method of measuring the range of HEVs. NHTSA is considering basing the dual fueled electric vehicle driving range on procedures established by a Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) committee. The SAE is currently developing procedures for chassis dynamometer measurements of range, electrical energy consumption, fuel economy, and exhaust emissions of HEVs. In a brief overview, the SAE HEV Test Procedure Task Force committee's actions will include: (1) Classifying the vehicle by driving range and ability to complete the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) driving cycle,
