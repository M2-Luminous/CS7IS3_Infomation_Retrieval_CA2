Technology development _The creation of new technology or the use and application of existing technology to promote the development and commercialization of new products, new processes, and new services that can be produced or provided in rural areas. Rural and rural area _Includes all territory of a State, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands that is not within the outer boundary of any city having a population of 50,000 or more and its immediately adjacent urbanized and urbanizing areas with a population density of more than 100 persons per square mile, as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture according to the latest decennial census of the United States. Urbanized area _An area immediately adjacent to a city having a population of 50,000 or more which, for general social and economic purposes, constitutes a single community and has a boundary contiguous with that of the city. Such community may be incorporated or unincorporated to extend from the contiguous boundary(ies) to recognizable open country, less densely settled areas, or natural boundaries such as forests or water. Minor open spaces such as airports, industrial sites, recreational facilities, or public parks shall be disregarded. Outer boundaries of an incorporated community extend at least to its legal boundaries. Cities which may have a contiguous border with another city, but are located across a river from such city, are recognized as a separate community and are not otherwise considered a part of an urbanized or urbanizing area, as defined in this section, are not in a nonrural area. Urbanizing area _A community which is not now, or within the foreseeable future not likely to be, clearly separate from and independent of a city of 50,000 or more population and its immediately adjacent urbanized areas. A community is considered ``separate from'' when it is separated from the city and its immediately adjacent urbanized area by open country, less densely settled areas, or natural barriers such as forests or water. Minor open spaces such as airports, industrial sites, recreational facilities, or public parks shall be disregarded. A community is considered ``independent of'' when its social and economic structure (e.g., government; educational, health, and recreational facilities; and business, industry, tax base, and employment opportunities) is not primarily dependent on the city and its immediately adjacent urbanized areas. Sec. 4284.505␣Applicant Eligibility (a) Grants may be made to public bodies or nonprofit institutions. (1) The RDA will proceed as follows in rural area determinations: When the RDA determines an area to be urbanized or urbanizing, he/she must then determine the population density per square mile. If the project otherwise appears to be eligible, the RDA will request the National Office to provide the correct density figure. (2) All such density determinations will be made on the basis of minor civil division or census county division as used by the Bureau of the Census. In making the density calculations, large nonresidential tracts devoted to urban land uses such as railroad yards, airports, industrial sites, parks, golf courses, and cemeteries or land set aside for such purposes will be excluded. (b) An outstanding judgement obtained against an applicant by the United States in a Federal Court (other than in the United States Tax Court), which has been recorded, shall cause the applicant to be ineligible to receive any grant or loan until the judgement is paid in full or otherwise satisfied. RDA grant funds may not be used to satisfy the judgement. Questions about whether or not a judgement is still outstanding should be directed to the Office of the General Counsel (OGC).
