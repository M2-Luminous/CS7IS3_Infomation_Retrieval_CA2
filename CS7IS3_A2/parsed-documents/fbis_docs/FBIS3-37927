He attributed this to shortage of skilled men and absence of command structures or deployment systems. This is the reason why Russia has undertaken to send troops on peacekeeping missions to `hot spots' in the former USSR. "There are numerous Russians residing in conflict areas and we must protect their interests," the minister said. He said that the reform of the Russian armed forces had run into problems in terms of the financing and construction of homes for servicemen. He hoped nevertheless, that the compact and mobile forces that are required by the new military doctrine would be set up.
