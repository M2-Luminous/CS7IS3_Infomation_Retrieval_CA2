FR940812-2-00178 FR940812-2-00065 MPAA opposes application of the practice of grandfathering permitted signals. According to MPAA, if the Commission engages in a reranking of markets, ``the Office must either accept the reordering entirely or not at all for copyright royalty purposes.'' MPAA, comments at 5. If reranking results in a second 50 market moving to the first 50, cable systems in that newly reranked market would gain an additional permitted signal. However, cable systems located in a market that loses one or more permitted signals as a result of reordering would have to pay the increased 3.75% royalty rate for those signals. This must be so because the practice of grandfathering would unfairly advantage cable systems: they would gain the benefit of additional permitted signals when their markets move up the §76.51 list, but would not lose any permitted signals when their markets move down the list. Id. at 6. Permitting grandfathering would, in MPAA's opinion, create as a practical result a §76.51 list which, for copyright purposes, would treat more than 50 markets as being top 50 markets since cable operators in markets dropping out of the top 50 as the result of an FCC reranking would still retain the copyright benefits of being a top 50 market. Id . at 7. Full acceptance or rejection of a Commission reranking will preserve balance in the royalty scheme. Id . United Video criticizes MPAA's position, submitting that ``the issue should not be maintaining precise balance or `imbalance' in the royalty plan or whether cable systems receive some minimal advantage or disadvantage. The primary issue and consideration in this proceeding should be the public interest in avoiding disruption of television signal carriage.'' United Video, reply comments at 2. Joint Cable Operators state that ``[w]hile the idea of cable systems gaining or losing permitted signals as they move up or down the major market list has a certain `symmetrical' appeal to it, the result will be needless disruption in service to viewers.'' Joint Cable Operators, comments at 3. e. Policy Considerations. In addition to responding to our questions, several commentators offered other reasons for accepting any and all changes to the §76.51 list. In what can loosely be categorized as ``policy considerations,'' these parties ask us to continue our 1987 Policy Decision accepting FCC redesignations and give effect to Congressional efforts to harmonize the cable compulsory license with the 1992 Cable Act. Several commentators aligned with broadcast and cable interests argue that the current proceeding is unnecessary because we already resolved the handling of §76.51 redesignations in our 1987 proceeding. See, e.g. , Press Broadcasting, comments at 3&hyph;4; NCTA, comments at 4; INTV, comments. They underscore that the Office's 1987 statement ``formally adopts the view that signals entitled to mandatory carriage status under the FCC's former must-carry rules as a result of an FCC market redesignation order are to be treated as local signals for purposes of the cable compulsory license,'' 52 FR 28362 (July 29, 1987), and argue that nothing supports a change in this position. They argue that if the Office ignored its 1987 Policy Decision and did not follow Commission redesignations, then the Office would in effect be making its own determination of market status. R&R Media Corp., comments at 6. See also NAB, comments at 4&hyph;5 (Copyright Office has no authority to ignore FCC changes to §76.51). According to INTV, maintaining the 1987 practice is ``more likely to promote the basic policy goal of copyright.'' INTV, comments at 18. We ``must resist the superficial notion which suggests that enlarging stations' copyright local area would decrease the cable royalty pool,'' and recognize that the addition of communities to §76.51 markets will increase carriage of broadcast stations not previously carried by cable systems in those markets because of distant royalty fees. Id. at 19. Increased carriage will make more broadcast stations stronger, and ``stations then will be in a position to pay more for programming. This enhances the value of the program owners' copyrights and assures an enhanced reward for use of their works. Program production is stimulated, and the goal of copyright is furthered.'' Id . at 20. Several commentators also argue that the Copyright Office's refusal to follow §76.51 changes would frustrate policy goals of the 1992 Cable Act. Press Broadcasting notes the language in the House version of the 1992 Cable Act, stating ``[n]othing in this section shall be construed to modify or otherwise affect title 17, United States Code,'' was deliberately omitted from the Senate version that ultimately became the law. Press Broadcasting, comments at 8. ``By deleting language which would have rendered the Copyright Act immutable in the face of the 1992 Cable Act, Congress has at least strongly suggested that the latter legislation, being Congress' most recent action in the area, should be deemed to take precedence over the 17 year-old Copyright Act to the limited extent that any conflict between the two may be perceived.'' Id . at 8. INTV argues that Congress' direction in the 1992 Cable Act to update §76.51 is an effort to harmonize what is a local signal for both the Cable Act and section 111 of the Copyright Code. INTV, reply comments at 1&hyph;2. Through the 1992 Cable Act, Congress abandoned the unnecessarily restrictive and difficult to administer 1976 must-carry definition of a local signal, employing the more rationally based ADI concept. Congress also gave the FCC authority to adjust ADI determinations in situations where application of ADI would result in broadcast stations in the same market being treated differently. INTV, comments at 8 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 268, 102 Cong., 2d Sess. 98 (1992)). According to INTV, updating §76.51 promotes both goals of ADI-wide carriage and parity among stations. Failure to recognize market redesignations for compulsory copyright license purposes ``would hinder ADI-wide carriage and promote competitive disparity among broadcast stations in the same market.'' Id . at 9. V. Policy Decision We have fully considered the record in this proceeding and are satisfied that the 1992 Cable Act's amendment of the Communications Act of 1934 requiring that the FCC make ``necessary revisions to update section 76.51 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations'' is not a substantive change of the ``rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976.'' As a matter of sound copyright policy, we will therefore observe the redesignations of the Ohio, Connecticut, and Georgia markets contained in the Commission's March 29, 1993, Report & Order for purposes of calculating royalty fees under the cable compulsory license, 17 U.S.C. 111. We will also observe for cable compulsory license purposes other FCC redesignations_defined as the addition or deletion of communities to the markets contained on the §76.51 list_made after March 29, 1993. We do not, at this time, take a position with respect to the reranking of markets by the FCC_defined as the reordering and/or addition or deletion of markets contained on the §76.51 list_and its effects on the calculation of the royalty fees under 17 U.S.C. 111.
