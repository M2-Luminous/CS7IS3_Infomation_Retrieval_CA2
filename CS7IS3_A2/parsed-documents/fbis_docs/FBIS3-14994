He declared about this at a meeting with heads of the republic's atomic power plants on Monday. The president reassured that the problem related to the supply of atomic plants with fuel would be solved in the near term, and in accordance with the tripartite statement between Ukraine, Russia, and United States signed in Moscow. Russia pledged to deliver fuel for atomic power plants in exchange for nuclear warheads. In Kravchuk's words, currently, the government is solving issues to improve material conditions for the employees of atomic stations. In particular, the income tax for key experts of atomic power stations is to be lowered by 10%. Kravchuk said that the proposal of atomic power stations' leaders to introduce world prices for power supply should be thoroughly examined. He said that "one should do this very accurately and in a balanced manner so as not to deepen the crisis phenomena in the economy and in the state." In Kravchuk's opinion, the issue of drawing foreign investments into atomic energy "is to be further analyzed and examined." A presidential decree on urgent measures to develop the atomic energy complex is expected to be issued in the near future.
