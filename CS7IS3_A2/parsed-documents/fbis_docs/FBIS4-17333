He says in the private notes that two years of economic reform carried out by former First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar showed Russia's peculiarities and that "Russia must go its own way." KYODO NEWS SERVICE has obtained a copy of his memoirs to be published early may in Russia and abroad. In it he describes how he has watched and reacted to recent developments in Russia and the former Soviet Union. It covers the failed coup attempt by conservatives in the former Soviet Union in August 1991 and the military crackdown against rebel members of the Russian parliament last October. Yeltsin said he adopted "shock treatment" by Gaydar, once the main architect of Russia's reforms, because his theories were the most convincing among those of many economists. Yeltsin defended the radical economic policy, saying it would have been impossible for Russia to carry out any different policy. On hyperinflation brought about by the introduction of market reforms, Yeltsin said every nation, without exception, has passed through this sort of era. The memoirs also give Yeltsin's account of his use of troops against conservatives holed up in the White House parliament building in Moscow last October. Yeltsin reveals that he went through "a critical situation" because at first the military did not obey his order to attack the rebels. After declaring a state of emergency, he had tried to dispatch the military to suppress mobs attacking key city buildings, but the troops were slow to act. By finally persuading the military to agree to attack the White House, Yeltsin managed to force the surrender of the conservatives, led by former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy and former parliament chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov. In sharp contrast with bitter remarks about former political foes, Yeltsin praises incumbent government ministers led by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. He calls Chernomyrdin a man who is reliable and has never betrayed his expectations. Describing a visit to Japan shortly after last autumn's turmoil in Moscow, Yeltsin said he went ahead with it out of concern that suspending it might have damaged bilateral ties for a long period. "If it had not been to Japan, I could have canceled the visit, but I thought I must go," he writes. [sentence as received] Before last October's visit, Yeltsin had twice called off scheduled trips to Japan. He indicates his desire to complete his four-year term of office, saying he will leave politics in accordance with the constitution. A Japanese-language version of the book is scheduled to be published early May, publishing world sources said. The book will be titled as Yeltsin's Memoirs -- Behind the Scenes of Collapse and Confrontation."
