"We are at the right time for Cuba to rejoin the hemispheric community of nations," said Caldera, recalling statements made by Portuguese President Mario Soares, who said Castro was "a man beyond suspicion." Soares expressed respect and admiration for President Castro, saying "the Cold War ended, and the Berlin Wall fell; therefore, there are no reasons whatsoever why Cuba could not help abate the isolation it is in." Caldera said the current conditions are propitious for the island to rejoin the OAS, but "it is also the time for Cuba to revise its domestic policies." The Venezuelan president decried the blockade against Cuba, "because any unilateral blockade harms the people rather than a certain government." Answering questions from the media, the Venezuelan chief of state said "neoliberal policies carried out at any price and policies of structural adjustment rigorously carried out in an orthodox manner have made us pay a very high social cost." Caldera believes trade openings and processes of integration have benefited all nations, but "the exaggeration with which the neoliberal doctrine has been implemented has deteriorated society, and those peoples who elected us are demanding better and more humane living conditions," he said. Caldera, along with 21 chiefs of state and government (in addition to Dominican Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso), are attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which will end on 15 June at this port, located 1,200 km from Santa Fe de Bogota along the Colombian Caribbean coast.
