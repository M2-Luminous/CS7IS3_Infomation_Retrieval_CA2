FBIS4-27899 "dreas109__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-109-A Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo Supports Weapons Embargo Against DPRK Tokyo Supports Weapons Embargo Against DPRK OW0606133694 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 6 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0606133694 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Japan, the United States, and South Korea have agreed in principle to "take appropriate measures including economic sanctions against North Korea in the UN Security Council" for its suspected development of nuclear weapons. In response, the government highly assessed the agreement on 5 June, saying, "Japan, the United States, and South Korea have been able to show their cohesiveness," (according to a Foreign Ministry source). The idea surfaced in response to Japan's insistence that the UN Security Council adopt a "resolution warning North Korea," and the government plans to speedily study from early next week the possibility of including an embargo on the export of weapons to North Korea in the resolution. While the United States, Britain, and other nations are taking a tough stand, China is still cautious about any economic sanctions against North Korea. Japan, therefore, is likely to be pressed to conduct difficult coordination. The government will start a full-fledged study of measures to be taken by Japan after Shunji Yanai, chief of the Foreign Policy Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, who attended the tripartite talks, returns to Japan on 6 June. The government will hold a meeting of the "Joint Information Council" on 6 June that is to be attended by officials from relevant ministries and agencies, and chaired by Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara. With regard to the "resolution warning North Korea" and other sanctions that were discussed at the tripartite talks, the government sees the resolution as "a highly possible option," (according to an informed source). The Japanese Government has adopted a basic policy for "phased sanctions against North Korea" under which 1) the UN Security Council first adopts the "resolution warning North Korea"; 2) in case North Korea refuses to go along with the resolution, then the UN Security Council "votes to slap the economic sanctions on North Korea"; and 3) in case China opposes the economic sanctions, then Japan, the United States, and South Korea impose their own economic sanctions against North Korea. The Japanese Government has adopted this basic policy, taking into account the situation where China is expressing its disapproval of the economic sanctions against North Korea, and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is opposing any economic sanctions imposed jointly by Japan, the United States, and South Korea as long as the UN Security Council does not vote to impose such economic sanctions. The export embargo of weapons and materials used to build nuclear weapons to North Korea is included in measures that the government believes Japan can take. The government believes that since such weapons and materials are not actually exported to North Korea, Japan's proposal for the export embargo will be accepted by other nations (according to a government source). The proposal is the product of a compromise between the United States, that has advocated imposing tough economic sanctions against North Korea from the beginning, and Japan and South Korea that have been negative about imposing the economic sanctions. As a result, the proposal has saved the face of the United States. The effect of the economic sanctions is believed to be slim. Therefore, there is a high possibility that the United States, Britain, and France will demand tougher economic sanctions against North Korea. The question remains whether China will really go along with Japan on the proposal for imposing the export embargo of weapons to North Korea. While some government officials take an optimistic view that China will accept the proposal in the end, other government officials take the pessimistic view that China will resist the proposal to the last. The government intends to do everything it can in concert with the United States to persuade China.
