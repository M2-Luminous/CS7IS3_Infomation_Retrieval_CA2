Mun Chong-su, secretary-general of South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), held working-level talks with Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party, to discuss promoting exchanges betweem the DLP and the Communist Party. The two parties, which began their exchanges when South Korean President Kim Yong-sam visited Beijing in March, agreed to expand the exchanges to low-level party structures and grass roots, including district chapters and young party members. Mun, saying party chairman Kim Chong-pil hoped to visit China in November, discussed a detailed schedule with Li. He also invited a senior Communist Party official to visit Seoul, DLP officials said. Mun and Li traded views on boosting cooperation to help peace take root in Northeast Asia and supported a further strengthening of economic and overall relations between the two governments. After the meeting, Mun met with Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, at Diaoyutai, the official guest house, and visited the Foreign Ministry on Wednesday afternoon. At the ministry, Mun is scheduled to be briefed by Tang Jiaxuan, vice foreign minister for Asia, on the situation in Northeast Asia and they will exchange views on pending major issues between South Korea and China, including the North Korean nuclear problem.
