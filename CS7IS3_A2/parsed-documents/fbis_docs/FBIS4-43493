The top treasury official spoke in an interview with ANSA during a visit here to meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Director General of the International Monetary Fund Michel Camdessus. Dini called the decision "a potential element worsening the public accounts balance that the government will have to take note of during the preparation of the 1995 budget." The Treasury Minister did not rule out the need for new budget adjustments soon to counteract the spending increase that ruling will entail. Dini said his U.S. and IMF interlocutors, with whom he talked about topics that will be discussed during the July Group of Seven summit in Naples, had shown great interest in the 1995 budget, "from which they expect to be able to evaluate the economic policy and strategy of the government."
