The blast was confirmed by Witwatersrand Liaison Officer Col Dave Bruce. He could not confirm it was a car bomb. A spokesman for the Joint Operational Centre in Pretoria said although details of the airport blast were still scanty, reports had been received that three people had been injured -- one seriously. "There was a car bomb," said a spokeswoman at the Operational Centre. But police in a later official statement said "an explosive device...as yet unknown type" exploded at the airport. Police could not immediately confirm any deaths. SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reported a "car bomb" exploded at the parking area adjoining the arrivals facility. Kempton Park fire brigade officers were treating several injured people who sustained injuries.
