The watchword will be "a tougher opposition," and to this end the People's Party leadership has decided to focus its line on corruption and the government's economic failure, making it clear that "the person responsible is Felipe Gonzalez," People's Party leadership sources told LA VANGUARDIA. The PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] congress will mark the turning point for the definitive change of strategy, since they wish to prevent Gonzalez from "capitalizing on the closing of ranks around him" that could occur, and to this end Jose Maria Aznar and the main party leaders will touch on matters of corruption and economic failure. According to the sources consulted, an instance of the change of strategy will be the speech that the People's Party chairman will deliver at the convention to be held by the party in Torremolinos 26 March, which will be the starting signal for the preliminary campaign for the European and Andalusian elections, and an event that will be attended by several European leaders. However, it will be in the opposition leader's speech in the state-of-the-nation debate scheduled for 12 April that Aznar will deliver an all-out criticism of the government and, more specifically, of Felipe Gonzalez -- in contrast to his recent speeches in the house. Again according to the People's Party leadership sources we consulted, corruption is crucial in the situation that the country is experiencing, and they now believe that "it was a mistake" not to raise the issue in the last television debate between Felipe Gonzalez and Jose Maria Aznar on the eve of the general election, after they had based much of their campaign on condemning government corruption. Process of Decomposition The People's Party leadership believes that "this issue is ours" and they cannot remove it from their line, "giving the impression that there has been some kind of shady deal with the government to cover everything up," although Aznar has already begun to raise this issue, to which he did not refer for many months. For instance, at a public meeting held in Alcazar de San Juan in Ciudad Real yesterday, he said that "the country is experiencing a process of decomposition that Felipe Gonzalez is unable to halt," and that "every day we come across a new scandal." The People's Party will try to take advantage of the committees of inquiry that have now been set up in the Congress [of Deputies] -- especially the one dealing with the Roldan affair and Banesto [Credit Bank of Spain] -- or the appearances that could take place with respect to the confidential funds, "which are already tainting the Moncloa Palace." This new strategy will also differ in procedures. Aznar, who has not met with Felipe Gonzalez since 28 December, "does not intend to do so" until the elections, which will mark for the People's Party the time to decide whether to try to bring about a change of government, if the Socialists lose the elections. For that reason, the same sources assert, nor will photographs of People's Party and PSOE leaders negotiating the democratic impetus be repeated. This does not mean that there will not be talks. The two parties' spokesmen in the Congress -- Rodrigo Rato and Carlos Solchaga -- "are talking," but they will do so not publicly, "but as we have always done, and always making it clear that one side is in power and the other side in opposition." These negotiations will be confined to renewing the institutions: "This is normal; there had to be an agreement between the PSOE and the People's Party to renew other bodies in the previous legislative term, too." The aim is "not to give the impression that there is an understanding between government and opposition," since there is none. The key to these talks will be the renewal of the Spanish Radio and Television Company board, without which, the People's Party asserts, "there will be no agreement for the other institutions." According to the same sources, although the two parties' stances are very far apart right now, "there could be an agreement next week." The problems lie in the fact that while the People's Party wants the number of board members it proposes "to be the same as that for the PSOE-CiU [Convergence and Union] coalition," the Socialists utterly reject this stance.
