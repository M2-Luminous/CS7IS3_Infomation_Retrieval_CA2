FR940511-1-00055 FR940511-1-00012 Payments for Child Care for Children With Special Needs Under CCDBG The CCDBG program uses the term ``special needs'' in two different contexts. But as stated earlier for the purpose of payment rate discussion, the term ``children with special needs'' will be used to refer to children with mental or physical impairments that substantially limit one or more of the major life activities. Because the ADA stresses the need for making decisions on accommodations on an individual basis, it is inconsistent to require grantees to set a single or overall payment rate for children with special needs. We believe that grantees must have the flexibility to set payment amounts on a case-by-case basis. As a consequence, we propose to revise ยง98.16(a)(12)(ii) by removing the requirement that grantees justify a decision not to have different rates based on the additional amount charged for child care services provided to a child with special needs. We also propose revising ยง98.43(b)(2) to reflect that additional charges for providing child care for a child with special needs must be for services not required as an accommodation under the ADA. Payments for Child Care for Children With Special Needs Under Title IV&hyph;A The existing regulations governing payments for title IV&hyph;A child care require States to conduct local market surveys to establish rates for such care, including care for children with special needs, where applicable. Further, although the regulations for the CCDBG do not require that grantees conduct such market surveys, many grantees have adopted the title IV&hyph;A local market rates established by these surveys. The ADA does not explicitly prevent States and grantees from continuing to conduct and use such surveys as a method of establishing rates for payment of special needs child care. However, given the emphasis of the ADA on accommodating persons with disabilities on an individualized basis, ACF strongly believes that local market surveys, for the purpose of establishing rates for special needs care, are no longer useful or accurate. Because the ADA stresses that decisions on accommodations for a person's disability must be made on an individual, case-by-case basis, we propose at ยง255.4(a)(2) that in lieu of a local market survey to establish rates for special needs care, States must use the following method for determining payments to providers of care to special needs children: when a provider charges a special needs child, on an individual basis, a rate that exceeds the local market rate for a child of the same age and category of care, that charge would be the local market rate for that special needs child. The State would pay that charge, subject to the statewide limit and applicable cost principles, if it is for services which are not required as an accommodation under the ADA. Other than the statewide limit, our regulations do not provide for or authorize additional limitations on charges for children whose needs go beyond those accommodated under ADA. We had concerns that such limitations could violate the ADA principle of individual accommodation, and we did not want to entangle welfare agencies in decisions about what are appropriate accommodations under ADA. Further, it is our belief that the general cost principles applicable in these programs protect both Federal and State governments against provider charges that are unreasonable. Nevertheless, we are interested in comments in this area. It should be noted that States may continue to establish higher statewide limits for children with special needs. As discussed above, we believe that States cannot establish valid local market rates for children with special needs because, under the ADA, any higher charges must be based on the individual child's and provider's circumstances; these would not be known or taken into account by a survey. Accordingly, we also propose to remove the reference to differentiating local market rates for children with special needs from ยง255.4(a)(3)(ii). In-Home Care The CCDBG and title IV&hyph;A child care regulations currently mandate that States and other grantees offer in-home care as an option to parents whose child care is subsidized by these programs. However, the provisions for in-home care in the two sets of regulations lack compatibility and impede seamless program administration. CCDBG grantees are allowed to limit the availability of in-home care to those situations in which the payment is reasonably similar to payments for other categories of care. The title IV&hyph;A regulations contain no such provision for limiting the availability of in-home care and, unlike the CCDBG, require that States establish local market rates for this category. To increase the compatibility between CCDBG and IV&hyph;A regulations we are proposing to: (1) Allow States and other grantees the same degree of flexibility under both programs; (2) give both programs greater latitude in setting the terms and conditions under which in-home care will be offered; and (3) allow States to establish the minimum wage as the in-home payment rate for care subsidized under title IV&hyph;A without conducting a market survey. We believe that these proposals will give States and other grantees greater control and flexibility over the use of in-home care while protecting parental choice and ensuring that specific family needs can be met. Because this category of care occurs in the child's own home, it has unique characteristics. First, it is affected by the interaction with other laws and regulations. For example, in-home providers are classified as domestic service workers under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. 206(a)) and are therefore covered under minimum wage and tax requirements. Second, child care administrators have faced greater challenges in monitoring the quality of care and the appropriateness of payments to in-home providers. These unique characteristics and the experience of States, Territories and Tribes over the past several years indicate a need for greater flexibility as well as consistent policies across funding streams.
