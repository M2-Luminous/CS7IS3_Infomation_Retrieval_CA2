He said that Lieutenant General Chea Savan, secretary to co-chief of staff Ke Kimyan, would represent the royalist FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and General Ta Mok would represent the Khmer Rouge. No independent confirmation was immediately available. The official said the planned meeting would follow secret talks in Bangkok between the two sides, who were once allies in a coalition against the Phnom Penh government set up by Vietnam. There was no indication of participation by a member of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) which shares power in Phnom Penh with FUNCINPEC following May elections. The Khmer Rouge, which boycotted the elections, was understood to have offered a ceasefire in exchange for posts in the Phnom Penh government. Meanwhile, both the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge continued to bring up reinforcements into western Cambodia where three days of fighting at the New Year left almost 50 dead, the Thai military said. A trader arriving in the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet Wednesday said he had seen long lines of military trucks carrying arms on the 150-kilometer (90-mile) highway from Battambang toward Poipet, especially around Sisophon. Both sides were taking advantage of a two-day ceasefire Wednesday and Thursday arranged by Thailand so that Thai troops could help farmers to bring the rice crop in from the fields, military officials said. Late Wednesday afternoon, border patrol police reported one shell landed on the Thai side of the border but said there was no damage. There was no indication of significant clashes on the Cambodian side. In Poipet, Cambodian government Brigadier General Em Saray said he had been ordered to launch an offensive against the Khmer Rouge in late December. He said he was awaiting fresh orders related to political developments as well as supplies of ammunition.
