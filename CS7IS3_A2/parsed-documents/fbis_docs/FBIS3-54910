In his exclusive interview with INTERFAX he underlined that the joining of new members, Azerbaijan and Georgia, confirms this fact. Shushkevich hopes that in 1994 politicians will pay major attention to the strategy "but not to tactical conveniences and raising of definite political groups in different countries." "If we decide to build the Commonwealth and want that the Russian-speaking population be respected in all its states, as it is in Belarus, then let us behave adequately! Any protest against separate moves of several Russian politicians can grow into an anti-Russian policy," declared Shushkevich. He believes that principles of economic relations and primarily issues related to fuel and energy deliveries from Russia are the most important issues which have not been resolved yet. At the same time, Shushkevich emphasized that those "who accuse him of anti-Russian moods" are guided by poor instincts and not by sound sense." The head of the parliament awaits a new democratic parliament and, perhaps, presidential elections in 1994.
