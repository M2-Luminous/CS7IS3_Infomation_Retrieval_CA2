Cui Tiankai, a Chinese delegate to the UN Second Committee (Economic and Financial), told the committee that the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 adopted by UNCED are milestones, but the consensus reached in Rio de Janeiro last year has yet to be translated into action. ``In spite of the numerous efforts made by the international community in the follow-up of UNCED,'' Cui said, ``they fall far short of the requirements for the effective implementation of the various decisions of UNCED.'' He said that the developed countries should fulfill their commitment and take practical actions by strengthening official development assistance and creating a favorable international economic environment for the economic growth of the developing countries. The developed countries should also provide them with new and additional financial resources for environmental protection and transfer to them on favorable terms environmentally-sound technologies, said the Chinese delegate. He noted that the level of official development assistance from the developed countries has stagnated and in some cases even declined in recent years. This has rendered more elusive the prospects for reaching the targets on financial resources and the transfer of technology as set by the Rio Conference, he added. ``Failure to reverse this trend is bound to erode the Rio consensus and reduce the agreements reached at the conference to a mere scrap of paper,'' he said. Cui said the relevant UN working groups to be set up by the commission on sustainable development should conduct in-depth studies on the developing countries' needs for funds and technology. These groups should also identify the obstacles to the access of the developing countries to funds and the transfer of technology, and come up with viable recommendations on how to overcome those obstacles. He called on the parties concerned to reach an appropriate agreement on the restructuring and replenishment of the global environment facility so that necessary conditions can be created for the facility to play its expected role in the followup of UNCED.
