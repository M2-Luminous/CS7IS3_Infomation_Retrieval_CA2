Kurdish leader Massud Barzani told AFP the Iraqi blockade was causing the region "a very serious problem." Fuel prices tripled when the stoppage went into effect Saturday, with the price of one litre rising from two dinar to six dinar. Stocks rapidly ran out, with queues forming at every petrol station. Public transport was forced off the road by lack of fuel, and the streets were deserted. Barzani, speaking at the headquarters of his Kurdistan Democractic Party (KDP) in Salahuddin, said Baghdad was venting its anger at Friday's UN decision by hitting the Kurds, because it was "not powerful enough to do anything against the UN." The UN Security Council renewed Friday an oil and trade embargo imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, despite a split among council members on whether or not to publically acknowledge Iraq's acceptance of UN demands. The split, the first since the Security Council imposed the embargo, meant the embargo was automatically renewed. Barzani said the UN embargo was also causing Iraqi Kurdistan economic difficulties, and called for finanical aid for the area. Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control for the past three years, after it was set up with the assistance of the allied forces at the end of the Gulf war in February 1991. Barzani added he was willing, if asked, to play a role in helping to solve the problem of the Kurds living in Turkey. A solution in Turkey "must include the Kurdish people and cannot ignore them," he said
