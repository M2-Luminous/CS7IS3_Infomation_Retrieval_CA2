Among imported commodities through the port, automobiles, rolled steel, metal cutting machinery, tools and equipment needed by overseas-funded enterprises here in China have seen a large growth. Meanwhile, the amount of imported fertilizers, plastic materials and paper pulp went down by a big margin last year. Last year also saw more clothes, Coke and cashmere made and produced in China flow into the international market through Tianjin port, while less grain, aquatic products and pig-iron were exported. Northern China's provinces still held the largest share in the import and export trade through Tianjin port, although that of southern and central China provinces has increased somewhat. Tianjin port now has a throughput capacity of about 35 million tons with more than 40 deep-water berths and China's largest container wharf. As the drive of economic reform and opening-up is stepping up, more and more interior provinces and cities in north and west China, including Beijing, find Tianjin port most ideal for their imports and exports.
