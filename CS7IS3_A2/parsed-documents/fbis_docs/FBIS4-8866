The White House is awaiting the outcome of Russia's diplomatic effort to effect a ceasefire around Gorazde, while sending confused signals about its determination to keep up its military pressure on the Serbs and the priority it attaches to political dialogue. President Bill Clinton on Sunday indirectly intimated that the United States would be willing to do an about-face in its current policy towards the Serbs, which has been signaled also by THE WASHINGTON POST. Quoting high-ranking sources in the administration, the daily said that the United States was prepared to consider lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) as an incentive to the Bosnian Serbs to agree to a ceasefire in Bosnia. On Sunday, Clinton discussed the Yugoslav crisis with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, as did Secretary of State Warren Christopher with his Russian opposite number Andrey Kozyrev. Information available at this time suggests that Kozyrev asked Washington to agree that the Bosnian ceasefire deal include a provision on a phased lifting of the anti-Yugoslav sanctions, with Christopher agreeing, albeit reluctantly, that the Serbs needed to be stimulated in some way. Meanwhile, Washington is in a ferment with speculation about what the United States should do in a situation where it is largely considered that the current policy of limited military pressure on the Serbs has been defeated and that the Serbs have humiliated the United States, NATO and the United Nations. The advocates of an intervention are strongly on the offensive, the most rabid of them being former secretary of state and ambassador in Belgrade Lawrence Eagleburger, who has told the C.B.S. network that, if Clinton has crossed the Rubicon and used force, he should now follow through with massive bombings of targets not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina but also deep inside Serbia. The campaign has been actively joined by Bosnian Moslem Vice-President Ejup Ganic, who has made several television appearances for local networks in which he called for a massive air raid on Serb targets and demanded that Clinton immediately send arms to the Moslems in Bosnia. Appearing in a television show with Ganic, Congressman Lee Hamilton poured cold water on both demands, explaining that the United States could not unilaterally exempt the Moslems from the arms sales embargo which has been in force against all of former Yugoslavia since late 1991, as that would in effect constitute an invitation for an escalation of war, and that a massive intervention was not envisaged in the mandate of the United Nations.
