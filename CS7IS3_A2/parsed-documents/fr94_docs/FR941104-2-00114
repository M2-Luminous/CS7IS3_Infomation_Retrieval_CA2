FR941104-2-00114 FR941104-2-00066 CSW and Energy are not seeking Commission authority to finance the construction of the Project at this time. However, the Partnership may incur certain expenses in connection with the development of the Project (``Development Expenses''). The total amount of the Development Expenses will not exceed $12 million. CSW and Energy propose to fund the Development Expenses by capital contributions, loans or open account advances through the various subsidiaries to the Partnership. Loans or open account advances would have a final maturity not to exceed 25 years and would bear interest at a rate per annum not in excess of the prime commercial lending rate as in effect from time-to-time at Mellon Bank plus 4%. The Applicants believe that this rate approximates the current market rate that the Partnership would be able to secure from nonassociate third party lenders for loans of this type.
