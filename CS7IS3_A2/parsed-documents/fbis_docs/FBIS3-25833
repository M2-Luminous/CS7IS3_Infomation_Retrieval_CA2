It is also one project to which the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the municipal government have attached great importance. As a result of the various measures party and government leaders have taken to tighten comprehensive management of public security in recent years, Shanghai's public security and order have improved noticeably, and a environment favorable for Shanghai's reform, opening up, and economic development has been created. Nevertheless, we should also realize that certain districts are still plagued by serious public security problems, and the people are eager to see this situation change. Leading cadres in these districts must fully understand their responsibilities and take effective measures to deal with the problems until actual results have been achieved. Shanghai has a system under which leading cadres are charged with the responsibility for managing public security in a comprehensive manner. This system has institutionalized the principle that "whoever is in charge should also take up his or her responsibilities." Under this system, principal party and government leaders must be the first persons responsible for the security of the districts and departments under their charge. Experience proves the key to achieving comprehensive management of public security lies in the leadership exercised by the top leaders of one level over the top leaders of the next level. Comprehensive management of public security is a broadly involved and formidable social systems engineering project; and only when principal leaders attach importance to it, care for it, support it, and involve themselves in it can they mobilize and guide other responsible cadres to do their job with real efforts. In accordance with their assignments for comprehensive management of public security, party and government cadres at all levels must find their respective positions, discharge their respective responsibilities, properly supervise their own staff, and take proper care of their own affairs so that peace can be ensured in districts under their charge. To succeed in comprehensive management of public security, the system governing leaders' responsibilities in ensuring peace in districts under their charge should become one criterion having a close bearing on leading cadres' term of office, performance evaluation, promotion, and award or disciplinary action. Leading party and government cadres of various districts and departments whose serious negligence of duty has given rise to protracted public disorder or to major incidents upsetting the local stability must be disciplined in accordance with relevant party and administrative rules. To show that they care about comprehensive management of public security, leading cadres at all levels must conduct investigation and study at grass-roots units and attend to their major problems. More importantly, they must pay attention to giving full scope to the roles played by organs in charge of comprehensive management of public security as well as departments in charge of public security, judicial, and educational affairs. Moreover, they must attach importance to the work of these departments, care for their work, support their work, and earnestly help them deal with the outstanding problems they encounter in their work. We should also have effective measures for mobilizing the people, especially party member-cadres, to take part in the management of public security in certain districts or trades so that the work of ensuring peace there will become an obligation of each and every one. Development needs stability, and there will be no development without stability. On the other hand, development promotes stability, and stability ensures development. Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand and have a firm grip of the dialectical relationship between development and stability. Under the new situation where Shanghai continues to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, and take the lead in building a socialist market economic system, we hope all our cadres will take advantage of the system of delegating leading cadres responsibility for comprehensive management of public security, and mobilize and organize people in our society to intensify the project so that a social environment favorable for achieving a sustained, fast, and healthy economic development can be created in Shanghai.
