The meeting mainly discussed the issue of the All Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Chinese Patriotic Prodemocracy Movement [AHKASCPPM]. The backbone of AHKASCPPM was made up by radical democrats in Hong Kong, and AHKASCPPM was led by Szeto Wah and Martin Lee. They had seized the opportunity provided by the activities of people of all sectors in Hong Kong in support of the patriotic student movement at Tiananmen, and had established AHKASCPPM, which had achieved unprecedented development. This was a united front-type organization which was mainly based on center-right forces, while including also people of the left, the center, and the right. The leadership of the organization was in the hands of radical democrats. At that time AHKASCPPM incorporated almost all the democracy- and autonomy-seeking organizations of various tendencies in Hong Kong as well as many of those centrist associations which had been rather politically apathetic before or even some leftist organizations. During the 4 June Incident, they had adopted exceptionally radical strategies in fighting Beijing, shouting the slogans, "down with Deng, Li, and Yang" and "down with fascism"; they had declared that they would not recognize the legitimacy of the "Li Peng regime," and had vowed not to have any contact with the "Li Peng regime." At the meeting Beijing argued that this was an organization attempting to subvert the Chinese Government and a tool used by some Western countries and local anti-Communist forces in their joint effort to turn Hong Kong into an anti-Communist base, and demanded that Britain "outlaw" it. Ji Pengfei agreed to the view expressed by Li Hou [2621 0683] that "we should take up the matter of the British Government's tolerating AHKASCPPM with the British Government and demand that the British Government nullify the registration of AHKASCPPM and outlaw AHKASCPPM." The CPC Hong Kong and Macao Work Committee's view was somewhat different. According to our intelligence units, we argued at the meeting, there really are a small number of people in AHKASCPPM who are using this organization in carrying out activities of fighting the Chinese Government, and among those few people there are representatives of foreign and outside forces who are attempting to turn Hong Kong into an open or semiopen anti-Communist subversive base; but as for the broad masses who participated in activities and shouted radical slogans because of their indignation, we should adopt a policy of dividing and winning over people--winning over the majority and isolating and striking at a small minority. We are in favor of having the British outlaw AHKASCPPM in accordance with the law of Hong Kong. The law of Britain prohibits activities to subvert the British sovereign. With regard to openly calling for the subversion of the Chinese Government and shouting the slogan, down with the Chinese Government, we may take up the matter with the British Government, but we estimate that the chance of Britain's accommodating us is not great; therefore it is still necessary to mainly rely on our own work in the future. As for some people's attempt to turn Hong Kong into an anti-Communist base, we believe that such a situation has existed all along and that the only difference is that some people want to change from operating secretly as in the past into operating openly or semiopenly by exploiting the current movement. The intelligence units have discovered in a preliminary manner that in fleeing the country some of those who participated in the democracy movement in the hinterland have depended on the help from AHKASCPPM which has not only provided money but has also specially assigned people to do the job. Some of those who have fled the country first stayed at the home of that "specially assigned person," and then got foreign visas and left Hong Kong. Those few people are the main targets of struggle. The meeting did not further discuss the analysis made by the CPC Work Committee. The conclusion was that it would be necessary to take up the matter with the British Government in an effort "to outlaw AHKASCPPM," and that it was also necessary to work on others so as to gradually weaken or even eliminate the organization, thereby eliminating the tool used by some forces in their effort to use Hong Kong as a base for subverting the Chinese Government. The meeting also listened to Li Hou's speech on the resumption of the activities of drafting the Basic Law. In view of Hong Kong's performance during the 4 June Incident, Li Hou suggested that clauses on deterring subversive activities and imposing marshal law in time of emergency should be added to the draft Basic Law. As no participant expressed any disagreement, the suggestion was also passed. After the meeting the Foreign Ministry and the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY took up the matter of outlawing AHKASCPPM with the British Foreign Ministry and the British Hong Kong government, respectively. We also carried out supporting media actions in Hong Kong. The British Government rejected China's demand on the ground that AHKASCPPM was registered in Hong Kong and was not in violation of the law of Hong Kong. In addition we also persuaded some leftist and centrist organizations which had joined AHKASCPPM to leave AHKASCPPM. Some centrist organizations left AHKASCPPM for their own reasons. But all this only "weakened" AHKASCPPM slightly. On 21 July RENMIN RIBAO published an article by Ai Zhong, entitled "No Attempts to Disrupt the One Country, Two Systems' Arrangement Is Allowed." We had had no prior knowledge about it, and felt surprised. After some inquiry we learned that the article had been drafted by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. Hong Kong society reacted strongly to the article. I felt that the article were flawed in two aspects. First, it revealed the internal analysis that a small number of people were attempting to turn Hong Kong into an open or semiopen anti-Communist base, and the language of the article would lead people to think that all those people in Hong Kong who had participated in the activities supporting the student's patriotic movement were trying to turn Hong Kong into an anti-Communist base, thereby striking at a very large number of people and creating many enemies. The article not only failed to square with the facts but was also very unwise in a tactical sense. Second, it almost openly named the names of Martin Lee and Szeto Wah. I felt that the article constituted openly treating those two persons as "enemies," and that nevertheless the article would not only fail to isolate those two persons but also increase their name recognition in the political arena and their political capital. On the other hand the article would create a situation where there would be no way of making contact with those two persons in the future and where work could not be carried out. We had already known the stands of those two persons. In dealing with them who would be our adversaries in future political struggles, we should conduct both struggle and cooperation. After the 4 June Incident they misread the situation in China and adopted a radical strategy. Now struggle with them was the dominant aspect of the matter. But openly naming names in this way now would in fact leave no room and was thus a radical move which was unwise in a tactical sense. I thought that it was necessary first of all to clarify the first issue and to make explanation to Hong Kong society so as to moderate the strong reactions against the RENMIN RIBAO article, through making a distinction between the majority and a small minority and making clear that the "anti-Communist base" had nothing to do with the majority. I immediately arranged for others to write an article expounding this view in a focused manner. After it was written I sent it to Beijing, hoping that it would be published in RENMIN RIBAO. However, later Li Hou told us that approval was only given to publishing it in the magazine LIAOWANG. Surely the basic stand of this article was in support of that RENMIN RIBAO article and therefore its impact was not large. After the 4 June Incident I made direct and indirect contact with Szeto Wah and Martin Lee privately. The purpose then was to preserve some room for restoring cooperation in the future. But Beijing did not know the activity. They would not have given approval, but would probably have tried to stop the activity; and if they would not criticize the activity immediately, they would probably have kept "a record" afterward. The policy and strategy of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese Government of trying to get AHKASCPPM "outlawed" and "eliminated" were wrong and would not work. This wrong strategy not only will not work before 1997 but is also very unlikely to work after 1997. If they at that time adopt tough "outlawing" measures, not only will the Communist Party of China and the Chinese Government continue to pay a political price, but the government of the special administrative region will also be put in a very difficult position, resulting in damages to Hong Kong people's confidence in the government of the special administrative region. The wise approach would be to show "tolerance," trying to win over the majority and gradually changing their attitude toward China. With the continuous reform and opening up on the mainland itself and with the increasing closeness in the relations between Hong Kong and the hinterland as 1997 is drawing near, it is entirely possible that such a policy and strategy will work. I participated in the formulating of the erroneous policy and strategy and approved of the policy and strategy; therefore I was responsible in this respect.

On Two Occasions David Wilson Took the Initiative in Inviting Me To Have "Afternoon Tea" at the Governor's Residence. After the 4 June Incident China's relations with the entire Western world deteriorated, and the relations between China and Britain also deteriorated. Clashes between China and Britain occurred continually, and the relations between China and Britain ebbed, thereby ending the short period of cooperation which had existed after the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Britain and the entire Western world together adopted a tough policy of imposing sanctions on China. Britain suspended diplomatic contact with China and also unilaterally suspended the meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. All negotiations between China and Britain on the question of Hong Kong came to an almost complete halt. The British Government adopted the strategy of supporting the patriotic mass movement in society. In this way it could not only make a good impression on people at large but also make China's image even worse and weaken people's confidence in China. On the other hand they also worried that the development of the patriotic mass movement would affect public safety in Hong Kong, resulting in a loss of control which could cause China to take up the matter with them and intervene. After the 4 June Incident their way of handling workers' strikes, shopkeepers' strikes, and students' strikes across the city contained contradictory elements but was wise. The British Hong Kong government took actions to facilitate people's patriotic activities, such as allowing the masses to hold rallies at the racecourse, an unprecedented move. On the other hand they also enhanced protection for the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and Chinese-owned institutions. At that time there were constant mass activities such as marches, petitioning, round-the-clock sit-ins, hunger strikes, and demonstrations in front of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY BUILDING. The walls opposite the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY were completely covered with posters and cartoons. There were many onlookers. The situation was tense. In addition to increasing police patrol, the British Hong Kong government also had several dozen additional police personnel posted at the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY all the time. We vacated the first floor of the building to give them a place to stay. They set up such things telephones and monitoring television devices, applying rather elaborate security measures. In the past, during the Kowloon riots, there had been attacks on China's institutions in Hong Kong. At that time the British Hong Kong government had not taken preventive measures beforehand. This time they took the initiative, and solicited advice from us beforehand. Only after securing our consent did they do those things as described. They treated Chinese-owned banks and newspapers and other institutions belonging to China in the same way. After the 4 June Incident the CPC Work Committee also made preparations for dealing with the most serious situation. We divided the CPC Work Committee's responsible persons into two groups. One group stayed at the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Building, ready to deal with any serious situation; the other group retreated to the Stanley guest-house, getting prepared to continue necessary activities in case the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY should be unable to make contact with the outside world. I decided to stay in the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY BUILDING, and Zheng Hua and Qiao Zongzhun went to Stanley. Before the 4 June Incident, once David Wilson, governor of Hong Kong, by his own initiative, invited me to have "afternoon tea" at the governor's residence. After the foreign affairs department secured approval from the Foreign Ministry, I went there. David Wilson asked me about my opinion of what had happened in Beijing. Could I tell him my personnel opinion? I used the diplomatic approach in a unique way: "Your Excellency, I have been instructed to inform you that the activities at Tiananmen in Beijing are an instance of turmoil." David Wilson expressed his understanding. When discussing local activities in Hong Kong society in support of the student movement in Beijing, David Wilson told me that according to the statistics of the police department of the British Hong Kong government, approximately 500,000 people participated in the 21 April march, which had been claimed to be a million-man march. They had devoted all their resources to making sure that no accidents would happen during the march. He also told me that they would do everything possible to safeguard the security of China's institutions in Hong Kong, and he expressed his appreciation of the cooperation given by the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in this regard. I also expressed my appreciation of the measures taken by the British Hong Kong government to safeguard the security of China's institutions in Hong Kong. After the formal talk with David Wilson, I chatted casually with him as he walked out of the front room to see me out. He said that it was very difficult to handle things under the current circumstances, thereby demonstrating that he felt that he was in a difficult position. I immediately said in a sympathetic manner: "I understand." He was moved by my words and said: "You assumed heavy responsibilities when being the leader of a big province. You are experienced and know what may happen under such circumstances." I replied in a sympathetic manner: "I understand your difficulties. We are similar to each other." David Wilson spoke standard putonghua. We talked to each other directly in putonghua. (Installment No.127) [9 Sep 93 p 2] [Text] One "Incident" After Another (Part Two of Four): The Issue of the Right of Abode in Britain Caused Disputes Between China and Britain; There Was a Strong Statement Accusing Britain of Violating the Joint Declaration My second meeting with David Wilson was similar to the first in that this time David Wilson again invited me to have "afternoon tea" by his own initiative. The relations between China and Britain was then already rather tense. At that time, in accordance with Beijing's instruction, the foreign affairs department of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY was negotiating with the political counsel of the Hong Kong government on the issue of outlawing AHKASCPPM. Our side demanded that the British Hong Kong government nullify the registration of AHKASCPPM. The British side said that the registration had been handled according to the law of Hong Kong. We then argued that according to the law of Hong Kong an organization would not be allowed to try to subvert the British sovereign, and that therefore the registration of AHKASCPPM should still be nullified. The British side retorted: that according to the law of Hong Kong AHKASCPPM should be allowed to exist and operate. Either side was willing to make concessions, resulting in a stalemate. However, when I met with David Wilson, neither of us touched upon this issue. What he was concerned with seemed to be the situation of the top leadership in Beijing. I could not satisfy his desire, and, like friends, we chatted for a while. I talked to David Wilson about the issue of "the right of abode in Britain" raised by some people in Hong Kong. This issue had first been raised by the manager of a conglomerate in Hong Kong in the name of an organization. The point of departure was that after the 4 June Incident too many of Hong Kong's elites had emigrated, thereby affecting the functioning of Hong Kong enterprises. This was true. As too large a portion of the managerial personnel of the business world had emigrated, those who had not emigrated were also unsettled, and were planning to emigrate, resulting in a serious brain drain. In Hong Kong society there was a widespread feeling of a lack of enterprise management personnel. High salaries were used to retain the management personnel planning to emigrate. There were two salary increases in one year, or even three increases in some cases. Under such circumstances some people put forward the idea of "the right of abode in Britain," the idea that the right of abode in Britain should be given now while those granted the right would not emigrate to Britain right away, that after 1997 they would not necessarily emigrate if China's policies should be enlightened and if Hong Kong should remain in the same condition as before, and that they would emigrate if they should consider the situation to be bad. People in Hong Kong said that under the current immigration procedures, there was a need to stay in an "immigration prison." That is, they could return to Hong Kong only after they had lived in the foreign country and had acquired residence status there. "The right of abode in Britain" could eliminate the need to stay in the "immigration prison." As a result there would be no adverse effects on their service at enterprises. They publicized this idea in newspapers, and carried out activities privately, applying pressure on the British Government and demanding that the British Government grant this right. It seemed that the British Government had adopted this idea and was using it for resolving the issue of civil servants in the British Hong Kong government, in an effort to change their mood characterized by a lack of confidence and a desire to emigrate. I told David Wilson my personal opinion as Beijing had not yet given any instructions on this issue. With regard to the issue of "the right of abode in Britain," I said to David Wilson, my personal opinion is that the putting forward of this idea is understandable, but that some problems will be difficult to resolve, and may lead to serious consequences. If "the right of abode in Britain" is applied to civil servants, then there will be great difficulties in the continued functioning of the government of the special administrative region after 1997. For with the departure of a large part of those civil servants granted "the right of abode in Britain" who have no confidence in the future special administrative region, there will be a lack of knowledgeable people in the government of the special administrative region. If the situation in Hong Kong is good at that time and if most of the civil servants have confidence, decide not to emigrate while still having the right of abode in Britain, and stay here to serve the government of the special administrative region, then will they be loyal to the British sovereign or to the government of the special administrative region? They will experience such conflicts both psychologically and in real life. I hope you will consider the issue carefully. In this way, I in fact described in advance the position which China would find it difficult to accept, despite the fact that at that time I did not know Beijing's attitude. Because I spoke in a discussion tone, David Wilson just nodded and did not indicate his attitude after listening to me. Shortly afterward, at the Hong Kong and Macao work conference gathered by Ji Pengfei, Zhou Nan [0719 0589] presented the written protest concerning "the right of abode in Britain" that the Foreign Ministry intended to deliver to the British Foreign Ministry, and asked the participants to discuss it. The draft raised the importance of the issue to the level of violating and damaging the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and stated that the British Government would be held responsible. I suggested that such wording might be too strong. According to my information, I argued, the issue was not raised by Britain but has been "taken up" by Britain which has then expanded the issue to encompass the civil servants; at least such has been the case on the surface. Many upper- and middle-strata people in Hong Kong are in favor of Britain's adopting this policy and hope that Britain will adopt this policy. It is necessary to reconsider whether to raise the importance of the issue to the level of violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration. If we are being too harsh, those people's mood will be affected; as a result the work of winning those people over will be adversely affected. If there is to be a written public protest, might it not be advisable to make the wording milder and not to raise the importance of the issue to such a level? Ji Pengfei approved of my view, and immediately asked Zhou Nan to make some changes. Nevertheless the protest which was made public later still exhibited a harsh attitude, effectively accusing the other side of violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration. (Installment No. 128)
