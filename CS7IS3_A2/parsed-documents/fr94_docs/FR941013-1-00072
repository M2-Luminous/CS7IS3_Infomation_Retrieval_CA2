FR941013-1-00072 FR941013-1-00010 The data available to the EPA at this time for the off-site waste and recovery operations source category are insufficient to perform a rigorous statistical analysis for the purpose of establishing the minimum VOHAP concentration value for the wastes or recoverable materials managed in each of the tanks listed in the data base and reported to use air emission controls. From a qualitative perspective, application of tank air emission controls is not needed when the material in the tank has little or no potential for organic HAP emissions. In general, these wastes or recoverable materials can be characterized as materials having low VOHAP concentrations. The EPA considered a range of possible values to establish the VOHAP concentration limit. Based on consideration of available information regarding the potential for organic HAP emissions from off-site waste and recovery operations, the EPA concluded that a VOHAP concentration value of 100 ppmw would best represent the MACT floor for existing tanks required to use air emission controls. Using a VOHAP concentration value of 100 ppmw also allows owners and operators to use several different methods for determining the VOHAP concentration of a waste or recoverable material. This is an important factor considering the diversity of wastes and recoverable materials potentially subject to the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP and the potential interferences of the quantitation limits of certain analytical methods by non-HAP organic chemicals in the material. Additionally, selection of 100 ppmw would require most existing tanks managing wastes or recoverable materials having organic HAP emissions to use air emission controls consistent with other EPA regulatory actions related to off-site waste and recovery operations. Many waste and recovery operations facilities subject to this regulation will also be subject to other air emission standards. The EPA is aware that being subject to several standards with differing action levels may create confusion in the regulated community. To the extent possible within the requirements of the Clean Air Act, the EPA wishes to minimize discrepancies between the action level in the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP and other emission standards affecting waste and recovery operations. The EPA therefore requests comment on the 100 ppmw VOHAP concentration action level, as well as information that can be used to support alternative action levels, such as 500 ppmw. Specifically, the EPA requests information on action levels for surface impoundments and other land disposal units. b. Existing Containers. The MACT floor for existing containers at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities is determined to be the use of covers on containers managing wastes or recoverable materials with a VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw. The number and type of containers used to manage organic HAP containing wastes or recoverable materials at off-site waste and recovery operations vary from site-to-site. Furthermore, at any off-site waste and recovery operations facility, the number of drums, roll-off boxes, or other containers at the site can often fluctuate on a weekly or monthly basis depending on the number and origin of new material shipments received at the facility during a particular week or month. Thus, no data are available to the EPA which allow a statistical determination of the type of air emission controls used on the average of the top 12 percent of containers located at off-site waste and recovery operations facilities or the VOHAP concentration of wastes or recoverable materials handled in containers. Based on existing RCRA rules for containers handling hazardous waste and observations by EPA representatives during site visits to facilities that manage wastes in containers, the EPA concluded that the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of containers used to handle wastes and recoverable materials containing organic HAP is the level of control achieved by the use of covers. Thus, the EPA determined that the air emission control technology for existing container MACT floor is the use of a cover. The EPA selected a VOHAP concentration value of 100 ppmw to be the action level for the MACT floor for existing containers consistent with the level selected for existing tanks. Containers such as drums, tank trucks, roll-off boxes, and tank rail cars are a primary means used to ship materials to off-site waste and recovery operations facilities. In many cases, these materials are temporarily stored at the off-site waste and recovery operations facility directly in the shipping containers or are transferred to tanks or other management units prior to treatment and disposal, in the case of wastes, or prior to reprocessing and shipment, in the case of recoverable materials. The most volatile of the organic HAP in a waste or recoverable material will be emitted soon after being exposed to the atmosphere. If containers at the off-site waste and recovery operations facility are not controlled to the same level required of tanks, a significant portion of the organic HAP in the waste or recoverable material will be emitted before the material is transferred to the controlled tanks or other controlled management units. Consequently, the organic HAP emission reduction effectiveness of applying air emission controls on downstream tanks and other management units would be significantly diminished since a significant portion of the organic HAP in the waste or recoverable material had already escaped to the atmosphere from open containers.
