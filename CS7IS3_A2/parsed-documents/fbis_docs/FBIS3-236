The region has been the scene of clashes, of troop movements, and flight of populations of Nigerian nationals. Now, President Eyadema of Togo has turned up in Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, setting speculative tongues wagging. On the line to Yaounde, Ajoa Yeboah-Afari asked our reporter, William Moles, if it was known what President Eyadema was doing there: [Begin recording] [Moles] Well, nothing has been said, especially, yet. In fact, the government has been tight-lipped over all the negotiations that have been going on in the last few weeks. But I do know that President Eyadema met with President Paul Biya this morning for half an hour, but I have just missed them at the Hilton at lunch time. I just heard from sources at state television that he is now on his way to Abuja. They also said that he had sent his foreign minister to Abuja on Monday [28 February]. So, I don't think there is much doubt that he is here in some kind of negotiating role between Nigeria and Cameroon. Also, sources at the Foreign Ministry here told me that President Omar Bongo from Gabon will also be arriving in Yaounde shortly. State radio reported earlier on this week that he wanted to use his experience to negotiate between Nigeria and Cameroon over the Bakassi dispute. [Yeboah-Afari] We understand that there is also a French naval vessel nearby. Can you confirm this? [Moles] Yes, I can confirm this. I have had confirmation of this from the French Embassy here. At the Nigerian Embassy, they are rather alarmed by the arrival of this French frigate they call the (Vondemiere). It came to the port in Douala last night with a crew of about 90 sailors. At the French Embassy they say that it is just here for a routine surveillance trip and that they were also here last September. But obviously, the Nigerians here are naturally a bit skeptical about that. [Yeboah-Afari] Well, we understand that the French Embassy are saying that the current round of negotiations are going on quite smoothly. What would you say to this? [Moles] Well, they haven't actually revealed a great deal about negotiations. All they did say to me was that there has been some progress in the negotiations after their meetings in Abuja on Tuesday [1 March], and they also said that the fierce pronouncements of Baba Kingibe, Nigeria's foreign minister, in a press conference yesterday, were rhetorical and they didn't really say the atmosphere in which they talks were conducted. They really have not said much more than that. [end recording]
