The Presidential Guard cannot be singled out. I have the impression that the Presidential Guard has been considered to be different from the rest of the Army. What I can say is that, all in all, our soldiers remained quite calm and behaved well. Here and there -- among the soldiers of the Presidential Guard and others -- there have been some undisciplined troops. Because of some undisciplined troops, we cannot say that the Rwandan Army took an active part in the massacres. [end recording]
