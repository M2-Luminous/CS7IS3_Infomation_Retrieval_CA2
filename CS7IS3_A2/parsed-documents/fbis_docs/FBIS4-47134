Developing and prospering parallel to the deep crisis of material production is a vast unregistered service sector. According to a widespread view, the slowing of the inflation rate in recent months is caused by the more frequent nonpayment of wages and salaries at enterprises and organizations. This is confirmed by bank statistics which show that cash money circulation is falling in Russia. According to official data, real wages and real minimum pensions are decreasing, which, it is generally believed, account for 85-90% of the monetary income of the population. But according to the same data, real cash incomes of the population... grow (by 12% in four months of this year). Bank statistics register the growth of physical persons' deposits. The personnel at currency exchange offices in Moscow testify that each day a great number of their clients convert rubles into dollars; the sums exchanges are frequently within the limits of average monthly earnings. Finally, the data from the State Committee of Statistics of Russia on the volume of the sale of foodstuffs indicate the growth of the population's solvent demand.

They show the volume of sales in foodstuffs in an artificially limited number of stores and markets in only 132 Russian towns which the Statistics Committee has observed for a number of years. But this data is comparable since the situation has been studied on a regular basis. Judging by this data, demand does not switch from more expensive foodstuffs to cheaper ones, for instance, from sausage and pastry to macaroni and bread. Contrary to the generally accepted view, the cost of foodstuffs relative to the real wages of the population (minus taxes and with a correction for the inflation index) has decreased by 13-15% on average. Contrary to the same view, the growth of the sales of macaroni and bread does not exceed the growth of the sales of cheese, sausage, butter and meat. There was not even a complete switch to potatoes from private kitchen-gardens, and more potatoes were bought in the trading network than a year ago. As for the decrease of the sale of vodka, this evidently testifies to the growth of sale outside stores. Where do people get money? What do workers live on whose enterprises have not paid their wages for 3-6 months? And, incidentally, whence such a growth of foodstuffs when the output of the food industry is officially stated as decreasing and the import is falling? A considerable number of Russia's citizens have found alternative sources of subsistence which are not registered officially. Yuri Yurkov, Chairman of Russia's State Committee of Statistics, with whom we discussed this problem described these sources as "handicrafts" in the sense that they belong in the sphere of services: various kinds of repairs and construction, consultations, lectures and similar activities. Yurkov also expressed his doubt that the rate in the reduction of the index of the gross domestic product calculated by his committee on the basis of official data is close to reality. This is a truly historic statement, since it is the first time that the economist in charge of statistic agencies admits that his own conviction differs from official material which he himself publishes. The structure of the gross domestic product shows a sharp reduction of industrial output and an equally sharp increase of the share of retail turnover and paid services. The chairman of the State Committee of Statistics of the Russian Federation said that he feels that the share of paid services grows much faster than we record it. The cash turnover in the taxless sector of the economy is evidently not big enough so far that it can affect the inflation index in the country. Besides that, as Yurkov justly said, the money paid in this sector is really and truly earned. Here no products are produced which cannot be sold immediately and no services are offered which do not have a constantly enhanced demand. The chairman of Russia's Statistics Committee believes that the original financial source in the taxless sector of the economy are the incomes of participants in foreign-economic activity. The effectiveness of export operations compared to the extreme inefficiency of domestic production is accompanied, first, by the release of a considerable share of resources which were formerly processed in Russia and, second, by the transfer to foreign-economic activity of a considerable number of initiative and highly professional workers. Besides that the import of cheap food into Russia from and through "near abroad" countries which is not registered by official statistics has evidently proved profitable. That is why stores have foodstuffs to offer despite the fact that officially registered imports and their domestic production are decreasing. The hearings on this subject conducted by the State Duma at the end of April showed that, following the introduction of new import tariffs, the state has been practically deprived of income from imports which have become illegal and are mainly effected through the transparent borders of the "near abroad states." The growing incomes of the participants in foreign-economic activity stimulate the domestic demand for high-quality and costly services in various sectors. The illegal character of profit is evidently one of the causes of the deep-going stratification of Russian society. To people who cannot declare the source of their incomes the speed of the use of money is probably a more important factor than effectiveness. They are threatened simultaneously by law-enforcement agencies and the criminal world, and that is evidently why consumption receives more than is required by rationalism and simply the norms of behavior in society. Persons servicing the thin layer of super-rich "new Russians" form the present "middle class" (middle in the level of incomes) whose requirements are more modest but whose number is greater. Their requirements are, in turn, satisfied by less well-off categories of the population. The involvement in this chain allows a considerable number of our citizens to exist tolerably well and sometimes quite comfortably. Russia in fact continues to live on oil dollars, the only thing that has changed being the system of the distribution of incomes. A considerable number of people, continuing to be on the staff of enterprises which are "latent bankrupts," have taxless sources of income which sometimes exceed the official, taxed earnings. A part of these incomes is converted into U.S. dollars, especially at the initial stage of redistribution, which are turned into rubles when required. The "junior serving personnel" of this sector, more inclined to keep their savings "in the sock," on the contrary convert the surplus of earned rubles into dollars. The vast cash dollar turnover of the economy (it is assessed at about six billion dollars in Moscow) has allowed so far to support the appearance of relative financial stabilization in the ruble space. It is interesting to note from the psychological point of view that although the Russians treat US dollars as a means of payment, even preferable to rubles, they often do not regard them as money. Dollars are spent easier than rubles, as if they are not earned but fall from the sky, as bonuses did under Soviet power in addition to the main earnings. This ease of spending is probably one of the reasons for the incredibly high dollar prices of consumer goods in the Russian Federation. If this concept is correct, the overbalance of the "handicraft" sector, which was absolutely untypical for former Russia, probably threatens us with much faster, sharper and irreversible changes than those with which we are ready to reconcile ourselves. Nor are any prospects visible in the event of the fall in demand for our resources on world markets or the exhaustion of these resources.
