[Koichi Amemiya, president of U.S. Honda] Actually, we didn't want to raise our prices at all this fall. The minor increases that were announced in February and April were meant to dramatize an "Accord price freeze" for the new car year. But the yen rate suddenly shot up when we were at the final stage of setting prices. Because some of our cars are imported from Japan, we couldn't absorb the higher rate otherwise. [Kobayashi] Why wasn't everything produced in the United States? [Amemiya] We were ready to, for our part. But the problem was over on the Japan side. Personnel adjustments on their side haven't kept up with the speed that localization is taking place here in the United States. [Kobayashi] I imagine you'll have to be concerned about the U.S. automobile industry accusing you of dumping if there are only minor price adjustments despite the higher yen. [Amemiya] We locally sourced 82 percent of the parts for the Accord. And local production accounts for 80 percent. So there's no need for price increases to reflect the higher yen in its entirety. I can say with confidence that our prices are the result of our efforts to rationalize our operations. [Kobayashi] Then, in terms of prices, will you be able to compete with U.S. cars? [Amemiya] GM's fall increase was on a par with the Accord's, a 1.8 percent increase, but GM didn't raise its prices in the spring. So, all together, our increase is on or around the 4 percent level. U.S. car makers also give a bigger mark down to their dealers. On the other hand, until now, people have been saying that with the same accessories, Japanese cars are $2,000 higher than U.S. cars. With this new Accord, however, I think we've cut that difference down to $500. That's sufficient to make the Accord competitive. [Kobayashi] Does it look as though you'll be able to regain your position in 1994 as having U.S. best-selling car? [Amemiya] When we lost our top seating in 1992, there were people in Japan saying, "Given the trade friction between our two countries, that might have been for the best." But in the United States, winning is what counts. When we export the Accord to Asia, there, too, we're asked, "When is the Accord going to recapture first place?" Placing first in the United States is very important. [Kobayashi] How about the business end...? [Amemiya] What with a combined sales slump and start-up costs, 1993 was a very tough year for us. But the Accord should be contributing fully next year. We'll also be adding our own version of the Rodeo (recreational vehicle) to our battle lines. Higher priced imports like the Acura are having a tough time because of the stronger yen, but profit-wise, by the end of this term, we should be seeing the end to our present slump.
