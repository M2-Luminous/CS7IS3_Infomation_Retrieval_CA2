"The Crimea duplicates the situation that has been characteristic of Ukraine for several years. The Ukrainian leadership fears unpopular reforms," Crimean Vice-Premier Yevgeniy Saburov told a news conference here today. "The Crimean Supreme Soviet had kept the bread prices low for a long time on political reasons. The prices are no longer real, and their support has been stopped. Thus, prices went up on April 1," he said. In the opinion of Saburov, food prices should not be curbed down but they should not jump either. The bread price increase may influence the results of the second round of parliamentary elections, and the government hopes to ease the situation with reduced taxes on enterprises and business structures and improved banking activities and currency regulation. These measures have been coordinated with the Ukrainian president and do not run counter to the legislation, said the vice-premier. Decrees to the effect have been prepared to be signed by President Yuriy Meshkov upon his return from Cyprus, where he left today. Bearing in mind Saburov's statements, Chairman of the Crimean Union of Businessmen Aleksandr Dudko told the news conference the union will suspend the lock-put for two-weeks in order to enable the government to settle the taxation issue.
