FBIS4-43594 "drweu118_o_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-118 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 CYPRUS Government Releases Proposals Submitted to UN Government Releases Proposals Submitted to UN NC1706185594 Nicosia CyBC Television Network in Greek 1730 GMT 17 Jun 94 NC1706185594 Nicosia CyBC Television Network Greek BFN [Text] The Cyprus Government has called on the permanent members of the UN Security Council to cooperate with the UN secretary general's special representative in Cyprus to start deliberations with the two sides for a new beginning with the addition of new options. The Cyprus Government's call is included in a series of points submitted by Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis to the UN secretary general and the UN Security Council members. Those points were made public just a short while ago. The following are noted as new options: Disarmament; the guarantee of a future solution; and reassurance that the Security Council can never accept negotiations for a solution unless they are based on only one sovereignty, nationality, and international identity. Other options noted include demographic changes and a population census, the issue of Turkish troops in Cyprus, and the call for Turkey to conform with Security Council Resolution 550 and hand over the fenced area of Famagusta to the United Nations. In the points submitted, Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis also notes that if the Security Council avoids proceeding in a decisive manner to achieve a new beginning, then the message to the Greek Cypriot side would be that it is avoiding putting the blame where it should, failing to assume alternative measures, not showing determination, and refraining from blaming Turkey. The message to [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas is that it is not necessary to abandon his usual tactics and lack of political will, since in the end they will save him and his unacceptable stance will be tolerated. In the points that Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis submitted, he repeats that the Cyprus Government still accepts the 21 March document and stresses that it has no objections to any efforts by anyone to convince the Turkish side to accept the confidence-building measures and ways to implement them. Finally, the foreign minister notes that the Greek Cypriot side believes that if the UN secretary general should give any additional information to the Security Council, it should be done in a verbal briefing and not in a supplementary report. Furthermore, the foreign minister notes that if someone believes that the confidence-building measures have a future, he should pressure the Turkish side to accept them, and there should be no effort to hold further talks on them.
