The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God alone hopes to elect 12 deputies. With about 25 million followers, according to evaluations by their congressional bloc, the Protestant Church has the potential to elect an even greater number of deputies and senators than that. Not all of the Protestant Church sectors have, however, a centralized hierarchy like the Universal Church. This religious group, headed by Bishop Edir Macedo, chooses its candidates through a system resembling the "democratic centralism" employed by orthodox leftist organizations. The Bishops Council, which is comprised of eight to 10 bishops, holds a national meeting and chooses the candidates for each state. Their faithful (nearly 1 million) are instructed to vote only for those candidates. This centralizing system is also partially adopted by the other Pentecostal churches, such as the Assembly of God, the Church of God, and the House of Blessings. The difference is that in these religious groups decisions are made in each state or city. The historical divisions of the Protestant Church, such as Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Lutheran, do not indicate any preferred candidates. Clergymen who choose to follow a political career, however, end up being supported by the faithful. Both the historical and the Pentecostal Protestants reject political parties. They share, however, an interest in topics linked to the family, such as abortion, divorce, homosexuality, and prostitution. The evangelical Christians follow the principle that "Christians vote for Christians," independently of any party to which the member of the Protestant faith is linked. Of the current group of 21 Protestant deputies, 15 have already changed parties after having being elected. In the Senate, the bloc has four members. The structure of the churches can be used to help elect Protestant candidates. The Universal Church has a television network (Record) and radio stations in several states. During the electoral campaign, the clergymen of several of these groups become voluntary campaign workers. The newspapers that circulate among the faithful are also used to disseminate news about the candidates. Deputy Luiz Moreira (PFL-BA) [Liberal Front Party-Bahia State], of the Universal Church, says that all the clergymen of their 160 churches in Bahia State will be his voluntary campaign workers. "We will still have the support of these churches' workers," he said. Moreira asserts that the clergymen comply strictly with the instructions of the Bishops Council. "Our hierarchy is centralized," he explained. Aware of the votes available in Bahia State, the Universal Church has proposed a candidate for federal deputy and two for state deputies. The other religious groups are not as well organized. PFL Deputy Arolde de Oliveira (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro] asserts that the 2 million Protestant faithful of Rio de Janeiro could have elected up to 20 deputies in 1990. The excessive number of candidates from these churches, however, allowed only seven of them to be elected. "The votes of the Protestant faithful increased the support for the other party candidates, and ended up getting non-Protestant people elected," the deputy analyzed. One of the things Protestant congressmen have in common is their support of the government. Arolde de Oliveira explains: "We want the freedom to disseminate our ideas, to address the people in public squares, to have radio and television stations." The Protestant congressmen's support of then President Jose Sarney ensured them radio and television stations. These congressmen also defended a five-year presidential mandate for President Sarney at the 1988 Constitutional Assembly.
