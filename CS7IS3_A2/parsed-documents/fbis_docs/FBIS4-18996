He also told the committee that Foreign Minister Willy Claes will meet with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali within 48 hours in Geneva to discuss the matter. Addressing the committee, Jean-Luc Dehaene questioned the future of the Belgian presence in Rwanda: "Everything depends on what comes of the Arusha agreement." He continued: "If the Arusha agreement is abandoned, the problem will have to be settled by the United Nations itself, since the UN forces were sent to Rwanda on the basis of this agreement being implemented. While we would still like to see this agreement implemented, we have to examine the problem of the UN troop mandate in general, and ask questions about our own participation in the mission." For Jean-Luc Dehaene, in the current circumstances, the conditions for the continued participation of Belgium in the UNAMIR have not been met. The anti- Belgian feeling that has been developing for some time and which has accelerated in recent days has made the presence of Belgian UN troops particularly difficult. On this subject, Willy Claes declared that he could not see why "we should continue to expose our troops to additional dangers." The government has, moreover, authorized Foreign Minister Willy Claes to broach the issue in clear terms in a meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. The prime minister also stressed that the government's "absolute priority" now was the success of the evacuation operation. As for the future of Belgian cooperation in development, he asked that there be no hasty decision "driven by emotion." Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes told the committee that he had taken a number of steps to officially make it public in Rwanda that Belgium denies the report which accused it of being responsible for the deaths of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents. This "totally false" report has further strengthened the anti-Belgian feelings of a minority of Rwandan extremists, the minister said. Mr. Claes summoned the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels to demand that sanctions be taken against RTLM (Free Radio and Television of the Thousand Hills) which broadcasts anti-Belgian news. He has also asked official Rwandan radio to broadcast the Belgian denial, "but I note that that has not been done." The minister again stated that he had also broadcast this message on the BBC World Service and BRTN [Dutch-language Belgian Radio and Television] which are listened to in Rwanda. He will also try through official Burundian radio.
