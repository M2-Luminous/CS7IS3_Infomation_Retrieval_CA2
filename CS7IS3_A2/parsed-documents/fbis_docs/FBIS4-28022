Colonel Johny Lumintang, military commandant overseeing security in East Timor, told journalists that the rebels attacked citizens' houses and "ambushed people in the streets". He put the number of those involved at "no less than 300" but declined to explain how the troops had dealt with them. He said the separatists meant to use the planned Manila seminar on East Timor to make the world aware of their existence. "The clandestine movement's activities are confined to distributing anti-government and pro-Fretilin [Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor] (secession movement) brochures," Lumintang said. Recently, a number of separatists held an anti-integration demonstration at Hotel Mahkota in Dili where a group of visiting foreign journalists stayed, he said. He said some of the demonstrators were arrested.
