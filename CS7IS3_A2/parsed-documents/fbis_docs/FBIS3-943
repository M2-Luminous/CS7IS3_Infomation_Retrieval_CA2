An Anglo-American spokesman said the sources were used to measure the density of mud and had no commercial value whatsoever. Two of the sources are gray in color and one is bright yellow. All are about the size and shape of a large coffee tin, and bear a radiation warning symbol. Mine management has emphasized the sources are highly dangerous and should not be approached or handled.
