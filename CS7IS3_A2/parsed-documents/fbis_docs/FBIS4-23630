A small number of armed policemen were posted at the entrance to Eleke Crescent after police offered a reward for the arrest of Abiola, who fled house arrest Saturday. The Moslem millionaire, the presumed winner of annulled presidential elections last June, has declared a rival government of national unity and proclaimed himself president. The road on which police were posted leads to the diplomatic missions of the United States, Britain, Italy, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Russia, India, Bulgaria and Finland, as well as their associated residences. Passengers and drivers were questioned about the missions to which they were heading. Earlier a police statement reported on radio said that "it has been established that the activities have enjoyed the tacit support and linkages to a certain foreign mission in Lagos." Officials have offered a 60,000 naira (2,700 dollar) reward for information leading to Abiola's arrest, national television earlier reported. In a nationwide broadcast Sunday, military leader General Sani Abacha expressed hope that the international community "will do nothing to encourage the idle dream of some self-seeking individuals or the parochial interest of a small opportunistic group within our society who are bent on acts of destabilisation under various covers."
