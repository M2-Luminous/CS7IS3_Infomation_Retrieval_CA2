Attention to America still is stronger than attention to Turkey's real interests with Iraq. Although everyone in Turkey now agrees on the need to lift the blockade on Iraq, and Turkey's prime minister herself has spoken more than once on the subject, particularly during her recent visit to the United States, the Ankara government has given no open sign of taking the initiative in this direction, although Turkey is one of the countries most harmed by the blockade imposed on Iraq. Official Turkish pronouncements sometimes can be interpreted (this is my personal opinion) as a kind of inducement to the United States and other Western countries to give Turkey financial and economic aid. American President Clinton's vacillating statements on aid to Turkey perhaps give something of an impression about the truth of what I have indicated. It should be said here that the continued foreign military presence on Turkish soil to confront Iraq means that Turkey's movement with regard to lifting the blockade on the Iraqi people is restricted. This is because any official Turkish move to this effect will be met by an unannounced reaction by the coalition forces to impede the Turkish move in this direction. The Kurdish card will be one of the most powerful cards used to pressure the Turkish government and prevent it from resuming full relations with Iraq. Other cards that can be used against the Turks include Cyprus, relations with Greece, relations with the former Soviet republics in Asia, and relations with Iran that can ebb and flow for many reasons and motives. Ending the foreign presence in Turkey will free Turkish will and Turkish official and popular decisionmaking from heavy shackles. This, however, does not mean that turning the words of Turkish officials about lifting the blockade on Iraq into deeds is a matter difficult to achieve before achieving the withdrawal of the coalition forces from Turkey. Every day that passes with Iraq under blockade increases Turkey's economic and security problems, as Turkish officials themselves acknowledge. Though this acknowledgment is sincere, it has not yielded the desired results. At best, it has seemed to be a campaign to elicit the sympathy of others to aid Turkey, or it may be an expedient for domestic consumption, to rally public opinion that will accept nothing but the historic good relations with Iraq and lifting the blockade from the Iraqi people. A well-known political principle is that the advent of a new president and a government from another party means that one need not retain the old policy of the previous president and government when that policy is unacceptable to the people as being at odds with their interests and those of the country. However, the current administration and government in Turkey have in no way acted on this principle, despite comments about the harm that Turkey's previous president caused to Turkey by facilitating military aggression against Iraq, approving the concentration of coalition forces in Turkey, and participating in imposing a blockade on Iraq. Add to this the fact that continued penetration by the Turkish army and air force into Iraqi territory on the pretext of pursuing elements of the Turkish Kurdistan Labor Party and continued cooperation with renegades subservient to Iraq's Kurds is against the official policy of the new president and government in Turkey. This is something that conflicts with the agreements on borders and relations between Baghdad and Ankara. It conflicts with international laws and practices, and it also conflicts with the conviction of Turkish officials and political figures that the border with Iraq cannot be brought under control if the Iraqi state is absent from the area of self-rule. Desire and embarrassment (desire to resume relations with Iraq, embarrassment at behaving rationally, not to say fear of America) is not a fruitful policy. I have great hope that Turkish officials will realize that foreign financial aid, however great, comes with heavy conditions. Whatever this aid may be, it can never compensate Turkey for its continued losses because of the blockade of Iraq. Turkish security will be realized outside of bribes paid from the Turkish treasury to renegades who have no future.
