What was the outcome of these visits? How do you evaluate them? [Chea Sim] First of all, let me express my most sincere thanks to you, the AKP special correspondent, for giving me a chance to inform the people of the outcome of this trip. It can be summed up in these words: Our delegation's visit to these three friendly countries was certainly very fruitful. Although it was the first of its kind, this trip made major and important contributions. First, it strengthened and expanded the bonds of friendship and mutual cooperation between our state and people and the states and peoples of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand who share our common borders. Second, it opened a bridge of excellent cooperation between our legislative organ and those of the three neighboring countries. Third, it elevated our national prestige in the region and on the international stage. As the messenger of the Cambodian people and a contributor to the defense and advancement of our nation's superior interests, our delegation did its best to accomplish everything with a high sense of responsibility in order to promote and encourage new developments in Cambodia's relationship with its neighbors in a new form and in line with the new regional and international trends. In this context, the talks and negotiations we conducted with the top leaders of the three countries enabled our delegation to hold consultations and exchange views in greater depth concerning all aspects of our bilateral relations, both present and future, which must proceed in a new and progressive form. Our delegation sought to acquire a firm foundation capable of guaranteeing the durable interests of our country. All of these top leaders unanimously agreed that the existing traditional relations of friendship and mutual cooperation between our states and peoples must be further strengthened and expanded; good neighborliness is an important factor in the development of each country; mutual understanding, respect, and trust and a sense of solidarity must be based on respect for each nation's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and right to self-determination; and bilateral cooperation must be implemented on the basis of the principles of equality and reciprocal benefit. As for problems that remain to be settled, we agreed that we will work jointly to solve them peacefully. This is the only good way to guarantee that the sense of good neighborliness will last. Because of their geographical proximity to Cambodia, the three countries expressed their wish to cooperate with and assist Cambodia in its national rehabilitation on the basis of the principle of mutual help. This is an excellent fundamental line that will guide our future relationships. At the same time, the top Vietnamese, Lao, and Thai leaders all affirmed their resolute support for peace and national reconciliation in Cambodia. They consider this to be not only an important factor for the stability and development of each country, but also a contribution to the strengthening of regional and international stability, friendship, and cooperation. These prominent dignitaries reemphasized their respective countries' resolute and unwavering support for the Royal Government of Cambodia -- headed by His Royal Highness Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh as first prime minister and Samdech Hun Sen as second prime minister -- both in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Cambodia and in the realization of Cambodia's national reconciliation. The Vietnamese, Lao, and Thai leaders expressed their distinguished respects for His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, our venerated monarch, and solemnly wished him a prompt recovery so that he could pursue his noble and historic royal crusade. It should be noted that during our visit to these three countries, our delegation was accorded the great honor of meeting with all the top leaders of each country. For instance, in the SRV our delegation met with His Excellency [H.E.] President Le Duc Anh; H.E. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet; H.E. National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh; and H.E. Do Muoi, secretary general of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee. In the LPDR we met with H.E. President Nouhak Phoumsavan, H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon, and H.E. National Assembly Chairman Saman Vignaket. In the Kingdom of Thailand, we met with H.E. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai; H.E. Dr. Marut Bunnak, chairman of the National Assembly; and H.E. Senate Chairman Michai Ruchuphan. Even better, our delegation was graciously accorded an audience with His Majesty King Phumiphon Adunyadet of the Kingdom of Thailand at the royal palace in Bangkok. Aside from discussing bilateral relations, our delegation learned about and exchanged experiences on parliamentary work and other issues of importance to our country's development, such as agriculture, irrigation, industry, electricity, education, financial systems, and the market economy. Our delegation also visited industrial estates, construction projects, bridges, and hydroelectric dams. It was an important opportunity for members of the delegation and of the nine National Assembly commissions to gain a better understanding and experience for future use in the service of the nation and people. Concerning the relationship between our National Assembly and the assemblies of the three friendly countries, we agreed to expand mutual contact through exchanges of delegations at the top level and at the level of committees, representatives, and house secretariats. We exchanged documents to help promote the spirit of friendship, mutual understanding, and cooperation between our states and peoples. Based on this visit, we can draw the conclusion that the foundation of our National Assembly-to-National Assembly relationships has already been established. It should be noted that the legislative organ of each host country accorded our delegation a great honor by arranging an excellent reception for us at a high protocol level. This clearly shows the common desire and wish for friendship and good neighborliness. Although the visit to each of these countries was brief, each had profound political significance and was replete with a great feeling of friendship and mutual regard.
