According to the official, experts have appraised various geological structures of 18 blocks in the northern Tarim basin and 19 geological formations which could be oil-bearing. He said that since the late 1960s, geologists have been wondering whether there are oil deposits in China's paleozoic marine strata. But this question has been resolved with discovery in the past nine years of 14 oil and natural gas fields in the Tarim basin. In the East China Sea, too, high-yield wells began to work, with a single well yielding a daily output of up to 650 cubic meters of crude oil and some 227,000 cubic meters of natural gas. Geologists found six promising geological formations during a geophysical investigation in the South China Sea. Well-drilling will start next year, according to the official. In Tibet's Yangbajain area abounding in geothermal water resources, China found its hottest well with a top temperature of 262.03 degrees centigrade at its deepest point. At present, the yangbajain geothermal power station provides Lhasa, capital of Tibet, with 40 percent of its electricity supply. For mineral prospecting, the official disclosed, 89 key mineral deposits have been discovered and some 20 minerals' reserves have proved much greater than expected, including manganese, copper, bauxite, gold and silver.
