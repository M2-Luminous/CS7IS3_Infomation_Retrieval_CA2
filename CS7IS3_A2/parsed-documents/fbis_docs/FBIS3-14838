Latvia was represented in this training by the Commander of the Latvian Defense Forces, Dainis Turlais. All three commanders from the Baltic states had a separate meeting with the chiefs of the Scandinavian Armed Forces. The most important was the meeting with the Danish high-level military persons, D. Turlais told DIENA. During the talks, a decision was made that Latvian officers would begin their training with Danish assistance as early as this month. A plan was worked out to prepare the Latvian officers for the joint Baltic peace battalion. The Scandinavian states have decided to create a council with the aim of coordinating military aid for the Baltic states. As DIENA was told by Turlais, this year the training had a special meaning -- how to create new relations between the northern states and the Baltic states in the framework of the Partnership for Peace program. The foreign minister of Norway made a forecast for the nearest future -- Sweden and Finland would join the EC and later would become members of NATO. Subsequently, this would show the Baltic states the way to integrate in the group of the Scandinavian states and next also in NATO. The mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak Spoke against this very sharply and categorically. He described such cooperation as a threat to Russia, which absolutely cannot be permitted.
