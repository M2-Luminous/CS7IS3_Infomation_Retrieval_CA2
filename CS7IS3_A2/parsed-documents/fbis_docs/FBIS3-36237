Russian Side Prefers To Forget About It"] [Text] The winding up of the 16th round of Russian-Estonian talks coincided with another anniversary of the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty. Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Vasiliy Svirin, who leads the Russian delegation to talks with Estonia, remarked that the sides completely forgot the date in the course of the tense two-week work: "As far as we are concerned, that treaty has died a natural death." The Russian diplomat advised that the work on 1 and 2 February centered on the four [as published] main problems of bilateral relations: the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Estonia, social protection for Russian military pensioners who live in the Baltic republic, and border and economic questions. The Russian side had planned to turn over to its Estonian counterparts a complete schedule for the withdrawal of troops until 31 August 1994, but seeing that the Estonians had completely blocked the question of military pensioners' rights, it did not find it possible to make such a step. Mr. Svirin confirmed the statement by Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin to the effect that Russia had never linked the problem of its troop withdrawal from Baltic territory with the position of the Russian-speaking civilian population. He remarked, however, that the problems of upholding the rights of servicemen and retired servicemen had always been regarded as part of the troop withdrawal questions. "The conduct of the Estonian Government may entail considerable repercussions because it actually deals with the deportation of military pensioners," he said. For example, leaders of this Baltic country demand that all military men retired after 20 August 1991 should leave the republic's territory before 31 August 1994. The remaining 9,000 pensioners (35,000 together with their families) are only granted the right to seek residence permits while the Estonian side advanced such humiliating, according to the Russian diplomat, requirements as nonparticipation in armed formations and not having been implicated in cooperation with foreign intelligence services. The package of border questions, Vasiliy Svirin declared, had been also blocked by the Estonian side. The Russian delegation once again underlined, during the latest round of talks, that Estonian claims to a number of rayons in Pskov Oblast were hopeless. Vasiliy Svirin remarked that Estonia is still refusing to demarcate the land borders: "Russia will probably have to do this unilaterally," he warned.
