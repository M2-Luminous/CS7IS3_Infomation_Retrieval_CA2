The plant, to be built on the site of a former petrolium industry equipment supplier, is expected to have a yearly production of 16,000 [metric] tons of packaging materials consisting mainly of aluminum, card and paper sheets. Russia's lack of packaging materials is considered one of the main reasons for the huge losses incurred by its agricultural sector, a situation only partially eased by the country's purchase in 1992-1993 of materials worth 190 million dollars.
