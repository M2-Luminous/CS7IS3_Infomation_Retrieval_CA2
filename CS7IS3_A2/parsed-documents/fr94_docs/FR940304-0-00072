FR940304-0-00072 FR940304-0-00019 Historically, Isodendrion pyrifolium was found at unspecified localities on Niihau, Molokai, and Lanai, as well as on Oahu in the central portion of the Waianae Mountains, on Maui in the northeastern to southwestern regions of the West Maui mountains, and on the island of Hawaii at the western base of Hualalai (HHP 1991n1 to 1991n5, Wagner et al. 1990). The species had not been collected since 1870 and was presumed extinct. However, in 1991, four plants were found on Hawaii at Kealakehe near Kona on State-owned land being developed for residential housing and a golf course (C. Corn, in litt. 1991; Francis Blanco, Hawaii Housing and Finance Development Corporation, and K. Nagata, pers. comms., 1992). In late 1992 and early 1993, 50 to 60 additional plants were found at this site (Evangeline Funk, Botanical Consultants, pers. comm., 1993). This species typically grows on dry sites in Lowland Dry to Mesic Forests at low elevations (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, Wagner et al. 1990). Associated species include 'iliahi, mamane, and Waltheria indica ('uhaloa) (Paul Weissich, Weissich and Associates, pers. comm., 1992). The major threats to Isodendrion pyrifolium are habitat conversion associated with residential and recreation development, competition from alien species such as fountain grass, fire, and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the single known population and the small number of existing individuals (C. Corn, K. Nagata, and P. Weissich, pers. comms., 1992). In 1920, Kuekenthal described Cyperus fauriei based on a specimen collected by Faurie on Molokai in 1910 (Wagner et al. 1989). Koyama (1990), in the current treatment of the genus, transferred the species to Mariscus, resulting in M. fauriei. Mariscus fauriei of the sedge family (Cyperaceae), a perennial plant with somewhat enlarged underground stems and three-angled, single or grouped aerial stems 4 to 20 in (10 to 50 cm) tall, has leaves shorter than or the same length as the stems and 0.04 to 0.1 in (1 to 3.5 mm) wide. Three to 5 bracts, the lowest one 2.4 to 7.9 in (6 to 20 cm) long, are located under each flower cluster, which measures 0.8 to 1.6 in (2 to 4 cm) long and 1.2 to 3.9 in (3 to 10 cm) wide and is made up of 3 to 10 spikes (unbranched clusters of unstalked flowers). Each spike measures 0.3 to 1.2 in (0.8 to 3 cm) long and 0.3 to 0.4 in (8 to 10 mm) wide and is made up of compressed spreading spikelets, each comprising seven to nine flowers. Fruits are three-angled achenes about 0.05 in (1.2 mm) long and about 0.03 in (0.7 mm) wide. This species differs from others in the genus in Hawaii by its smaller size and its narrower, flattened, and more spreading spikelets (Koyama 1990). Historically, Mariscus fauriei was found on east Molokai, in the northwestern and southwestern portions of Lanai, and on the island of Hawaii on the northern slope of Hualalai and the northwestern and southernmost slopes of Mauna Loa. A total of 3 extant populations and about 33 to 43 known individuals of the species are found on Molokai and Hawaii; the species is almost certainly extinct on Lanai now. One population of about 20 to 30 plants occurs on Molokai above Kamiloloa on State-owned land. Two populations located about 45 mi (72 km) apart are known on Hawaii on the Hualalai side of Mauna Loa and in the South Point area. The land is privately owned, and there are a total of about 13 known individuals on that island (HHP 1991o1 to 1991o8, HPCC 1991g; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). This species typically grows in lama-dominated Lowland Dry Forests, often on aa substrate, at elevations between 880 and 6,000 ft (300 and 1,830 m) (HHP 1991o8, HPCC 1991g, Koyama 1990). Associated species include alahe'e, Peperomia sp. ('ala'ala wai nui), and Rauvolfia sandwicensis (hao) (HHP 1991o8, HPCC 1991g). The major threat to Mariscus fauriei on Molokai is grazing and trampling by feral goats and axis deer ( Axis axis ), and on Hawaii, competition from alien species such as Christmas berry and Oplismenus hirtellus (basketgrass). On both islands, the species is faced with stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations and individuals (HHP 1991o8, HPCC 1991g; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). First collected on the island of Hawaii by Charles Pickering during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840 and 1841, Nothocestrum breviflorum was named by Gray in 1862. He chose the specific epithet to refer to the short corolla of the flower of this species. In 1888, Hillebrand named var. longipes, but in the current treatment of the genus (Symon 1990), no varieties of the species are recognized.
