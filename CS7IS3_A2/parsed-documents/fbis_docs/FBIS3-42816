Kalinin, National Consumer Protection Fund general director, by DELOVOY MIR correspondent M. Gelman: "Rabkrin Is Returning . . . : Consumer Protection Is a Matter for Consumers Themselves"] [Text] The law is the law. For it to work, the appropriate means for its implementation are required. For example, the vitality of the Criminal Code is supported by the police, the prosecutor's office, and the courts. But who is going to ensure the implementation of the Russian Federation's law "On Consumer Rights Protection," and how? Violations of those laws frequently bear the nature of criminally punishable acts. In practice, however, oversight over those rights falls out of the field of vision of the lawkeeping organs for some reason. And of the executive authorities as well. Therefore public organizations are compelled to be involved in oversight as well. This may just be right. State organs alone could scarcely manage here. There is similar experience in the country at hand: at the dawn of Soviet power, a worker-peasant inspectorate for oversight over anything and everything was created--Rabkrin. In the recent past, a people's control committee functioned, for better or ill. On the problems of consumer rights protection, which affects the country's entire population, DELOVOY MIR correspondent Moisey Gelman interviews the general director of the recently organized National Consumer Protection Fund, Aleksandr Kalinin. [DELOVOY MIR] Aleksandr Yakovlevich, with what purpose was your fund created, and what are its functions and legal base? [Kalinin] The Consumer Rights Fund is an extrabudgetary, independent, noncommercial, charitable organization with a social orientation. Its chief task is to unify the financial and intellectual potential of organizations and enterprises of all forms of property in order to implement the Russian Federation [RF] law "On Consumer Rights Protection." The fund was created at the initiative of the RF State Committee on Antimonopoly Policy and the Support of New Economic Structures. It functions under the good offices of Russia's leading ministries and departments, which are under instructions to ensure state protection for the rights of consumers of goods, jobs, and services. The fund is financed out of institutional, membership, and sponsor contributions, as well as investment funds from its members. The fund's founders and members include the RF Committee on Standardization, Measurement, and Certification [Gosstandart], the State Inspectorate for Trade, Goods Quality, and Consumer Rights Protection of the RF Committee on Trade, the RF Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Russian Goods and Raw Materials Exchange, the Moscow Goods Exchange, the Dialog-Bank, the Estra Financial-Industrial Company AO (joint-stock company), the Energogarant insurance joint-stock company, the Norilskiy Nikel concern, the Germes-Tsentr bank, the Soyuz-Germes AO, the Certification VNII (all-Russian scientific research institute), and others. At present, the fund is implementing three programs: financial-economic, informational-propaganda, and organizational-methodological. It is trying to attract monetary funds and financing for its protection activities for the rights and legal interests of consumers and the support of the consumer movement, while taking into account the multiplicity of its forms and structures. It is also creating in Russia centers and laboratories for the independent consumer expert analysis and certification of goods, jobs, and services, the compilation of a list of goods that do not meet mandatory safety requirements, the organization of counter-advertising for the producers of those goods, the organization of consumers' legal defense, and the financing and implementation of programs for the training and retraining of specialists and expert auditors working in the organized consumer movement. Moreover, the fund is participating in international programs, preparing proposals for Russia's government and goods producers on common state and regional programs for the development of the production of goods, jobs, and services, as well as facilitating the development of entrepreneurship and the formation of a competitive environment in the consumer market. In order to carry out the tasks identified by the fund, centers have been organized for the assortment and quality of goods and services, technical expertise, and certification of items of automotive and tractor machine-building, as well as the training and retraining of personnel. An independent international center for the certification of goods and services for radiation safety and an information rights center for the protection of consumers are being created, as are centers for the independent consumer expert analysis of foods and the raw materials used in them, technical expertise, and certification of flammable fabrics, and others. Departments and branches of the fund are also being created in various regions of Russia. Over the next couple of years, more than 80 are slated for creation; as of now there are 9. Their appearance has been facilitated by local organs of power and commercial structures. Contacts are being established with partners from the countries of the CIS and elsewhere abroad. After all, such funds abroad are actively defending the rights of consumers. [DELOVOY MIR] What guides those wishing to join your fund or to help it? Are they moved by altruism or economic interest? [Kalinin] There has always been some tension with "altruism." The market is forcing people to strive for checks and balances of mutual interests. Their motivations differ, however. For example, it is profitable for banks to support financial relations with us. The Norilskiy Nikel concern has an interest in social protection for its 170,000-person collective working under difficult conditions above the Arctic Circle. The difference between our fund and the various other consumer associations is that only juridical persons can be members of the fund; however, we render assistance, above all legal, to all consumers. With our small staff of nine, we are helped in this by more than 300 experts free of charge, among them scientists, economists, and jurists. The main reason behind the fund, however, was to facilitate the implementation of consumer rights laws, above all through financing various programs (and in this it differs from other consumer associations), for which we attract funds from various sources. Right now we are conducting negotiations about this with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Commission on the European Communities, and several other organizations. Since our fund is charitable, our sponsors and investors are accorded the benefits envisioned by legislation if they invest their funds in charitable projects, which is what the programs carried out by the fund for certifying children's toys and children's food are, as are the separate funds for protection and safety (there are more than a thousand types, and their production employs about 800 enterprises in the country). Whereas the certification of items of automotive and tractor machine-building is not considered a charitable act. [DELOVOY MIR] What part of the spectrum of consumer rights covers the activities of your fund? Do you defend the rights of enterprises as consumers of various output? [Kalinin] We protect the rights of consumers--physical persons. As defined by the corresponding law. The rights of consumers--juridical persons--are safeguarded by state organs, as well as courts of arbitration. The spectrum of their rights is extremely broad, from political to economic. The sphere of our interests comprises primarily the economic rights of the individual as a consumer of goods and services. [DELOVOY MIR] Despite the diversity of violations of the rights of our country's consumers, the main cause is the monopolization of markets, which engenders the decreeing of prices and the low quality of goods and services. What measures should be undertaken to minimize the negative consequences of the economy's monopolization? [Kalinin] Price decrees were engendered by the poorly thought out state policy of price liberalization. This policy must undergo cardinal change. As for the quality of output, given the monopoly nature of production, it must be constantly monitored from the outside. It has worked out that the quality of output, its certification, and the reliability of the funds for measurement are controlled basically by a single department, the RF Gosstandart. True, one other organization is involved in matters concerning expert analysis of consumer goods, the all-Russian association Soyuzekspertiza, under the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This is obviously insufficient. Life demands the creation of an extensive system of consumer expert analysis and certification, including nonstate, in order to eliminate the monopolism that exists in this sphere. Today foodstuffs and the raw materials used in their production are the most dangerous items on the consumer market. If foods are at least somewhat monitored for safety for the individual, then the initial raw materials remain outside the attention of the organs of certification and oversight. It is important to obtain certification and oversight for the technologies of production of all foods, beginning with the places of cultivation and the receipt of the initial components. A poisoned field cannot yield a good product. Therefore, we must achieve the introduction of complex systems of certification and oversight. Not only for foods but for all consumer goods and services within the framework of a system of state and independent consumer expert analysis. [DELOVOY MIR] The solution to this problem is connected with the need to conduct a state policy of ensuring a uniformity of certification and oversight, similar to the old policy of ensuring the uniformity of measurements. Uniformity of certification and oversight allows us to obtain identical and reproducible results anywhere in the country. However, this requires us to solve several problems of a methodological, measurement, organizational, legislative, and technical nature. In particular, it is essential to obtain uniformity of standardization of measurement profiles and an evaluation of the accuracy of the means of oversight. As it is done for the means of measurement. For instance, scales and weights are the same throughout the world. This allows us to weigh a kilo of potatoes identically in Moscow and Nyu-Vasyuki. [Kalinin] We have already run into these problems. Questions arise, for example, about how to certify banking services. Therefore we support the idea of creating both a common methodological center for certification and technical expert analysis and also specialized methodological centers, in particular, a center for the monitoring and certification of the radiation safety of consumer output. Several specialized centers mentioned above have already been created with our support. [DELOVOY MIR] Isn't it obviously just as important to monitor safety in the operation of machines and mechanisms utilized in rendering various services? Especially the means of transport, for which it makes sense to have built in a permanently functioning system of oversight, and possibly certification as well, with sensors at all danger points. Such systems make it possible to avert catastrophes at the early stages of their conception, when deviations of parameters from norms arise only at discrete points and their number does not exceed a certain level of danger. Apart from safety, this makes it possible to increase significantly the intervals between capital repairs of technical means and, consequently, the resource of their work will grow, which will also create a significant economic effect. [Kalinin] The creation at one site or another of permanent systems of oversight and certification also must become the concern of the corresponding independent methodological centers. These are new commercial structures in which the fund is actively investing its funds. Right now we are working on the draft for a national joint-stock insurance company, Kachestvo. We are talking about insuring risks connected with the quality of goods and services. On the basis of preliminary assessments of their quality, the company will insure primarily trade enterprises against possible losses due to poor-quality goods acquired for sale. This kind of prophylactic insurance will make it possible to move our own country's high-quality output into the market actively and with guarantees, which undoubtedly will be in the interests of consumers. At the same time such insurance will make it possible to decrease the price decrees of monopolists. This insurance is going to be implemented in our country for the first time. [DELOVOY MIR] Here you are going to run into the above-mentioned problem of assessing accuracy, that is, guaranteeing the insurance risk for the company and, connected with this, the margin of error in quality oversight, and therefore the accuracy of the testing of output. That is, its certification. [Kalinin] In order to supply information for the work of the fund and the centers being created, we are planning to organize an electronic data bank, which will include all certified output. This means it can become a part of the international system, which will allow us, in conjunction with foreign consumer rights protection funds, to disclose unconscientious suppliers and importers and exports of poor-quality items not only in Russia but in other countries as well. The ordinary consumer needs a supply of information, too, so we are planning to publish a series of brochures, hold a TV marathon, and organize several newspaper hotlines in which our experts and associates of the Certification VNII will participate. I hope that DELOVOY MIR will not refuse our offer to be a part of these efforts. [DELOVOY MIR] With the release of prices and the beginning of the devastating devaluation of money, the state has for all intents and purposes confiscated savings kept in the Sberbank belonging to tens of millions of people. In doing so they violated, mildly speaking, the rights of depositors who utilized Sberbank's services. How does the fund intend to protect this category of consumers? [Kalinin] In a decent society, debts (and confiscated savings are a state debt) are repaid. Therefore we support all proposals for the speedy compensation to depositors for losses and the prevention henceforth of any similar disrespectful--boorish even--treatment of consumers. People encountered the Sberbank's loutishness in July of last year, too, during the exchange of old banknotes for new, when they were forced to be crushed in lines. Generally speaking, in the sphere of consumer services, not only is the dignity of citizens being trampled on as before, but their material interests are suffering as well. Prices for services have risen thousands of times. The sphere of consumer services is contracting since many can no longer afford services. Moreover, the quality of those services, due to the increased monopolism, is declining. Recently we conducted a check of several dozen Moscow photo studios. Long since privatized, naturally. In several of them control photographs were made from our sample negatives, and the pictures differed substantially from the originals. Moreover, the studios lacked proper calculation, and prices were set arbitrarily. This is not even talking about how rude some photographers were. [DELOVOY MIR] How can you protect consumers from price tyranny in our pseudo-market environment? [Kalinin] We can't, for all practical purposes. However, we are determined to undertake several steps. After all, given monopolism, many prices are born from the desire to rip as much as possible out of the consumer's pocket for personal consumption. Therefore these people have to be regulated and restricted somehow. Today the state is allowing anarchy in price formation. [DELOVOY MIR] I think that the uncontrolled growth of prices under monopolism is born out of a desire for uncompensated borrowing at the expense of the consumer. After all, bank loans today entail 220 percent annual interest. The monopolist has raised prices in order to replenish his own circulating funds without burdening himself with debts, so he has obtained the necessary loan. Free of charge and forever. I think that the Metropolitan and telephone communications are expanding today by extorting money in this manner. The simplest calculation shows that if the Moscow Metro is used daily by 10 million passengers, daily receipts come to 500 million rubles. Given this kind of income, is the systematic increase in the cost of travel justified? [Kalinin] I have attempted to familiarize myself with the expenses and bookkeeping balance sheets of the Metropolitan. I did not succeed, however. Everything is cloaked in secret. After all, though, the Metropolitan is a a state enterprise. What then is there to say about private, especially trade enterprises? There the buyer is deceived as before: they misweigh and miscount. [DELOVOY MIR] But what if all buyers are transformed into non-staff monitors? With payment to them of a specific portion of the fine exacted from the violator if the violation has been revealed by the buyer. Moreover, the fine must be quite substantial. [Kalinin] That suggestion is worth considering.
