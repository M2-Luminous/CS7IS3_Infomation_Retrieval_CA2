AL-MAJD has learned that this pro-western team, which claims concern for Jordanian interests, has sought the help of its friends in Washington, London, and elsewhere during the past two weeks in order to pressure the higher Jordanian authorities into abandoning the option of comprehensive solution, easing political and economic rapprochement with Syria and Lebanon, and, consequently, reactivating negotiations and normalization with the Israeli enemy and the Gaza-Jericho protectorate. AL-MAJD has also learned that the higher authorities, known for their ability to deal with crises, have reluctantly given the pro- western team partial freedom to secure some sort of balance in Jordan's relations with the neighboring states on the eve of King Husayn's visit to Washington. According to reliable sources, AL-MAJD can emphasize that Jordan will not go too far in its political and economic talks with the Israeli enemy and 'Arafat, and that the strategic option of the higher Jordanian authorities is still that of adherence to Arab coordination and attainment of a comprehensive solution. AL-MAJD can also affirm that the higher authorities will not risk signing a separate peace treaty with the enemy as desired by the Israeli-American alliance--an alliance that is seeking to weaken the Arab negotiating position by attracting Jordan, terrorizing Lebanon, and singling out Syria.
