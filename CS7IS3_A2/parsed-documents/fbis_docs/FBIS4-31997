The increase was mainly registered in the manufacturing industry. Energy consumption fell by 5 to 6 percent as compared to the corresponding period last year, according to the Finance Ministry's most recent report on the economy's first quarter performance. Exports increased more slowly than imports, but the gap is gradually narrowing. According to preliminary customs figures, Hungarian companies exported products to a value of $2.9 billion by the end of April, 4.7 percent up on the same period last year. Imports amounted to $4 billion, which shows a 7 percent increase as compared to the first four months in 1993. With the increase in imports falling from month to month, the ministry projects a slower increase in imports for the year. Food industry accounted for most of the increase in exports. Exports of machines were moderate, while their import significantly increased. According to ministry analysts the drop in machine exports and the growth in machine imports indicate that domestic investment demand is on the rise, which should contribute to long-term growth in the economy. In the first quarter, enterprises spent 65 billion forints on investments, 59 percent up on the same period of last year at current prices. The ministry's report predicts a 5 to 10 percent increase in the volume of investments for 1994. However, analysts are cautious about drawing conclusions from these figures.
