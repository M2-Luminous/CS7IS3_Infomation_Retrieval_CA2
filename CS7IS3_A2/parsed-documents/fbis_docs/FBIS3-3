S.-IAEA Pyongyang Signals Preference for Talks With U.S. Over ROK SUMMARY Pyongyang's response to the latest South Korean proposal for resumption of inter-Korean talks seems to reflect an effort by the North Korean regime to score polemical points against the South and its ongoing preference for negotiating with Washington over Seoul on the nuclear issue. END SUMMARY Apparently violating a recent DPRK-U.S. agreement, Pyongyang countered Seoul's proposal for a 1 March working-level contact with a later date, a counterproposal that seemed aimed mainly at gaining some perceived polemical advantage over Seoul. According to Pyongyang radio on 1 March, Pak Yong-su, North Korean chief delegate to the proposed working-level talks, sent a telephone message to his Southern counterpart proposing a meeting on 3 March. Pyongyang's attempt to delay the North-South meeting for two days seemed to violate an agreement it had reportedly reached with Washington for resumption of high-level DPRK-U.S talks. The 25 February agreement, announced by Pyongyang radio on 28 February, specified 1 March as the date the following will take place "simultaneously": + Seoul will announce its decision to discontinue this year's running of Team Spirit and Washington will announce its consent to Seoul's decision. + The International Atomic Energy Agency will start nuclear inspections in the North to ensure continuity of safeguards. + Inter-Korean contacts will start at Panmunjom to discuss exchanging of special presidential envoys. + Pyongyang and Washington will announce resumption of high-level bilateral talks to take place on 21 March in Geneva. Pyongyang's Motives In proposing a later date for North-South contacts, Pyongyang may have been showing its concern about appearing to cave in to pressure on the issue of nuclear inspections and its continued reluctance to deal with anyone but Washington on the nuclear issue. In the latest attempt to portray Seoul as irrelevant on the nuclear issue, the party paper Nodong Sinmun in a 28 February commentary ridiculed ROK President Kim Yong-sam for allegedly acting "as if he receives U.S. reports on DPRK-U.S. talks" and "as if he controls the talks" (Pyongyang radio, 28 February). Kim creates this impression, the commentary added, even though "he is not even qualified to join the talks." Pyongyang's reluctance to engage Seoul in anything of substance was also evident in the sheer contempt for President Kim North Korea expressed in commenting on Kim's 25 February press conference commemorating the first year of his presidency. Departing from its past practice of avoiding extreme personal attacks on South Korean leaders during periods of inter-Korean dialogue, the North Korean news agency KCNA on 27 February heaped abuse on President Kim, calling him, inter alia, a "traitor," a "puppet," and a "political mountebank," accusing him of "arch crimes of flunkeyism, treachery, fascism, repression," and promoting national "division and confrontation," and of plain "stupidity." KCNA went on to claim that Kim's remarks about the probable absence of nuclear arms in the North and his proposal for an inter-Korean summit constituted a de facto admission that his "criminal" policy "against the North" had been wrong. The party paper Nodong Sinmun on 28 February similarly ridiculed Kim's "preposterously absurd remarks" (Pyongyang radio). DPRK-U.S. Talks In sharp contrast to its reluctance to meet with Seoul, Pyongyang was upbeat about the prospect of upcoming talks with Washington. Although monitored Pyongyang media have not commented on the news of the upcoming high-level bilateral talks, Ambassador Ho Chong, deputy chief of North Korea's mission to the United Nations, was depicted in South Korean media as being optimistic about the eventual outcome of the negotiations. In an interview with the Seoul daily Hangyore Sinmun (28 February), Ho termed it "fortunate" that Washington, "although belatedly," withdrew "unjustified preconditions" to resumption of the high-level talks, thus paving way for "a package solution" of "not only the nuclear issue, but also other issues now standing in the way of diplomatic normalization. Implications Pyongyang's contrasting media treatment of Washington and Seoul indicates that the North Korean leadership continues to prefer the United States as partner for nuclear negotiations and is inclined to limit talks with the South to the minimum required to fulfill preconditions to resumption of high- level talks with Washington.
