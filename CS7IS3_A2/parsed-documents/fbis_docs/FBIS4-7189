SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama said, "I am worried that (the minority government) will strengthen its character as a pseudo LDP government." The leader of the second largest opposition party told reporters the party will cooperate for passage of the overdue state budget for fiscal 1994, but judge other bills on their own merit. Murayama rejected Hata's last-minute plea to return to the ruling coalition earlier in the day. The party decided Tuesday to withdraw from the coalition over an abrupt creation of a joint parliamentary bloc by coalition groups in the House of Representatives excluding the SDP. Asked whether the SDP will force the government to dissolve the lower house for a snap general election after passage of the budget, Murayama showed a cautious attitude, saying a political vacuum should not be created in view of the current economic situation.
