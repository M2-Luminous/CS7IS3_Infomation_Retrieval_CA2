The mine was surveyed and discovered by the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. Since the bureau was founded in 1989, it has organized eight geological teams and has spent three years carrying out geological prospecting activities in a block section [kuai duan 1040 3008] of 800 meters. The geological prospecting results show that the Paishanlou Gold Mine belongs to the tough shear belt metamorphic hydrothermal type. It is a new type of cold deposit which has been discovered in China for the first time. It is characterized by a large scale, a single mineral, a high percentage of gold, shallow storage, and easy extraction and selection. The gold reserves total 430 tonnes. This is the most exceptionally large gold mine ever discovered in China. The mine is a key development project in the Eighth Five-Year Plan. The state will invest 200 million yuan and will build the mine into China's largest comprehensive modern gold mine, complete with an extraction, selection, and smelting process. The feasibility study of the mine and its overall design have been completed, and its preliminary work is underway. The mine is expected to become fully operational in 1995.
