He condemned the African National Congress [ANC] for its "onslaught" in the homeland to topple President Lucas Mangope. He also accused the government of willfully watching the goings-on. "The ANC demonstrated what use they have of violence...If this is the pattern for the future it spells no good for South Africa." Both the government and the ANC could not be allowed to dominate South Africa, he said. There was tension between him and the controlling bodies of the AVF [Afrikaner National Front]. He had also realised he was not acceptable to a "large proportion" of AVF supporters, the general said. Also, many of his supporters, had urged him to create an opportunity not to vote for the National Party [NP]. He had also experienced "great pressure" from the security forces that they did not want to vote for the NP. Gen Viljoen said he had by Saturday morning not had contact with Dr Hartzenberg. There was a good relationship between him and Dr Hartzenberg and he would assist him in strategic planning as military adviser, said the general.
