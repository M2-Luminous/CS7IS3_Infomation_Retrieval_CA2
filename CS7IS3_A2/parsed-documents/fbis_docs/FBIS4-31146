At the same time casting the entire burden of the risks and uncertainty on the victims of Serbian aggression? This dilemma is similar to the question: "Has the development of the events in Bosnia reached a phase that might be referred to as a new-Yalta delimitation in this part of Europe between Moscow and Washington, or is that only a forced construct that answers more to wishes than to geopolitical reality?" The questions and dilemmas suggest themselves spontaneously, especially since last week's negotiations in Vienna and the ministerial meeting of the United States, Russia, and the European Union in Geneva. In just a few days the United States has changed its own position, and has done so essentially to the detriment of the Muslim-Croat federation. Whereas in Vienna Mr. Redman, Clinton's special emissary for the former Yugoslavia, supported on behalf of the United States the demand for the future Bosnian federation to embrace 58 percent of the total territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher suddenly reverted in Geneva to the European position, accepting division in a ratio of 51:49 to the advantage of the Muslims and Croats. The Muslim-Croat federation was thus reduced by 7 percent in just a few days, and that makes the psychological-political damage from that U.S. loop-the-loop just that much worse. Are the Americans backing the Muslim-Croat federation in any serious way, and are the promises and guarantees they have made to be believed? 1. There are reasons to believe that the U.S. commitment in Bosnia and in the Balkans as a whole is being overstated by a good bit. It is true that the Americans have made a stronger commitment (since the NATO ultimatum in Sarajevo), but basically the character of their commitment has not changed. It still does not occur to Washington to send ground forces to Bosnia nor to intervene seriously from the air in the events of the war there. There are several explanations for that, but two seem to be crucial: Since the disintegration of the socialist bloc and the bipolar division of the world, tendencies towards isolationism, one of the major constants and dilemmas of U.S. politics, has become stronger in the United States. At the same time, because the ideological and worldview confrontation with Moscow had come to an end and because of Russia's obvious economic dependence on the West, the Russian danger in Europe was reduced to a great extent. In that sense Europe had begun to lose a bit of its priority status for the United States. It would not be long before the Clinton administration would turn its foreign policy options and interests more towards Asia than the Old Continent. What is more, aside from the moral and political obligations that arise from America's many years of support to the former Yugoslavia, Washington does not see its strategic and national-security interests in this part of Europe, at least not to the extent that perhaps was expected. In one phase of his vacillating and frequently unclear Balkan policy, it is true, Clinton did attempt to explain strategic U.S. interests in terms of the need to protect human rights and freedoms, but that proved to be too weak a support for any serious commitment of the United States in this part of the world, especially since political conditions and relations in today's world are more and more like those in the 19th century. In his most recent book, which many say is his best, Kissinger in fact predicts that in coming years and decades there will be five or six great powers on the scene (instead of two blocs and ideologies head to head), among which a balance of power will have to be maintained in order to preserve global peace, and that means that policy based on interests, rather than a policy based on principles, will have to leap into the foreground. Part of that vision proves to have been realized already in Bosnia: The principles and moral-political standards from the heroic period of the Cold War have been completely pushed away into the middle distance or background, and all that is left is harmonizing the interests of the key powers: the United States, Russia, Great Britain, France, and -- in an altogether reduced sense -- Germany. 2. Aside from the fact that U.S. national interests were not directly touched or threatened in the former Yugoslavia, limitations of Washington's involvement were also imposed by other circumstances, the relationship with European allies first of all. It has been no secret, neither yesterday nor today, that Great Britain and France have been supporting the project of creating a Great Serbia in one way or the other. Even back during the war in Croatia, that tendency was evident, but it took on its full physiognomy after the diplomatic recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. Since Germany deserves most of the credit for diplomatic recognition, Paris and London tried in every way to conduct a policy which in the end-game would repair the damage done to the interests of those states by the disintegration of Yugoslavia. This is the line pursued not only by the subtle anti-Croat strategy, as a kind of substitute for a more open anti-German policy, but everything has been done to block any serious action that might halt the Serbian war of conquest. With his visit to Sarajevo and Bosnia, Mitterrand deliberately cheated the humanitarian commitment, which has blocked every other action, with the result in the end-game that the Serbs today hold under their control about 72 percent of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Those same factors have also frustrated every attempt to settle problems in the occupied areas of Croatia, without allowing Croatia even the possibility of solving that problem with its own forces. To be sure, the situation in France is today somewhat different than a few months ago. The intelligentsia are no longer neutral or pro-Serb, but have become fairly critical of Belgrade and Pale, which to some extent has diminished Mitterrand's own opportunity for open support to Serbia. But in essence France has not essentially altered its policy in this regard; it has only become more quiet. Finally, the most recent threats that Paris will withdraw its Blue Helmets from the occupied areas of Croatia, and perhaps also from Bosnia, are not aimed against the Serbs, but above all against Washington. Paris is dissatisfied with the fact that the United States did not put as much pressure on the Muslims as was necessary for them to accept the division of Bosnia, which basically guarantees Serbia recognition of the results of its war of conquest. In Britain the situation is more unfavorable in the sense that the orientation of the intellectual elite (educated at Oxford and Cambridge) is still profoundly pro-Serb, pro-Karadjordjevic, so that one can hardly expect any movements towards a new policy there. The statements by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher are only the exception to the rule (incidentally, she does not come from the milieu of the Cambridge-Oxford intelligentsia). So, if the Americans were to embark on an extremely severe course toward the Serbs in Bosnia and indeed in the former Yugoslavia in general, that would necessarily bring them into conflict with their European allies, with France and Britain first of all. That would also jeopardize the minimum consensus achieved in NATO already with the military threats to the Serbs, which would not have been possible without the active support of Paris. In a word: It is not possible at all to expect that the Americans would risk their relations with their European allies because of Bosnia, nor Croatia either, especially since this is nevertheless a European problem and a European conflict. 3. Third, relations with Russia are an equally crucial limiting factor. Even though the Clinton administration no longer looks so naively on Moscow as was the case before Clinton's visit to Russia early in the year, it nevertheless is interested in as much partnership as is possible, that is, in only as much confrontation as is inevitable. First, because it always could be worse with Russia and because Yeltsin has no alternative for the present. Anything else would make Russia still less predictable, and, given the huge nuclear potential which that country possesses, this could give rise to a global danger. In a dual sense: directly in the form of Russian military and political imperialism, and second, through the uncontrolled spread of nuclear weapons and technology even into the so-called "terrorist zones of the world." Since Russia has up to now been standing behind Serbia, and no one doubts that it will continue to do so, and since indeed it itself has its own strategic interests in the Balkans, it is clear that any radical course toward the Serbs would lead the United States into confrontation with Russia. A confrontation which in theory the United States ought not to fear, but which Washington does not find sufficient national motives for and which Clinton is simply neither psychologically nor politically prepared for nor capable of. 4. All those limitations certainly do not mean that the United States does not have interests on the soil of the former Yugoslavia and will not attempt to pursue them. But certainly not in the fashion that the victims of Serbian aggression have at times imagined. Washington objectively awakened from its Bosnian lethargy the moment when the Russians, following the Sarajevo ultimatum, "marched into Bosnia" uninvited. In the White House, which unfortunately is more preoccupied with U.S. health reform and Clinton's real or fabricated romances and financial dealings, they suddenly became aware of the fact that the Russians were right there and right then! From that moment on the United States has been attempting to halt that Serbian-Russian westward spread through some kind of a new Yalta, and doing so with methods and means that follow from the limitations and self-limitations of U.S. policy in the Balkans we have described. That is the moment when the idea was born of creating the Muslim-Croat federation and later the confederation with Croatia (which only then was becoming realistically possible!). The goal in this, as can be seen, was for that Bosnian federation, Croatia, then Macedonia, certainly Albania and Greece, to fall into the western and U.S. sphere of interest, although the last of these is pro-Serb, but, most essential for the United States, it is a member of NATO. Although those states do not make up a compact geographic zone, they nevertheless guarantee U.S. control of the Mediterranean and indeed the Adriatic, since the Croatian coast has become intact. This actually frustrates the Russian outlet to the sea to a more serious extent, since Kotor Bay is no serious point of support in this respect, especially since everything else is under someone else's control. 5. At the same time this explains why the Americans were so yielding in Geneva concerning those 7 percent to the detriment of the Muslim-Croat federation. The problem of the Americans is not so much what is going to happen to a few thousand square kilometers as how to get the Muslims to accept a peace plan based on recognizing the results of the Serbian conquest without exerting great pressure on them. For them the essential thing is for the Muslim-Croat federation to be large enough to survive and therefore perform the role which Washington has assigned it. In addition, at that lowest level of protection of Muslim-Croat interests in Bosnia it is also possible to achieve, without major confrontation, that accommodation with the Russians we have spoken of, as well as agreement with Paris and London, and, finally, with Belgrade and Pale. Finally, the Americans have openly told Sarajevo that they do not intend to wage war on its behalf and that the solution must be found at the negotiating table. To be sure, there are signs that Washington would gladly remove the embargo on arms deliveries to the Muslims, as well as to the Croats, which in future would probably turn the situation to the advantage of the present victims of the Serbian aggression. But is difficult to believe that that will happen, since Paris and London are strictly against removing the embargo, and Moscow has already threatened countermeasures, which could particularly hurt the Americans in a region as sensitive for them as, say, the Persian Gulf. 6. Accordingly, we should not anticipate any greater U.S. commitment when it comes to helping Croatia integrate those occupied areas into its body as a political state. Today more or less all serious observers and analysts are cautioning that they see no way of forcing the Serbs to give up occupation and secession. Especially since it is in the interest of France and Britain for Croatia to remain "occupied" in this way. It is generally held that there are two realistic solutions. The first is for the occupied areas to remain a part of the Croatian state only formally, while in actuality and in future they remain under full Serb authority, that is, under Belgrade, with the possibility of subsequent annexation to a Great Serbia. That is why some of the observers hold that it is perhaps better for Croatia not to make any concessions to the Serbs in the direction of territorial-political autonomy, in hopes that in that way they might come into possession of their occupied areas. According to that version, it is better to keep things open and wait perhaps for other times. That of course carries a certain risk, especially with respect to possible pressures from outside and Serb military provocations. The other solution, which observers inclined toward Croatia are afraid of, might be that in the end-game, as part of a peace solution for Bosnia and Croatia, Croatia would be compelled to give up its occupied territories, along with the minimal possibility of a correction to its advantage, which would be in the area of Osijek, western Slavonia, and the Zadar hinterland. The Americans would certainly be in favor of that correction, and it would guarantee integrity of the transportation system. 7. Kinkel's rather surprising demand, for the present the only one of its kind, that is, that Croatia be accorded reentry into the financial and business arrangements of the European Union because of its demonstrated cooperativeness, was mainly interpreted along those lines in Bonn. Minister Kinkel himself, who really is sincerely interested in Croatia recovering its occupied areas, seems to be realizing more and more that he cannot gain allies for something like that on the international scene. And Germany is unable to go it alone against all the rest. It is for that reason, it is being said, that he wants to "bring" the European Union to compensate Croatia for the occupation with financial, i.e., economic, aid. Probably also with the muffled hope that solid financial injections into Croatia might perhaps have a sobering effect in the occupied areas. It is believed that Germany might succeed in that, and there are two reasons why. Most of the funds which the European Union would possibly donate to Croatia would be German anyway, since Bonn is paying the most into the Brussels treasury. Second, France and Britain would consent to this, since Croatia, and this is the most important thing to them, would still remain "occupied." 8. Of course, just as events are unfolding in the field, so political ideas and intentions are also subject to process. The situation for the present seems to be as we have described it. But that does not mean that this will necessarily still be the case in six months or even later. Especially since the Croatian position in the world has been strengthened and stabilized since the Washington agreement, above all in the sense that the Serbs, who bear the main responsibility for the war and the aggression, have themselves remained out in the international cold. To be sure, they still have fairly persistent and strong protectors, but, as we have said, things are never completely glued together.
