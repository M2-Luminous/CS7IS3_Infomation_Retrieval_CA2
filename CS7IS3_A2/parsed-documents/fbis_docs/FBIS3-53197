It notes comments by Swiss papers, which highlight this meeting, considering it a major event, expressing hope that the meeting will achieve its desired objectives and give great momentum to the peace process. AL-BA'TH notes various media reports about Syria's major, key role in the peace process. Syria not only defends its national interests. It also strongly defends all Arab interests. U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher were the first to note that there can be no peace in the region without Syria. The paper adds: It is common knowledge that Syria, as the entire world has acknowledged, contributed to the convening of the Madrid conference. Syria still believes that the Madrid formula remains the basis in any real endeavor to establish a just and comprehensive peace. Syria has repeatedly said that a comprehensive solution alone would lead to peace and stability in the region. AL-BA'TH concludes: The Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton is extremely important. As many observers think, the summit comes at a time when the peace process has reached a dead end because of Israel's rejection of the Madrid formula and its refusal to implement international resolutions that stipulate full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. Therefore, the whole world hopes the Geneva summit will give new momentum to the stalled peace process. To achieve this, the U.S. Administration is required to take a firmer stance to consolidate the principle of international legitimacy. AL-THAWRAH says the world is looking in the direction of Geneva and is anxiously awaiting the convening of the summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton and its results, which, it is hoped, will usher in a new stage of U.S.-Syrian ties and cooperation regarding the peace process. AL-THAWRAH adds that the nature of the issues and hot topics that will be discussed, in addition to other issues which the two presidents are expected to address, will make the summit meeting a historic event and a major turning point, especially in light of the constant, principled positions of al-Asad's Syria toward these issues. These positions, as everybody has acknowledged, are now firmly embraced by the world. This confirms the credibility of Syrian policy and its sound approach. The summit reflects a clear recognition of Syria's important, central, and weighty role. It is also a U.S. and international confirmation that Syria is a major party to the Middle East equation, a major interlocutor, and truly embodies hopes and aspirations for the liberation of lands and restoration of rights. AL-THAWRAH asserts that leader al-Asad is a man of constants and difficult historic positions in difficult times. He has proven under all circumstances, and in an age of stormy changes and developments, that he is the person most capable of steering the nation's ship toward a safe shore. Al-Asad is going to Geneva to speak in the name of all Arabs. The nation which authorized him realizes that he is its faithful son and honest leader who can be entrusted with issues concerning future and destiny. While stressing the importance of the summit and the fact that it is a juncture between war and peace, its success depends on the U.S. side which sponsored the peace process and which is authorized by the international community and how much it is willing to pressure Israel to rectify the course of the peace process, abide by the Madrid point of reference and formula, and adhere to all resolutions of international legitimacy. Any other wager that does not take into consideration a radical change in Israeli positions and performance toward peace is an illusion and self-deception that will not lead to any result.
