He is calling on NATO leaders to agree to a tough declaration warning the Serbs they will face air attacks unless they give way in two key areas. The bold proposal is designed to restore NATO's credibility in the Bosnian crisis, step up the West's military pressure and appease French demands for nothing short of full-scale bombing raids. Mr Major highlighted the problems in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica where Serbs are preventing the replacement of 300 Canadian troops by a Dutch force and their refusal to allow the airport at Tuzla to be reopened. His proposal urges that plans be drawn up to ensure the replacement of the Canadian forces and to examine how Tuzla airport can be reopened. "If, despite knowing in advance air support was available, troops attempted to stop that from happening, then we would use air support -- i.e., we would use air cover aggresively to achieve our objectives," said a British source. Throughout the two-day NATO summit the French have been pressing for punitive air strikes across Bosnia, but Mr Major warned there could be serious consequences unless these were carefully thought through. But French president Francois Mitterrand was among the first to back Mr Major's proposal which will be formally tabled for endorsement by the alliance later today. The biggest stumbling block will be U.S. approval after President Bill Clinton warned the summit against continued empty threats against the Serbs. But British sources appeared optimistic that the Americans would sign up to the proposal. The Allies are determined to open the Tuzla airport as its closure is severely hampering the humanitarian operation in northern Bosnia. And there is widespread anger at the Serbs' refusal to allow the 300 Canadian troops out of Srebrenica at the end of their six-month tour of duty which was supposed to end just before Christmas. A Dutch contingent is ready to replace them, but the Serbs have blocked all attempts to move them in. The NATO declaration will also re-emphasise NATO's commitment to use warplanes to break the stranglehold on Sarajevo if the situation in the Bosnian capital becomes untenable. A large allied air force is poised for action at bases in Italy and on aircraft carriers in the Adriatic. Britain has a squadron of Jaguar attack jets at Gioia del Colle in Italy and eight Sea Harrier jump-jets aboard the carrier Invincible.
