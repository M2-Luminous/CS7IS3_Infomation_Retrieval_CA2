At a news conference, Seselj said that "backroom dealing by the Belgrade regime police in Krajina unveils the mechanism that the regime is also secretly using in Serbia." According to him, authorities in Serbia believe that by TV manipulations in the next 12 days, ahead of the fresh round of elections in Krajina, they can change the will of the Krajina people. "The Serbian Radical Party will do everything to prevent it," Seselj stressed. He also announced that the Radicals will "do everything" to prevent the continuation of the government campaign against private business owners, members of the Serbian Radical Party, which has taken on the form of thwarting their business activities in order to ruin them financially. Seselj also condemned, as he put it, the state terror against organizers of the latest strikes, which, according to him, are an expression of workers' discontent. "The regime must do something to avoid strikes, but not to achieve it by arresting organizers, but by improving the living standard of all those employed," he added. Seselj read out a list of deputies to the Serbian Assembly appointed by the Main Committee of the Serbian Radical Party. Out of 39 SRS deputies to the republican parliament, these are the SRS MP's from the electoral district of Belgrade: Dragan Todorovic, Aleksandar Vucic, Stevan Vukajlovic, Dusica Nikolic, Stevo Dragisic, Miroslav Dereta, and Miroslav Bogdanovic.
