Yet Another Attempt"] [Text] If you remember correctly, the first attempt was made by the Supreme Council, which, contrary to logic and common sense, called off its own moratorium on the construction of atomic units and canceled its own decree on closing down the Chernobyl Atomic Plant. The Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant [AES], named after V.I. Lenin, lives and... I nearly said... "prospers." The situation is, of course, far from prosperity, as it also is from closing down. I became convinced of that last Friday [27 May], during the visit to the Chernobyl AES by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. I have no doubt presidents do not frequently visit such facilities, and when they do, it is not for mere trifles. What led Leonid Makarovych to the Chernobyl Plant? In order to rule out various interpretations of the trip's objective, the radio and television efficiently informed the public and conveyed the president's ideas on the prospects of atomic power engineering in Ukraine and did so, so to speak, close to the text. In turn, the public response came quickly. The next day, I overheard the following conversation on crowded Kiev bus number 16: "Did you hear what Kravchuk said? No one intends to close down Chernobyl. On the contrary, new units will be commissioned." "Maybe they will even start the fourth unit?" "Who knows? He says that Ukraine will plunge into an energy crisis without Chernobyl." "An energy crisis is better than yet another Chernobyl. I wish we could survive that one." Indeed, at the meeting with representatives of labor collectives and trade union leaders of the Chernobyl AES, the Ukrainian president stated that it is still early for us to dismiss the Chernobyl AES and generally too early to write off atomic power engineering. That is why the concept of the Program for the Development of Atomic Power Engineering in Ukraine had already been elaborated. One can expect that the program also takes into account the Chernobyl AES. At any rate, Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] repeated several times that no one was going to close it down. It is another matter that the world community wants this very much, but if it really wants this very much, it must loosen its purse strings and pay... $14 billion. Despite such a statement, the Ukrainian president gave more arguments in favor of continuing the operation of the Chernobyl AES. However, I personally did not find them convincing. Take, for example, the following argument: The whole Europe abounds in atomic plants. Or: In terms of some safety parameters, the Chernobyl AES is in a much better shape than other similar plants, and so on. Who knows better than Ukraine how safe the Chernobyl AES is. However, it appears that the president himself was not quite sure of the validity of his words -- in particular, those that concerned safety, but he was compelled to defend the position of the so-called atomic lobby. The atomic lobby knows what it is defending. It must be said that, as soon as the correspondents' pickup crossed the border of the exclusion zone, representatives of that lobby immediately got down to work. The correspondents were actively persuaded that it is damaging to close down the Chernobyl AES and that it is safe. One would think we were not going to the atomic plant known to the world by the catastrophe but to a Black Sea resort place. Just eight years have passed since the accident! Eight! Have we forgotten everything? At the plant, the correspondents were in for a small surprise. The program for the president's stay at the Chernobyl AES has envisaged a visit to the premises of the Central Control Board. They say it is located right above the reactor. A historic moment was planned there -- the president poses before photographers over the reactor, something that might symbolize its perfect safety. While the entire team of correspondents climbed to point 35 and prepared the equipment for the sensational shot, it turned out that certain changes had been made in the program. In short, the president did not rise to point 35, and so the historical and sensational shot was not made. Instead, my colleagues took as many photographs as they wanted in Slavutych, where Leonid Makarovych went to personally meet with residents of the town of power engineers. There, Leonid Makarovych repeated what he said in Chernobyl and added that the residents of Slavutych should not worry about their future, meaning that they will not remain without work. I do not know whether the Slavutych residents are pleased with such prospects, but I am convinced that the majority of the Ukrainian population will not be enthusiastic about it. The exoneration of atomic power engineering is a thankless and dangerous deed, all the more so since the people still experience the bitter aftertaste. It is really necessary to hurry up?
