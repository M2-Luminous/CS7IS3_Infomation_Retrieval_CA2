That is why we were informed by the Office of the President of the Presidency that during last night's talks [with General Rose], President Izetbegovic asked General Michael Rose to explain his statement. The British general supplemented his earlier remark by saying that he had also told the Serbs they could not win under any conditions. Their infantry is irreparably wounded, said General Rose, and in the long run, they would [word indistinct] lose the war in Bosnia. The UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina believes that, at the moment, the Serbs cannot defeat the Bosniaks, while the Bosniaks do not have the strength to expel the occupiers. A firm stalemate has been created in Bosnia, which, according to General Rose, is forcing both sides to look for a compromise to end the conflict. This is stated in the communique issued by the Office of the President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency.
