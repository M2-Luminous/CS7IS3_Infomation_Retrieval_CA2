[De la Rua] We want to participate in the party convention and present a homogeneous discourse there. We believe we must attend the convention without feeling subjected to the pact and having the possibility of voting against the clause on reelection of a president who is in office and of reassessing the Buenos Aires Government's autonomy. [Argento] Wouldn't it be more convenient to present a homogeneous discourse at the national level? [De la Rua] Generally speaking it would, but with regard to this issue it would not be advisable because not everybody is of one mind. Here we have been presented with a fait accompli -- there was no prior debate on it. [Argento] You lost the debate when the UCR party convention approved the Democratic Pact. Shouldn't you conform to what the majority wishes? [De la Rua] That is precisely what we are demanding in Buenos Aires City. You must bear in mind that programs and platforms for this type of election are put together by each constituency. [Argento] Why do you think the pact is detrimental to the UCR? [De la Rua] Because it has bowed to the government's wishes. What the pact has incorporated in the constitutional reform does not limit the monopoly control of power. On the contrary, it increases it by vesting the president with the power to issue decrees in cases of extreme necessity or emergency; by seeking to make all terms of office the same length; by incorporating the partial veto and the position of prime minister, which is a hybrid that has no power of its own. And above all, because it makes the role of the opposition wishy-washy and presents it as if it were backing the government. [Argento] [Raul] Alfonsin contends that had the pact not been signed the country would have lurched toward chaos. [De la Rua] The government was then considered a threat. Why should one trust it now? There is a contradiction in terms. The long and short of it is that the government has brought pressure to bear on us and we, the leading opposition party, instead of withstanding it, have surrendered our stronghold. [Argento] Are you saying that the UCR "got cold feet?" [De la Rua] Oh, absolutely. [Argento] Given the UCR's infighting, how will you be able to keep the promise of being the guarantors of the constitutional reform pact? [De la Rua] It has nothing to do with that. That is an election slogan that people can accept or reject. To gain credibility in our capital we have to base our campaign on the stance we have always had, namely being against the president's reelection and a constitutional reform that serves the government's interests and purposes. [Argento] Criticism has been voiced of certain positions like that of Alberto Kohan [secretary general of the Justicialist Party National Council] concerning the possibility of Constituent Assembly members having different positions from what the pact establishes. What image will the UCR give then if it also fails to present a united front? [De la Rua] I have never changed either my stance or my discourse. The government, however, signed a pact and some of its officials say they can disregard it. Now, on closer examination, Article 6 of the law does not say that voting must be in keeping with the terms stipulated in the previous articles but rather that everything that does not fall under the rules established in Articles 2 and 3 will be considered null and void. Therefore, there are constraints on the fields, i.e. the issues that can be discussed, and not on the resolution made there. [Argento] Are you going to head the list of Constituent Assembly members? [De la Rua] I would love to. [Argento] Can it be interpreted as a strategy to recover the ground lost in the October parliamentary elections? [De la Rua] No, it is rather my duty vis-a-vis Buenos Aires residents. Now if my fellow party members want me to be a Constituent Assembly member (this issue does not rob me of my sleep; this is not my overriding concern), I will be one. [Argento] [UCR Deputy] Leopoldo Moreau some days ago said that de la Rua "has no chance" of becoming a presidential candidate. [De la Rua] He shares President Menem's views and it is only natural that he should do so. [Argento] Will there be a rift within the UCR? [De la Rua] Absolutely not. We have always wanted to have a united party and we will continue struggling within our party. [Argento] Would you leave the UCR? [De la Rua] Never. [Argento] Alfonsin denied that he intended to intervene in the Buenos Aires City constituency. Do you think there will be sanctions? [De la Rua] (He laughs) That would be just the thing that is missing to deepen the crisis we are enmeshed in due to the current UCR leadership. [Argento] What is your forecast for the 10 April elections? [De la Rua] Some public opinion polls show that the Justicialist Party has an overall majority. This process is already under way; the constitutional reform has for all practical purposes been passed, the government already has got it at hand since it is already discussing who Menem's running mate will be in 1995. [Argento] Do you then think the UCR will limp badly? [De la Rua] I wish just the opposite, but I must be pessimistic.
