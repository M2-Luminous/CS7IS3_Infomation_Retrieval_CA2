By late 1995, professionals will represent the largest portion of military specialists in the Army units and subdivisions. Later the whole Army, from soldiers to generals, will become professional. Creanga rejects certain people's proposals to liquidate the Army. He says that Moldova should have "sufficiently numerous regular troops mobile and capable of confronting eventual threats to its security." Referring to the instruction of officers, Creanga specified that by late 1995 at "Alexandru cel Bun" Military College courses for retraining different military specialists will begin. He also said that other special schools for instructing professional soldiers will be opened as well. About 100 graduates from the CIS military schools will begin serving this year in the Defense Ministry. Many Moldovan Army soldiers are studying in France, Romania, the U.S.A., and Greece, Says Creanga.
