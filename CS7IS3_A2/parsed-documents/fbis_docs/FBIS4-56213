[Begin recording] [Costales] Lawyer Magda Montiel has not committed any crime, yet is the target of harassment and threats from the far right of the Cuban emigre community of Miami. All she has done is participate, in her fatherland, in a conference between emigres and representatives of the Cuban Government. [Montiel] The things we have heard are things neither one of us could have ever imagined. Not only that, I cannot go out. We are constantly under police protection. [Costales] Have you been given the protection you requested? [Montiel] Yes. We are under continuous police protection at office and at home. I am not able to go out. There have been protest rallies even in my neighborhood. I cannot go out. [Costales] What are you planning to do? [Montiel] I do not know what I can do. I am living from moment to moment but it is constant, the bad news, and protests. Yesterday, I was unable to leave my office. [Costales] Have you been able to make it to your house? [Montiel] Yes. But I cannot even tell you where I am. [Costales] I understand. How is your family, so far? [Montiel] Okay, so far. [Costales] Magda, tell me something, from a judicial point of view, can anything be done? [Montiel] No. They get permits to hold the protests, and there are the calls, threats, bomb scares, and all my employees resigned. [Costales] We were aware that something had happened, we got news, and know that the far right has intensified their attacks and have made lists of people for the simple act of coming to Cuba. We are aware of this. This is why we call you to know how you are doing and what has happened. We are, of course, against that. [Montiel] There are certain hours when the telephone calls never stop, the insults, bomb scares, and ugly, ugly upsetting things. It is a constant torture to have the telephone ringing off the hook and not be able to go out, and having to have bodyguards and police protection, and worrying about the children and the fear of sending them to school. No one should have to live this way. [Costales] Of course, not. That is unfair. We agree with you. [Montiel] What I am telling you is barely the surface. You can not imagine. I guess in a few days they will find something else to do and perhaps the situation will get somewhat calmer. I am a prisoner. I cannot go out. [Costales] Magda Montiel cannot be harassed by the simple fact of visiting Cuba. Makes sense? That is what I think. [Montiel] That is what I am saying. For me, the irony of the whole affair is that you turn on the television to see Nixon's funeral where he is being treated as a great hero and see me portrayed as a traitor. I keep telling myself: My God, I have not been caught buying cocaine, or killing anyone, or molesting children. What is going on? Zenaida, the most important thing is that I have kept my dignity and position. I have not sold out. There are people who have told me to ask for forgiveness to save my family. Others have told me to say that as a lawyer I had a case I was trying to solve and that is why I acted so. I have maintained my position and may God decide. Hopefully, it will have a peaceful ending, and my children and I will not be harmed. [Costales] We are aware that you have remained firm because we have heard certain things. All we can say is that we keep you in our thoughts and are tracking the news. We will call you again. We trust everything will come out fine. [Montiel] Thank you very much. So long. [end recording]
