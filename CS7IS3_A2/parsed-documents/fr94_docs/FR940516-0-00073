ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning presumptive service connection for certain diseases resulting from exposure to ionizing radiation during military service. Congress has added cancer of the urinary tract to the list of radiogenic conditions for which presumptive service connection is authorized, but did not indicate which entities it considers part of the urinary tract. This amendment is intended to define the term ``urinary tract'' for VA purposes. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 1992. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Caroll McBrine, M.D., Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, (202) 233&hyph;3005. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: VA published in the Federal Register of October 5, 1993 (58 FR 51798&hyph;99) a proposed amendment to 38 CFR 3.309(d) to define the term ``urinary tract'' for purposes of implementing the presumption of service connection for urinary tract cancers based on exposure to ionizing radiation established in the Radiation Exposure Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;578. Interested parties were invited to submit written comments on or before November 4, 1993. Since no comments were received on the proposed rule, the final rule is adopted as proposed, effective October 1, 1992, the date provided by Public Law 102&hyph;578. The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.104 and 64.109.
