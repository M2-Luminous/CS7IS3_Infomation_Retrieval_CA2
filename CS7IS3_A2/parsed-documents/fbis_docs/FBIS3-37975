This has been reported to ELTA by Viktor Shevaldin, director general of the Ignalina nuclear power station, today. After additional investigation, a conclusion was made that radioactivity could have increased because of the leak of gas, which is used to pull the turbines, into this compartment. Although the rate of the gas leak was much lower than that permitted by the exploitation procedure, the administration of the station, however, decided to shut down the second power unit in order to be able to carry out a detailed inspection of the compartment and to eliminate the cause of the leak. The unit is to be under maintenance from 25 February until 6 March, Shevaldin said. The head of the power station also informed that the increase of radioactivity in the unmanned compartment of the second block did not have any influence either on the power station or on the radioactive background of the environment.
