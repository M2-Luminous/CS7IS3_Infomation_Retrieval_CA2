The demonstration lasted about one and half an hours beginning around 5 P.M. along a street near the east ward office near Sosok-dong. When riot police fired tear gas canisters, the students mostly of Chonnam and Chosun Universities countered it with rock hurling, paralyzing traffics. At an earlier rally held at the Chosun University campus, the students also demanded the safe return home of those Kwangju students stranded in Seoul and asked for the disclosure of the truth of the June 18 violent clash at Hong-ik University in Seoul. Meanwhile, at the reports of the renewed issuance of search and seizure warrants against the two Kwangju campuses, students erected barricades at their school gates to keep police from entering. So far 110 Namchongnyon students were arrested for their part in unlawfully stopping a passenger train and in the violent clash of June 18 in which more than one hundred policemen and students were injured. Student arrests are likely to swell as the police, determined to ferret out all those who actively took part in the violence, have launched an extensive manhunt. Students claim that both the train stoppage and Hong-ik University clash were the results of "traps" laid by the police.
