Today, this crack should be rewritten to read that every time there is an election, everyone knows who is offering gratuities, the amount of the gratuity, what is expected in return for the money, and who is a thug. The Kuomintang is the only one that does not know. But how could it not know? Whenever a party official large or small states how "strong" his nominator is, that shows that the KMT has actually known for a long time. "Strong" is a special term used as a code word in Taiwan politics. When the KMT urges the withdrawal of an inexperienced young person, it says he or she "is not strong so how can he or she be elected." When the media analyze an election, they also rank candidates by who is and who is not "strong." When the election is won, everyone declares that the "strong" person won. The KMT is the "strong faction." In short, to be "strong" is to be like Chiang Kai-shek and Sun Yat-sen. If you are not "strong," how can you be elected? Take the present election of county and city assembly chairmen and vice-chairmen, for example. It was really extremely coincidental that before balloting all the assemblymen were surprisingly so wholehearted in their great interest in group tours for their constituents. But no one knew anything about this coincidence. Rubbish. However, in Taiwan, hard evidence is important. Election bribery? Did anyone see a KMT candidate give money to anyone. Thugs? Did anyone see a KMT candidate shoot at another person? Since there is no hard evidence, naturally everything is considered mud slinging. What is more, from the very beginning of the election, the KMT repeatedly exhorted comrades against using bribery to get elected, against wining and dining people, against offering group tours to constituents, and against force and threats. Since it had be so emphartic, surely there would be no breaking of the rules. Even if some candidates did offer bribes, that was not the party's problem, but a problem with the social atmosphere. Dammit! What kind of logic is that! What makes one not know whether to laugh or cry is that it was the logic used in the 2 March KMT Standing Committee meeting. Therefore, Taiwan's bribed elections have actually long been an incurable disease. It is not that the disease is so serious or a remedy so hard to find, but only the "not knowing." When everyone realizes that elections are sick, the KMT does not admit that anything is wrong. When everybody sees bribed elections and thuggery, the KMT does not know anything about it. It tells bare faced lies. Now, even were a remedy to be offered with the best of intentions, the KMT would not countenance it. Bribed elections are not a difficult to cure disease. All that is needed is for a young candidate who has a good image, who is capable, and who is not "strong" to win once or twice, and the disease would be suddenly cured. Of course, to run for election without being "strong" means victory would not be assured. However, a good person might lose once, but he would not lose forever. Once a good person won, that would not be just a small win; it might bring a great, complete victory in its wake. Are bribed elections difficult to cure? Not at all. All that is needed is to change the hearts of the party bureaucrats into the hearts of the common people. There is nothing to it!
