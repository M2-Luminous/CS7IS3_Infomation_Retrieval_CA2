This is one arena where Cap Sesa Industrie seeks to boost its presence. "Industry is the sector of the economy that dispensed most of all with software and services last year," says Gerard Mezin, director-general of Cap Sesa Industrie. In the light of this finding, his company (Fr1 billion business volume) -- which chalked up 3.5 percent of its software and service sales for 6.5 percent of the business volume of the SSI [data processing services and engineering companies] in this sector in 1992 -- intends to double its shares of the market by the 1996 horizon without any foreign growth. The pie that is to be shared here as a matter of fact looks quite appetizing. According to Pierre Audoin Conseil, the industrial enterprises last year devoted 92 billion to their data processing systems, including 29 billion for software and services. A study specially conducted by Cap Sesa shows that the big accounts, that always sustained the growth of the services market (in 1992, ten industrial groups accounted for 35 percent of the software and services expenditures) have a tendency to slow their investments down; on the other hand, medium-sized enterprises will pick up the slack and will help push expenditures up. "The difficult economic situation in which many of the big accounts find themselves obviously has an unfavorable impact on their investments in software and services," emphasized Gerard Mezin. Moreover, there are currently wide disparities between the sectors that should recover with the passage of time. Some of them, such as metallurgy, agribusiness and food, and capital goods are posting expenditure ratios between data processing and business volume that are still rather meager when compared to the industry average. Cap Sesa, in turn, has just signed two important contracts, representing a total of more than Fr80 billion in the field of computer-aided manufacturing management and commercial management. "In 1996, the industrial enterprises will consume 30 percent of FM and 30 percent hardware. Big projects will be increasingly built up on the basis of these products," predicts Gerard Mezin. These two market segments should advance, respectively, at a rate of 23 percent and 12 percent per year, as against 9.3 percent for systems integration, a preferred arena of competition between data processing services and engineering companies, on the one hand, and data processing equipment makers, on the other hand.
