The final decision on his future in the government Shakhray does not intend to take until his meeting with Premier Chernomyrdin and President Yeltsin. This was how Shakhray commented to the information by an Interfax correspondent that Yeltsin had not accepted Shakhray's resignation. Shakhray announced his resignation on Wednesday after he had been removed by Yeltsin's orders from his other government post as minister of nationality and regional affairs. According to Shakhray's press service, he puts the president's evaluation, voiced by Kostikov, of his personal traits "on the conscience" of Press Secretary Kostikov. The latter had voiced criticisms of Shakhray while quoting the president on Thursday at a briefing in the Kremlin. Kostikov, quoting the president's words, in part said that Shakhray is marked by "a certain political fickleness and a desire to accumulate many (governmental) posts, and has political plans that don't always meet the true interests of Russia."
