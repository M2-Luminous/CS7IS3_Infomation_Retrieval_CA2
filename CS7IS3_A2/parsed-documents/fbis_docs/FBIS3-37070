The concrete steps toward the resolution of this issue are often assessed without taking into account the actual reality and the set of all existent factors, that is to say, in a one-sided parochial view. Therefore, the issue returns once and again to be viewed in our programs. Today we will take a look at this with the help of General Colonel Ivan Bizhan, deputy defense minister. [Bizhan] Despite the fact that a great deal has been said about this issue in the press, television, and on the radio, many people are still interested in it. I would like to say one more time that not a treaty but a declaration and an annex to this declaration were signed by the presidents of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and the United States in Moscow. There are no significant discrepancies between this declaration and the Supreme Council resolution on ratifying the START I treaty. I would also want to emphasize that Ukraine's nuclear disarmament issue involves the United States as well. This is exactly what we have wanted from the very beginning, when we began to address this issue. Carefully looking at the annex to the statement signed by the presidents, one can see that the Russian Federation for the first time committed to service the nuclear warheads deployed in Ukraine, and which, according to the agreement, will be gradually transferred to Russia for dismantling. This is also one of the problems which we had been trying to solve, but which Russia had been refusing to solve, intending to exert pressure on Ukraine through this or to force it to adopt certain decisions. You know that we ourselves cannot maintain these nuclear warheads. Now, one does not have to convince anybody that the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine are our property. As you remember, one had to do this until recently, because the Russian Federation by no means wanted to admit that. It claimed that these weapons once belonged to the Soviet Union, and now they should be inherited by the Russian Federation. Therefore, it considered itself the only inheritor of these nuclear weapons. Now, when this problem has ceased to exist, another one arises: What should our state do with these nuclear weapons inherited after the downfall of the Soviet Union? For example, what could be done with the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine? Some people say that Ukraine should be a nuclear state. If this problem is examined in the context of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine, then how can Ukraine become a nuclear state? If we agree with the Russian Federation that Russia will service the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine, and that it will replace nuclear warheads whose warranty and shelf life have expired, and that it will hand over to us the systems of control. However, while saying that, we should ask ourselves a question: Will Russia agree with that? Will the United States agree? Will other states agree? And a whole range of other questions. This is unreal. To link our nuclear weapons to the nuclear status of the state is the only way, however unreal. Assuming that Ukraine should become a nuclear state, it will be necessary to adopt a resolution to establish an entire infrastructure which a nuclear state should have. We do not have such a structure. Specialists should give their opinion on whether it is possible or not to do this. Although they have already said a lot about this, let them say more. What will this involve; what problems will this cause; what costs are entailed? What will be the consequences of this decision? Do we need that? Will this increase our security? There are also other problems we should resolve in this regard. Thus, the nuclear weapons deployed on the territory of our state and the nuclear status of our state are two different issues. Now we should solve this issue. The declaration signed by the president of our state and the annex to it concern nuclear weapons that we inherited from the Soviet Union and we currently possess. However, while solving this issue, we should proceed from objective circumstances. No matter what we say and what decisions are adopted, the circumstances are dictating [their terms] now. What kind of circumstances? For example, every nuclear warhead has a certain warranty period. You know that President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk, at a news conference given at Boryspil airport following his return from Moscow, said that the warranties of all the nuclear weapons deployed in our state will expire in 1999 or 2000. However, they begin to expire as early as this year. Therefore, a certain number of nuclear warheads will surpass their shelf life this year. This means that we will have to deal with this problem every year. No matter what decisions we adopt, we should resolve the problem of nuclear weapons which have surpassed their shelf life. Actually, nuclear weapons are one of the powerful security guarantees for a state, but only if a state is really a nuclear one. For example, if we had all those elements, or all that infrastructure that accounts for the status of a nuclear state, this would unquestionably be a guarantee of our security. However, the things are not like that. The nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine today cannot be a guarantee of our security because these weapons are nothing more than our property. The entire control system, the entire production system, the entire servicing and testing system is in the Russian Federation. No matter what our desires are, this is true. For some reason, we have recently discussed only those nuclear weapons which are deployed on our territory, having in mind the problems, or aspects, of our security. However, we should not forget the fact that, with regard to conventional arms, to conventional armed forces, our state is the second power on the continent, after the Russian Federation. Is this not an aspect of our state's security? It is, and it is an aspect that we can maintain on such a level of combat readiness, which would allow our Armed Forces to defend our state. It could be done at the expense of resolving the issue of nuclear weapons which are now in Ukraine. First of all, I have in mind financial aspects, when we will be able to allot larger funds to our conventional Armed Forces. Therefore, I think that we should not forget about this issue, too. Besides, the issue of our state security is an issue of our integration with European structures, including the Partnership for Peace program adopted during the recent NATO session. We should participate. We should integrate with NATO and other structures. It will also be one of the guarantees of our security. I do not want to mention such issues as friendly relations with other states, in particular, with neighboring states, or the resolution of our many heavy economic problems. The resolution of these problems will also grant us security guarantees. Having resolved the issue of nuclear weapons deployed in our state, we will be able to resolve those other problems and aspects that constitute the entire body of our state security. [Pohorelov] Ivan Vasylyovich, let us close our interview with the following summation of the nuclear weapon issue in Ukraine today: One cannot be a king for only one day; one must also think about the future. [Bizhan] Yes, you are right. Our status with regard to nuclear weapons, which are actually our property, is a temporary situation. This temporary situation will terminate at the end of the year of 2000. The number of nuclear warheads will be decreasing every year. No matter what resolution we adopt, the objective circumstances will drive us toward a reduction of nuclear warheads deployed on Ukraine's territory. It is because of objective circumstances and the connection with serious issues related to the nuclear and ecological security of our state. I do not think anyone will adopt a resolution which could bring tragedy, either nuclear or environmental.
