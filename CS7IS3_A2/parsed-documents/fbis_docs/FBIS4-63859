FBIS4-63859 "drsov101_r_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-101 Daily Report 21 May 1994 Azerbaijan Aliyev Speaks on Islamic Festival Day Aliyev Speaks on Islamic Festival Day NC2305204694 Baku Azerbaycan Radio Televiziyasi Television Network in Azeri 1630 GMT 21 May 94 NC2305204694 Baku Azerbaycan Radio Televiziyasi Television Network Azeri BFN [Speech by President Aliyev during a meeting with refugees on the occasion of the Islamic Festival of Sacrifice in Baku on 21 May -- recorded] [Excerpts] Esteemed sisters, brothers, and citizens from Shusha, Khodzhaly, Malybeyli, Lachin, and Karabakh, which is a beautiful part of our country: I congratulate you and the people of Azerbaijan on the occasion of the Festival of Sacrifice. I wish you and the people of the Republic happiness and an auspicious future. [passage omitted] The religious festivals are auspicious and happy occasions for the people. However, our people are in a very difficult situation at the present time. Azerbaijan has been subjected to Armenia's military aggression for six years now. It has been forced to fight to safeguard its territory. A serious situation exists in the Republic. Azerbaijan's brave and heroic sons have been martyred while trying to defend our territory. Our refugee sisters, brothers, and sons from Shusha, Lachin, Khodzhaly, and Malybeyli have met here today. They prove that our people are in a difficult situation. However, they are optimistic. They have never bowed their heads. They have never yielded. That being the case, we have not forgotten our traditions and customs even at this serious time and we have moved to celebrate the Festival of Sacrifice. Undoubtedly, marking the occasion in prosperity and security is impossible. We are all aware of that state of affairs. However, we all feel happy and optimistic on this day. That is why I have come here to meet you. That is why I have come here to meet the people who have suffered most in Azerbaijan. I repeat that you have suffered significantly. You have been forced to abandon your homes and places of birth during the past two years. You have lost the property you inherited from your forefathers. You have martyrs in your families. I am well aware of the fact that each and every family in this gathering has missing persons and martyrs. All the families are grieving. However, you must rest assured that each and every patriotic citizen of Azerbaijan shares your grief. I have congratulated you on the occasion of the Festival of Sacrifice. Nevertheless, my heart is full of grief. I share your grief. I have been elected president through the people's will. That means that I have to grieve more than anyone else. Rest assured that I do. I have put my hope in you and the people of Azerbaijan. You must rest assured that I shall spare no effort in the struggle I wage to fulfill your expectations and those of all the people. On the occasion of the Festival of Sacrifice, I commemorate our sons, sisters, and brothers who have sacrificed their lives for the defense of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and independence. I wish to reiterate that their heroic services will never be forgotten. We shall cherish their memory in our hearts forever. Through their heroic services and martyrdom, they have become an everlasting monument. I call upon you to observe silence for one minute to commemorate those who fell to become martyrs while defending our homeland. [silence observed for one minute] God bless their souls. God give patience to their families, sisters, and sons. I pray that God also give you patience and protect you. I wish to reiterate that the blood of the martyrs will be avenged. Azerbaijan's people will maintain the struggle that the martyrs waged. They will reestablish Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. [applause] We are well aware that you are in a serious situation. You have been living as refugees during the past two years. You have found a place to live in the recreation buildings in this place, which were constructed in the past. I am aware that they are not spacious. However, we are all aware that the majority of those who have recently become refugees are now living in tents and places that are even worse. They are living in tents in Imishlinskiy, Sabirabadskiy, Agdzhabedinskiy, and other rayons. It is common knowledge that Azerbaijan has lost 20 percent of its territory in the war, which has continued for six years. This territory has been occupied by the Armenian military forces. It is common knowledge that more than one million citizens from Shusha, Malybeyli, Khodzhaly, Lachin, Kelbadzhar, and other towns and cities in Daghlyk Karabakh have become refugees during that period. We have been taking measures under very difficult conditions to help them. Considering your problems, I wish to inform you that I greatly appreciate your steadfast resistance and patience. Thank you for maintaining your steadfast nature. Thank you for enduring the tragic situation, which applies to all the people. That is a unique aspect of the Republic's people. [passage omitted] The difficult times will pass and Azerbaijan's people will have a happy and prosperous life in their independent country in the future. I have confidence in that and I wish to assure you that the state, the government organs, and the president will spare no effort to achieve that objective. [applause] I wish to take advantage of this meeting to convey my views on the recent developments and the situation in our Republic. It is common knowledge that Armenia has consistently maintained its military aggression against Azerbaijan over the past few years. Consequently, we have lost a part of our territory. Several measures have been taken since my return from Nakhichevan to Azerbaijan to establish the Azerbaijan Armed Forces and other conditions needed for the defense of our republic. Several measures have been taken to enable Azerbaijan to adopt a policy on the war with Armenia and the developments in the world, that is, a policy in line with the people's interests. You are well-aware of those measures. Most probably, you are also aware of the war, the political developments in the Republic, the struggle waged by various groups for power, and the activities of individual people against the general population's interests significantly curtailed Azerbaijan's potential in the economic, intellectual, cultural, and social fields over the past few years. You will remember that several people at this gathering reminded me that in the past we have met in Shusha and in the cemetery at Baku. One of them told me that I had presented the order of merit to her. But, those were different occasions. Our people had a comfortable and prosperous life at the time. Please remember the work we carried out to renovate Shusha in the 1970's. [passage omitted lauding past renovation and construction work] We have taken measures to enable Azerbaijan to end the war. In addition, we have taken measures to establish and strengthen the Azerbaijani Army and set up our defense positions. We have taken political measures to find a peaceful solution to the war. We have conferred with influential countries, and tried to use various opportunities to benefit from international organizations. Meanwhile, we have consolidated our military strength, reactivated our economic potential to a certain extent, and upgraded our foreign policy. Furthermore, we have made an effort to use political measures to end the war and remove the problems of the people. I wish to inform you that the measures we have taken and the work we have done have yielded results and will continue to do so in the future. You are well-aware of the situation of our military forces in the past. It was not that we did not have an army, however the military units were [words indistinct]. The people of Shusha, Khodzhaly, and Daghlyk Karabakh are well-aware of that state of affairs. We made efforts to establish a regular army and have achieved significant success. We now have a regular army. You are well-aware that our military forces launched attacks against the Armenian Armed Forces over the past few months, particularly after October and November 1993. As a result of those attacks, we reclaimed a part of the occupied territories. Consequently, Azerbaijan's military forces proved their high capability to the entire world. The Armenians and the Armenian Armed Forces realized that as well. The Armenian military units were forced to withdraw. That is only a part of the outcome of our work. However, we are well-aware that the war will lead to more tragic situations if it is allowed to continue for another three or five years. With that in mind, we wish to end the war. We wish to find a peaceful solution to the dispute. That can be achieved only through talks. Your sons must not be killed. That can be prevented only through talks. We have held talks from time to time. You are well-aware that the dispute on Daghlyk Karabakh has a significant place in the policies of all the world's countries. Each and every country in the world has expressed its opinion on the Daghlyk Karabakh dispute. Regrettably, Azerbaijan maintained a weak policy and failed to put its weight down in international platforms over the past few years. Furthermore, the officials responsible for Azerbaijan's policy were unsuccessful. Consequently, the influential countries, mainly the European countries and the United States, were convinced that Azerbaijan had to be blamed and that the Armenians in Daghlyk Karabakh were deprived of their rights. International opinion has supported the Armenian side. That is a fact. Maybe you may not be aware of that state of affairs, however we are well-aware of the situation. Those who were involved in politics in the past, and those who have currently appeared on the scene claiming to be politicians, are also well-aware of that state of affairs. Consequently, we have made efforts over the past few months to end the war by finding a peaceful solution to the dispute, but on the condition that the occupied territories are returned to the Republic. Then, Azerbaijan's territorial integrity would be restored, and the non-violation of the Republic's borders is observed. However, you must realize that achieving all that is not easy. The general view of international platforms and organizations has been against Azerbaijan. Our territories have been occupied as a result of the inefficiency and treachery of those who were responsible for Azerbaijan's future. Undoubtedly, all that has created very serious problems for us, and during the talks we have had to find a peaceful solution to the problem. Many countries around the world support Armenia. Meanwhile, we have been unable to remove the Armenian military forces from our territories. Consequently, the Armenian side has put forward conditions in the talks. Can you realize how serious and difficult that situation is? A wise and well-considered policy has to be maintained. Yes, that is the kind of policy we are trying to maintain. You are well aware that Azerbaijan's relations with Russia have deteriorated significantly during the past few years. Obviously, an organization that called itself the Azerbaijan Popular Front but that failed to concern itself with the people's problems created a very unfavorable situation between Azerbaijan and Russia. The question of international politics is a complex matter. No country in the world, including small countries, must avoid maintaining a realistic approach. How can Azerbaijan, which recently achieved its independence but is still unable to stand on its feet as an independent country, allow itself to maintain a state of discord with a great country like Russia? Is that possible? Anyway, there is no reason for that. Azerbaijan has been influenced by Russia for 200 years. Whether we like it or not, that is a historic fact. Many kinds of relations were established between Azerbaijan and Russia in those years, including humanitarian, economic, scientific, and technical relations. How can those relations be destroyed? How can more than one million Azerbaijani people in Russia be ignored? How can we force a great country to be an enemy of Azerbaijan? That is absurd. In view of that, we made an effort to normalize Azerbaijan's relations with Russia. I am convinced that we have succeeded. Azerbaijan's relations with Russia are at a very favorable level at the present time. We have established friendly relations. That must be the situation in the future. Each and every independent country should have friends in the world. Neighboring countries should be friendly, not hostile. That is what we have tried to achieve. Furthermore, it is common knowledge that we have joined the CIS. That was very essential. All that has created a significant basis for a peaceful solution to the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Meanwhile, we have made an effort to establish close relations with other countries. For example, we have traditional, friendly, and fraternal relations with Turkey. We are maintaining our friendly and fraternal relations. It is common knowledge that I have visited that country and signed important agreements. We have very sincere relations with the top officials in Turkey. Iran is a close neighbor. Millions of Azerbaijani people live in that country. We have had close relations with that country for many centuries. However, the policy that was maintained until recently disrupted the relations between Azerbaijan and Iran. That country became our enemy. Nevertheless, we rectified that situation. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani visited Azerbaijan and signed several agreements. Consequently, our economic, humanitarian, and cultural relations are developing in a very favorable way at the present time. We have also made an effort to improve our relations with the influential countries in the world. The United States is a great country. It has a significant influence on international politics. A very chilled atmosphere prevailed in Azerbaijan's relations with the United States in the past. We improved that state of affairs and I am convinced that the effort we have made has yielded positive results. You will recall that the U.S. Congress adopted an unjust resolution against Azerbaijan in September 1992. That was because of unwise policies and the inactivity of Azerbaijan's leading officials at the time. The resolution banned any U.S. aid to Azerbaijan in accordance with Article 9/7 [as heard] of the U.S. law on freedom because Azerbaijan supposedly blockaded Armenia. The U.S. Congress adopted that resolution, which created a significant precipice between Azerbaijan and that country two years ago. Azerbaijan's relations with Russia and the United States deteriorated in the past. Had the officials--who supposedly governed Azerbaijan in the past and who now claim that they are great politicians--maintained a wise policy, Azerbaijan's relations with Russia, Iran, and the United States would not have been disrupted and the U.S. congress would not have adopted that resolution. We have carried out significant work in that direction. I have held talks with U.S. officials who have visited Azerbaijan several times. We also maintain contact with U.S. officials through other means. I can also inform you that President Clinton sent a letter to me a month ago. It indicated a positive shift in the U.S. approach toward Azerbaijan. President Clinton described the resolution, which banned any U.S. aid to Azerbaijan, as an unjust decision. That was the first time he did so. Furthermore, he informed me that he will work to have the Congress cancel that resolution. Considering Azerbaijan's present situation, I am convinced that this move is a very appreciated step by President Clinton. President Clinton also conveyed a congratulatory message to me on the occasion of the Festival of Sacrifice on 17 May. I believe that the meaning of that message is important from two aspects. First, it indicates that the United States is aware of our national and religious festivals. President Clinton has congratulated Azerbaijan's people through me on the occasion of this festival. Second, it indicates that President Clinton appreciates Azerbaijan's efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Daghlyk Karabakh dispute, particularly within the CSCE framework. In fact, he has said that the U.S. Administration will also work on the matter. Those two aspects indicate that the talks we have had with the United States within the framework of our foreign policy have yielded positive results. A large U.S. delegation arrived in Azerbaijan on 15 May. We held very fruitful talks with those officials. Furthermore, you are aware that I visited France at the invitation of President Mitterrand, Britain at the invitation of Prime Minister John Major, and the PRC at the invitation of President Jiang Zemin. Very useful work was carried out during my visits. The UN Security Council has five permanent members. They are the United States, Russia, Britain, France, and the PRC. I have held talks with the leaders of four of those countries. You are aware that I have held talks with President Boris Yeltsin several times. I met with the leading officials of France, Britain, and the PRC during my visits. Our independent Republic signed very important agreements with them. Can you imagine, a new and independent Republic like Azerbaijan has established close relations with several countries that influence international politics. Official visits have taken place and fruitful agreements have been signed. All this has given Azerbaijan publicity in the international community. Unfortunately, we have had many problems in connection with that matter in the past. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's position in the world has strengthened. A significant opportunity has been created to remove the serious situation in our Republic. However, that is not all the details of our foreign policy. But I do not wish to give you detailed information on it. My intention is to express my opinion and focus only on the need to find a peaceful way to end the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. I am convinced that we have to strengthen our defense forces and consolidate our capability to defend ourselves. Meanwhile, we must also use all the existing opportunities. For example, we are holding talks with Russia, the United States, and Turkey on the matter. We are also in constant touch with the UN Security Council and the CSCE. We are making a very serious effort. I have realized the importance of the CSCE's effort to find a peaceful solution to the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia ever since I took office as president. In view of that, we have cooperated with that organization. The Minsk Group, which is made up of nine countries, is affiliated with the CSCE. I have been constantly in touch with its chairman. The CSCE Minsk Group used to be headed by Mario Raffaelli. It is now headed by Mr. Jan Eliasson. I have held talks with Mr. Eliasson and his delegations in Azerbaijan several times. I have explained Azerbaijan's position to them for hours and days. Yes, I have worked to have the CSCE play the main role in the effort made to resolve the dispute. I will continue to work in that direction in the future. Mr. Eliasson recently visited Azerbaijan. We held talks and agreed that the CSCE should make initiatives for a cease-fire. We also agreed that measures should be taken later for the signing of a cease-fire agreement to end the war. Naturally, Mr. Eliasson also cooperates with Armenia and Russia. He disclosed in our latest talks that the problem should be resolved within the CSCE framework. However, he also said that Russia should play a special role. That was his proposal. I wish to inform you that Russia has made an effort to mediate for the solution of the problem. We have not objected to that. On the contrary, we have tried to benefit from that approach. We have to use each and every opportunity. So, we have approved the joint effort by the CSCE and Russia. That was proposed by the CSCE. It was proposed by Jan Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group. Meanwhile, we have taken a step to promote our work in the international community. You are aware of the existence of NATO. [passage omitted] The heads of state in that organization convened in Brussels and approved a program to create the conditions required by the former Warsaw Pact countries, which have now become independent, to join NATO. They adopted the program on partnership for peace and disclosed that the countries that have recently become independent may join it. We considered the matter and decided that Azerbaijan will strengthen its position in the world if it joins that program. Therefore, we made a decision and I traveled to Brussels, which hosts NATO Headquarters. I addressed a meeting in that headquarters and disclosed that Azerbaijan is prepared to join the program on partnership for peace. In fact, I signed that program. Four CIS countries have signed that program; Azerbaijan is the fourth. The remaining CIS members have not signed it. I am convinced that Azerbaijan's decision to sign that program was right politically and diplomatically. Furthermore, it was a daring step. I was informed by a CSCE representative in Brussels that Russia and the CIS must join the effort that is made to resolve the Daghlyk Karabakh dispute and find a peaceful way to end the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. He said that the CSCE believes that it must carry out joint work with Russia and the CIS. I responded by saying that we shall support that approach, since the CSCE is in favor of it. The important thing to us is to end the war. Azerbaijan will not object to a CSCE move to cooperate with a foreign country to end the war. So, a new formula was drawn up. Jan Eliasson arrived in Baku on the basis of that formula on 13 May. He presented a draft agreement for a cease-fire. The draft also called for the consolidation of the cease-fire regime. We had made several initiatives for a cease-fire. For example, we proposed a cease-fire through Russia's mediation on 28 April. However, Armenia objected to it. Later, we maintained our initiatives for the same purpose. They, too, were rejected by Armenia. The interparliamentary assembly convened in Bishkek on 5 May. The Daghlyk Karabakh dispute was discussed in that convocation. Afiyettin Dzhelilov headed Azerbaijan's delegation to that meeting. We gave instructions to him on various issues. We informed him that we had to attend that meeting and hold talks with the other participants. However, we instructed him that Azerbaijan must not sign any document without the approval of its president. We dispatched Dzhelilov to Bishkek with that instruction. He acted accordingly. A document was placed on the table. He said that he was not able to sign it. Later, we studied the document. It contained a provision for a cease-fire. Consequently, he decided that Azerbaijan should sign it. Chairman of the National Assembly Rasul Guliyev signed the document with our approval on 8 May. A cease-fire began on 10 May. Exchanges of fire have not taken place since that day. The objective of Azerbaijan signing the Bishkek protocol was to have a cease-fire. We have achieved our objective. That was the right thing to do. Meanwhile, we held talks with Jan Eliasson. He submitted a draft document for the consolidation of the cease-fire regime on 13 May. We were satisfied with it and we suggested that he should consult with Armenia. He visited Armenia. The Armenian officials made some changes in the draft document in accordance with their views. Eliasson returned to Baku on 16 May. The defense ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia held a meeting in Moscow at the time. Yes, an initiative was made for such a meeting and we had agreed to it. I wish to reiterate that we have tried to use every opportunity. The defense ministers met in Moscow for two or three days. Russia's defense minister held a press conference on 16 May. He disclosed without Azerbaijan's approval that Russia's peacekeeping forces will be deployed as observers in areas between Azerbaijan and Armenia. He also disclosed that a few battalions, that is, some 1,800 men, will be dispatched to the region. Later, he urged Azerbaijan to sign a protocol on that matter. However, considering that such a protocol would be inappropriate for Azerbaijan, I instructed the Republic's defense minister not to sign it and to immediately return to Baku. Jan Eliasson was in Baku at the time. He was briefed on that matter. We agreed to his draft document and he returned to Yerevan. The officials in Armenia refrained from signing the document Jan Eliasson brought to us from Yerevan. So, that confirmed that Azerbaijan supports peace and wishes to end the war. It also was an indication that confirmed Azerbaijan's wish to resolve the dispute through international organizations and Russia. However, Armenia has exposed itself. It has confirmed that it does not wish to end the war. Later, Jan Eliasson returned to Vienna. He is continuing his work. Meanwhile, we summoned the Republic's defense minister from Moscow. We also disclosed that we could not sign that protocol. I wish to inform you that the CSCE, the Minsk Group, and Jan Eliasson are in close contact with Russia. They wish to maintain their cooperation. That is all that I can say on the developments. I wish to draw your attention to the fact that exchanges of fire have not taken place since 10 May. I believe that this is a positive development for Azerbaijan. Our military forces heroically fought during the past few months. However, we have had many casualties. I wish to clearly say that there have been days when we had 50 martyrs in one place alone. Azerbaijan's officers have died together with their troops. They fought to defend our territories. The Armenians planned to occupy Terter by 1 May. They also planned to occupy Barda later. Their plans were foiled because our military forces steadfastly maintained their positions. The Armenians have other plans too. However, you must realize that Armenia is not waging war by itself; you are well-aware of that. No, Armenia is not waging the war by itself. You are well-aware of the countries and forces that support it. Had it only been Armenia, Azerbaijan's military forces would have evicted them from the republic's territory, even though our forces are not yet at full strength. However, that is connected with international politics. We are unable to influence the policies of certain forces and countries in the world, who act as they please. Therefore, we have to maintain a wide-ranging policy, and we need experience and information in order to be able to do so. We have to analyze and draw conclusions. I am convinced that you believe that we are capable of doing so. As president, I occupy myself with all those matters round the clock. Regardless of all that and at a time when our republic is working in various directions, certain internal forces continue to try to create discord among us. I am confident that the people do not believe them. I am aware that the people trust me. Some 7 million people in Azerbaijan trusted me and elected me president. I rely on the people's support. I rely on your support. I rely on the support of the people of Azerbaijan. Why have I said all this? In an effort to create discord in the republic, some individuals have recently claimed that Azerbaijan's leaders are making the wrong moves. What does that mean? I have already explained the developments related to the Bishkek protocol. On 18 May, a group of deputies in the National Assembly--they were Etibar Mamedov, several deputies from the Azerbaijan People's Front, and a few others who always vacillate on way and the other. [shouts against the Azerbaijan People's Front from the audience] Please be calm. I can see that you, too, have many things to say. I am addressing you at this moment. I wish to express my views. Later, I will give the floor to anyone who wishes to speak. Yes, they demanded that the National Assembly place the Bishkek Protocol on its agenda. There is nothing to debate in the Bishkek Protocol. The main objective of that protocol is to effect a cease-fire. Their actions indicate that they do not wish to see a cease-fire imposed. They want people to be killed. This matter was debated; I attended that session. We voted on the matter. The parliament has its rules. Their motion did not pass. The Bishkek Protocol was not placed on the agenda; then a recess was called. Some 15 deputies presented an ultimatum and walked out when the National Assembly reconvened. The remaining members of the National Assembly, who were in the majority, issued a statement against them. The walkout by the deputies conflicts with the ethics and experience of a respected parliament. It confirms that their cultural levels are not high enough. Obviously, they have used uncivilized ways and means to achieve their goals thus far. As president, I condemn their actions. I am confident that the people will support me. I urge them to refrain from lawlessness. However, the matter does not end there. I could have decided not to mention these matters, but I feel obliged to do so. Later, Etibar Mamedov held a meeting in the building which houses his political party with a few inefficient individuals who supposedly represent the Azerbaijan People's Front and the Karabakh Liberation Movement. Have you heard about that movement? Let the members of that movement go to fight in Karabakh. They should not create such a state of affairs for the people. We have a political party which is known as Bozkurt [Gray Wolf]. It is led by Iskendar Khamidov. He and several others have issued a statement, which is disgusting and unjust and which conflicts with our present day national interests. It is full of lies and calumnies. It claims that Russian military units have arrived in Azerbaijan and that we wish to have them defend our republic. No Russian military units have been deployed in Azerbaijan. The people must not be misled. I have explained the measures we have taken during the past few months. The television network will further inform the people on what I have outlined. No Russian military units have arrived in Azerbaijan. The people must not be misled. Furthermore, if they are opposed to the measures that have been taken by the government, then they should hold talks with the officials. Azerbaijan is an independent country. Its president has been elected by the people. The people hate secret meetings that are held in dark rooms to draw up plots. Those are lawless activities, which no one can tolerate. They met again yesterday to draw up a policy for national resistance. They disclosed that they will hold a large meeting. What kind of a meeting will that be? Who is to organize it? Yes, they are Etibar Mamedov, Iskendar Khamidov, Tofik Gasumov, Isa Kamberov, Ibragim Ibragimov, and several other people like them. They established a committee yesterday and urged the people to attend the meeting they will organize. Undoubtedly, the people will not allow them to hold such a meeting. The state laws will be enforced if they act in a lawless way. Each and every one of them will be penalized accordingly. I wish to make that clear. [applause] Regarding the movement that has been established by those individuals, I believe that it conflicts with Azerbaijan's national interests. [Shouts of "Treachery"] Yes, I regard it as an act of treachery. Thank God that an administration exists in Azerbaijan. Thank God that Azerbaijan has a president and state organs. However, a handful of individuals in the streets ignore them and claim that they themselves wish to defend Azerbaijan's people. The people have entrusted the president they elected with the duty of defending them. The president is the guarantor of the people's security in Azerbaijan. He guarantees the people's rights and protects the republic's territory. [applause] Who has authorized those individuals to assume those responsibilities? Who are they? You are well-aware that I do not wish to say anything about them, because I do not wish to lower myself to their level. The people are already aware of their situation; but I do not wish to lower myself to their level. If they wish to improve their situation, then they will have to do the right work for 10 or 15 years. None of them have any experience in any field. They have gathered together from here and there and from the streets. [passage indistinct] We have opened the door to democracy. Political parties have been established. More than 40 political parties have registered in Azerbaijan. The newspapers publish whatever they wish. They published [words indistinct] and calumnies. In view of democracy and pluralism in politics, I have not objected to all that. Nor will I do so in the future. However, I will not allow any calumny or activity aimed at misleading the people and encouraging them to commit crimes. I wish to inform everyone in that regard. [applause] I have respected Etibar Mamedov. However, I can see that several of you do not like him. Nevertheless, I have respected him because he has carried out political work to a certain extent. I hope that he will hear and understand what I am going to say now. He must assess my respect for him. There is no reason for him to maintain the claims he has made. [applause] Etibar Mamedov has had only one objective in mind for the past three or four years: He only wished to come to power. Well, he was a candidate in the presidential elections, along with Abulfaz Elchibey, Nizami Suleymanov, and several others. He would have come to power if he had secured the people's support. He was not elected; Elchibey was elected instead. Etibar Mamedov moved against him. Later, Elchibey abandoned his post. I tried to convince Mamedov to work together with me. I invited him, asked him to serve as the republic's foreign minister. He refused, saying that the post was not good enough for him. I asked him to serve as the state secretary. He did not agree to that either. [passage omitted] Etibar Mamedov and Iskendar Khamidov have an agreement to wage a struggle against the government now. Who is Iskendar Khamidov? That state of affairs is very disgusting for Azerbaijan. There is no reason at all for it. Khamidov established the party known as Bozkurt. What kind of a party is it and where does it find the funds it needs? Khamidov disseminated unfounded reports; he committed many crimes in the past. He has now moved to organize a meeting. Regarding Isa Kamberov, he got himself appointed chairman of the Azerbaijan Supreme Soviet in one way or another. God knows whether he got that post through fraud or otherwise. He was expected to serve the country, but he abandoned his post. He resigned on 11 [month indistinct], saying that he was unable to work. Why was he unable to work? Well, they had brought Azerbaijan to the verge of civil war. A civil war broke out in Azerbaijan. The republic was about to split up. Certain groups took action in Ganja, Lenkoran, and Baku. The process of fragmentation had begun. Kamberov, who was responsible for creating that state of affairs, urged me for three hours to travel to Baku to end that state of affairs in the republic. [passage indistinct]
