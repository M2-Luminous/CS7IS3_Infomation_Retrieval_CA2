This has great significance for improving the management of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. All localities should make positive efforts to seek new ways to effectively practice the public ownership system and should study the state economy's microeconomic organizational forms under socialist market economic conditions. From 12 to 20 April, Li Tieying conducted investigations and studies in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Huizhou, Foshan, and Zhanjiang cities on how to experiment with establishing a modern enterprise system. He heard reports by concerned departments of provincial and city authorities on enterprise reform; inspected some enterprises; and held a special meeting attended by comrades in charge of Guangdong Province and various cities, secretaries of party committees of concerned departments, and factory directors (managers) of some enterprises, to seek their opinions. The central authorities' various macroeconomic reform measures are being smoothly implemented in Guangdong, and the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee and government have done a great deal to implement these measures. Compared with the same period last year, the value of the province's sold industrial products increased 18.6 percent in the first quarter of this year, financial revenue increased 48.8 percent, total retail sales of consumer products increased 33 percent, and total exports increased 96.1 percent. Li Tieying held that Guangdong's economic situation was good. He said: Although some practical difficulties and problems have cropped up in the course of development, most of them are just problems pertaining to development -- they are temporary. The central authorities are currently taking measures to solve some of these problems that are common in all localities. Guangdong has placed great importance on enterprise reform. All the cities I have visited have seriously studied and boldly practiced enterprise reform measures. They have conducted a great deal of studies on reform of the property right system, social insurance system, and enterprises' three systems [labor, personnel, and wage distribution system] as well as on preserving and increasing the value of state assets, and on improving and injecting new vitality into enterprise management. Li Tieying pointed out: Enterprises experimenting with establishing a modern enterprise system should primarily study ways to improve the enterprise legal person system; decide the main investment channels for enterprises' state assets; decide enterprises' legal person organizational form; establish a scientific enterprise management structure; reform the enterprise labor and personnel system; improve the enterprise financial and accounting system; enable party organizations of enterprises to serve as a political nucleus; and improve enterprises' trade union work and democratic management by workers. In addition, they should study ways to establish a macroeconomic regulation and control system, social insurance system, unified market system, and socialized service system in line with the market economy, in order to organically integrate macroeconomic reform with enterprises' microeconomic reform. Li Tieying stressed: We should strengthen leadership over the work on experimenting with establishing a modern enterprise system, and should establish a responsibility system for carrying out the work. Major comrades in charge of concerned localities and departments should personally take charge of the work of the 100 enterprises selected to experiment with establishing a modern enterprise system under the State Council's guidance; well-trained personnel should be assigned to assume specific responsibilities. All responsibilities should be affixed to individuals in charge, and they should ensure that work is carried out in a down-to-earth manner. Li Tieying said: The term "modern enterprise system" is a general term for an enterprise system in which enterprises' property rights, powers, and responsibility are clearly defined; government administration is separated from enterprise management; and scientific enterprise management is practiced. A modern enterprise system may be implemented in various specific forms. All localities should act in light of their local conditions, proceed from the actual situation, and make use of beneficial experiences from abroad while exploring new ways to establish a modern enterprise system. As reform continues to deepen, we should continue to change the way we think, and must not be bound by our current understanding of things, which may impede our efforts to deepen reform. Li Tieying added: In experimenting with establishing a modern enterprise system, we should step up investigation and study work, and sum up experience regularly. Experimental work should be carried out steadily and in an active and down-to-earth manner -- we must not rush headlong into mass action or do work just for form's sake. Currently, we are experimenting with establishing a modern enterprise system; we should endeavor to achieve some results. This is not the time to promote the system in all enterprises. The term "modern enterprise system" is scientifically defined; we should not regard the system as a basket and throw everything into it because this will tarnish the system's reputation. For enterprises experimenting with establishing a modern enterprise system, we should do a good fundamental job -- we should transform their operating mechanisms; improve their internal management; improve their efficiency; improve their profitability; and carry out the various economic policies and macroeconomic regulation, control, and reform measures adopted by the central authorities, in order to lay a good foundation for the next-step reform.
