Our colleague Zeljko Rajic met them on their arrival. We would like to warn you that the footage that we are broadcasting now has not been edited: [Tudjman] I think that this was the most important document since UN Security Council Resolution 871, because according to it Yugoslavia, i.e. Serbia and Montenegro, have recognized the Republic of Croatia within its borders. Although it has not been clearly said, the formal declaration refers to the UN Charter and the basic CSCE documents which set out precisely that; relations between states are based on mutual recognition and the declaration itself expressly says that this is the first step in the establishment of both diplomatic relations and normalization [as heard] and establishment of interstate relations, and in the normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations in their entirety, which means that the Serbs in Croatia, by this official declaration by Belgrade, are called on to regulate their relations with the Croatian Government in the Republic of Croatia. This is a victory for our policy which is in line with requirements set by the international community, with the European Union [EU] requirements and those set by the UN Security Council -- that political means should be used to resolve the problem of Croatia's UN-protected areas, which are actually under Serb occupation; this occupation, as we know, came as a result of their being supplied in every sense, both with weapons and troops from Serbia. Official Belgrade has now given up this forceful policy and declared itself in favor of political normalization of the overall relations, and consequently has given up the Serbs in Croatia. This is of paramount importance. After we had signed it, I had a feeling of having achieved a great victory. We will not have to suffer fresh casualties to liberate Croatian territories. In the very near future we will be able to direct our efforts into building our country in the economic and cultural sense. This very act which is of great significance must influence the restoration of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is not as yet certain, as I said in the beginning because the Muslim side has continued putting forward fresh conditions and because there is no accord there when it comes to important issues. As far as the conference is concerned, I likewise have to say that within the conference we, on our part, offered a new proposal to the Muslims for the regulation of mutual relations, for the establishment of real friendship, for the cessation of fighting between the Muslims and Croats, for halting the Muslim offensive against the Croat areas in central Bosnia. The Muslims openly demanded in the course of the negotiations that Croatian Defense Council [HVO] forces pull out from central Bosnia, that is, from Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovaca, Kiseljak, Kresevo etc. Therefore, they made it clear in the talks that they wish these territories to become part of the Muslim republic, they tried to back this with all kinds of excuses and reasons -- all unacceptable to us from the standpoint of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the strategic interests of the Croatian state. We presented our proposal to the Muslims and they gave us their paper, their proposal. We have not even started coordinating our views -- the Muslims believe war is inevitable, they even believe that war between the Croats and the Serbs in Croatia is an inevitability and that the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina could hardly be resolved without war. However, this evening, prior to take off and our departure for Zagreb, we held individual talks -- Deputy Prime Minister Granic met with Silajdzic, I had a tete-a-tete with Izetbegovic. We tried to agree on the need to establish peace between the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, to stop the bloodshed and seek a basis for lasting cooperation to the benefit of both peoples. We agreed to continue these talks and we hope they will finally produce some results. We [Croatia and Yugoslavia] signed a declaration and the representatives of Herceg-Bosna and the republic of Srpska also signed a joint declaration on the cessation of hostilities and the opening of missions. All three sides agreed on the establishment of hot lines to prevent the conflict from spreading. I should also say that we agreed in this declaration on the opening of offices -- an office of the Republic of Croatia in Belgrade and an official office, a bureau or whatever, of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Zagreb. This is a way to establish normal diplomatic relations, to achieve diplomatic recognition. I remembered in this context that, following the Second World War, when relations between two superpowers -- the United States and China -- were frozen, such offices were opened after Kissinger's trip to China. Therefore, this is an extremely important development. [Tudjman] Let me say this: Some of our people may ask themselves: What does this mean now, establishing diplomatic relations with Belgrade? Is this a way to return back to Yugoslavia or back to Belgrade? I want to make this clear to everyone: This is recognition of sovereign Croatia. This is a possibility to incorporate peacefully, without casualties and new destruction, all those Croatian areas which are currently occupied or under UN protection into the constitutional and the legal system of the Republic of Croatia. This will not be easy but we have made an important step by initiating this kind of resolution. From this aspect it was a success of our policy, our reputation in the world, our power and friendship that we enjoy from the international factors that helped us [as heard]. Not only did the Russian representative but also representatives of other European states supported this declaration. Therefore, this is how one should assess this truly important event in our recent political reality. [Reporter] Mr. president, could you describe the role of peace negotiators and the pressure by the international community via the WEU [Western European Union], NATO, and other officials? Did they exert any influence on the two-day talks in Geneva? [Tudjman] They have influenced the overall talks. They did not have a direct influence on the declaration on the normalization of Serb-Croat relations but they supported this initiative. Russia particularly supported the initiative, which is very important because it means that the main ally of Serbia or Yugoslavia is recommending this. This is also a guarantee that the declaration will be implemented. Some people at the conference had their doubts but it is clear that Serbia, Yugoslavia, and Belgrade found their interest in signing such an agreement; the situation in which they are, bearing in mind the embargo, the sanctions. The international public has accepted this declaration with general approval.
