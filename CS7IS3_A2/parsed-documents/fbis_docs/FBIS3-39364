The new basic party program advocates an "ecological and social market economy." The party's new basic program will realize and update the existing basic program, adopted at the Ludwigshafen party conference in 1978. The party conference submission commission rejected proposals by the Christian-Social workers and several land organizations that had spoken out against expanding the term "social market economy" to read "ecological and social market economy." The ecological extension of the social market economy is one of the most important innovations the basic program has seen. The draft program that the delegates have been recommended to adopt says that the CDU wants to step up the use of market economy instruments and control mechanisms in order to achieve a more gentle treatment of nature and the environment. The objective of the ecological and social market economy is combining economy, social justice, and ecology. The CDU considers the principles of polluter and precaution the basis of an ecological order. It calls for a system where producers and consumers meet the costs resulting from their failures in environmental precaution and from using the environment. This can only be guaranteed if the costs result in honest prices. With this, the CDU wants to stimulate and encourage people to be gentle on the environment. Ecology in Tax Law Based on the individual's responsibility in the ecological and social market economy, the CDU speaks out on using all cooperation opportunities before implementing government regulations. But it leaves no doubt that ecological regulations with legal orders and prohibitions, critical values, requirements, and licensing procedures are necessary to efficiently tackle the immediate danger to humans and the environment. But in order to increasingly use industry's efficiency and innovativeness to serve the environment, the CDU wants to increase the use of ecological control elements in the tax law, environmental fees, compensation regulations, and liability rules. The CDU basic program also reflects the intensive debate on Germany as a business location. The draft program says that as a country with a scarce supply of raw materials and high labor costs, Germany relies heavily on the efficiency and innovativeness of its people and industry. "With our capacity to achieve the top results we have to concentrate on top quality products and production methods. The cycles of technological progress are becoming ever shorter, requiring a speeding up of innovations." Strengthening Business Location Germany For this reason, Germany's competitiveness as a business location depends very much on high standards in research and development, as well as the use of new technologies such as biological and genetic engineering, information and environmental technologies. Environment-friendly products and technologies will be very important in the future. "By further developing our economy to become an ecological and social market economy we can both strengthen our leading role in the field of environmental technologies and secure an important advantage for the future." In order to strengthen Germany standing as a business location, the CDU suggests: -- Decreasing the public share and cutting taxes and fees; -- Improving education and vocational training, science and research, and its infrastructure; -- Promoting future-oriented technologies and environmental protection; -- Privatizing and cutting subsidies; -- Deregulating and decreasing bureaucratic regulations and requirements, and speeding up licensing procedures; -- Introducing more flexible working hours and longer machine-operating hours; -- Improving information and transport infrastructures; -- In particular, securing social peace and social partnership. The program turns against protectionism. It says that Germany as an export-oriented industrial nation depends on free trade. Protectionism blocks the dynamics of the economy and prevents innovation. The consequences of reunification are mainly described in the basic program's chapters on fiscal and financial policy. These chapters say that the framework conditions of financial policy changed drastically for a longer period of time following reunification. "In order to promote the growing together of Germany at a high speed, we have had to put up with higher public debts, an increase in the public share, taxes and public expenditure for a certain period of time. This must, however, be followed by reducing indebtedness, consolidating all public households, reducing the public share in the gross national product, and easing the tax burden in the medium term." The draft says that a reduction of the public share with consolidated public households is the yardstick for all fiscal policy decisions. The CDU wants to create the conditions for reducing debt by redefining public tasks. "We will have to redefine priorities in the public services, what the state and social insurance systems can do, which public services can be controlled via market relations, and which services we will have to cut." The CDU considers structural changes and shifts, cuts in spending, and higher efficiency necessary. "By deregulating, cutting bureaucracy, and privatizing we want to make public services more efficient and cost-effective." The CDU wants to increase the share of public tasks that are financed by special funds, such as prices and fees, and co-insurance. Also, it calls for a comprehensive cut in subsidies. Subsidies should be limited in time and be digressive. In order to increase clarity and justice, and to simplify administration procedures, the CDU wants to link the tax system and social benefits that are not based on contributions. Tax Burden To Be Cut In the medium term, the CDU wants to reduce the overall tax burden and restructure the tax system. The draft program says that the direct tax burden on productive factors such as capital and labor is too high. "We want lower direct tax rates, but a broad tax base with less concessions and exemptions." This is, at the same time, a simplification, and thus increases tax equity. The CDU says that it will have to increase taxes on consumption, especially energy consumption and environmental fees. "By restructuring the tax system along economic and ecological lines, we are setting the course for further development of the ecological and social market economy." In terms of taxes, real capital must not be at a disadvantage in relation to financing capital. The CDU wants to cut nonprofit-linked taxes and to speed up the harmonization of taxes within the European Union.
