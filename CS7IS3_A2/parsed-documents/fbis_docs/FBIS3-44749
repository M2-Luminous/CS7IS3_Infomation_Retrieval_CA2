Tianjin University recently developed the high-tech machine tool to make the bit, after decades in which this sophisticated cutter had been hand-made. The machine tool developed by the university in north China's Tianjin city is among the most advanced ones in the world. It can make a bit that has different irregularly shaped blades. According to a university official, the highly efficient bit has been widely used in machine-making industry in the world. Ni was then elected a model worker because of his invention, and later became the head of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU). The official said that though the bit has been updated with different models in the past decades, the fact that it had to be hand-made caused problems in assuring uniform standards of quality. The newly developed automatic machine tool has solved the problem. It uses a computer to control the making of bits.
