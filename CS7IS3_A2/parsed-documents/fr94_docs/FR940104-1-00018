FR940104-1-00018 FR940104-1-00004 The Commission also is proposing to eliminate the requirement, in current §250.16(g)(1), that pipelines maintain and make available to the public (at the pipelines' offices and through the mail) the tariff information they file with the Commission. This provision merely duplicates existing provisions. Section 4(c) of the Natural Gas Act requires pipeline tariff information to be publicly available and the Commission's regulations already require that the information be made available at the pipelines' offices as well as through the mail. 14 14 15 U.S.C. 717c(c) (1988); 18 CFR 154.16, 154.22. 3. Reporting Transportation Transactions Current §250.16(b)(2) requires pipelines to file with the Commission a transportation log reporting a variety of information related to affiliate transactions, and §250.16(c) requires pipelines to maintain the same information for nonaffiliate transactions. The Commission is proposing to reduce the amount of information that must be maintained and to clarify the filing requirements in light of the requirement, promulgated in Order No. 497&hyph;D, that pipelines post the information on their EBBs in lieu of filing it with the Commission. 15 15 Order No. 497&hyph;D, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles at 30,737; 18 CFR 250.16(d)(1). a. Information requirements. The Commission is proposing to eliminate the requirement that pipelines maintain information relating to firm transportation under §250.16. As a result of Order No. 636, the posting and awarding of firm service, including the reservation charge for that service, will be conducted through, and reported on, the pipelines' EBBs. 16 Since all the details regarding an affiliate's or other shipper's acquisition of firm service will be on the EBB, a similar posting requirement for affiliate information under §250.16 appears unnecessary. 17 16 18 CFR 284.8(b)(3), 284.8(b)(4); Order No. 636, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles at 30,419&hyph;20. 17 The Commission recognizes that pipelines may offer firm shippers discounts on the reservation charge after the capacity is awarded and also may discount the firm usage charge. But the Commission does not deem the potential for such discounting sufficient to warrant the continuation of the reporting requirements under §250.16. Such discounting has not proven to have been extensive in the past. Moreover, information on any firm discounts that pipelines do provide affiliates will be available on pipeline EBBs under former standard I and under the Commission's Part 284 discount reporting requirements, although without as much detail as required by §250.16. See 18 CFR 161.3(i)(revised §161.3(h)); 18 CFR .8(b)(4)(v) (requiring standards of conduct information to be posted on EBBs); 18 CFR 284.7(d)(5)(4). In addition, the Commission's adoption of straight-fixed-variable (SFV) rate design in Order No. 636 virtually eliminates the pipelines' ability to discount the firm usage rate as well as the impact of any discounts if they did occur. Under SFV, the usage rate reflects only variable costs (and applicable volumetric surcharges), and pipelines cannot discount below variable cost. For interruptible transportation, however, the EBBs will not provide the relevant discount information, because, unlike firm service, the EBBs will not be used to allocate interruptible capacity or establish a shipper's rate for interruptible service. 18 The allocation of interruptible transportation and the rate for individual transactions usually takes place during the pipelines' monthly and daily nomination and scheduling process. Accordingly, the Commission is retaining the current requirement to maintain and post information for discounts on interruptible service (proposed §250.16(c)). 18 Order No. 636 only required pipelines to post their available interruptible capacity on their EBBs, but it did not mandate that the awarding of interruptible capacity take place on the EBBs. 18 CFR 284.9(b)(3). The Commission is proposing to eliminate a number of reporting requirements relating to requests for interruptible service. 19 The Commission's experience in administering Order No. 497 is that the most important information for monitoring potential undue discrimination is the discount information for individual transactions. Once that information is known, the Commission can obtain information regarding the transportation request during an investigation if it is needed. Indeed, some of the information on the request, such as the extent of affiliation between pipelines and suppliers or shippers, would appear to be well known to the parties transacting business on the pipelines and should not need to be posted. 20 19 The Commission is proposing to eliminate current §§250.16(b)(2)(ii), (iii), (v), (vi), (xiv), (xv), (xvii). 20 For the same reason, the Commission is proposing to eliminate the reporting of corporate affiliation in the discount reporting requirement under current §250.16(b)(2)(xix).
