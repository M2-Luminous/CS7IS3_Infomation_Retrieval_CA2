Criminal Proceedings Instituted Against Deputy Chief of Russian MVD Main Administration for Criminal Investigations"] [Excerpts] In issue No. 85 of 6 May IZVESTIYA gave an account of investigation "maneuvers" concerning Major General Igor Shilov, deputy chief of the Russian Federation MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Main Administration for Criminal Investigations. Today we publish what we have managed to find out about this sensitive affair from the Moscow Regional Administration for Organized Crime, the capital's prosecutor's office, and the Moscow Internal Affairs Main Administration Investigation Department. According to reports from representatives of these three departments, the scandal started with a completely run-of-the-mill operation whereby members of the organized crime subdivision "grilled" a certain citizen Korneyev on suspicion of illegal activity. [passage omitted] So far the criminal proceedings against Shilov, like the other militia officers, have been brought under Article 218 of the Russian Criminal Code for illegal possession of weapons. The investigation apparently has evidence directly against the country's number two detective that he received a television and video recorder, a fountain pen with a gold nib, and the promise of a car at a cheap price from Korneyev in the form of bribes. But staffers of the Moscow Regional Administration for Organized Crime and of the capital's prosecutor's office are letting it be known that they possess information about much more serious transgressions by the deputy chief of the Criminal Investigation Main Administration and other militia staffers who have come to their notice. But it can be publicized only after the investigation has finished. The editorial office has learned that Shilov, who has spent 36 years working in the criminal investigation system, categorically denies all the accusations being made against him. Judging from his statements, the country's number two detective sees all the recent events as a carefully prepared provocation aimed directly against the entire criminal investigation department. The mafia is trying to remove him using the Moscow Regional Administration for Organized Crime with the help of agent-informer Korneyev. It has been learned that Shilov is confident that given an independent investigation all the accusations made against him, like those against most militia officers who have fallen out of favor with him, will totally collapse. One way or another Moscow City Prosecutor's Office (which is now handling this sensational case) will have an extremely hard time. Irrespective of the reality of the case's criminal basis and even of the evidence gathered it has already become political, and will undoubtedly play its role in the conflict of various interests both within the MVD itself and outside it. A major case of corruption in the militia's ranks could to some extent encourage the MVD's future to be decided on the pattern of its "big brother" -- the Security Ministry, whereby the ultrapowerful department is split up into several structures which are independent of each other: the Russian Administration for Administering Punishment, Internal Troops, etc. The Main Administration for Organized Crime would then become something akin to the American FBI. The future of the Main Administrations for Criminal Investigation and Economic Crimes looks more complex under this scenario. Separately or together they could be turned into federal departments or, by handing over some of their functions to the Main Administration for Organized Crime, they could be retained only at city or oblast level. But according to a different opinion the Russian MVD itself has nothing terrible to fear, nobody is going to alter it. But enemies of the current internal affairs minister will try to exploit the furor over the "Shilov case" and other similar cases in order to remove Viktor Yerin from his post.... We will very soon find out how events are going to develop further.
