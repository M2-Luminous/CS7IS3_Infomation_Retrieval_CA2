If Marben Software Engineering firm (specialized in real time computing and telecommunications)--consolidated since last July--is also figured in, total business turnover comes to 3.81 billion French francs [Fr]. Next to a constant size and rate of change this growth can be considered practically as being equal to zero (+0.4 percent). On the contrary, the net profit has diminished by 7.1 percent (Fr160.6 million against Fr172.8 million in 1992). According to Sligos' CEO, Henri Pascaud, the successor of Gerard Bauvin--presently presiding over Clio, a holding of Credit Lyonnais charged with managing the bank's participation in the computer field: "The engineering (segment), which represents 35 percent of our business turnover, has decreased by 2 percent." The finances, the second greatest component in Sligos' income (35 percent of the total), has recorded a 6.5-percent growth. The means of payment activity, fueled by orders for memory cards and by check processing, has recorded a boom of 19.4 percent (Fr528 million). For 1994, Henri Pascaud does not predict any strong growth, unless Sligos gets new acquisitions.
