FR940302-2-00070 FR940302-2-00051 INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY AND WATER COMMISSION United States_Mexico Joint Project for Immediate Emergency Removal of Sediment in the Lower Colorado River in Mexico, Morelos Dam to the Northerly International Boundary_Finding of No Significant Impact agency: United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico. action: Notice of Finding of No Significant Impact. summary: Based on a revised draft environmental assessment, the United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico (USIBWC), finds that the proposed action that the United States Government and the Government of Mexico engage in a joint project for immediate emergency removal of sediment in the lower Colorado River in Mexico from Morelos Dam to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) is not a major federal action that would have a significant adverse effect on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality Final Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508); and the USIBWC's Operational Procedures for Implementing Section 102 of NEPA, published in the Federal Register September 2, 1981 (46 FR 44083&hyph;44094); the USIBWC hereby gives notice that an environmental impact statement will not be prepared for the proposed project. addresses: Mr. M.R. Ybarra, United States Section Secretary; United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico, 4171 North Mesa Street, C&hyph;310, El Paso, Texas 79902. Telephone: 915/534&hyph;6698. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Proposed Action The action proposed is for the United States Government and the Government of Mexico to engage in a joint project to remove sediment in the lower Colorado River in Mexico from Morelos Dam to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB). The need for the project arises from extraordinary winter storm runoff in 1993 in the Gila River basin which resulted in the filling and spilling of Painted Rock Dam, located some 116 miles (187 kilometers) upstream of the Gila River's confluence with the Colorado River. The sustained high flows carried a large sediment load, causing dangerous accumulations in the international boundary segment of the Colorado River. The sediment removal is necessary to provide immediate flood control relief in the vicinity of Morelos Dam and to enable Mexico to receive full deliveries of their 1944 Treaty waters. All sediment removal activities will be conducted in Mexico. Alternatives Considered Three alternatives, including the No Action Alternative and the Proposed Action Alternative, were considered: The No Action Alternative would result in accumulated sediment not being removed from the lower Colorado River in the vicinity of Morelos Dam. Mexico would not be able to divert full domestic and irrigation allotments. Serious impacts to human health could result from an absence of an adequate domestic water supply. Sediment accumulation in the Morelos Dam system would increase flood stage elevations. The United States would not be acting in furtherance of the 1944 Water Treaty requirement to recommend and carry out flood control activities and the 1970 Boundary Treaty requirements for boundary preservation. The Proposed Action Alternative is a joint United States/Mexico emergency project to remove sediment upstream of the Morelos Dam flood control gates for a distance yet to be determined, but no further upstream than the NIB, and downstream of the Morelos Dam intake gates. The IBWC, on behalf of the United States and Mexico, would coordinate the work utilizing, as authorized in the 1944 Water Treaty, the resources of the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), and the Mexican National Water Commission.
