FBIS4-54149 "dreas102_m_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-102 Daily Report 26 May 1994 Thailand USIS Accused of Colluding With Government USIS Accused of Colluding With Government BK2605045894 Bangkok THE NATION in English 26 May 94 pp A1, A4 BK2605045894 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Opposition lawmakers on the House committee monitoring MPs' conduct yesterday accused the United States Information Service (USIS) of acting in collusion with the Thai Foreign Ministry to smear the name of Chat Phatthana MP Mongkhon Chongsutthanamani. According to USIS, the US Embassy in Bangkok on March 18 rejected Mongkhon's application for a US entry visa on the grounds that he was suspected of involvement in drug trafficking by US law enforcement authorities. "Everybody on the House committee on parliamentary affairs agreed that USIS was apparently in great haste and gave confusing statements regarding the rejection of Mongkhon's visa application," said MP Phairot Suwanchawi (Chat Phatthana-Nakhon Ratchasima). Phairot, a member of the House committee, claimed that the US Embassy informed Mongkhon that it could not issue an entry visa to him because he had not submitted all necessary documentation on February 28. "The USIS statement said the US Embassy rejected his visa application on March 18. How can the embassy reject the visa application on March 18 when Mongkhon did not re-submit his application at that time?" the Chat Phatthana MP said. There apparently was a misunderstanding on the part of opposition lawmakers as a copy of a notification dated Feb 28 issued by the US Embassy informed Mongkhon that he was ineligible at that time for the entry visa because his application was still "pending necessary administrative processing". Therefore, it appears no irregularities were involved when, after consulting the US law enforcement authorities, the embassy on March 18 rejected Mongkhon's visa application on the grounds of suspected drug trafficking activities. Copies of the US Embassy notification, written in English, were given to reporters yesterday by some members of the House committee. Phairot said the House committee also decided that the government should devise measures to prevent people from accusing others of serious crimes without supplying evidence to back up the charges. He also said Mongkhon, who testified before the House committee without being summoned, announced that he was willing to travel to the United States if the US Embassy here arranged for his journey. "Khun Mongkhon said he was prepared to go to the United States even if he would be arrested by US authorities upon arrival," Phairot said. MP Witthaya Thianthong (Chat Thai-Sa Kaeo), also a member of the House committee, said USIS must have colluded with the Foreign Ministry to damage Mongkhon's reputation. "USIS must have been given a cue from the Foreign Ministry. The whole thing is politics between the coalition government and the opposition," Witthaya said. He acknowledged that some coalition government MPs on the House committee did not agree with the opposition lawmakers' theory. The House committee chairman, Charoen Khanthawong (Democrat-Bangkok), said the House committee did not make any decision as to what to do with Mongkhon's case. Charoen said opposition MPs on the panel claimed there were irregularities in the way USIS handled Mongkhon's case but several other members disagreed. "Some members claimed that USIS was interfering in Thai politics, while others disagreed," the chairman said. Charoen said the House committee had sought more information regarding Mongkhon's case from the US Embassy but was told that any request must go through the Foreign Ministry. The House committee has yet to conclude its investigation into the case of former MP Thanong Siriprichaphong (Chat Thai-Nakhon Phanom), who resigned from the Chat Thai Party last Saturday and who subsequently lost his House membership. Thanong has been charged in the United States with smuggling into that country more than 45 metric tons of marijuana between 1973- 1987. Thanong's assets in the United States -- a Beverly Hills house and a Mercedes Benz -- have been seized under a US court order.
