The FMLN activist was identified as Ismael Bernardino, and the incident took place early on Wednesday in the town of Nahuizalco, in western Sonsonate Department. FMLN spokeswoman Aida Sanchez explained that, according to preliminary reports in her possession, three individuals went to Bernardino's home and killed him. "The hooded individuals were carrying large caliber weapons," the relatives of the victim indicated. Sanchez stated the men tried to create the impression that it was a burglary but did not take anything from the house. It cannot be ruled out that a death squad killed Bernardino, who was fully participating in the political campaign, since these groups "are still active" in El Salvador, the spokeswoman stressed. Representative of the UN Observers for El Salvador went to the site to begin an investigation.
