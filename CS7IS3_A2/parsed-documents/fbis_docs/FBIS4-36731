Interviewed by Assane Diop and Dominique de Courcelles, he began by speaking of relations and cooperation between Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab world: [Dembri] We currently face the problems that are thrown up by the transition to a market economy and the bringing together of our potentialities in order to build up economic complementarity; this will ensure that, in the future, Africa and even the Arab world will be able to talk on an equal footing with the developed world. This is not just our own conclusion: The European Union, which is for us the closest pole of development, is pushing us toward economic integration. [Correspondent] As concerns bilateral relations between Algeria and some of its African neighbors, you have, in particular, intervened on the problem of the Tuareg refugees from Mali. You recently held a new series of meetings. Where at present do things stand on the return of the Malian refugees? Algeria is playing a major role in this issue, as most of the refugees are on Algerian territory. [Dembri] If you take the problem of displaced persons in Algeria, we do indeed have some 40,000 Malian refugees in the south of the country. We are trying to make their lives somewhat easier, as best we can, by contributing our own facilities, and also making use of aid from international organizations, from some countries also, including France, in order to make sure that these people do not feel completely abandoned. [Correspondent] Will you encourage their return, because we know that the program has been seriously delayed? [Dembri] Absolutely. There are always difficulties, which flow primarily from the primary difficulty, which is that of transport-- we are talking about enormous distances, arid or semi-arid regions; there is also the problem of the dispersion of these displaced persons. I think that we are trying to do something. [Correspondent] Algeria is currently weighed down by its internal problems, and in particular, by the security problem and the lack of dialogue between the government and the Islamic militants. What can Algeria expect from an OAU [Organization of African Unity] summit, and from other African nations as far as this problem is concerned? [Dembri] It is true that we may have a few hotbeds of insecurity in Algeria. It is true that there is some terrorist activity, but there is a momentum of political dialogue that is beginning to pick up speed, and this movement is irreversible. The transition platform enabled the opening of political talks to all the children of Algeria--all of them, without any exceptions. [Correspondent] Including the extremist armed Islamic fundamentalists? [Dembri] All the children of Algeria. We just have to realize that political dialogue can only work through the peaceful confrontation of ideas. [Correspondent] So the OAU could do something? [Dembri] The OAU can quite simply address the general problems of transition: I mean that we cannot achieve in a few years what the Western world took two centuries to achieve. Consequently, this transition must be accompanied in a responsible way by the surrounding countries, because it is quite clear that situations of instability here will lead to instability elsewhere. There is a kind of cosolidarity that must develop, which must emerge from this forum.
