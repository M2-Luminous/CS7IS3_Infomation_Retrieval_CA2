Croatian Radio and Television. Mr. President, at the Croatian initiative, in Bonn, another proposal was made to normalize Muslim-Croat relations. The reply is expected in three days time. What are your expectations? What will happen despite all of this fighting in Bosnia? [Tudjman] As you said, I initiated a new meeting -- for two reasons. First, despite the fact that all the sides, therefore the Muslims too, undertook the obligation in Brussels to halt hostilities during the Christmas holidays -- between 22 December and 15 January -- the Muslim offensive in central Bosnia still continued and threatened not only the population of Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovaca, Kiseljak, and Kresevo, over 100,000 Croats, but it also posed the threat of an ecological catastrophe, since an explosives factory is situated in Vitez. Understandably, the Muslim forces wanted to take the factory and it was to be assumed that the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] units would not allow the factory to fall into the hands of the Muslims. This could cause an ecological catastrophe, high casualties, and tens of thousands of new refugees. This was one of the reasons why exactly a week ago I proposed another meeting with Alija Izetbegovic to point out the possible catastrophic consequences for relations in the area, the current situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the future relations between the Croat and Muslim people. The second reason was my intention to present once again Croatia's stands, the stands Croatia has been advocating since the very beginning of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina about the need and necessity for the Croatian people to be interested in cooperation with the Muslims; likewise for the Muslims not only because of their survival but because of the fact that it would be linked to western civilization by relying on Croatia. To this effect in this proposition of ours, in the draft contractual agreement, we presented concrete proposals for cooperation within a union of Bosnia-Herzegovina, or else if a parting of the ways takes place -- something the Muslim leadership has already opted for, then we propose cooperation between a Bosnian-Muslim republic, i.e. state, and Croatia. This document in fact conveys the continuity of this Croatian policy. [Modric] Sanja Modric, NOVI LIST. I would like to ask you -- we read in VJESNIK today, it appears that Sarajevo radio has reported this, too -- that in Bonn you offered, and of course, Izetbegovic rejected this, that in Bonn you offered, that it would be possible to build some port in Peljesac for the Muslims. As we know very little about this, would you explain it in more detail. What is at issue here? [Tudjman] Since Mr. Izetbegovic reiterates his demand that Neum should be ceded to a Bosnian-Muslim republic, i.e. state, that it should be placed under full sovereignty, I explained again that from a Croatian point of view such a demand was unacceptable, that it would mean a breakup of Croatian territory and the Croatian people. It would pose a threat to southern Croatia, including Dubrovnik. This demand is in fact in line with something Serbia's policy has demanded for over a century. It wanted to conquer Dubrovnik in this war, too. Consequently, I said that we could only agree to what we had agreed aboard Invincible, i.e. we offer the Muslims a free zone in Ploce. We make it possible for them to build their own port on the Neretva. In Neum only the construction of a tourist facility appears as a possibility, on Croatian territory under joint management. During the two days of talks in Bonn I said that instead of Neum we could offer this solution: That we rent some tourist accommodation to the Muslims on the Peljesac peninsula, where they could then be linked with their, actually not their, but a free zone in Ploce. In that way it could be thought that we again showed goodwill to find a solution with the Muslims, despite their demand regarding Neum, which is unacceptable for us. I also reminded not only the Muslim leadership but also the European participants in the talks that the truce agreements of Pozarevac and Sremski Karlovci, of 1699 and 1718 respectively, through which the Dubrovnik diplomats succeeded in getting the two buffer zones at Neum and Sutorina, did not give access to the sea to the Bosnia of that period, but that this was a buffer zone by the sea which had a role of separating the area under the Venetians from Dubrovnik. Many of them at the talks in Bonn were surprised by this and, as you know, this solidified the viewpoint of serious people in Europe that Croatia cannot agree to giving any sovereignty to Bosnia over Neum, for that would threaten Croatia's strategic, national, and state interests. [Correspondent] VJESNIK. Mr, President, did the Muslims perhaps offer us something in central Bosnia? [Tudjman] They did. Their offer was that we should let them have central Bosnia or else their army will seize the whole central Bosnia, which was, according to the Vance-Owen plan on reorganizing Bosnia into provinces, provinces with the majority Croatian population, and also according to the current borders of the republics within the Bosnian union, envisaged to be a part of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. They are carrying out the offensive in today's central Bosnia in order to conquer these areas. I told them that the Serbs too agreed that Croatia should get 17.5 percent of the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory and that this is the absolute minimum the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia -- for strategic reasons -- can agree to, that it is out of the question that Croatia should cede this territory, because these areas have predominantly Croat population, because the Croats lived in Bosnia-Herzegovina before the Muslims, and because the Croats defended these areas first from the Serb aggression and are defending it now from the Muslim aggression. Consequently, their demand, the Muslims' position is therefore totally incomprehensible, as they lay claim to this area, because of the demographic composition of the population as well as because of the fact that this would reduce the share of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna in the distribution of these republics within the present Bosnia-Herzegovina, i.e. in a future union. In this respect Mr. Izetbegovic put forward a very interesting proposition and a very understandable one from their point of view -- that we should come up with a joint stand according to which the Bosnia-Muslim republic and the Croatian republic should be given 51 percent of territory and the Serbs, consequently, 49 percent. Acceptable at first glance. They, however, wanted to conquer 2 or 3 percent, included in this percentage -- 51, precisely in central Bosnia which was earmarked for the Croat republic. I pointed out that we cannot accept this as there is no other area inhabited by Croatian population that might be included in the Croat republic in the course of dividing up, either within the framework of a union or in a total parting of the ways. Consequently, one can conclude that Mr.Izetbegovic and his leaders invested every effort to, first, conquer militarily and then, possibly, achieve agreement at the negotiating table so the Croatian side would give up these areas which, as I say, for historical, political and strategic reasons as well as because of the present democratic state of affairs are such that it is logical that they should belong to the Croat republic in the division. As far as that meeting and our proposal are concerned, it should be pointed out that our proposal was focused on the need to cease all hostilities. For their part, the Muslims stress that they now have an army of 200,000 soldiers. Unfortunately, by far the largest part of that army is directed against Croatian areas, against the HVO. In reality, they are not engaged in combat with Serbian forces anywhere, apart from clashes and mutual artillery attacks around Sarajevo. Therefore, the Muslim armed forces are directed against Croatian forces and Croatian areas. This is one of the reasons, along with the two reasons I mentioned earlier, for an immediate cessation of hostilities. We also initiated a proposal on cooperation and friendship between the Croatian and Muslim peoples within the union; a proposal on cooperation and very close links, almost a confederal alliance between the Bosnian Muslim and the Croatian republics and their alliance with Croatia. As we were aware that the Muslim leadership had already opted for partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina, at the end of the talks we presented our proposals on cooperation between the Bosnian Muslim state and the Croatian state after the breakup of the union, i.e., the present Bosnia-Herzegovina. Current attempts to seize the Croatian areas [in Bosnia] prove that the Muslim leadership has chosen partition, i.e., creation of their Muslim state. After Mr. Izetbegovic, Silajdzic, and Komsic signed an agreement with me on 14 September providing for cooperation between the Bosnian Muslim and Croat republics, and their cooperation with Croatia, Mr. Izetbegovic signed an agreement with the Serbs granting the Bosnian Muslim republic UN membership in case of a breakup. This was in reality an agreement on partition. Just before the NATO summit in Brussels the Muslim leadership sent a proposal according to which NATO would offer guarantees for the Bosnian Muslim state. In the proposal they call it the pluralist Bosnia-Herzegovina, i.e. the victim state. This means that they did not even raise the issue of entire Bosnia-Herzegovina but instead they brought up the issue about ways in which NATO would offer guarantees for the borders and the viability of such a state. Therefore it is obvious that the current leadership has opted to create a Muslim state. I must admit that during the talks with us, Mr. Izetbegovic and the members of his delegation said that their prime objective was to preserve the union, but that clearly all possibilities had to be examined. But we did not spend much time on that problem, because the main problem was how to halt the hostilities and to explain that conquering central Bosnia, which is what the Muslim forces are trying to do, not only threatening tens and almost hundreds of thousands of the Croatian people, and creating streams of refugees [sentence incomplete as heard]. Therefore this poses the danger that any future cooperation between the Croatian and Muslim people, between the Croatian and Muslim states, will be made impossible. Mr. Izetbegovic admitted in principle that the Muslims have to be interested in cooperation with Croatia. He described our proposals as exceptionally useful. He said it in the presence of the entire delegations, the cochairmen of the conference on the former Yugoslavia and high-ranking German diplomats. This was said in Germany and then after the talks, I heard, he said that the talks had not produced any results. He even said that our proposals were, as a whole, acceptable, and that they would be discussed in Sarajevo and he would personally use his influence for the proposals to be accepted by others in Sarajevo. We agreed that they should reply to us in writing before the Geneva conference, which will be held on 15 January. Well, God willing, we will see. [Novak] Hloverka Novak, DANAS. Mr. President, some say that this peace proposal of yours is the last offer by the Croatian side to the Muslims. If Alija Izetbegovic and the Muslim leadership refuse your peace proposal, what will happen? Does this inevitably mean war, or new negotiations? What do you expect the international community's reaction to be like in the light of the Muslim leadership's attitude? [Tudjman] Let us be sensible and say that in the politics, the same as in life, as long as there is politics, as long as there is life of a man or of a nation we cannot say that something is the last thing. Consequently, we are compelled to have talks until we find a solution. We will be ready to continue the talks. But what you said is completely true, that in our proposal and our examination of the geographical settlement we have really reached the last straw and the Croatian side in this respect cannot yield. We said so. We can state with pleasure that all important international factors both in Europe and the world have recognized the truth that in these negotiations Croatia has been behaving very consistently in aspiring toward peace, that it has been ready to offer proposals which are acceptable for all three sides and in that sense the international factors likewise understood our resolve when it came to the points where there can be no yielding. I could say that since my initiative, I think it was at the beginning, on 5 or 6 November, and in the course of both conferences within the European Union, first the Geneva conference organized by the European Union and then the Brussels conference, and this one with this new proposal, that all important international factors became completely convinced in the consistency of the Croatian policy, the benevolence of the Croatian policy; and that with that Croatia's international position as regards the final phase of the resolution of that crisis on the territory of former Yugoslavia and Bosnia-Herzegovina has been considerably strengthened. [Correspsondent] Swiss radio. Mr. President, you said that the Muslims had decided in favor of a Muslim state, that the Bosnian government had decided in favor of a Muslim state. Could that in the end provoke Croatia to derecognize Bosnia-Herzegovina? If Croatia makes such a step, would that provoke the Croatian Army to intervene in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Tudjman] If the Muslim offensive and their efforts to create a Muslim state directly threatened the Croatian territories, including the border territories of Croatia, it is obvious that Croatia would have to protect its borders. It is no secret that in Herceg-Bosna a considerable number of volunteers from Croatia has been involved in fighting. But these are volunteers who were born in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who fought in the homeland war against the Serbian aggression in Croatia, and who went back there as volunteers to defend their homes, their land, first from the Serbian aggression and now from the Muslim aggression. As regards accusations that regular formations of the Croatian Army have been involved in fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I said that there were no regular formations of the Croatian Army there: These are volunteers who were born in Bosnia-Herzegovina and those who are working abroad, in Europe and other countries, who keep contacting us wishing to join their ranks. Consequently, the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina are interested in protecting their home territory, securing its survival. I told Mr. Izetbegovic that the Croatian policy has been and is going to remain... [pauses] that we have even been ready to influence the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina to remain within the Bosniak Muslim republic, as a considerable number of Muslims will remain within the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and that their human and national rights must be secured on the basis of reciprocity. These Croats in the Bosnian republic and the Muslims in the Croat republic, can be a bridge for overcoming animosity that has been created in this horrific war, and for restoring permanent cooperation and friendship in the future. [Modric] Modric, YOMIURI SHIMBUN. Mr. President, the map the Croatian press revealed today is not exactly clear. At first glance it appears as if the whole of Kiseljak and its surrounds are missing. Is it true that this part is included in the Muslim republic? Thank you. [Tudjman] This is precisely what reflects the Croatian side's willingness to contribute its share to a solution that would enable the Bosnian-Muslim republics to meet territorial conditions, too, for an independent life. In this demarcation, in opposition to the Muslims' general demand that they get all the areas of central Bosnia, meaning Travnik and Novi Travnik and Vitez and Busovaca and Kiseljak and Kresevo, in the course of talks we agreed to this with the Croats of Herceg-Bosna so they would remain within the framework of the Bosnian-Muslim republic, Kiseljak and Kresevo with their dominantly Croat populations, but that Busovaca, Vitez and Novi Travnik should by all means be included in Croatia [as heard]. Likewise, Bugojno and Gornji Vakuf, too, which were inhabited by predominantly mainly Muslim populations. In this way one ends up with a map such as the one you have seen. It is compact in terms of Croatian territory. On the other hand with Kiseljak, because of the fact that Bugojno and Gornji Vakuf are to be included in the Croat republic, one gets compact territory linked to Croatia. On the other hand, by leaving Kiseljak and Kresevo to the Bosnian-Muslim republic they receive an area around Sarajevo which is in territorial terms capable of supporting the existence of their independent state. This is what I was speaking about, in this way preconditions would also be created for cooperation and friendship and an alliance, both economic and defensive, as we suggested between the Bosnian-Muslim state and the Croatian state at a later stage. [Correspondent] DAILY TELEGRAPH, London. Could you try to explain to me Mr. Tudjman -- from Croatia's point of view what kind of role is Mr. Boban playing in the light of these new negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina?. Do you fully and unreservedly support Mr. Boban as a legally elected representative of Croats in Bosnia? [Tudjman] Mr. Boban became the leader of the Croat people in Herzeg-Bosna during the resistance struggle against the Serb aggressor. At that time I personally had neither known him nor had I heard of him, nor had probably the majority of the people from political leadership. However, he was doubtlessly legitimately elected, as you said yourself, during the self-organized resistance struggle of the Croat people against the Serb and later also the Muslim aggression. He has played an exceptionally important role in the Croat people's resistance against the Serb and later Muslim aggression in central Bosnia. But there are people in the Muslim leadership, including Mr. Izetbegovic, and others too, who also spread these ideas abroad, They laid the blame for the Muslim-Croat conflict on Mr. Boban and also the responsibility for the failure of the Muslim-Croat talks. It was clear to me, personally, and to other people that this was not true. But even in this respect the Croatian side showed its readiness to do everything possible, to remove all, even fictitious, obstacles to an agreement, that is to create all preconditions to reach an agreement. I must say here that Mr. Boban, as a great patriot, as a man who placed his personal resources at the service of the homeland and the people of Herceg-Bosna, has said that he is a soldier of his people and that he will accept any solution which is in the interest of the Croatian people. Mr. Boban has remained the president of what they call the community of Herceg-Bosna, but he is not taking part in further talks to prevent the Muslim side using the argument that they cannot talk to Boban. So, they are talking to other people now and have received in written form everything that can be offered to them. I think that the Croatian side has thereby shown its unreserved willingness to do everything to create conditions to end hostilities and initiate cooperation and friendship with the Muslim people in the future. [Correspondent] Does this mean that Mr. Boban is not going to take part in the talks in Geneva... [Tudjman, interrupting] This is not important. It depends on the nature of the talks. As you already know, in addition to the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] leadership, Herceg-Bosna has got its government, it has its assembly, a presidential council has been set up, they have the entire leadership which will appoint their representatives. It is important to restore peace, to achieve a solution that is in the interest of both the Croat and Muslim nations. I will tell you one more thing: When we proposed cooperation with the Muslims on such a broad basis, when we urged right from the outset that the Croats should take part in the referendum for an independent Bosnia, when we were the first to recognize [Bosnia] and send our ambassador to Sarajevo, then we bore in mind the interests of the Croatian people, the strategic interests of the Croatian state, but also the interests of the Muslim people and the interests of the Western world, because we knew that the Western world wanted the Muslims to rely on Croatia and be linked through Croatia with Western civilization. Contrary to extremist views that have surfaced in this war, and statements that we have heard when they said they wished to destroy Croatia, and that it was wrong for the Muslims to have gone with the Croats rather than with the Serbs, contrary to these and such views we have been doing everything on our part to prevent some fundamentalist and extremist elements from turning Bosnia into a hotbed of terrorist attacks, to which the Croats have unfortunately been already exposed in the horrific massacre of the Croat people in Algiers; such incidents have been recorded elsewhere, in Europe also, in individual showdowns. Consequently, it is in the interest of the Croat people and the Western world that the Bosnian Muslims become a constituent part of Western civilization, which they can remain to be by relying on and being in an alliance with the Croatian people. [Pesikar] Mate Pesikar, VECERNJI LIST. Mr. President, please tell us just a bit more about the territorial settlement. What is the destiny of Bosnian Posavina? Thank you. [Tudjman] As you can see on this map, our demand has been and continues to be, that the largest part of Croat-populated territories in Bosnian Posavina be included into the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. In this respect I owe an explanation to our people. We, the Croatian people, were not able to defend all those areas in [northern] Herceg-Bosna to the same extent that we were able to do so in southern Bosnia and in Herzegovina. The reason is simple: The Yugo-communist Army and then Serbia had such huge supremacy in tank forces, in overall military equipment, and manpower in that area, and they were so much interested in creating a corridor between eastern Bosnia and the Banja Luka area, that even if we had been allowed to deploy the Croatian Army there we would not have been able to prevent that. Those few volunteers whom we could send there were not able to prevent that. The population of Bosnian Posavina also offered resistance, but a large majority, I daresay even 80 percent of the Croatian population fled Bosnia-Herzegovina. It should be recalled that in the course of fighting in Bosnian Posavina the Yugo-communist army and then the Serbian army bombarded and pounded Croatian areas in Croatia -- between Bosanski Brod and Zupanja, even further afield up to Pozega and Djakovo. At the same time, I would like to remind you of the fact that on 12 July 1992, when signing an agreement with Mr. Izetbegovic, I put forward a proposal on a military alliance, by which the deployment of the Croatian Army formations in Bosnia-Herzegovina would have been legalized. However, Mr. Izetbegovic would not accept such a military alliance then; we only reached a conclusion that the Croatian Army should cooperate with the Bosnian Muslim forces and the Croatian Defense Council in border areas. Therefore, Croatia was in a very delicate position all the time. Therefore, our demand for Bosnian Posavina to belong to the Croat national corpus has been and has remained the same, but it depended on the developments and on the situation in the Armed Forces in the course of the war. The territorial settlement in Bosnian Posavina has not been finalized in the negotiations so far. I personally proposed to all the people in Bosnian Posavina to defend their areas and to organize their demands, including the proclamation of a separate province. Objections that we have allegedly forgotten about Bosnian Posavina to the benefit of Herceg-Bosna are completely unfounded. Not for a moment, on the contrary. I can even say something that a part of the public probably knows, I personally said: If we, with our volunteer forces and the local population, cannot prevent the corridor that the Serbs have been attacking and wish to control, then we have to defend Bosanski Brod as it is a part of Slavonski Brod. However, something happened there that is still being examined by commissions: Why was Bosanski Brod abandoned at one moment contrary to all orders and, in my opinion, not under the pressure of the balance of forces? Consequently, we have been doing everything to protect our interests in Bosnian Posavina. [Correspondent] One more question Mr. President. What are your expectations from NATO, from their latest meeting. A while ago you said that Izetbegovic had sent certain proposals to NATO. Obviously, he is expecting their help. The possibility of air strikes has also been mentioned. Can you comment on that? [Tudjman] Mr. Izetbegovic has sent a demand to NATO only to come to protect borders of his state. However, we can be pleased with conclusions. On my return journey today I briefly read them. I have heard of the draft, of the proposal [as received], but we can be pleased with the NATO conclusions for two reasons: For the first time a higher level of unity within Europe and the United States has been created regarding the need to act more resolutely in the sense of searching for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina; second, it was said that NATO, and I think that President Clinton in his Brussels speech had a sentence: If you leave such a sentence in the declaration, then everything must be done for its implementation [as heard]. These conclusions say: NATO and the international community have to apply force both against those who are strangling Sarajevo, against those who are obstructing humanitarian convoys, and against those who are threatening other areas. This means, in other words, that air strikes could be used against all three sides if they obstruct what I have just mentioned. We are welcome this. We believe that in the international community a demand is becoming ripe for all three sides to reach a final agreement, and also a standpoint that the humiliation of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] will not be tolerated, nor actions by those who, despite statements on cease-fire, are continuing with the destruction of Sarajevo. In this case this can also refer to Muslims if they continue with the offensive against Croatian areas, which will also refer to the Croats if they obstruct humanitarian convoys. I am not mentioning anything else because the Croats are not carrying out any offensive operations anywhere, they are only defending their areas. I have not seen the entire document, but at first sight, judging by these few things that I have seen, we can be pleased with the conclusions. Two more questions please. [Todorovski] Ilinka Todorovski, Slovenia TV. I have a question on another topical issue. Mr. President, have you been informed about Slovenia's decision to suspend electricity supply to Croatia from the Krsko nuclear power plant due to Croatia's outstanding financial obligations? Can you comment on that? [Tudjman] I have not been informed about it, and if Slovenia adopts such a decision I will consider it a very unfortunate decision, that does not contribute to the establishment of normal relations; there has been discontent among the Croatian public and views that Slovenia is abusing the situation in which Croatia has found itself. Slovenia is issuing demands not conducive to the establishment of good-neighborly relations between Croatia and Slovenia for which we have been ready and still are. We would like all relations between Croatia and Slovenia to be resolved in a satisfactory way, in the interest of both sides, not to the detriment of anyone, and want them to be in accordance with the best European examples. If such a decision has been made I do not consider it being appropriate to such aspirations. [Ramljak] Olga Ramljak, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. A while ago in your reply to a question you said that Croatia will persist on its peace proposals, but also that its proposal that was presented in Bonn was final. Croatian opposition parties said that if Croatia's peace efforts fail, if the Muslim leadership continues with the offensive against the Lasva River valley, that Croatia will have to refer to its obligations stemming from its constitution and protect the Croatian population using other means. How do you comment on this, and when will it happen if it had to happen? [Tudjman] The Croatian state has also until today acted in accordance with its constitutional obligation, and as I have already said in my replies to your questions today, it permitted the deployment of volunteers [in Bosnia-Herzegovina] to protect Croatian areas. Croatian state policy has proved itself as very mature in the protection of Croatian interests and pursuant to this, we will adopt necessary decisions, according to given circumstances on the battlefield and on the international scene. [Announcer] By this we are completing the news conference. Thank you very much and goodbye.
