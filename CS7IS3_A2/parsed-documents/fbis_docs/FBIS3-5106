U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will come to Tokyo next week to mend the strained bilateral ties or put further pressure on Japan to open its markets further. Christopher's Tokyo visit follows President Bill Clinton's signing of an executive order to reinstate the super 301 provision of a 1988 trade law giving the President the authority to retaliate against countries deemed to be engaging in unfair trade practices. Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, responding immediately to the U.S. action, called it "unilateral" and urged Washington to exercise care in applying super 301. "Japan wants to resolve the case multilaterally rather than bilaterally," said Hata, suggesting Japanese readiness to bring the case to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Christopher will arrive in Tokyo on Wednesday as part of a four- nation tour of Asia and Australia. He will meet Hosokawa, Hata and other Japanese leaders during his three-day stay. According to a senior State Department official, Christopher will discuss trade issues with Japanese leaders and warn Japan of a potential fallout beyond economics. The secretary of state will play largely a listening role and has no plan to make any U.S. proposal on how to resolve trade disputes with Japan, Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord said. Lord said the economic problems afflicting Japan and the U.S. "are very serious" and added they could spill over to other aspects of the bilateral relationship if left unattended. Clinton, ignoring a Japanese plea, took the super 301 action after his talks with Hosokawa in Washington last month on a new trade framework for the two countries collapsed. The U.S.-proposed framework is aimed at opening Japan's markets and reducing its huge trade surplus with the United States by setting specific targets. The failure of the talks has drastically reduced the number of Japanese who think Japan-U.S. relations are good. An ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper poll released this week said pollees who consider bilateral ties to be good plunged to a record low of 20 percent, down from 37 percent two months earlier. Those who do not consider relations to be good increased from 42 percent to 64 percent, the poll found. Hosokawa will appear in the Diet for three days from Monday to reply to questions from ruling and opposition legislators on his administrative policy speech delivered this week. His political leadership was badly damaged this week as he failed to shake up his seven-month-old cabinet -- an action aimed chiefly at dumping Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Political commentators said Hosokawa wanted to get rid of Takemura because of growing differences in political outlook between the two, both former prefectural governors whose relationship was once described as close. The abortive attempt has left a serious scar and split in Hosokawa's seven-party coalition between those supporting the prime minister and those backing Takemura. Cambodian Prime Ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen are scheduled to visit Tokyo from Wednesday through Saturday to attend an International Conference on Cambodian Reconstruction in which the U.S. Secretary of State will also take part. The International Committee on Reconstruction of Cambodia will be held on Thursday and Friday with the participation of 3l countries and the European Union as well as l2 international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Meetings of the Cambodian premiers with Hosokawa and Hata are also scheduled, and official Japanese sources said Japan will offer Cambodia some 9 billion yen in grant aid for fiscal 1994. Other foreign dignitaries visiting Japan next week include Xiao Rong, the third daughter of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. Xiao, who often accompanies her father, will stay in Japan from Monday to Saturday in connection with a book she wrote about her father's life. The book was recently translated into Japanese. She is a vice president of the China Association for International Friendly Contacts and a member of the National People's Congress, China's parliament. Other events next week include a seminar Japan will host from Monday to Friday for 12 former Soviet republics on its measures on arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation. It will be the first gathering including all 12 former Soviet republics to discuss controls on the export of technology with military application. The seminar is designed to help the 12 establish an effective export control system to strengthen the nonproliferation of arms. On the economic front, the Economic Planning Agency will release a monthly economic report Tuesday.
