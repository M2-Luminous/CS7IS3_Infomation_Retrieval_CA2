The peace plan endorsed by the said countries entails numerous difficulties wrote the daily, adding that such a bisection of the country is quite unfair and amounts to nothing less than presenting the aggressor with an award. This is not at all surprising since the entire economic structure in the western world is founded on a few basic pillars, the daily said. "One of the most critical of these pillars is the arms industry which provides, next to the narcotics, the greatest amount of revenues for the western countries", the paper added. Naturally an arms industry can thrive only if there are wars and aggression, the article noted and added that western countries claim that they intend to punish the aggressor and bring an end to the war which cannot possibly be true for such a policy would deprive them of one of their highly lucrative lines of business. That is why seven western countries which are among the greatest exporters of arms have rewarded the aggressor in order to insure the continued need for their products, wrote the article.
