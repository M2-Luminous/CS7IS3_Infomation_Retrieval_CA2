FR940127-0-00051 FR940127-0-00012 Final Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) ensures that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The costs associated with this final rule are below any threshold established by FAA Order 2100.143A. Therefore, the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on any small entity. International Trade Impact Assessment This final rule will have neither an effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States, nor an effect on the sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries since it does not impose costs on aircraft operators or U.S. or foreign aircraft manufacturers. Federalism Implications The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, nor the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Justification for Immediate Adoption The FAA has determined that delay in the adoption of this rule would cause undue burden to qualified domestic repair stations, air carriers, air taxi operators with large aircraft, and commercial operators of large aircraft. These companies use their SFAR 36 authorizations to develop and use data not formerly approved by the FAA for major repairs on products and articles. Current SFAR 36 authorizations will terminate on January 23, 1994, and this rule must be effective for the companies affected to continue to use data developed under the authorization to perform major repairs. Accordingly, the FAA has determined that good cause exists to make this rule effective in less than 30 days. Conclusion I certify that this final rule: (1) Is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a significant rule under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures for Simplification, Analysis, and Review of Regulations (44 CFR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In addition, this final rule has little or no impact on trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseas, or on foreign firms doing business in the United States.
