Arriving from Beijing, after two-hour strategic talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Han said he is "satisfied with the substance of the discussions with Qian." He emphasized that South Korea, Japan, and the United States are working for a U.N.-backed sanction resolution on North Korea. "We are not working on assumption that the resolution will not be passed at the Security Council," he said when asked about the possibility of actions outside the United Nations. Despite reports that Qian insisted on more dialogue with North Korea on the nuclear crisis, Han said he expects China to continue playing a constructive role. "The problem is that dialogue hasn't taken us very far," said Han, "China has said it will play a constructive role, and I expect such role to continue." Asked whether Qian said clearly whether Beijing will or will not oppose sanction resolution, the foreign minister said he did not anticipate a yes-or-no answer to begin with. "The meaning of consultations such as this is in mutual understanding, widening our consensus," said Han. He belittled North Korea's insistence that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) can still recount the history of its nuclear activities. "From the information and facts gathered so far, there is no basis to believe that the history can be recounted," he said. "But if North Korea does present the ways to reveal its past activities and fully cooperate with the safeguards agreement, then that will open the road to dialogue," he said.
