The men, who are suspected of belonging to an international syndicate distributing Nigerian heroin, were arrested in Helsinki at the end of March. According to police, the heroin was smuggled to Germany and the United States via Finland. Police have seized as much as 700 grams of heroin from an indicted 24-year-old student. This amount would have been worth several million markkas on the street. The student had been previously charged for possession of approximately half a kilogram of heroin. On Thursday the prosecutor asked punishment for two other Nigerians for aggravated narcotics violations. According to the indictment, a 32-year-old public relations man had, with the aid of a Finnish passport, sent out 250-350 grams of heroin from this country. The man denied all charges. He was previously sentenced to five months imprisonment for having smuggled marijuana into Finland. The prosecutor now demanded punishment for him and for a 36-year-old student for possession of heroin. The student denied he had sought economic gain from the activity, saying he had been holding the narcotics as a favor. All three men have resided in Finland for many years. The National Criminal Police got on the gang's trail through cooperation with the DEA and U.S. Customs. Authorities in Finland and the United States moved against the gang at the same time in the United States and Finland. Several suspects have also been indicted in the United States. The court will continue dealing with this case on 19 May. Pending this, the three are being held.
