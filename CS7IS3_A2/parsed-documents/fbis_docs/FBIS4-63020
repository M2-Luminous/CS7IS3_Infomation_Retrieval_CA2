Removing the plastic wrapper at home, I discovered large, completely unspoilt bulbs. Where was this garlic from? From Argentina, my friends! Well then, we have entered the world market with such speed that we can no longer produce anything. You see "Snickers" wherever you go: Have some -- no thanks.... And how do matters stand with our own agricultural output? To put it mildly, not very well. According to Russian Federation State Committee for Statistics figures, as of 25 April 2.3 million hectares (15 percent of the area sown) of winter crops on Russian Federation farms had perished. This includes 2.1 million hectares (15 percent) of grain crops. And where have the winter crops perished? On our most fertile lands! In Voronezh Oblast half of all crops have perished. In Volgograd and Astrakhan Oblasts -- a third. In Krasnodar Kray -- 27 percent. I asked the leading experts: What is the cause of this disaster? No one could give me satisfactory explanations. Unforeseen weather conditions, they suggested: There was a sharp frost, but there had been no snow.... The there are the mysterious subsoil waters, which suddenly changed their course. OK. What about the spring crops? As is the custom, they have caught up and overtaken. Spring crops (as of 25 April) have been sown on an area of 5.2 million hectares. Of these cereal crops account for 3.7 million. Last year the corresponding figures were 4.0 million and 2.8 million hectares. And more sugar beet has been sown than last year as well -- 231,000 hectares, and more sunflower seed -- 260,000 hectares. (Last year the corresponding figures were 197,000 and 92,000 hectares.) Add to this an increase of one-third in the area under potatoes and vegetables. The figures do inspire some optimism. But here is how they are assessed by the experts from the Russian Federation Government Economic Conditions Center, which cannot be accused of prejudice. In their opinion, a 10-percent reduction in the output of eggs can be expected in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year, together with reductions in the production of meat and milk of 20 and 31 percent respectively. The overwhelming majority of Russians will find it hard in such conditions to survive until the promised lavish harvest. And will it be so lavish anyway? After all, it is not enough to grow a crop -- it must also be gathered, stored, and processed. Yet storage and processing capacity is hardly increasing at all. So the prospects for the new harvest will hardly be enviable.
