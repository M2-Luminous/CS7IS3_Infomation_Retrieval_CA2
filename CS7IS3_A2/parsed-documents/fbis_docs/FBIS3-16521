This was reported by the press center of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed its incomprehension of W. Christopher's statement that "there are about one million Russians in Latvia who are deprived of voting rights," because, in fact, 278,087 out of 722,468 Russians residing in Latvia are citizens of the Latvian Republic. The chief U.S. diplomat pointed out twice that the presence of the Russian Army at the Skrunda radar base is essential. The note states that W. Christopher has accepted Russia's rights "to stimulate the Latvians to broaden their circle of citizens and to grant voting rights to Russians who want to live in Latvia." The Latvian Foreign Affairs Ministry is alarmed that Russia might interpret these remarks as acceptance of Russian attempts to dictate Latvian citizenship and naturalization policy. In the end, the note says that Christopher's remarks, unless they are explained, can be tendentiously distorted in Latvia as well as in Russia, and this could seriously interfere with the efforts of the Latvian Government to resolve important issues related to citizenship, Russian military withdrawal, and the status of the Skrunda radar station. The note expresses amazement over the fact that the U.S. secretary of state did not mention any of the progress which has been achieved in Latvia in working out a citizenship law in line with international standards, as well as the fact that one third of ethnic Russians in Latvia are already Latvian citizens. The Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has proposed a meeting of diplomats from both countries.
