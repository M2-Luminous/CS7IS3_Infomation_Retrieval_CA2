An assertion to this effect by the Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week was challenged by one of the members who pointed out that ``even a garage mechanic'' could refit the F-16 to carry nuclear weapons. The U.S. intelligence agencies, as also disarmament experts, have confirmed that the F-16s supplied previously to Pakistan have been refitted to carry nuclear bombs. Former CIA Director Robert Gates had in a Senate testimony in 1992 acknowledged that Pakistan had equipped its F-16s to deliver nuclear weapons. The renowned disarmament expert Mitchell Reiss, consultant at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre too has asserted that the uranium-based Pakistani bomb could be delivered by any of the advanced fighter jets in Islamabad's inventory including the F-16. India's opposition to the sale of F-16s is based not only on the consideration that Pakistan's offensive capability will increase to the extent of upsetting the balance of power, but also that it will boost its capacity for nuclear adventurism. It has also been revealed that despite the ban on military sales to Pakistan under the Pressler Law, the U.S. Administration has quietly permitted the Pakistani Armed Forces to buy American made arms from commercial firms. Among the items sold are spares for F-16s, which form the nucleus of Pakistan's Air Force. It is argued that the spares were intended to help Pakistan to maintain its current arsenal. Although for years Pakistan was engaged in a massive, covert effort to build atomic weapons, U.S. governments were reluctant to take strict measures against it because of its assistance to Washington's efforts to arm the Afghan rebels who were fighting Soviet troops. Thus, Islamabad was rewarded for building nuclear weapons and given favoured treatment. Official sources said here that it was too simplistic a proposition that Pakistan will cap its weapon-oriented nuclear programme for anyone to take seriously. If past performance is any guide no reliance can be put on Pakistan's word. Therefore, India cannot be expected to accept a corresponding obligation of capping its capability and throwing its facilities open to international inspection in the face of Pakistan's record. There is talk of offering ``incentives'' if India agrees to verifiably cap its nuclear fissile material production. It is pointed out that due to the sanctions imposed on the Indian Space Research Organisation, India is forced to develop indigenous capabilities for manufacturing Cryogenic engines. It has also built parallel computers capable of performing the functions of super computers. There is now talk of U.S. allowing exports of computers with the capability of 500 MTOPS to 1000 MTOPS, to provide India access to high resolution satellite pictures and even to supply commercial nuclear reactors subject to international safeguards. These carrots will not tempt India which feels its security threatened. However, there are no differences between India and the U.S. over a universal test ban and capping production of fissile materials for weapon purposes provided it is globally applicable. In fact, New Delhi co-sponsored with Washington a UN resolution proposing an international convention for fissile material cut-off. India believes that it will commit itself to cut-off when all countries including the five declared nuclear powers, accept it. The U.S. Administration proposal is however, seen to be discriminatory as it will create two categories of nations, one that will be allowed to retain their huge stockpiles of fissile materials, and other who will have to cap, roll-back and ultimately eliminate their production. During her recent New Delhi visit Assistant Secretary Ms Robin Raphel sought to convey the impression that the U.S. was interested in a comprehensive dialogue with India without which its South Asian policy would not carry much weight. She refrained from unfolding new policies to get the Indian reaction.
