Observers say this Zionist action is the biggest attack on the Muslims since the killing of worshippers in the al-Khalil mosque. The attack on the worshippers in Bab al-Zawiyah took place when nearly 160 political observers were stationed in al-Khalil to safeguard peace. This attack in the presence of international observers exposes the reality that the Zionists have no respect for international observers and, in view of their racist characteristics, they capitalize on every opportunity to suppress the Muslims. This attack on worshippers in the Bab al-Zawiyah mosque took place when U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived in Tel Aviv within his Middle East tour and a visit to Jericho was on his agenda. The objective of the U.S. secretary's visit to Syria and Tel Aviv was to open the doors to negotiations between them. With his trip to Jericho, he sought to convey U.S. support for the compromising accord and for the progress of the talks. With the U.S. secretary's visit to the region and the talks that took place, efforts were made to project the process of compromise as a means of ending the Middle East crisis. But the protest of the Muslims of the occupied territories and their suppression by the Zionist regime has proved that signed accords are of no use. Even though the accords are formulated by the compromising leaders and were implemented from on high with the support of foreign powers, the trend of the struggle continues through the masses of the people of occupied Palestine. As long as these protesting masses who are considered the true masters of Palestine do not achieve their dreams, accords will produce no results.
