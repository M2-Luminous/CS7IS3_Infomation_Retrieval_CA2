He said both groups of islands come under Vietnam sovereignty because Vietnam was the first to discover them in the 17th century, and has been exercising its genuine ownership over them in a continuous and peaceful manner. The Vietnamese spokesman was speaking in an interview to the army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN following remarks made last Friday by a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman who claimed Chinese sovereignty over these two islands groups while rejecting Vietnam's right over the land. He said Vietnam has been trying to resolve the issue through peaceful means in keeping with international laws and with consistency, and will continue to do so in the future.
