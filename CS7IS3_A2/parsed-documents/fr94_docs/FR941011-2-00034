FR941011-2-00034 FR941011-2-00008 3. The applicant must have earned commercial fishery income in 1991, 1992, 1993, or 1994. 4. The applicant's 1992, 1993, or 1994 commercial fishery income, whichever is greater, must have declined by at least 50 percent from the applicant's commercial fishery income from the base year selected. If an applicant had no commercial fishery income in 1992&hyph;1994 and had commercial fishery income during a base year, this criterion is satisfied. 5. If single, the applicant's 1993 gross income must have been less than $25,000. If married, the applicant's 1993 gross combined income of the applicant and his/her spouse must have been less than $50,000. No person may receive financial assistance under NEAP that exceeds 75 percent of any uninsured and otherwise uncompensated commercial fishery loss resulting from the fishery resource disaster, and no person may receive more than $100,000 of Federal funds in the aggregate for all losses resulting from the disaster. The intent of these criteria is to provide the available assistance to those commercial fishermen who have been most heavily dependent on salmon fishing and who have suffered the greatest losses. In order to comply with the requirements of the IFA, an uninsured loss must be shown. The second criterion is intended to determine those applicants that have been dependent on the commercial fishery for most of their livelihood. The third criterion is intended to limit eligibility to those who commercially fished during the disaster period. The final two criteria are intended to focus the available financial assistance on those commercial fishermen who have suffered the greatest losses due to the disaster and who do not have significant income from other sources. In applying for any of the programs, a commercial fisherman will be required to submit documentation, including salary, earnings, or crew-share statements and affidavits that demonstrate eligibility. Discussion of the rationale for these criteria was provided in the notice of the proposed program and is not repeated here. V. Program and State Funding Targets NMFS anticipates that the NEAP program will result in the following distribution of available financial assistance among the affected states and programs: 55 percent of available funds will be distributed to the State of Washington and 22.5 percent of available funds will be distributed to each of the States of Oregon and California. NMFS emphasizes that these are ``target'' distributions, not fixed percentages, and are flexible; redistributions could be made, if increased total benefits can be achieved. Classification This action has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. This action establishes a financial assistance program that will contain collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The necessary information collection forms and specific reporting requirements have not been fully identified at this time, and will be developed in conjunction with the intermediaries administering the program, and submitted to OMB for approval prior to implementation. Because this notice establishes a program to address some of the immediate needs of salmon fishermen affected by the resource disaster, there is good cause under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act to make this notice effective upon publication in the Federal Register . Any delay in making this program effective will delay relief to those adversely affected by the disaster and, therefore, delaying the effective date of this notice for 30 days in contrary to the public interest.
