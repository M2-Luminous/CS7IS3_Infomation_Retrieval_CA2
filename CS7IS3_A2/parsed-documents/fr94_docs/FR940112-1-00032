FR940112-1-00032 FR940112-1-00013 (ii) The allocations made under paragraph (i)(A) of this A. 13 shall be made on the basis of the relative gross income derived by each such affiliate with respect to the product produced in whole or in part in the possession. Where the product is a component product, the relative gross income with respect to the component product shall be determined by multiplying the relative gross income of the integrated product by a ratio, the numerator of which is the production costs of the component product and the denominator of which is the production costs of the integrated product. Where the product is an end-product form, the relative gross income of an end-product form shall be determined by multiplying the gross income of the integrated product by a ratio, the numerator of which is the production costs of the end-product form and the denominator of which is the production costs of the integrated product. (iii) The allocations made under paragraphs (i)(B) and (i)(D) of this A. 13 shall be made on the basis of the relative gross income derived by each such affiliate from the active conduct of the trade or business in the same product area. (iv) The allocations made under paragraphs (i)(C) and (i)(E) of this A. 13 shall be made on the basis of the relative total gross income of each such affiliate before allocating income under this section. (v) Income allocated to affiliates shall be treated as U.S. source and section 863(b) does not apply for this purpose. For purposes of determining an affiliate's estimated tax liability with respect to income thus allocated, the income shall be deemed to be received on the last day of the taxable year of each such affiliate in which or with which the taxable year of the possessions corporation ends. * * * * * Margaret Milner Richardson, Commissioner of Internal Revenue .
