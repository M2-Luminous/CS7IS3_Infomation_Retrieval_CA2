The deadline was given at the end of a two-day meeting in Bujumbura with the governors of 15 provinces to review the security situation in the interior of the country. But, he warned, those asking for an extension of the deadline should know that the disarmament plan is now in its implementing stage. He said that the Army would maintain the necessary pressure on rebelling districts and arrange safe passages to evacuate people who wish to leave insecure areas. Another meeting was held in the capital between representatives of rebels and some high-ranking officers of the Army operating in the troubled sector of Kamenge, in the north of the capital. The minister of defense, Colonel Gedeon Fyiroko, said that this was an attempt to appease the public. But eyewitnesses reported Bujumbura to be extremely tense. There has been heavy gunfire in the southern and northern parts of the capital.
