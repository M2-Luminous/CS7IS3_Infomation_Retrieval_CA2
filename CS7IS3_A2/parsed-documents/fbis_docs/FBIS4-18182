Therefore, there is no alternative at all to further support for President Yeltsin. If stability and economic progress is achieved there, the whole of Europe will benefit from it. Russia must be fully integrated within the world economy, where the division of labor exists, which also applies to the other CIS states. In particular, Kinkel mentions Ukraine, whose government he requests to accede to the Nonproliferation Treaty. Then the minister spoke about his recent meeting with the three Baltic ministers in Bonn: Of course, the three Baltic states are a special concern for us. Ties in the Baltic area that have been buried for years have to be revived again. Of all former Soviet republics, the Baltic states can show the most impressive reform successes. Yes, the dimensions are small, but they are nevertheless impressive. One objective of our presidency in the second half of the year will be to conclude an association agreement with the prospect of association also with Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The talks that I held with the three Baltic foreign ministers in the past few days focused on leading these states to the European Union [EU]. Politically and economically stable Baltic countries are an advantage for the whole of the region, and, by the way, also for Russia. It is the priority task of the European policy of these days to join the parts of Europe that have been separated for more than four decades. It presents particular challenges to Germany, the country in the center. We are particularly affected by all the risks, but, on the other hand, especially favored with the chances, too. Since the end of 1989, we have particularly supported the reform states in Central and East Europe. However, the historic chance that lies ahead of us, that is, to help the chances of freedom in our east to be transformed into jobs and thus into permanent political institutions, far exceeds Germany's powers. Also for this reason, it is so important that the EU continues to advance consistently on the road toward its enlargement, as was outlined in Copenhagen. Of course, the European-Atlantic institutions must not be overstrained or overtaxed when stability is extended to Central and East Europe. This would not help those who want to become members, either. Therefore, we have to beware of a course of action that only permits the choice between entry and isolation. The right course is a flexible system of increasingly close pan-European cooperation in addition to the option of entry. I do not want to fail to mention the Foreign Ministry's cultural promotion for the German minorities in Central and East Europe. For example, several representations were newly established in regions with German minorities. The foreign representations in Almaty, Bishkek, Tashkent, Gdansk, Szczecin, and soon Novosibirsk and Saratov are dedicating a considerable part of their work to the concerns of the German minority in their administrative districts. This is good and very important. Help for self-help, from the training and advanced training of teachers through syllabuses and textbooks to media promotion, is primarily the issue here. With this policy, we want to build additional bridges to these countries through our minorities, but we do not want to create artificial loyalty problems. We must not forget one thing: Europe is more than growth figures and foreign trade statistics and also more than the mere maximization of affluence. Europe is a cultural area. Whoever wants to put it together again has to restart above all the intellectual-cultural exchange. A tremendous amount of things still have to be done in this respect. Personally, I very much deplore the fact that we have relatively few funds for this purpose at a time when we have problems and difficulties. Above all I deplore it so much because we -- this has often been said in the Bundestag -- have an enormous chance as far as our language is concerned. It is not unimportant for the Germans -- it is particularly striking for me as their foreign minister -- that colleagues, friends, and partners who speak German come from these countries to the numerous conferences that we hold and where French and English have hitherto been the only languages. This is a chance that we should use. I ask the German Bundestag again to help me when money is at issue and to give a proper impetus. [passage omitted]
