In an interview with reporters in the Beijing Great Hall of the People yesterday, Deng Rong did not mention Deng Xiaoping's specific views about the current "two sessions." She only said that Deng Xiaoping, being an NPC delegate himself, had closely followed the course of the "two sessions." Apart from reading newspapers every day, she added, he also read documents on the sessions and watched special programs on the sessions. Deng Rong pointed out that her father had all along advocated strengthening democracy and the legal system. She said that she had also worked with the NPC Standing Committee for a long time adding that, before transferring to the Central Military Commission, she served on the NPC Standing Committee Legislative Affairs Commission. Regarding the impact the current reform has had on the "two sessions," Deng Rong said that since the 14th CPC National Congress held two years ago, Deng Xiaoping has maintained that the current reform is a deep-seated one, which does not only exercise influence on the current "two sessions," but also exercises far-reaching influence on China's future. When asked about China's future priorities, Deng Rong said China should focus on developing its economy to increase the national strength and gradually improve the people's living standards. This, she added, also accords with the three criteria for judging any principle and policy proposed by her father. The three criteria are "whether the principle and policy helps develop the productive forces, strengthens the overall capacity of the country, and improves the people's living standards." The "three criteria" were first put forward by Deng Xiaoping during his 1992 south China inspection tour.
