FR940323-0-00013 FR940323-0-00006 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;34] Alteration of VOR Federal Airways; ME agency: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. action: Final rule. summary: This rule modifies Federal Airways V&hyph;93 and V&hyph;451 located in Maine. Modifying V&hyph;93 and V&hyph;451 is necessary because a segment of the description for each airway utilizes the Navy Brunswick, ME, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility which is scheduled to be decommissioned on April 28, 1994. This action also corrects an inadvertent error in the description of V&hyph;451: ``Calverton, RI'' should read ``Calverton, NY.'' effective date: 0901 UTC, April 28, 1994. for further information contact: Patricia P. Crawford, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9255. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On January 12, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify V&hyph;93 and V&hyph;451 (59 FR 1686). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Domestic VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The airways listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies V&hyph;93 and V&hyph;451. A segment of the description for each airway utilizes the Navy Brunswick (NHZ) VORTAC which is scheduled to be decommissioned on April 28, 1994. This action becomes effective concurrent with the decommissioning of the Navy Brunswick VORTAC. This action also corrects an inadvertent error in the description of V&hyph;451: ``Calverton, RI'' should read ``Calverton, NY.'' The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
