The French envoy expressed this hope at a reception held here this evening by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship With Foreign Countries (CPAFF) to mark the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic ties. In his speech, Peyrefitte said his country has always held that the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate Government of China. After the two countries overcame the recent crisis between them, the bilateral ties have been thrust back onto a right track, he said. "We see with pleasure that the two governments have reached agreements on the improving of Sino-French ties," said Han Xu, CPAFF president. "The clouds over the bilateral ties have been dispelled," Han said, adding that these ties have been brought back to normal and would be further developed. "China's reform and opening and its modernization drive have entered into a new phase of development, which provides bright prospects for Sino-French cooperation and the friendly contacts between the two peoples," he said. Among those present at the reception were Wang Hanbin, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, French Ambassador to China Francois Plaisant and visiting French Senator and Admiral Philippe de Gaulle.
