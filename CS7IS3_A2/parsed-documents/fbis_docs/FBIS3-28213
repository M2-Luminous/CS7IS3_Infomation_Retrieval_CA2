According to the National Unification Board [NUB] on 3 February, North Korea is only holding two events on the occasion of Kim Chong-il's upcoming 52d birthday, which is 16 February, compared with over 20 domestic and international events held in previous years. The source said the scale of the events are being reduced and noted that the individual competition of the Fourth 16 February Arts Award, which opened on 18 January, is being held without the participation of overseas Korean artists. To create a birthday celebration atmosphere, North Korea completed a heating system; is carrying out city beautification works, including the rearrangement of flower beds in cities and cleaning of waterworks and sewage; and issued commemorative stamps and postcards. Regarding domestic events, the 16 February Arts Awards and the Athletes Games in Mt. Paektu opened on 18 January and 1 February, respectively. As to international events, a preparatory committee for the celebration of Kim Chong-il's birthday was formed in Mozambique on 20 January; film shows were held in Tanzania, Nigeria, and Ghana during 19 to 21 January; and a study institute of Kim Chong-il's works, including the "Azalea in Deep Mountain" and "The Seeds," was formed in Japan early January. The NUB analyzes that such a scale of events is considerably reduced compared with the 50th birthday in 1992 and the 51st birthday last year. In 1992, a "relay of loyalty letter," which had only been held on Kim Il-song's birthday, was held for the first time, and another relay of similar scale was held in 1993 in connection with the Eighth Congress of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea. Celebration events for Kim Chong-il's birthday began in February 1974 and the day was designated a holiday in 1975. The celebrations expanded remarkably after Kim Chong-il was elected member of the Party's Standing Committee during the Sixth Party Congress in October of 1980. On the 40th birthday in 1982, a decree of the Central People's Committee designated the whole month of February as "Festive February" and upgraded the celebration as an event next to the celebration of Kim Il-song's birthday. An NUB official analyzed: "Although there is a point where the scale of the birthday celebration is reduced because it is not a special birthday that falls on every fifth birthday (a multiple of five or 10), however, it is deemed that the change reflects a shrinking atmosphere due to economic difficulties and the nuclear issue."
