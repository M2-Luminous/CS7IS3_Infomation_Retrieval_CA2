That was reported to Interfax by the Ukrainian border troops press-service on Monday. At a news-conference on the border between the two countries, journalists have been told that Kiev disagrees with the verdict and will instruct its Embassy in Poland to appeal the court's decision. Border officers described the case with Lysenko as a crude provocation. Major Lysenko was detained in Poland at the end of August last year. In his words, his trip was private.
