Ministry officials said it has yet to be decided whether President Kim Yong-sam will attend the summit. A senior CSCE officials' committee in Prague Wednesday unanimously approved inviting South Korea to attend and make a contribution, the ministry said. The summit is scheduled for Dec. 5-6 in Budapest. South Korea is the second non-member to be invited to a conference meeting after Japan, which participated in the Helsinki summit in 1992. The 52-member CSCE does not hold annual summits, but officials here predicted that the top-level conference will eventually be regularized. Seoul is a strong advocate of creating a regional security dialogue forum in Northeast Asia, and taking part in the CSCE meeting will provide know-how on the mechanisms and operation of such dialogue, ministry officials said.
