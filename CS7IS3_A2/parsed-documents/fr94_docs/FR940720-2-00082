FR940720-2-00082 FR940720-2-00068 Date of amendments request: May 27, 1994. Description of amendments request: The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specification surveillance test interval from monthly to quarterly for several channel functional tests for the Reactor Protective System and the Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS). In addition, an administrative change to the ESFAS table would remove an out-of-date footnote concerning the emergency diesel generator logic circuit modifications. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Reactor Protective System (RPS) and the Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) provide the actuation signals to safety equipment necessary to mitigate design basis accidents and transients. The proposed change would increase the surveillance test interval from monthly to quarterly for several of the RPS and ESFAS instrumentation channel functional tests. The RPS/ESFAS instruments are not an initiator in any previously evaluated accidents. Therefore, the proposed changed does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated. The required plant-specific setpoint drift analysis for Calvert Cliffs demonstrated that the observed changes in instrument uncertainties for the extended surveillance test interval do not exceed the current 30-day setpoint assumptions. This provides confidence the 90-day test interval will not impact the ability to detect and monitor system degradation. Therefore, the proposed change will not change the ability of the RPS/ESFAS instrumentation to respond to and mitigate the consequences of any previously evaluated accident. In addition, an obsolete footnote is removed from ESFAS Table 4.3&hyph;2. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed extended surveillance test interval for the RPS and ESFAS and the removal of the obsolete footnote does not involve any changes in equipment or the function of these instruments. The proposed change does not represent a change in the configuration or operation of the plant. The RPS and ESFAS setpoints will not be changed as the instrument uncertainties resulting from the proposed surveillance test interval (calculated using actual plant data) are less than the instrument uncertainties assumed for the current surveillance interval. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change will not affect the functions of the RPS or the ESFAS instruments. The CEN&hyph;327 and CEN&hyph;327, Supplement 1, topical reports quantified the corresponding changes in core melt frequency for the representative fault tree models that were developed for Calvert Cliffs. The proposed change has two principal effects with opposing impacts on core melt frequency. The first impact is a slight increase in core melt frequency that results from the increased unavailability of the instrumentation in question. This assumed unavailability results from less frequent testing. The unavailability of the tested instrumentation components represents the potential for the failure of the reactor to trip, an Anticipated Transient Without Scram, or a failure of the appropriate engineered safety features to actuate when required. The opposing impact on core melt risk is the corresponding reduction in core melt frequency that would result due to the reduced exposure of the plant to test-induced transients. The two changes are nearly equal and the net result is no distinguishable effect on plant safety. The NRC issued a Safety Evaluation Report which found that these evaluations were acceptable for justifying the extensions in the surveillance test intervals for the RPS and ESFAS from 30 days to 90 days. The RPS and ESFAS setpoints will not be changed since the instrument drift resulting from the proposed surveillance test interval is less than the instrument drift presently assumed for the current surveillance interval. This provides confidence the 90-day test interval will not impact the ability to detect and monitor system degradation. The removal of the ESFAS Table footnote only removes obsolete information from the Technical Specifications. The conclusions of the accident analyses in the Calvert Cliffs Updated Safety Analysis Report remain valid and the safety limits continue to be met. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendments request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;317 and 50&hyph;318, Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Calvert County, Maryland Date of amendments request: June 8, 1994. Description of amendments request: The proposed amendments would revise the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2 (CC1/2), Technical Specifications (TS) 4.6.2.2.b to extend the surveillance interval for the containment fan coolers from 18 months to 24 months. The requested changes have been submitted in accordance with Generic Letter (GL) 91&hyph;04, ``Guidance on Preparation of a License Amendment Request for Changes in Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month Fuel Cycle.'' These proposed amendments are part of a series of requests that will eliminate the need for mid-cycle surveillance outages to accommodate the existing 18 month surveillance requirements since CC1&hyph;2 is operating on 24-month fuel cycles. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The purpose of the Containment Air Cooling (CAC) System is to cool the containment atmosphere, and thereby limit containment pressure and temperature, following a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) or Main Stream Line Break in containment. Failure of the CAC System is not an initiator for any previously analyzed accident. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated. Historical CAC System reliability, monthly surveillances and monitoring of CAC-related plant parameters provide assurance that undetected system degradation will not occur between 24-month surveillances, and the system will continue to perform its safety function. Therefore, there will be no significant increase in the consequences of accidents previously evaluated. Therefore, the proposed Technical Specification change does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. This requested revision to increase the interval for a CAC surveillance from 18 to 24 months does not involve a significant change in the design or operation of the plant. No hardware is being added to the plant as part of the proposed change. The proposed change will not introduce any new accident initiators. Therefore, the proposed change would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Does operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The CAC System provides a margin of safety by providing a means by which containment pressure can be limited following a LOCA or Main Steam Line Break. The proposed change does not affect the operation or design of the CAC System. Historical monthly surveillances and Control Room indications give assurance that the reduction in surveillance frequency will not adversely affect our ability to detect degradation in the system. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendments request involves no significant hazards consideration.
