Security forces have arrested Attia's father-in-law, named only as Bouchakor in the report, charging him with sheltering the armed gang after the December 15 killings, and have recovered stolen goods. Attia was reported to have led an armed band for more than a year and to be responsible for more than 200 attacks. He has been implicated in an assault on the Boughezoul barracks, 150 kilometres (90 miles) south of here, which left 19 soldiers dead, EL WATAN said. The 12 Croatian expatriate workers, employed by the Croatian company Hydro-Elektra, had their throats cut by a gang of about 30 people, near the dam they were helping build 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of Algiers. Last year, foreigners accused of cooperating with the Algerian government became the target of Moslem extremists waging war against the regime since the cancellation in January 1992 of elections the now outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
