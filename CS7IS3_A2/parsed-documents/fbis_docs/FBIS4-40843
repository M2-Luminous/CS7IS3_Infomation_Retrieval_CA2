FBIS4-40843 "drsov119_c_94009" FBIS-SOV-94-119 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 Federal Assembly More on `Decembrists' Walkout From Duma Sitting More on `Decembrists' Walkout From Duma Sitting PM2006123994 Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 17 Jun 94 p 2 PM2006123994 Moscow IZVESTIYA Russian BFN [Report by Irina Savvateyeva: "Scandal in the Duma: `Decembrists' Slam the Door"] [Text] On Wednesday [15 June] the leaders of the "12 December Liberal-Democratic Union" deputies' group said that its members felt they could no longer participate in the Duma's plenary sittings. They marched out of the hall. This action was prompted by the cancellation of the decision to register the group. The cancellation of the decision to officially register the group, made 14 April, was proposed by the State Duma Work Organization Committee. The reason being that at the time of voting, as it turns out, the group did not have the requisite 35 deputies' applications. But Boris Fedorov, the group's leader, categorically denied the charge. Fedorov claims that the "Decembrists" put in 38 applications for registration, and copies exist. But all efforts by representatives of the group to find out from the committee which applications are deemed to have been forged failed. The controversial question was submitted for the State Duma council's consideration last Tuesday [14 June], but the discussion was postponed for a week in order to establish all the facts. But Duma Deputy Speaker Mikhail Mityukov sanctioned the circulation of the decision to disband the "Decembrists" among the deputies without waiting for the facts, Boris Fedorov and Irina Khakamada said at a press conference. The group's members regard this decision as illegal and are refusing to participate in the Duma's work until it is revoked. In his assessment of what had happened, Boris Fedorov said that it had been "the usual political provocation." He saw the coalition of "Zhirinovskiyites" and "Russia's Choice" people, who "have been gnawing away for six weeks now at the question of the registration of the `Decembrists' deputies' group", as being behind the "provocation." The former have said more than once that they are unhappy with the fact that the "Decembrists" now also call themselves liberal democrats. "Russia's Choice's" involvement is demonstrated, in Fedorov's view, by the fact that both Mr. Mityukov and Duma Work Organization Committee Chief Vladimir Bauer are deputies of this faction. The fact that Fedorov is fighting with Zhirinovskiy over more than just the right to be involved with the liberal democratic camp is nothing new, God knows. Some observers tend to see the conflict in the democrats' camp as a consequence of the changes that took place at the last "Russia's Choice" party congress. This party, as is known, contains two nuclei -- the "Russia's Choice" movement and the "Democratic Russia" movement, coexisting not without some friction. And whereas last October, at the congress of the "Russia's Choice" electoral bloc, representatives of the former movement emerged in the top roles (and they included such figures as Fedorov, Burbulis, Poltoranin, Yushenkov, Murashev, and Golovkov), at the latest congress the "Democratic Russia" people (Zaslavskiy, Shneyder, and others) prevailed. Now, according to observers, the victors will endeavor to keep other representatives of the democratic movement from becoming party leader. In this connection it is suggested that the Gaydar-Fedorov split could well have its roots in the confrontation between the founders of the democratic movement and other representatives of democrats.
