FR941117-0-00090 FR941117-0-00011 (f) After the one year period of responsibility to resolve blanketing interference, licensees must provide upon request technical information to complainants on remedies for blanketing interference. §22.355 Frequency tolerance. Except as otherwise provided in this part, the carrier frequency of each transmitter in the Public Mobile Services must be maintained within the tolerances given in Table C&hyph;1 of §22.357. §22.357 Emission types. Any authorized station in the Public Mobile services may transmit the standard emission types set forth in this section, regardless of whether they are listed on the station authorization. Before using any emission type(s) other than those set forth in this section ( e.g. ), amplitude compandored single sideband), licensees must apply for (FCC Form 401) and obtain authority to do so, and must explain in detail the reason why such authority is needed. An explanation of the standard international emission designators used throughout the FCC rules is contained in subpart C of part 2 of this chapter. Table C&hyph; 1._ Frequency Tolerance for Transmitters in the Public Mobile Services 1Frequency range 1Base, fixed 1Mobile>watts 1Mobile<=3 watts 25 to 50 MHz 20.0 ppm 20.0 ppm 50.0 ppm 50 to 450 MHz 5.0 ppm 5.0 ppm 50.0 ppm 450 to 512 MHz 2.5 ppm 5.0 ppm 5.0 ppm 821 to 896 MHz 1.5 ppm 2.5 ppm 2.5 ppm 928 to 929 MHz 5.0 ppm n/a n/a 929 to 960 MHz 1.5 ppm n/a n/a 2110 to 2220 MHz 10.0 ppm n/a n/a (a) Any station in the Public Mobile Services may transmit unmodulated emissions (NON) for short periods for equipment testing. (b) Any station in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, Rural Radiotelephone Service or Offshore Radiotelephone Service may transmit: (1) Emissions of the following types: 15K0F2D, 16K0F3E, 16K0F3C, 16K0F1D, and 16K0F1E; (2) Emissions resulting from modulation of transmitters by sub-audible tones or other signals used to establish and/or maintain communications; (3) Continuous unmodulated emissions (NON), with a power at least 10 dB less than that authorized, to prevent false indication of channel occupation. (c) Any station in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service may transmit emissions of the following types: 40K0F3E, 40K0F3D and 40K0F1D. See also §§22.901 and 22.917.
