The delegation from the Kingdom of Cambodia, led by First Prime Minister Samdech Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, arrived here yesterday on an official visit. Ranariddh thanked China for its aid to Cambodia, on behalf of the Cambodian Government. Jiang said the visit by the two prime ministers showed that the Cambodian Government pays much attention to its friendly and cooperative relations with China. The visit, a great event in bilateral relations, will promote mutual understanding and friendship, Jiang said. Ranariddh said his delegation held fruitful talks with Premier Li Peng yesterday, and hoped that the visit would further consolidate and improve Sino-Cambodian relations. Jiang said that Cambodia's transition from a 20-year-long war to a period of peaceful reconstruction brought light to the Cambodian people's common will and was also in line with the major trend of peace and development in the region. Jiang said the Chinese Government sincerely hopes that the Cambodian Government will cherish the hard-won peace, further advance the process of national reconciliation and mobilize all the Cambodian people to build up their country. Ranariddh said that though facing difficulties, the Cambodians are optimistic about their future. Under the leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk, they will build Cambodia into a country of independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and prosperity, Ranariddh added. Jiang described King Sihanouk as the beloved leader of the Cambodian people and respected friend of the Chinese people, adding that he had made indelible contributions to Cambodia's independence. Earlier today, the Cambodian guests laid a wreath at the Monument to the People's Heroes and paid their respects to the remains of Chairman Mao Zedong. They also inspected two factories in Beijing. They are scheduled to visit the Hainan island province in south China tomorrow.
