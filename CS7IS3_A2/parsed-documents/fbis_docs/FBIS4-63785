Azerbaijan did not sign Moscow's agreement providing for the introduction of the troops from only one country to the conflict zone," said President Aliyev on 21 May. As a result, the agreement, "On measures to implement the 18 Febraury protocol," proposed by Pavel Grachev and providing for Russia's mediation in the separation of the warring parties without the CSCE, failed. It is now clear that Baku took advantage of the contradictions between Russia and the CSCE in this matter. While the U.S. State Department head for the division on the Newly Independents States (NIS), James Collins, persuaded Andrey Kozirev to give the troops status of an international force, Azerbaijan's Defense Minisiter Mamedov delayed the signing of the Russian agreement during the Moscow talks. At the same time, the Chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group, Jan Eliasson, shuttled between Baku and Yerevan trying to convince Ter-Petrosyan not to hurry to accept Grachev's plan. After that it was obvious that the CSCE intends to push for the agreement "On measures to regulate a cease-fire schedule" and when military observers of this organization arrived in the region, Baku said that it prefers mediation by international forces and not only by Russia. Such tactics on the part of Baku are of the ultimate risk since an infuriated Pavel Grachev can teach a lesson to President Aliyev for such "boldness." Earlier, Azerbaijan has been punished with defeats on the front for ignoring Moscow's interests. Presently the situation can repeat itself. According to Azeri miltary intelligence, recently Russian tank battalion, artillery and special battalions have been transported from Armenia to Karabakh. At the same time, two motor-infantry regiments of Armenia's National Army were transported to the conflict zone as well. The same source reports that Armenian troops have been concentrated along the Terterskiy region direction. Judging by all, further development of the events will depend upon whether the West will permit Russian troops to be introduced into Azerbaijan.
