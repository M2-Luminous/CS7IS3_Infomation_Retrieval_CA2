We can never back any attempt to separate southern Sudan from the north. Speaking to reporters following the closed session of the Arab League ministerial council, Musa said the council decided to postpone discussion on the amendment of the league charter and relevant issues until Arab conditions improve and consensus is obtained on the amendment and its terms. He noted that the seven-member committee will hold a meeting this evening to discuss the Lockerbie crisis and developments in Libya's crisis with the West. Touching on a meeting among the foreign ministers of cordon states on the sidelines of the foreign ministers session, 'Amr Musa said: We did not discuss this subject and there are no arrangements to hold such a meeting on the sidelines of the ministerial council session. Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih praised Musa's remarks on southern Sudan, saying: We thank Egypt for this strategic stance, which seeks to preserve Sudanese unity, because Sudan's security is the same as Egypt's and is part of the pan-Arab security. He described his meeting with 'Amr Musa today as "fraternal". The Sudanese minister hoped official dialogue will continue between the Egyptian and Sudanese sides in Khartoum. We welcome Minister 'Amr Musa in Sudan to resume dialogue on disputed issues and resolve them, he said. Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said that the Arab boycott of Israel was not raised during the new session of the Arab foreign ministers council that started today. What we discussed is the report submitted by the Damascus-based Arab Bureau on the Boycott of Israel, he explained. Al-Shar' added that Arab parties have agreed to postpone the issue of amending the charter until an Arab summit is held, in view of the importance of the topic. Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal stated that the council's discussions today were constructive and that an agreement was reached to postpone discussion on the amendment of the charter because of its importance. He added that a number of remarks were made on that topic, including the view that this important matter should be discussed when the Arab atmosphere is more favorable so that the charter can be reviewed after due consideration and away from side issues that can affect Arab solidarity. Ibrahim al-Bishari, Libya's delegate to the Arab League, said today that he will submit a full report to a seven-member committee that includes the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria, Libya, Mauritania, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia.
