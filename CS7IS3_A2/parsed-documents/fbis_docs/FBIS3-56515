It is hard to say whether the fact is trustworthy and whether Vladimir Volfovich's coming to Armenia in the near future is possible at all especially in the wake of his promise to turn independent Armenia into a Yerevan gubernia as part of a Russian empire. Armenian social scientists, however, think Armenia does have a social base for forces like Zhirinovskiy's, because populism and socialist ideas take a far from back seat in semi-starving countries.
