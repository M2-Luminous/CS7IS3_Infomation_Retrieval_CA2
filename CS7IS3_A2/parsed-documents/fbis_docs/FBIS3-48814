Since they were first hesitatingly introduced in 1986, the reforms have made remarkable progress -- perhaps too much, in the eyes of party leaders who are worried that they are losing control of the economy and losing touch with the population. There is no suggestion that Vietnam's economic transformation will be halted but senior party officials are worried about the social consequences of the reforms they have introduced. Rising unemployment and a widening gap between the mostly urban rich and the rural poor are causing social tensions which some party cadres fear could surface in an imitation of recent peasant unrest in China. Vietnam is now one of only five countries ruled by a Communist party and party leaders are acutely conscious of the fate of their former allies in eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union, much of which they blame on the reforms introduced by President Mikhail Gorbachev and his supporters. This is the first time the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) has held a national conference mid-way through the five-year cycle between congresses. In Vietnam, as in the country's huge northern neighbour, China, the party is trying to reform the economy while resisting calls for any change to the political structure. The party is still the only legal one in Vietnam and its leaders have no plans to relinquish its power. Now they are increasingly worried that they are losing touch with ordinary people in the country, especially with young people who have diminishing loyalty to the ageing revolutionaries who still run the country. "We should carry out properly the task of broadening the party's membership, especially among the youth and women," general secretary Do Muoi told the conference. "We should rejuvenate the party ranks." Mr Do Muoi and his colleagues have reason to worry. Young people in Hanoi are becoming increasingly rebellious and appear to be more interested in western music and culture, than party politics. Last year, some 50,000 people joined the party, which now has a membership of almost 3 million out of a population of 71 million. However, many people say they joined the party because they had to or simply to boost their job prospects, rather than for any deep ideological commitment. Party leaders, many of whom are in their sixties or seventies, are widely seen as out of touch with ordinary people who have to adapt rapidly to their changing lives. On the streets of the capital, few people are even aware that the national conference is taking place and even those who do know show little interest. To mark the occasion, Party buildings and main roads through the Vietnamese capital are festooned with red and gold banners proclaiming "Long Live the Glorious Communist Party of Vietnam!" and "Our President Ho Chi Minh Lives With Us Forever!" One woman selling piles of oranges and apples by the roadside commented: "Oh yes, they always have banners for something. I don't know what these are for, though." She and the other traders nearby, several of whom had recently lost their jobs at state-run factories, said they had more pressing concerns such as making enough money to feed their families. Elsewhere, a young woman was sitting in front of a newly bought television, apparently not paying much attention to a report on the evening news about the party conference. "They just talk and talk and talk," she said, "but they don't do anything." This may sound just like the routine grumblings of people in many countries about their politicians. What makes these comments so remarkable in Vietnam is that just two or three years ago almost nobody would have dared to say these things, certainly not to a passing foreigner. The report to the national conference by the party central committee makes repeated calls for political stability and stresses the need for vigilance against "all plots and acts of the enemy", "the scheme and acts of `peaceful evolution' by hostile forces" and "the way of life consisting in running after money". However, outside the party's inner halls, people from all levels of society want to run after money; they are being encouraged by the government to start small businesses and to make profits. Throughout Hanoi, and across Vietnam, people are heeding this call. Tens of thousands of cafes, shops and other small enterprises have opened in the past few years. In other ways, many young people have also become alienated from the party. They gather in cafes to listen to western rock music and race their motorcycles around the streets of the capital late at night. To these people, who are searching for new influences and ways to escape the controls of the party, Mr Do Muoi's warning against "the tendency towards `commercialisation', propagation of heterogeneous cultures and depraved way of life" is faintly ludicrous.
