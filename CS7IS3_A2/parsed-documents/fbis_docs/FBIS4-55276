Before this, the ministry received information from the Office of State Protection that the Solidarity ["S"] delegation would be accompanied by a large group of miners, who were to arrive on several buses. For fear of occupation of the government's premises, the ministry placed barriers manned with policemen around the building. "S" arrived alone. After five hours, decisions were made concerning three out of the four demands of "S" upon which the miners determine the suspension of the strike. As this issue of the daily was being closed, discussions were under way on the main demand--compensation for lost remuneration for the period of the strike. On Wednesday [11 May], the "S" National Committee [KK] will decide on the further course of the protest action of the trade union. In the KK Presidium, three options are becoming noticeable. The strike action may be suspended, and it is also possible that it will be continued. The third possibility is the staging of a one-day nationwide strike following which we will suspend the protests, RZECZPOSPOLITA was told by KK Spokesman Piotr Zak. Ministry Half Open It was agreed that next week the ministry will present the trade unions with the economic results of the coal partnerships. Afterward, the demand for the liquidation of wage disproportions among the individual hard-coal mines will be discussed. As was stated by Deputy Minister Herbert Gabrys, concluded were also "far-reaching agreements" concerning the annulment of the resolution blocking wage moves in the mines and the employment policy. According to "S," the resolution conditioned an increase in productivity. Agreement was reached concerning the introduction into the statute of the coal partnerships a provision, in line with which the managements of the partnerships will obligatorily consult with trade unions on all issues that, in line with the Law on Trade Unions and the Labor Code, can be dealt with by them. So far the partnerships have only been operating on the basis of the Commercial Code. Guarantees were to be given and a provision was to be made, whereby employers, as a party, will join the labor collective agreements (so far the parties concerned were the unions and MPiH). Talks on compensation for the wages lost for the period of the strike continued late into the night. The miners condition the suspension of the strike on their results. Negotiations with the directors of the coal partnerships on the previous day did not yield any satisfactory results. According to "S," strikers might make up for the protest by "increasing their productivity." The government stated that such compensation would be a violation of regulations. Despite that, both parties were close to circumventing them and reaching an agreement, but, according to unofficial information, resistance was put up by the representatives of one of the partnerships that had already signed the protocol stating that the miners would not get any money for the period of the strike. However, if an agreement in this area were reached, the Trade Union of Miners in Poland was going to submit a demand concerning higher wages. Of the "S" demands, seven were intact, including the one concerning the exclusion of any repressions toward the participants of the strike. Apart from "S," participating in the talks were also employers and the Confederation of Trade Unions of Miners in Poland, "Cadre," and "S '80." Contrary to the fears of the MPiH, the "S" delegation came to Warsaw without buses full of miners. They were surprised to find barriers and policemen around the ministerial building. However, "S" did not deny that the miners would not come; it would be a joke rather than anything else. The buses went to the occupied agency to replace the miners of the Jastrzebie Coal Partnership with the employees of other partnerships. [passage omitted] Three Options of KK The option of continuing the "S" action is backed by the fact that other regions are declaring a strike alert. On Thursday, the Podkarpacie Region, among others, is supposed to go on strike, as well as the Cegielski Factory in Poznan. "Our protest has been going on for months now. Employees may feel tired already. The government adopted the tactics of ignoring the protests. It pretends that nothing is happening. Therefore, it is possible that a decision will be made suspending the strikes until September. Sooner or later, because of nonimplementation of our demands, there will be social unrest. Then the union will resume the protest," stated Zak. The union's spokesman also did not rule out the possibility that "S" may suspend the protest action only after a one-day nationwide strike and a several-thousand-people demonstration in Warsaw. Zak also stated that most of the KK Presidium members believe that representatives of "S" should not participate in the work of the Trilateral Commission--"These talks will not yield anything, and the government may say that it is trying to implement demands." Perhaps the Sixth National Congress of Delegates, scheduled for late June, will be put off until the end of August and the beginning of September. Zak explains that this is because the protest action has decelerated organizational work. According to other sources, "in the nearest months, the leadership of the union wants to work out a strategy for fighting with the present political configuration. Krzaklewski has often pointed out that this fight is planned for months and years. Such important decisions as those concerning a ruthless fight with the leftist configuration must be made by the congress, not by the KK." "S" decided to sue the government in the International Labor Organization for violating convention No. 122. According to "S," it is not effectively combating unemployment. A similar complaint was filed by the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement in 1993; however, the union suspended it in January of this year.
