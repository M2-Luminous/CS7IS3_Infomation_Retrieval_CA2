They said that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique yielded to the U.S. pressure to open market so the lives of 10 million peasants and even workers are being threatened. The students charged that the United States continues to threaten the North with a nuclear war and increase the war atmosphere on the Korean peninsula. They demanded that authorities refuse a "ratification of the final act of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks at the National Assembly," object to rice import liberalization and realise the U.S. troops' pullout and denuclearisation and disarmament and signing of peace agreement.
