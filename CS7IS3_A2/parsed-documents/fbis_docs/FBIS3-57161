Speaking at a democratic meeting in Moscow, Yegor Gaydar said that reformers in the government had seen Russia as a state that could serve society. In his words, this approach envisaged cutting down the state apparatus and minimizing officials' right to divide and distribute; and reformers did achieve some degree of success. Yegor Gaydar noted that by the time he left the government, the average salary in Russia had reached $100 a month, a large trade surplus had been achieved, and large stocks of grain to last until the next harvest had been amassed. Hence, dependence on grain imports has decreased sharply, the free market is beginning to work, and shortages have been fended off. Yegor Gaydar said that if the situation becomes critical, members of the present government might try to lay the blame for it on the reformers. He declined to comment on reports that Mikhail Gorbachev's former consultants, Leonid Abalkin and Nikolay Petrakov, have been drafted in to adjust the economic reform.
