Colonel General Nikolay Golushko, Director of Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, Answers IZVESTIYA Special Correspondent Valeriy Yakov's Questions"] [Text] This conversation had been repeatedly postponed, but the arguments presented by the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] were so convincing that I frequently had to agree with them. What indeed could you say when the president's edict abolishing the Ministry of Security came as a surprise to the actual ministry (at least that was what many of this department's high-ranking personnel said) and the structure of the new organization -- the FCS -- had to be developed virtually from scratch? Despite having a host of formal reasons for canceling this, his first major interview in his new post, Nikolay Golushko finally named a specific time and the conversation went ahead. It was a frosty morning, and dapper men filed from the subway to the main entrance of the new Lubyanka building in a hurry to start their working day and, judging by their numbers, personnel cuts are not yet over here. After studying my editorial ID card and that of the photographer, the cheerful warrant officers at the entrance asked us to wait for General A. Izmodenov, the director's aide, to come down to get us. We went up to the fourth floor with him. There was a deserted corridor with the traditional carpet runner and locked doors on both sides bearing no name plates, just numbers. The general suddenly opened a door that was hardly different from the rest (apart from the fact that it was made of metal and covered in leather of a different color) and we found ourselves in a spacious reception room. The director's office, the windows of which look over the courtyard, seemed huge at first (when you worked out how many paces it is to the main desk), but N. Golushko was already halfway to greet us and our initial impression diminished. There were a host of files of various colors on the desk. The aide moved some of them, the biggest ones, to one side. On the left there was a bank of telephones. The furniture and light fittings were not luxurious, but very good-quality and blended well with one another. You feel as if you are in an ordinary modern department (although not a poor one), but by no means inside a bureaucratic building with a scary past. The Russian flag stood on the corner of the desk and behind the director there was a picture of the president. [Yakov] Nikolay Mikhaylovich, the Statute on the FCS has been adopted and approved by the president, but the crux of it is still unclear; are we to see it as a guide for action and is the Law on Federal Security Organs no longer valid? [Golushko] The main content of the Statute on the FCS deals with the formation of a new centralized special service which, coupled with other existing structures, will have the duty of ensuring the country's state security. It is a question of creating this service in a radical, revolutionary way and top officials from the Security Council and the president's administration are involved in this work along with the leaders of components of the Federation.... The Statute defines the functional tasks of the FCS, which is transformed into a special service and will in effect cease to be a law enforcement organ. Acording to the Statute, the task of the FCS is to work to expose, avert, and suppress intelligence-gathering and subversive activity by foreign special services and organizations and illegal encroachments on Russia's constitutional system, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and defense capability. The unified counterintelligence system incorporates territorial and regional organs in republics, krays, and oblasts and military counterintelligence organs in the Armed Forces, Border Guard Troops and Internal Troops, and other Russian Federation military formations. I would particularly like to stress that, according to the Statute, all FCS activity will be carried out strictly in accordance with the requirements of the Russian Constitution and the law -- including the Laws On Security, On Organs of State Security, and On Operational-Investigative Activity. [Yakov] Today are there any of your deputies or collegium members who are not members of these organs? What criteria do you use to certify them apart from the wide-ranging concepts of "sense of duty" and "loyalty to the motherland"? Has the presidential apparatus certified anyone? [Golushko] The certification commission headed by O. Lobov is at work virtually every day from 1830 to 2200 or 2300 hours. Yu. Baturin, S. Kovalev, N. Medvedev, S. Stepashin, and others are on the commission. Standing orders have been formulated as well as the procedure for introducing the members of the leadership to the president. The commission has already approved the appointment of over 20 leadership personnel after conversations with them. A commission has been set up to certify operational cadres, including at local level. All this involves more than just a formal examination of their CV's or personal affairs. Conversations are held with every staffer who is being considered for a leadership post. People who were tipped for top roles are eliminated. The criteria include the following: Job assessment, practical results over the last two years -- since 1991 -- and any penalties or breaches of discipline. We see whether citizens have made any complaints about human rights violations by the person concerned. Our people's willingness to serve in any part of the country and work in the "hot spots" is also appreciated. After all, we have always had representatives of our central apparatus everywhere in addition to local personnel. Last year two of our staffers died in Tajikistan on an official tour of duty. Incidentally, Aleksandr Izmodenov, who met you, spent two months working in Abkhazia, cooperating with the special services, the leadership, and representatives of the Foreign Ministry, and performing tasks in Russia's interests. I could also cite many examples with regard to other regions. [Yakov] Nonetheless, Nikolay Mikhaylovich, how will the new special service differ from the previous one if it still has the same people holding the same ranks and working in the same buildings with the same files, and the same agents? [Golushko] What can I say? Only that the new generation of security organs in the new Russia is most likely still at school and studying at higher educational establishments. We had a number of academy graduates, we have deployed 400 people, I think that these are the personnel responsible for the future. But an operational worker or a counterintelligence staffer, who generally has a knowledge of languages, does not drop out of the sky so easily. I do not think it right today to reproach our personnel for the department's sins of old. They are not after all being certified for the first time. A considerable number of people were discharged after August 1991. The second phase occurred when the Ministry of Security was being set up, a fairly tough elimination policy was applied there too. Now yet another certification process is under way. [Yakov] Some 45 percent of Ministry of Security personnel will be left out of the FCS and there is no guarantee that the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or the tax police will want to take on your rejects. What does the future hold for them then, which structures will grow stronger with their experience -- criminal or commercial structures, the parties of Zyuganov, Zhirinovskiy, or Barkashov?... [Golushko] Every staffer's future is decided on an individual basis. Some will retire on a pension, others will go to the MVD, those with a knowledge of languages will go into foreign intelligence. The coming certification process should not be described as a "weeding-out process," much less should citizens of the united Russian state be divided into "them" and "us" according to party orientation. We estimate that most professionals will continue working in new jobs in the interests of Russia. Our former colleagues' possible involvement in criminal structures can cause nothing but regret. [Yakov] The experience of the last few years provides convincing evidence that coups d'etat and mass disturbances may be provoked not only by foreign special services, but also by Russian politicians. The Ministry of Security was unable to prevent the previous disturbances and coups, which department will now forecast and prevent such events? [Golushko] In my view, one should not be so categorical in assessing security organs' activity to prevent what you call the "coups d'etat and mass disturbances" of the past few years. The law prohibited the Ministry of Security from operating in political parties and movements. However, top organs of power were constantly briefed on all anticonstitutional, extremist, and radical manifestations. Including on the "Barkashovites," long before the tragic events. Today, in our view, one should not name a single organ that will engage in "forecasting and preventive work." The Commission for Public Security set up within the Ministry of Security can coordinate law enforcement organs and the special services, the FCS included, in order to perform similar tasks. But political parties and movements must be monitored by the Justice Ministry, as envisaged by the Law on Public Associations (this pertains to the constant question of "political investigation"). [Yakov] Counterintelligence presupposes the existence of an enemy, whom your work is to "counter." But whereas previously any pioneer activist could have been called the enemy of the homeland, how will things stand now? Whom do you assume to be your enemies in distant foreign parts and will you have enemies in nearby foreign countries? [Golushko] We are acting on a different principle and will not organize our work on territorial or any geographical grounds. Or on the basis of membership of a particular bloc. We will combat those special services that are conducting specific subversive activity against Russia. [Yakov] What will you do with the NKVD, KGB, and Ministry of Security archives; what principle will you use to divide them up between the new special services? [Golushko] A considerable proportion of the archive material has been declassified by a special commission -- this includes material on the czar's family, Bulgakov, Sholokhov, Florenskiy, and Kozin. Systematic work is under way to transfer documents that have no bearing on counterintelligence to the Russian State Archive Service. There are plans for us to join other establishments in declassifying material on scientific and cultural figures during the totalitarian regime, on the state, religion, the Korean war, and so on. And, most importantly, to further review cases for rehabilitation. [Yakov] There were only 19 investigators, conducting 400 cases, for the 60 vacancies in the Moscow Ministry of Security's Investigation Department. The vacancies and cases are now being transferred to the Prosecutor's Office, but investigators are refusing to transfer, what lies in store for these cases and the people under investigation? [Golushko] Our special service is losing its role as a law enforcement organ, it is being stripped of investigation subunits, merely retaining inquiry functions [funktsii doznaniya]. Therefore around 2,000 criminal cases being worked on by the Ministry of Security (as of 18 January 58 cases, including eight criminal cases, had been transferred to the Moscow Prosecutor's Office, whereby 17 people had been arrested and it has been agreed to hand over another 220 cases) are being handed over to the General Prosecutor's Office and its organs at local level. To date 62 out of 76 FCS territorial organs have handed over material to the prosecutor's office. All military counterintelligence cases have been handed over. As for investigators, each will have an opportunity, if they so desire, to continue serving in the FCS after they have been certified. [Yakov] What lies in store for your former agents? You cannot after all divide them up among the new services, it would probably be easier to put them on ice until better times come along? [Golushko] Work with agents has of late been put on a legal footing. You probably know that a law was adopted allowing us to have confidential sources. It defined the rights and duties of citizens who cooperate with state security organs. I do not think that there will be any problem with them, especially since the size of the agent apparatus has been considerably reduced compared with the KGB. [Yakov] So, the so-called operational reserve officers [ofitsery deystvuyushchego rezerva] will still be working under various "umbrellas"? [Golushko] The institution of operational reserve officers or the practice of attaching [prikomandirovaniye] special service officers to ministries, departments, organizations, establishments, and firms is not our invention, but is used by all the world's special services -- and fairly effectively at that. I can confidently say today that critical assessments of the attached personnel are fairly rare and are often an interpersonal thing. Our tactics for handling reserve officers and attached personnel will meet requirements and the tasks that the FCS can feasibly perform. Naturally, mindful of requests from heads of establishments, departments, and firms. [Yakov] The Lubyanka complex, secret rendezvous, training centers, recreational bases, the Ministry of Security academy... -- who will divide up this property belonging to the people, how, and between whom? [Golushko] The president's edict has assigned the federal service crucial tasks, and the corresponding material, financial, and operational base will be needed to resolve them. What is more, the FCS safeguards the interests of intelligence personnel, border guards, and the protection service [sluzhba okhrany], and that is why we are not currently facing the question of dividing up the material base. [Yakov] Sizeable expenditure is needed for the upkeep of this sizeable base and you probably already have estimates as to the FCS budget for 1994. Following the 46-percent cut in personnel, should we expect your budget to drop by roughly the same proportion compared with the Ministry of Security? [Golushko] Of course. Spending on cadre pay will drop considerably. [Yakov] What will be the resulting figure? [Golushko] At the moment we do not have a budget and it is hard for me to give you a thorough answer. As far as January at least is concerned we were given funding in December based on the number of staff. [Yakov] A good answer. I would even say a significant answer. Well then, could you be a little more specific and tell us how much a middle-ranking FCS staffer and the director are paid? [Golushko] Let's ask now, just a minute. (He repeated the question down the intercom, probably to a financial expert. The following response came: "An operational worker at the center earns 156,598 rubles, but I did not make enquiries about the minister." Golushko laughed. -- V.Ya.). Well then, that's what our pay is like. The director's pay is like that of any minister. Plus an allowance for rank and years of service. [Yakov] Nikolay Mikhaylovich, your department recently made the surprise revelation to the press that last year alone the Ministry of Security arrested 20 spies and a number of top bosses were discharged following a Ministry of Security report on their contacts with foreign intelligence services. But no names were given although the press was very keen to know who these bosses were and the reason for their dismissal. [Golushko] The former ministry of security did indeed expose a number of spies working for the foreign special services. A number of so-called "go-it-aloners" [initsiativniki] were also uncovered. Criminal proceedings have been instituted against some people and preventive-explanatory work carried out with others. Where possible, we provide the newspapers with specific figures and information. I can tell you, for instance, that in January the FCS arrested a Russian citizen whose activity was doing damage comparable, from preliminary estimates, to that of the Penkovskiy or Tolkachev case. (Shortly before this conversation N.M. Golushko promised IZVESTIYA an exclusive chance to talk about this case. But during the conversation he regrettably confined himself to just a single sentence -- V.Ya.) We realize that journalists and readers need clear facts. But you must understand our position too, we can by no means talk about everything in the interests of the cause, secrets may be revealed in time. [Yakov] Do you think that the FCS will be around for a long time or until the next election when our next leaders will start carving up the special services again, most likely in their own political interests rather than the interests of the state? [Golushko] Sad as it is to admit, but your question does imply the corresponding answer. Although, as I have already told you, there is nothing bad per se in the special services being reorganized, and many highly developed countries are doing this mindful of the global geopolitical changes. But let us not predict whether the FCS will be around for a long time or not. I think that everything will depend on how the service actually proves its effectiveness in defending the interests of the people and the Fatherland. And whether it will be "small change" in politicians' actions and "cops the flak" after they mess up. [Yakov] Have you contemplated your possible retirement? [Golushko] I see that as a natural process and I think that the time will nonetheless come in our country when a change of government will not be a supernatural event and the resignation of individual leaders will cease to appear a tragedy. [Yakov] Thus I see that you are mentally prepared for that twist of fate. But what then -- will you write your memoirs, take up political activity, set up an association to guard banks, go fishing? [Golushko] I will not be setting up any associations. As for writing my memoirs, I have my memories. I know how state security organs work. I have personally been involved in operational work and in investigating a number of notorious cases, and I have been well acquainted with very famous people.... But I have not as yet made any specific plans in this direction, I am not in the mood. [Yakov] Have you deliberately omitted fishing? I deliberately put that question to you in order to get some idea of what you are like outside work. [Golushko] Outside work I used to prefer reading. I was familiar with and loved a great deal of poetry, in particular Pushkin and Yevtushenko. I don't have any particular passions apart from picking mushrooms. But I haven't seen any mushrooms for about two years now. [Yakov] Nikolay Mikhaylovich, Zhirinovskiy once said that if he comes to power he will revive the KGB. If he does indeed come to power, how soon, in your view, will he be able to turn back the clock? [Golushko] It is no longer possible to revive anything now, the things that have gone have disappeared never to return. But there could be completely new organs.
