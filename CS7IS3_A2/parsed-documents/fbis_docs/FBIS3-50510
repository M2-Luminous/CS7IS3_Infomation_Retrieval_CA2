FBIS3-50510 "drlat001_a_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-001 Document Type:Daily Report 3 January 1993 CARIBBEAN Cuba Evening Highlights FL0101170794 FL0101170794 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks in Spanish at 0130 GMT on 30 December carry a recording of the 28 December evening session of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]. The session is called to order by ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada who asks the deputies to try to be as brief as possible in their presentations and to avoid repetition. Alarcon gives the floor to Deputy Zoe de la Cruz who reminds the deputies that many of the issues discussed earlier were repetitions of issues discussed at provincial assemblies and suggests that deputies broach specific rather than overall issues. The chair recognizes Pedro Martinez Pirez as the next speaker. Martinez Pirez begins by saying that "we must all admit that we are responsible for our people's lack of economic culture." He continues to speak of the current situation and the need to adopt measures that will contribute to solving the country's problems. Martinez Pirez recalls that the media has been reporting that a "shock policy" would be implemented and that "thousands would be unemployed as a result of this." The deputy continues to say that "here in Cuba things are not like in other countries where policies are not dictated by governments and parliaments, but by the IMF." Martinez Pirez concludes his presentation by saying that "this ANPP meeting should not conclude without some statement on the measures that should be taken." The deputy stresses that the ANPP should issue a document suggesting the changes that should be made to "save the fatherland, save the Revolution, and save the achievements of socialism." Castro addresses Ricardo Alarcon: "Alarcon, let us see if we can also preserve common sense; it would not be such a bad idea. I want to ask you something: Is adopting measures our goal at this meeting? Martinez Pirez was talking about a series of measures, and I do not know if a series of measures was mentioned in the document. I believe that any hope of adopting measures prior to the conclusion of this meeting is a bit too ambitious. We are practically in diapers on these issues with the material we have presented. On various occasions in the past, we have at least tried to bring to the attention of our comrades that our goal was to think out the problems. We wish to think the problems through. We would really be crazy if we thought we could adopt measures before the conclusion of this meeting that would solve all our problems. "I want to know if everytime something is brought up at this meeting, whether we can just comment on it, or do we have to wait until 55 deputies speak before we can clarify issues such as the ones Martinez Pirez has brought up. He has proposed that we adopt a series of measures. Do we have to wait until the 56th deputy speaks before we clarify that this is not the purpose of this meeting? Do we have to wait until the 56th deputy speaks before 60 more speak to clarify these issues?" Ricardo Alarcon says that during the provincial assemblies, it was made "very clear" that "the purpose of this session was not to adopt measures, but rather to consider, as a group, what could be done to solve these problems." Castro continues: "Someone else talked about the need to create awareness. I believe that what we are trying to do is create an awareness. Others have talked about repeating 24 February, but what would be our goals? To have a repeat 24 February, we would need to have an idea of what we want to do. There is something else I would like to remind you of. I suggested that these issues be discussed at this meeting. It would take us three days to adopt measures. All we need to do is issue another draft bill with four et ceteras. We would have our group of measures. "This is a very sensitive issue. This is not self-employment. This is something that can affect millions of people. It is of high political sensitivity. The ANPP can adopt a series of measures. The day the ANPP adopts a series of measures, it will say: Ladies and gentlemen, these are the measures we have adopted. A series of measures do not all have to be adopted at the same time. We are already adopting measures. "There is one thing that yields more than any amount of taxes. Some say we must produce; that is fine, we must produce. We must produce pants, we must produce textiles. But where is the cloth we need, where is the cotton we need? We must produce rum, but where is the molasses? We must produce beer, but where are the bottles? Where is the barley we need to produce the beer? We have a great many great ideas. Produce. Yes we must produce, but we must produce what we can produce. We cannot produce for the sake of producing. "I was saying that there is something that yields much more than anything we have mentioned here. We can eliminate all subsidies to the sugar industry and agriculture. Doing this would save us 3 billion [currency not specified]. I believe that the creation of the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's] is one of the good measures. There are others. The Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [Minfar] has cut back its budget by 600 million [currency not specified]. These are measures we are adopting. "We must adopt a group of measures. We have not taken the bull by the horns. We have been discussing the implementation of a tax system but no one has told us how much we will receive from those taxes. I believe we all wish to make progress, make some progress. "We must bring Jose Luis [Jose Luis Rodriguez Garcia, minister president of the State Committee for Finance] and Osvaldito [not further identified] here and interrogate them -- in the positive sense of the word. We want them to help us clarify some things. "But the big question is: Do we or do we not seize the money? That is a big question for you, select deputies, to answer. Should we or should we not seize the money? You are talking about the people hearing rumors. Many people do not know what to do with the money they have. They do not know whether they should put it in the bank or dig a 3-meter-deep hole and bury it. [laughter] Should we implement a policy where the money is not seized? Should we or should we not change the currency? I truly would not like to solve that problem here. "Among other things, some of the measures are very complex. I knew this when I suggested that this issue be broached by the ANPP. I will even add that from the very first day this issue was brought up at the ANPP, I knew it was going to represent a problem. I told the comrades at the National Bank to keep very accurate accounts of what happened, from the very day this problem was first mentioned. Who had his money in the bank and who had it buried? There are many people who have [words indistinct]. We cannot assume that those people who do not keep their money in the bank have illegal money. There are people in the habit of keeping their money at home. That is something else. However, many of the illegal street vendors and those involved in dirty businesses have money. Many people still remember the first exchange of money we made. They still remember how it was done. But that is not the issue. "Should we or should we not exchange the money? If we do, then we must be intelligent enough to do it publicly. The last time we did this, it was a big secret. A tremendous secret. We had the money printed in Czechoslovakia, brought it secretly into the country, distributed it, and from one day to another, the measure was implemented. All measures around the world are implemented in this manner. This will be the first time a measure is adopted publicly. But how do we go about doing this? We must find out. Well, that is one subject we must discuss: Should we or should we not change it? "Some deputies have attempted to differentiate between the thieves' money and the honest people's money. Ah, if only it were marked so that we could tell the difference. [laughter] How wonderful that would be. If that were the case, I would immediately suggest one measure, not a group of measures, but at least one measure: Gentlemen, remove all the money that is marked. But money has the same color and shape. We cannot tell the difference between one bill and another. "We must decide whether we should or should not seize the money; whether we should or should not exchange the money. How to do this. We must discuss this publicly. We must decide what policy to follow, taking into consideration the fact that we have two types of money: honest money and the other kind of money. I wonder if anyone involved in finance keeps an inventory of the money on the street. This is a decision the ANPP must make. It must be very well thought out, discussed. What we should do, one way or another. These are key issues. We have already heard 17 speeches on this topic. Many of the comrades have expressed themselves quite well. We cannot deny that. However, we are just going round and round the problem. "We have 10 million [currency not specified]. What do we do with that 10 million? I believe this is a key issue. Martinez Pirez and other comrades, if we were to begin discussing this, it would be quite a discussion. It would be a very big discussion. Let the media say whatever it wants to say. That is their problem, the foreign press and whatnot. We are not discussing dishonest matters. We must not be ashamed of what we are talking about. The most patriotic, brave, healthy, honest thing is to discuss this. The people will understand this. The people will understand the problems if we explain it to them clearly and make them part of our concerns. "A technocratic approach cannot be used to solve these problems. We must not think that technical measures will solve the problems. We must not forget that in this country, honor, patriotism, the sense of dignity and duty of the worker is expressed. We encourage the worker to express himself. If we did not, no problem could be solved. If tomorrow we were to decide to take all the money out of circulation, it would not mean that on the day after tomorrow, all the workers would show up for work. If everyone were to show up for work the day after tomorrow, we would not have enough room for them in our factories. The workers do not have raw materials, electricity, responsibilities, or workshops. Ours is a complex situation. But if we cannot count on the support of the workers who do have a job and a workshop to go to, then we cannot solve our problems. If we did something without the workers' support, it would be a political blunder. "At this meeting, I have not heard a single word from anyone appealing to the patriotism and honor of the worker. A few days ago, I said that most of the people in this country are working out of a sense of honor. Only their sense of honor makes them wake up at the hour they must wake up and find whatever means they can -- bicycle or whatever -- to go to work and fulfill their duty. They do not do it for money. We know that there is very little they can buy with what we pay them. They can only buy a few things at the grocery store because there are only a few things to sell, even if they are sold cheap. There is very little they can buy on the black market because they do not earn enough money to buy on the black market. "If we cannot count on the patriotism and honor of the people and their determination to do whatever [words indistinct] the Revolution, all technical measures we adopt will be useless. We may solve a problem today, but confront complications two, three, or four months later. Therefore, we cannot forget the people. We must never forget that we must keep the people informed. I understand hope; however, I cannot understand the need to conclude this meeting with an approved group of measures. I believe the people's curiosity can be satisfied if we make all that we have discussed here available to the public. This is what we are doing. Members of the ANPP are not the only ones in this hall. There are many witnesses here. The media is here. "This is the first time the ANPP is discussing problems as complex as these. If we wish to see positive results, then we should utilize what time we have left to discuss the heart of the problem. This is what I am proposing, so that we do not have to sit through 25 speeches. I suggest that we invite our two comrades, Osvaldito because he is president of the Institute of Economic Research -- he spoke here and expressed himself quite nicely; others did as well, but he is an expert on this matter -- and Jose Luis. Jose Luis is an expert on this matter and is knowledgeable. Let us begin broaching specific issues. "What is our budget? Jose Luis gave us some information, but let him expand on this matter. How much revenue would we receive from taxes? What kind of taxes should we implement? Will taxes solve the problem? How much do we pay out in social security benefits, wages, and other benefits? Is this a shock policy? Should we lower wages and social security benefits? Should we have cutbacks? Should we continue as we are? What should be taxed? Should we implement a tax system? How much tax should we charge? What measures should we implement? What policies should we implement? This is what we should be discussing if we really want to make progress. We must grab the bull by the horns. You cannot grab a radish by its leaves. "If everyone agrees, and we are not saying that no one else can speak, I would suggest a start on this. I know many of you cannot improvise a speech on specific issues... How many people are scheduled to speak? Alarcon answers: "Twenty." Castro: "Twenty or 22, and more to come. They grow faster than money. [laughter] I suggest we speak in front of witnesses and that we discuss what is proposed. [laughter] I should have added that the discussion be held with specialists on the subject. Let us discuss the issues and make some progress. However, we must do this knowing that we are not going to reach any agreements today. We must all think. You must think and the people must think. After you have thought, then we will talk. The people are aware of the problems we are confronting. Someone conducted a poll: Everyone understands what is going on, but practically no one agrees with the measures. If we do not get the people to understand the problem and accept the measures, then we have achieved nothing. It will be another draft bill with 17 et ceteras. Let us do something and extract something positive from these discussions. This is something new for us, something we have never done before. It is a complex situation, but we are deputies and we were elected to broach issues such as these. We were elected to confront the serious problems. The people may not elect us again after this. By the way, Alarcon, we do not get paid that much. The people can retire all of us." Ricardo Alarcon invites Jose Luis Rodriguez to take the floor. Rodriguez greets the assembly, then says: "I will go directly to the heart of the matter: As we said earlier, we believe this financial imbalance the country is experiencing is not a problem that can be solved effectively by a group of technicians or by the most brilliant group of economists. We agree that it is a big problem and has repercussions on our country and the Revolution. We also agree that it is essentially a political problem. Therefore, anything that is done must be evaluated according to [words indistinct] can be applied. We must evaluate our situation prior to implementing one measure or another. "As has been explained in the past, there is an excess of money on the streets. One of the key elements that contributes to increasing the excess currency, and the commander in chief mentioned it yesterday and today, is the deficit of the state budget. Our deficit has been increasing for the past few years. The reasons for this have been explained in the past. This deficit has been increasing since 1989. According to the report we have already presented, our deficit in 1989 was 1.4 billion [currency not specified]. It increased to 1.958 billion in 1990, and in 1991, it jumped to more than 3.7 billion. Then in 1992, a record year for us, it went up to 4.869 billion, and this year, 1993, it should be a bit lower. The report says that we will be ending the year with a 4.2 billion deficit. "We do not believe the measures adopted contributed to reducing this year's deficit. The drop is the result of certain economic activities undertaken by the country. "Now, regarding the deficit: In the past we had several sources that helped cover the deficit. One source was the loans the country got from abroad. We do not have to tell you that these are no longer available. We also had the money we could collect domestically, and we could cover the deficit by issuing more money. In the past few years, most of the deficit was covered by issuing money domestically. We have been issuing money at a rate of approximately 60 percent. "What is the first thing we learn from this? As far as we are concerned, this is very important. If we do not adopt measures to reduce the deficit, the excess money on the streets is going to increase. The deficit automatically contributes to the excess of money. Therefore, the first thing we should do is study the possibilities of reducing the state's budget deficit. "We must then say, and we mentioned it today when we reported to the ANPP, that contrary to what some comrades believe, the health, education, and not even social security benefits -- and these have shot up in the past few years, these benefits are currently in the amount of 1.5 billion pesos -- do not contribute to increasing our deficit. These three expenses are only 30 percent of the expenses included in the budget. If tomorrow we were to decide to reduce these expenses, we would only be reducing 30 percent of the budget. This, of course, is only a theory because we cannot make these cuts and we will not make these cuts. "For example, health and education: 75 percent of what we spend on health and education falls under the category of wages. We are working on reducing other expenditures. However, because of our country's wage policy, these have not been touched. This means that we are restricted to making cuts in vital areas because we cannot touch the work force. I must honesty say that we, for political, social, and economic reasons, do not agree that these expenditures should be cut substantially because it will not be here where we will find the appropriate solutions." Rodriguez continues to mention the various areas where, according to some, cuts can be made. Rodriguez adds that these cuts would not make much of a difference. Rodriguez continues to mention some of the areas the government could exploit and receive revenue. Parents who want their children to learn to swim or receive special courses in gymnastics can pay for these services. These areas would represent approximately 55 million pesos in revenue for the country. Rodriguez states: "Where does the country spend most of its money? We studied this situation and reached the following conclusion: The country spends its largest amount of money subsidizing the sugar industry and agriculture. During the three years of the special period, 1991, 1992, and 1993, the government has contributed 7.231 billion pesos in these two areas. This represents 54 percent of the deficit in those years. As you said earlier, we must work on this. And we see possibilities." Castro interjects: "That is a key point." Rodriguez responds: "It is a key point." Castro again: "That is a key point." Rodriguez again: "It is." Castro then says: "From the view of what we are discussing, the issue of subsidies is a key point." Rodriguez responds: "Yes it is. Furthermore, when drafting the 1994 budget we not only concentrated on subsidies but also on the financial situation of our state enterprises. Osvaldo mentioned this in his report. "Commander, we have a noticeable lack of discipline where payments are concerned. Our report is through September 1993. When we studied the business sector alone, and we are not including the area included in the budget, we found that the state owes the state 2.821 billion pesos. In other words, these are amounts that one enterprise owes the other but they do not pay." Castro asks: "And this affects the budget?" Rodriguez answers: "Yes it does, and it also represents a loss." Castro asserts: "It may represent a loss but it does not directly influence the excess of money on the streets." Rodriguez responds: "No." And Castro asks: "But they report this as a loss?" Rodriguez answers yes: "Yes. They write it off as a bad debt. These bad debts must be subsidized and the subsidies affect the deficit." Castro remarks: "Now you are talking about subsidies. That is included in the 7 billion you were talking about." Rodriguez says: "Yes. It is an important element. The problem here is not only an economic...." Castro, interrupts: "It is a problem of education as well?" Rodriguez states: "Not only that. From the social viewpoint this is very important. We have started to dig and this is one of the things that contributes to the shifting of large amounts of money. This is an example of the lack of economic control we were talking about earlier. "Since we are on the topic of shifting of large amounts of money I will say that this is one of the [words indistinct]. If you write and bill for services, but do not get paid for the services bill, and the person who receives does not know what he is receiving, does not know what he is supposed to pay, and does not pay, then its havoc. And we are talking 2.8 billion." Castro asks: "In how many months?" Rodriguez responds: "Through 30 September. We have yet to end this year." Castro again: "In one year?" Rodriguez: "We do not have a breakdown because these accounts go back a long time." Castro again: "You are talking 7 billion in three years. What about the 2.8 billion?" Rodriguez: "We have bills dated 60 days, 90 days, and we may even find some a year old." Castro: "A year old. Everyone should close the year by the end of the year. Will the amount increase by the end of the year?" Rodriguez: "We believe it will. It will increase because we have not been able to create an awareness regarding the need to collect due bills. We are beginning to meet with the biggest enterprises, with their directors, to make them understand the importance of this and explain to them that we cannot subsidize them when they have these huge amounts owed them. How can we give money out of the budget to enterprises that do not collect their bills." Castro says: "Give us some examples." Rodriguez: "What?" Castro: "Give us some examples." Rodriguez answers: "I will. For example, the Ministry of Basic Industry [Minbas]. I have brought this up because the other day we met with Marquitos [Minbas Minister Marcos J. Portal] and brought this up." Castro: "How much is the Minbas owed?" Rodriguez: "They are owed 556 million through 30 September." Castro: "Who owes them?" Rodriguez: "The Minbas oil sector is owed 556 million." Castro: "Who owes them that amount?" Rodriguez: "Basically, the retailers." Castro: "The retailers fall under the people's government, do they not?" Rodriguez: "Most of them." Castro: "So who pays?" Rodriguez: "This is something we caught only recently. We are making a file and then we will visit all those enterprises to discuss the bills they owe and are owed, those that must be written off because they are already too old, and which of them can still be paid." Castro observes: "Now this money can increase that excess money on the streets. " Rodriguez: "Yes it can." Castro: "If that money is stolen, where will it go?" Rodriguez: "That is anyone's guess. It can be used for many other things. The fact that you do not pay does not mean that you do not spend. You may spend on other things. Money is shifted from one source to another and you do not pay what you have to pay. " Castro: "[Words indistinct] for example." Rodriguez: "Yes, of course. We find that the foreign trade sector has 835 million owed them." Castro: "And they are not being paid?" Rodriguez: "No, they are not being paid. The import enterprises [words indistinct]." Castro: "Why do they not pay?" Rodriguez: "It seems we have a problem with operations. The enterprises that import the merchandise are not the ones that handle the merchandise. It seems that the billing and collecting mechanism is not working as it should. The enterprise scheduled to receive the merchandise takes it from the port and there is no control by the foreign trade officials. This seems to be the problem. We have yet to determine what the problem is. But they are owed much money. "Commander, we also have the bills to be paid in foreign exchange. I would not like to go into this because we are still investigating, but let me tell you that this involves hundreds of millions. We are not talking 10 or 20 million. A purge is necessary before we can give you...." Castro, interuppting, asks: "What is the problem? Tourism?" Rodriguez responds: "Part of the problem has to do with the tourist sector." Castro observes:: "We know that some of the tourist enterprises hold back payments. They are billed in November and they pay in January. We have to fight to get them to pay. "Are we owed for our exports?" Rodriguez: "Yes, we are. The Ministry of the Fishing Industry is a good example of this." Castro: "This means that they export and do not get paid." Rodriguez: "We have a problem with our collection cycle. We have to find out why it takes so long for us to be able to collect what is owed us. We have money invested there that we cannot move." Castro observes: "This has to do with international ways of doing things. Many pay every three months or every six months. We have to check and see what has been paid and what has not been paid." Rodriguez states: "That is correct. But that is money the country has to recover. We do not know how much it is, but what we are sure of is that we cannot continue to live like this. We must be able to use that money. We must get them to pay what they owe." Castro: "We also owe, do we not? Rodriguez: "Yes we do, but we have to pay. If we do not pay we cannot buy, and our meager imports will drop. "In other words, at this very moment, we are working on a mechanism, a sole mechanism, to determine where all this money is, and why it is not where it should be. This mechanism will help the state do what it must do." Castro asks: "Let us go back to the excess of currency in the country." Rodriguez: "We are talking about the deficit, and all those factors I mentioned contribute to increasing the deficit. The deficit is covered by issuing money, and this measure puts a certain amount of money into circulation each year. If we can reduce the deficit by tackling the problem that increases it, then we do not have to issue that much money next year. This would contribute to strengthening the country's economic policy. If this is possible, we would avoid issuing a large amount of money." Castro comments: "It looks as if the greatest amount of money goes into subsidies." Rodriguez: "And there is a good possibility we can lower those subsidies." Castro: "Continue." Rodriguez adds: "Commander, in addition to this. I must say that solving these problems alone will not help us gradually reduce the amount of excess money on the streets. You asked about taxes. We responsibly tell you that we are proposing a tax system for the country. We have already talked about the need to create an awareness among the people, an awareness that we have lost...." Castro interrupts: "No, no, no. We never had that awareness. The other tax system was a bourgeois tax system." Rodriguez: "We did have a sort of tax system. That is why I mentioned it." Castro: "We paid a direct tax on income?" Rodriguez: "We did, through 1967. We paid 11.9 percent in taxes on our wages." Castro: "That was for social security?" Rodriguez: "No. We also had a 4-percent industrial tax and other taxes. This system was abolished in 1967 and we have not had a tax system since." Castro: "By then, we were owners of our economy." Rodriguez: "Yes." Castro continues: "We had replaced the capitalists who owned the industries and other economic sources. So we did have a tax, but this was a relative tax system. So we paid 11 percent." Rodriguez: "No, 11.90 percent." Castro: "Wages were taxed." Rodriguez: "That is correct; it was deducted by payroll." Castro asks: "Until what year?" Rodriguez: "Until 1967. That same year, 1967...." Castro interrupts: "How much would that 11 percent represent today?" Rodriguez: "We are paying approximately 8.800 billion pesos in wages each year, so that would represent...." Castro interrupts: "That would be 900 million." Rodriguez: "Yes, approximately 900 million. This is a problem we must discuss because you know what it would be like suddenly imposing a tax system on the people. We have told ourselves that we are going to study this issue carefully and see what we can do to introduce an income tax system to the country. We cannot implement this measure without preparation. That is the way we see it. This means that...." Castro: "Which would be more profitable, to establish an income-tax system or a progressive tax on income?" Rodriguez: "That would have to be studied. Even though we have workers who are earning large salaries, they are not a majority. For example, through last year, 65 percent of the families had a monthly per capita income of 100 pesos. This means that only 35 percent earn more than 100 pesos a month. We are considering a family nucleus to be approximately 3.5 people. In other words, they are not a majority. Castro: "What kind of taxes have you been thinking about?" Rodriguez answers: "We have been thinking about income tax and business tax. Some taxes are currently being paid. The self-employed are being taxed." Castro: "How much revenue can we collect from the tax the self-employed is paying?" Rodriguez: "The self-employed are currently paying 49.90 percent, and 90 percent of the self-employed are paying their taxes -- but the system was only implemented two months ago, so we have to wait a while longer to see if they continue to do it. According to our estimates, next year we should be receiving approximately 126 million pesos; that is, if we do not raise taxes. If we raise taxes, we can receive more. We believe taxes should be raised. Only two provinces, Las Tunas and Cienfuego, have raised their taxes. Today we learned that Pinar del Rio is also working on this. However, we have not implemented the resolution on a basic minimum tax which was discussed here this morning. The other day we were telling the presidents...." Castro interrupts: "Do you support the idea that other products and services must be taxed, or only income?" Rodriguez: "We believe that we should implement a progressive tax on income system. This calls for one specific mechanism." Castro: "What is that?" Rodriguez: "The filing of an income tax return." Castro then asks: "Have you thought about this?" Rodriguez: "Yes we have, commander, but...." Castro interrupts: "Rest assured I did not steal your idea. I also suggested that." Rodriguez: "Commander, the problem is that...." Castro interrupts: "And what happens to the person who tries to evade filing the return?" Rodriguez: "If I am not mistaken, he will be fined 500 pesos." Castro: "Is that all?" Rodriguez: "That is for first-time offenders. Seizures and other punishments are also being considered." Castro: "Have other types of punishments been established?" Rodriguez: "Other types of punishments have been suggested. The problem is that...." Castro interrupts: "You are talking about petty fines. If you read our penal and civil codes, you will see that the fines are ridiculous. They were established when the peso was worth something. Today, anyone who legally earns 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 pesos, or makes 10,000 illegally, does not care at all if he must pay that amount in fines. I understand that many of those so-called countries have strong punishments for tax evaders." Rodriguez: "Tax evasion can entail eight to 10 years in jail. Let me tell you something else...." Castro interrupts: "The people will only file a return if they know that if they fail to do so they will go to jail." Rodriguez: "We are now asking that tax evasion be considered a crime. This was abolished in 1967. We are suggesting jail sentences for evaders." Castro: "There was no need for this because we did not have a tax system." Rodriguez: "That is correct, but if we are going to implement a tax system today, then we must establish that tax evasion is a crime." Castro: "I am just asking. For the people to pay and respect the tax system, it is necessary to establish some type of punishment. This must include jail; otherwise, we will have evaders. An income tax return is an instrument to collect taxes should you one day implement the progressive income tax." Rodriguez: "We are suggesting both: fines and jail sentences. We are also suggesting confiscation of the produced goods and the means of production." Castro: "That is nothing. Anyone would say that you are thinking of a car factory and that you are going to seize the factory. Right now, all you would seize would be a stand or a coach." Rodriguez: "Perhaps." Castro: "It would not take these people 10 days to set up another stand and coach." Rodriguez: "It is not that cheap to do, Commander." Castro: "With the money they have, they can do it. How much does a coach cost today?" Rodriguez: "That depends on the type of coach. There are coaches that cost 10,000 pesos." Castro: "That would be a [word indistinct]." Rodriguez: "No, no, no. The usual coach. There are comrades from the provinces who have more up-to-date information on that." Castro: "Great, they will have paid it off in three months. But there are others who do not have stands or coaches and have many ways of making much money." Rodriguez: "We are working on another idea, commander." Castro: "What are you going to seize from a messenger? His feet?" Rodriguez: "We will have to think of other types of punishment." Castro: "What?" Rodriguez: "We must think of other types of punishment." Castro: "Seizing property may be of some value, but I do not think it will work. If you are going to implement a progressive income tax system for the self-employed, and want the system respected and the tax paid, you need to do more than just file an income tax return. You need strict punishment for evasion. There are laws for this in the United States and in Europe. If they did not have them, people would not pay their taxes. These mechanisms must be accompanied by others." Rodriguez: "We are studying those proposals. We are being careful to ensure that the control system will not be more expensive than what we are going to control." Castro: "You have just proven that no matter how much you do, you will only collect some 200 million in taxes [words indistinct]. Now if we were to implement a general income tax, like the 11- percent you were talking about, the state would receive much more, right?" Rodriguez: "Yes." Castro: "It is a lot easier to collect that tax." Rodriguez: "All you have to do is deduct the tax from the workers' pay." Castro: "And that represents approximately 800 or 900 million. That is something. So what other taxes are we talking about?" Rodriguez: "Of those that directly affect the people, the ones we have mentioned are the most important at this time. We are studying taxing other areas, but they do not affect the people, at least not directly. We are studying the possibility of taxing several products, especially cigarettes and alcoholic beverages." Castro: "Since this has been brought up here, I want all of you to know that in 1970, we established a tax on nonessential products. We solved that famous budget deficit and the excess of money on the streets. It was that tax that did it. However, there is something different that has not been mentioned here. "Back then, we had an excess of money on the streets, but we did not have that scarcity of merchandise we are experiencing today. Today we have both things: excess money and a tremendous scarcity of merchandise. [Words indistinct] deficit, but we had things to buy. We had more than enough money, but we had things we could purchase." Rodriguez: "And we could import goods." Castro: "The tax on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages basically solved the deficit." Rodriguez: "This year we should be able to collect some 3.300 billion in taxes on those products. However, we need 600 million more to cover the deficit. This is basically due to the problems that we have had with production." Castro: "We do not have cigarettes, rum, beer. This effects us. Back in 1970, we had enough beer and cigarettes to satisfy the demand. There is a strong demand for those items. I recall that in 1970, a spontaneous sort of dry law was established. This was because some factories stopped producing. Today we do not have cigarettes. We do not have the raw materials or electricity to produce cigarettes. All that. Continue." Rodriguez continues: "That is all for taxes. In this initial phase, aimed at removing the excess money from the streets, we do not believe that the tax system would be a significant means of removing that excess money. It would be helpful to the economy. The tax is not only for people, but for the enterprises, including the mixed enterprises. We have other sources, but these are not directly related to the excess money in the hands of the people. "Now, about the excess money: You asked a question about measures that should be implemented in regard to seizure or exchange of money. I will now tell you what I know about this. I believe we...." Castro: "Let us take a break here." Rodriguez: "What?" Castro: "Let us take a break." Rodriguez: "If you want to." Castro: "Let us ask the deputies what they think. Let them tell us their views before you give us yours." Rodriguez: "About what?" Castro: "Seizure of money; we want to hear some ideas without putting this matter to a vote. Also ideas about the exchange of money. Ideas as to whether we should give up some of these ideas if your mechanisms do not solve the problem." At 0250 GMT Ricardo Alarcon is heard to say that there are several deputies who wish to express their views on the subject. The first deputy to speak is Leonel Gonzalez from Cabaiguan Municipality. Castro immediately interrupts him to ask: "How many of you have thought this problem out? How many of you have discussed this problem among yourselves? Be honest and raise your hands. Fine. Those of you who have not thought about this, raise your hands. This does not mean that you agree with the measures. Just if you have thought about this. We cannot ask you to give your opinion; all we want to know is who has thought about this problem and discussed it. Fine. Continue, comrade." Gonzalez begins to speak about the exchange of money. Castro interrupts to ask: "First of all, in your opinion, what is an exchange?" Gonzalez continues to explain what he thinks an exchange is and what he believes should be done. Gonzalez suggests that the government freeze the money that is in the bank, to which Castro responds: "The money that is in the bank does not affect the phenomenon created by the excess of money on the streets. We have launched campaigns for people to save money in the bank. If a man earned 100,000 pesos and put it in the bank, he is not in the least affecting the situation. The problem is the person who has 100,000 pesos and is spending it on the black market; buying cheaper and selling for a profit. We promote savings. It keeps the money off the street. Inflation and trouble are caused by the money on the streets, not the money that is saved. Many countries encourage their citizens to save as a means to keep inflation down. Let us call the excess of money an inflationary phenomenon. This would happen here if we did not have the ration book for certain articles, if there were free sales. But, you are just expressing your views. As far as you are concerned, you would put a freeze on excess money." Gonzalez continues to express his views. Next, Ricardo Alarcon recognizes Ramon Fernandez as the next speaker. Fernandez mentions the fact that there are too many workers in certain sectors and suggests that the excess manpower be put to work in other areas or on the land to produce food, to which Castro replies: "Then we start running out of land and we transfer them to Guira de Melena and there are too many people already in Guira de Melena. For the first time, and only since the creation of the UPBC, are we finding that some of these agricultural enterprises are admitting that they have too many workers. What do we do with the excess manpower?" Fernandez admits to Castro that this is a challenge. Castro asks: "What kind of a challenge -- to a sword fight, to a shootout?" Fernandez adds that for these cases, the government has implemented a system to protect laid-off workers. The chair then recognizes Tomas Pagan who also presents his views on the exchange of money and comments on Jose Luis Rodriguez' statement on outstanding debts among the various state enterprises. Castro interrupts to ask Rodriguez: "We have mentioned the worrisome issue of the outstanding debts among the enterprises. Are these outstanding debts included in the 7 billion utilized to subsidize various sectors? We are not very clear on this. What happens to that money? It is said that it could be a source for shifting of money from one place to another as well as other things. What is clear is that we must cover those 7 billion and that this represents 54 percent of the deficit. These outstanding debts, as far as I understood, represent losses for the state. When does this represent a loss? Can you tell us how much of those losses have unavoidably been covered by the budget? It would be nice to know how much; whether it is 800, 500, 900 million or 1 billion." Rodriguez: "We are looking into this. The problem is that we have not been able to...." Castro interrupts: "When we speak of approximately 3 billion in subsidies to the Ministry of the Sugar Industry [Minaz] and the agriculture sector are we talking only subsidies?" Rodriguez: "Subsidies." Castro: "Is this based on bills that must be collected?" Rodriguez: "Some of it could." Castro: "Some of it?." Rodriguez: "Some of it." Castro says: "You mentioned 7 billion in three years." Rodriguez: "Yes." Castro: "But a few days ago the Minaz and Agriculture ministers told us that those two areas received 3 billion in subsidies. What would happen if we cut off all subsidies?" Rodriguez: "Commander, I will answer that for you. A few days ago we made up a list of the enterprises that are making no profit. If you should cut off subsidies to those enterprises, you would be cutting off subsidies to 69 percent of the enterprises in the country; 31 percent of our enterprises are profit-making and 69 percent make no profit." Castro: "In other words, we would lose those enterprises. We would have to close them." Rodriguez: "Well, we either close them or do something else. However, if their subsidies are cut, they would not have the money to operate." Castro: "We would have to close the 158 sugar mills. They fall under that category. The sugar mills are not making profits. Can we close them? What should we do? What happens if we close our 158 sugar mills?" Rodriguez: "We cannot do that. What we should do is...." Castro interrupts: "What happens if we close the Moa and Nicaro mines?" Rodriguez: "You do not have to do that, but we could do what was done this year. You can stop the operations when it is not profitable to produce for export purposes." Castro: "Of course, when it is not profitable, but the workers are getting paid." Rodriguez: "Exactly." Castro: "And you have to find the money to pay the workers." Rodriguez: "That is correct. That case is perfectly justified. The only subsidies that are not justified are those allocated to poorly managed areas. Those are the areas we must pinpoint here." Castro: "Yet I believe that the measures adopted in the area of agriculture will considerably reduce subsidies to that area." Rodriguez: "Correct." Castro continues: "Perhaps even more than all you can collect in taxes." Rodriguez: "Probably." Castro: "Now tell me, of the subsidies allocated for the sugar industry how much goes to the sugar mills and how much goes to the agriculture sector." Rodriguez: "This year the agriculture...." Castro interrupts: "The sugar cane agriculture." Rodriguez: "In 1994 we are allocating approximately 300 million in subsidies." Castro: "And the sugar mills?" Rodriguez: "The sugar mills will be receiving approximately 400 million." Minaz Minister Juan Ramon Herrera: "In the past, the sugar cane agricultural sector received 600 million. With the [words indistinct] we had calculated 600 million for the sugar cane agriculture. Approximately 400 million are to be allocated to the sugar industry; that involves all the sugar activities." Castro: "Only a few days ago you told me that subsidies to your area were in the amount of 1.2 billion." Herrera: "No, it is 1.002 billion." Castro: "One billion plus 2 million?" Herrera: "That is correct. Not 1.2 billion but 1.002 billion." Castro: "And what about the agriculture sector." Rodriguez: "We have estimated we will allocate this year approximately 300 million to the sugar cane UBPC." Castro: "By this year do you mean 1993?" Rodriguez: "No. We do not have the Minaz' 1993 breakdown for the agricultural sector." Herrera: "Minaz will close 1993 with 1.7 billion." Castro continues: "You will close with 1.7 billion. And how much did you allocate for 1994?" Rodriguez: "We suggested a reduction for 1994. We suggested reducing subsidies to the sugar industry, Agriculture Ministry, and UBPC by 800 million." Castro: "You have already included this in the budget?" Rodriguez: "Yes." Castro: "You included the reduction in the 1994 budget?" Rodriguez: "Yes, we have." Castro: "That is an adopted measure." Rodriguez: "Yes, it is." Castro: "Is it the measure or one of the measures?" Rodriguez: "One of the measures." Castro: "Right. Alarcon, this is very interesting. The comrades are talking among themselves about what is being said. [laughter] Listen to them, they are talking." [laughter] Ricardo Alarcon recognizes Deputy Agustin Delgado who once again broaches the issue of exchange and his opinion of how this problem can be solved. He asks whether anyone knows how much excess money is out on the streets. He believes the "enemy of the Revolution" is encouraging the people to refrain from putting the money in the bank, thus undermining the Revolution. Delgado stresses his trust in the economists to which Castro says: "You do, but I do not. [laughter] Economists frighten me. There is only one thing I know a little about and that is politics. That has been my job, the most important job I have had. I believe that things must be viewed through politics. The ideas presented by the specialists must be analyzed from a political viewpoint. Our best economists are those who can suggest and draft measures with a political meaning. If they are going to propose something that technically may be good, but politically catastrophic, our mission and duty is to stop them and reject what they are proposing. We must combine economy and policy. "I would like to say as well that I know peasants who have never sold a single pound of their products on the black market and have hundreds of thousands of pesos in the bank." Delgado: "Commander, but if...." Castro interrupts: "I know some. Great people." Delgado: "But commander...." Castro: "Not all peasants are like that. For the past 20 or 25 years they have been harvesting tubers, vegetables, and potatoes. They are self-sufficient and do not have too many expenses. These are the people who make you stop and think. I wish that peasant's money had a little mark on it. There are some who have much money but who did not earn that money legally. They got the money through manipulations and the black market. "Now regarding those of you who are advising others to save or not to save, I will say nothing about that. I will not take sides." Delgado: "Excuse me commander, if that honest peasant...." Castro: " If we are going to adopt measures, we must not overlook your suggestions and opinions. That would not be correct. I truly believe we should adopt measures, but we have not reached a final decision. We have not covered every single angle. However, we are very interested in knowing what you think about this. It is necessary that we know how each of you feel because this helps us reach a decision on what measures to adopt. This helps create an awareness. "It is quite obvious that once this meeting has concluded we will leave this meeting place with much more information, a clearer view of the problem. We will know more about the problem than we did when we walked into this hall this morning." Delgado: "That is correct and this is why...." Castro: "This is why it is important that we know how you think. However, I also believe that it is too soon for us to commit ourselves. However, it is extremely valuable to learn how you think. "There is something the people believe in and they are not mistaken in doing so. Above all, the Revolution will protect the interests of the people. That will always come first. The Revolution will leave no one unattended. This is an unquestionable principle." [applause] Ricardo Alarcon then gives the floor to Deputy Marcia Febles, Trinidad Municipality, Sancti Spiritus Province. Febles reports on developments in her area and her views on the exchange. The chair then recognizes Deputy Raul Gomez Cabrera, who also expresses his views on the exchange of currency. The chair recognizes Deputies Hector Rodriguez Almaral and Luis Oscar Galvez, who also express their views on the topics broached, in particular the seizure or exchange of money. Castro then says: "I wish to clarify something. I brought up the issue of seizing money. In 1961 we seized the money in the country and we seized the money of the bourgeoisie. They did not have their money in the banks. Back in 1961 we did not touch the money in the banks; we only seized some of the money, not all of it. I talked about this and exchange because they are two of an arsenal of measures that could be adopted. I also talked about taxes. I wanted to find out about taxes, how much these taxes would yield, how much tax the people would have to pay, how much we would save if the people had to pay for school uniforms, if we did not pay for plastic surgery operations, and if we did not cover the costs of the special schools for girls interested in taking classes in gymnastics. I do not know how the National Institute for Sports feels about all this. Perhaps we should hear what they have to say about this, about their schools. I imagine they have their own schools, just as the music sector does. "We wanted to be specific; however, since this is one of the most touchy topics in this arsenal of possible measures, we wanted to discuss it. It is an important topic and we have been [words indistinct]. "You have said something that is true. No country announces currency exchanges; no country announces devaluations. No parliament in the world discusses problems of this nature. I believe this is the only parliament in the world where issues such as these are discussed, as we are doing. We are discussing the issue in front of you, the world, and the press. One must have courage to do something like this. We can do it. But the fact that we can do it does not mean that we will not do it. If we wanted to, we could announce a currency exchange tomorrow. There are ways to do this. We could do it tomorrow and it would cost us only a few dollars. It would be senseless for us to suggest this as one in the arsenal of measures, if it were impractical or too costly. We are discussing this matter from the political viewpoint. We are trying to establish whether or not it is an appropriate move, whether or not it would be a savings. We are discussing the measures' advantages and disadvantages. We are discussing them to get all the information we need, not because it is impossible for us to do. It will also be up to us whether we seize part of the money and leave the rest. "There are many solutions. What we need is awareness and knowledge. One of the reasons we are discussing all this is because there are many people who want the problem confronted and solved but do not agree with the measures that would solve the problem. As I said earlier, it is very necessary that we have the people's understanding of the measures to be adopted. There is no doubt that the measures adopted must be intelligent measures. We are discussing and questioning because we hope to find the best solution to this delicate problem. This problem is the result of the situation we are experiencing. You must realize that we are looking for solutions to the problem of excess currency under abnormal conditions. The other countries are experiencing normal conditions, yet they are devaluating their currency. Mexico did it. When Mexico devaluated its currency, it was exporting in large quantities, had a lot of oil, and was not experiencing a blockade. Devaluation is the same as seizing currency. The Mexican peso was 12.5 to a dollar, and from one day to another, it went to 250 pesos to a dollar. Devaluation and seizing currency are the same things. Devaluation is a systematic seizure of money and workers everywhere fight for raises. If there is 10-percent inflation, they ask for at least a 9-percent, even 8-percent, raise. As inflation goes up, the workers continue to ask for raises. They get raises, but their wages are really getting cut by 50 percent. "We do not know what an inflation phenomenon is all about. We have been lucky to have the sacred ration book, the blessed ration book. Perhaps one day, someone will explain how it has been possible for the Revolution to do all that it has done. All that was done has not been based on foreign cooperation alone. Simply put, the people in this country have been the ones who financed the building of schools, roads, and so forth. When we did not have the money to build a hospital, that hospital would be built. Why? Because we had the ration book. Without the ration book, our budget would have required complete balance to keep the prices down. We built thousands of schools, hundreds and hundreds of hospitals, many things, and the liter of milk never went up a single cent. The price of meat and food did not go up. I am talking about that golden era when the products in the ration book were much more numerous than today. "I have always been aware that the people financed the social and economic development of this country. We did not have a budget; we had no income to build these things. The amount of currency on the streets increased, but the people continued to get their products every month, and always at the same price. "I never heard anyone in this country ask if we had a budget for [words indistinct] and the people's governments know this. Ever since the people's governments were established, all they have done is build and do things, invent things. Ever since 1976, the people's governments have done everything they wanted to do. However, no one ever asked if the state had a budget for what they wanted to do. They never asked if there was money for what they wanted to do. Just having the plan and the need was enough. Back then we had enough cement, steel, and lumber. The wages, the money to pay those wages, came from the Ministry of Finance. And this had been the case for these past 30 years. Under normal conditions, the people financed all the work done. This was done without inflation. Prices were never freed. Had we freed our prices we would not have been able to do all this. Had we freed our prices we would have had a constant increase in prices. Only as the years went by did the prices of certain products go up. "Today we are facing a problem similar to the one we had in 1970. There is an excess of money. There is so much money that the people are not interested in money. Many people can live with the wages earned by one member of the family. This also happened in 1970. "You have talked about encouragement for work done. You should also talk about the need to work. Man works because he needs to work. Excess money results in some people not working because they do not need the money. Others do not work -- like the comrade from Trinidad said -- because they would rather be self-employed. Another comrade mentioned the risk of all workers in the crafts sector deciding to become self-employed. However, I have asked the people responsible for the crafts centers about this and they have told me that not too many workers have left. Many workers have grown accustomed to the centers; they get the raw material they need, and they are being taken care of. We must struggle to keep those workers and make sure they stay with us. I believe that gathering up that excess currency will contribute to the people needing work. Encouragement is something else. There is not much material encouragement we can give, but whenever we can, we do give it. "We are talking about finding a financial balance and solving the problem of excess currency at a time when the socialist bloc no longer exists and our imports have dropped by 78 percent. We are talking about all this at a time when the blockade is stronger than ever, and during the special period. We are talking about all this amid an international economic crisis. When other countries faced similar problems, they did not endure what we are enduring. It is much more difficult for us. However, we are not afraid to tackle the problem. The Revolution demands that we do what we must with the support and understanding of the people. "I can recall that the cigarette issue underwent much discussion. It was an issue on which we could not agree, so we decided to ask as many people for their opinions as we could. We even asked the people's councils for their views on this and that. The opinion of others has not always been the best solution to our problems. I could mention many things we discussed, and the solutions derived from these discussions turned out to be worse than if we had not discussed them. The decision we made on cigarettes is one of them. The decision we made on cigarettes is one of them. [Castro repeats himself] We found ourselves facing the problem of [words indistinct] find a way to increase the price of cigarettes. We had a standing quota and it was not appropriate. The Executive Council had reached specific conclusions, but when we broached this issue with the commission responsible for organizing the last congress, we could not reach an agreement; we could not get a consensus. It was then that we decided to consult other people, including the people's councils, but no agreement was reached. The truth, the big truth, is that another cigarette quota was implemented. That crazy quota of providing cigarettes to everyone who was 18 years of age and above. But it is impossible to keep an inventory of who smokes and who does not smoke; everyone 18 years of age or older got cigarettes. Since many of those people do not smoke, they would sell their cigarettes. The black market now has more sources. Today we have more sources. Anyone who can get his hands on a pack of U.S.-made cigarettes is a source for the black market. People receive new or worn clothes and sell them here at outrageous prices. Anyone traveling today and bringing back 10 kg of medicine -- something we authorized to help those who needed medicine that the State could not provide because it did not have the money to buy it -- becomes a source for the black market. All the money that comes into the country today, every single dollar that finds its way to a store, becomes a source for the black market. Anyone receiving $100 can purchase products at the foreign exchange stores and sell those products for thousands of dollars. There are many factors that promote a black market. Excess currency is not the only factor, even though it worsens the problem. There are many factors that promote this situation [words indistinct] evil, a sickness that we have to live with [words indistinct] finding solutions under the most difficult conditions. I believe that what we are doing is the most appropriate, honest, and loyal thing we can do for the people. "We are only interested in the people knowing what we are doing. Whose understanding do we need? The people's. Those who have illegal money do not know what to do with it. They are being creative with their money. If they get nervous, that is their problem. It is their problem if they do not have a clear conscience. However, the honest people of this country should harbor no worries at all. [applause] [Words indistinct] from the arsenal of things. Adopting some of these measures will represent a sacrifice. If you are going to charge the people for uniforms, that will represent a sacrifice. Perhaps the lady who has 100 pesos will have to buy a uniform. I do not know. Some here have suggested that we subsidize the people without making a commitment to subsidize them. This does not mean that the person who earns minimum wage and must buy uniforms, if uniforms are subsidized, must go to the social security office to get a ticket [preceding word in English] and pay for the uniform. If we were to do this, we would never get rid of our excess currency. "Taxing of certain articles increases the price of the article. I believe this tax should be applied to nonessential products, but any cut in subsidies would increase the price of essential products. We must check and see how high those prices would be and make sure that the people can still afford to purchase those articles. Any of those measures, such as taxing certain articles, will represent a sacrifice for the people. No matter how minimal the tax, if we implement a general tax, such as the one Jose Luis said was abolished in 1967, it will represent a sacrifice. "I see no possibility of us straightening out this mistake, this unavoidable mistake [words indistinct] someone's whims. It is precisely the Revolution's basic sense of justice, its basic need to protect the people, the basic need to maintain the rights and achievements of the Revolution, that force us to make sure that no one is left unattended, that not a single recently graduated university student is jobless, that a middle-level technician be jobless. And this is what has led us to this situation. This is nothing new, we could see it coming. It led us into the special period. This situation was unavoidable. Yesterday we were talking about recovering the sugarcane industry. The situations are quite similar. Did someone here whimsically or capriciously cause the drop in production? We were actually attempting to increase our production. We were seeking to produce 10 million [not further specified]. We were seeking to produce 10 million, using the same amount of land. The drop in sugar production is the result of the special period and as we said yesterday, we are seeking to increase production in accordance with the special period. That is why we kept asking so many questions about land, fertilizer, yields, et cetera. "However, we must all know that, despite the measures we adopt, it will not be possible to straighten out this situation if we do not solve all the problems first, and everyone must know that we will not be able to solve them immediately. It will take some time to solve all these problems and it will not be possible to solve them without some sacrifice. We must be aware of this and the people must be aware of this. "We are going to continue debating all this. We are going to continue debating. And there is something else. As I explained before, measures on this subject are already being taken. We cannot wait to have a complete package. It is even possible that it might not be appropriate as a package, but as a group of successive measures inspired by certain specific principles. These are the principles we are trying to define here. We do not have to wait for another meeting. Perhaps we need to meet again just for this, and to continue the discussion. The next time we will be more knowledgeable, will have a higher level of information. Perhaps we can meet for two days and discuss principles. I do not think you would mind meeting here again. I do believe some of the principles have been clarified. Jose Luis talked about measures to be adopted this year in the hope of reducing expenditures. We are working hard to create UBPC's. This should represent a reduction in expenditures. We must work to curb increases. Whatever we can save in the budget is an adopted measure. We must then work on the other measures. We must decide whether we tax certain articles; whether we should implement a general tax; whether we should eliminate certain gratuities, not because they would represent a savings, but rather because they would create an awareness, which must be strengthened in these times. Once we have overcome this situation, we will be much more efficient. We will no longer be thinking of the millions we can make, but will rather create an economic awareness among the people, so they value what they have. Let us wait and see what comes out of this meeting, what the rank and file have to say, what the people have to say about this. I hope our media will report on this broadly, thus helping you and all of those deputies the people will elect in the next election. "The next time we meet, everyone will have a great deal of information on all these ideas so that we can continue to discuss principles. I repeat, this does not mean that we will not begin to adopt measures as of now, basic and obvious measures aimed at saving. No one is going to object to this. No one will object to attempts aimed at increasing production. However, I can assure you that the efforts we are making are truly desperate efforts aimed at increasing production. Have no doubt about this. No comrade has been sitting with his arms crossed. Everyone is working in all areas to increase production. Everyone is doing his best to achieve this despite the situation. "It is obvious that we cannot discuss all our problems here. There are many things that must be done with discretion. Marti was very clear when he said: There are things that must be done discreetly or they will not get done because the enemy will sabotage them. There are things we must do, and whatever we do cannot be sabotaged. They [the enemy] will be even less able to do so if the people are aware, if the people understand them [the measures]. We need the people to understand them. We do not expect the people to applaud. Everytime we need to make a sacrifice, the people feel it. And if we have to make certain sacrifices, what we need is for the people to understand them because these sacrifices are unavoidable, sacrifices that we have to make. What we have to attain is the people's support for these policies. That is what we must seek. "Before the other deputies speak, I suggest that we start thinking about an extraordinary meeting to discuss these issues. I suggest that the meeting be held as soon as possible. [applause] The enemy will then find out if we are or are not brave. The hoarders and peddlers will then realize that they cannot fool the Revolution, that the Revolution is stronger and has more resources than they imagine. "I do not think we need to take a break. How many more speakers are scheduled?" Alarcon answers: "Twenty-two." Castro exclaims: "What do you mean, 22? Ducks do not play 22 in the lottery [en la charada 22 no es pato]." [laughter] Unidentified speaker: "Frog plays 22." Castro: "Frog? No it cannot be. Goats play 28? I used to play the lottery. I believe someone suggested the establishment of a national lottery to solve the budget problem. I do not know if they want to include the illegal lottery [bolita] as well. We must respect the comrade's idea. I do not wish to hurt his feelings, I am just citing his idea as an example. When the provincial meetings were held, all this was discussed. "Alarcon, analyze this idea thoroughly and decide if your deputies need a break, or if they can continue. If you think they want to continue, we will continue, otherwise we will take a short recess so that everyone can make a technical stopover. Then we can continue to talk about all this." Ricardo Alarcon declares a 20-minute recess. When the meeting resumes, Alarcon recognizes and gives the floor to Carlos Lage who wishes "to make a specific proposal." Lage supports Jose Luis Rodriguez' statement on the amount of money owed among the various enterprises. He asks that a list be made with the names of the enterprises and the amounts owed by them and owed them for these to be "discussed at the extraordinary meeting." At approximately 0500 GMT, Alarcon asks the deputies if they wish to speak or would rather wait until the extraordinary session is held. The deputies relinquish their right to speak and Alarcon begins to summarize Castro's views on the various topics, suggesting that all debates be postponed until the extraordinary session. He asks that the deputies study what has been said and be prepared to continue these debates "when we take up the subject again at the extraordinary session." The second ordinary session of the ANPP concludes at approximately 0520 GMT with the singing of the national anthem.
