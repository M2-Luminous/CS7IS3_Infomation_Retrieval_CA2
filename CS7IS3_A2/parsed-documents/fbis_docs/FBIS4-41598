The Russian military contingent deployed in the security area on either side of the Inguri river at an equal distance of 12 km is estimated to number 2,500 men. Izida Chanin, head of the information section at the Abkhaz Information and Press Ministry told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today that 1,400 Russian paratroopers are serving on Abkhaz territory. In her words, the paratroopers are guarding the most vital facilities in Galskiy Rayon, including a hydroelectric power station on the Inguri river. A tough curfew is in force in the area, and the areas in which the peacekeepers are deployed are patrolled on the ground and from the air. The Abkhaz authorities say that the deployment of the peacekeeping forces proceeded without incident, with not a single post coming under fire. The Abkhaz Information and Press Ministry reports that this assessment coincides with the view of the joint command headquarters of the group of Russian peacekeeping forces. The peacekeeping forces are expected to be deployed at all checkpoints and control and observation posts by 29 June, and by 30 June the remaining Georgian armed formations are to be withdrawn from the Kodori Gorge to areas outside Abkhazia under the supervision of UN representatives.
