Information on weapon exports is usually secret, unless the head of the inter-departmental commission monitoring exports gives permission to disclose specific data. Having received such permission, Buda said, "Hungary's Government has not had any contact with military forces in South Yemen in the past three years, as it officially recognizes the Sanaa government, and there cannot have been any legal weapon deliveries from Hungary to Yemen without an official end-use guarantee from this government." "Under a decree issued to Hungary's inter-departmental commission monitoring exports, the delivery of weapons to crisis zones is prohibited. Accordingly, Hungarian weapons cannot have been exported to Yemen, even with Saudi Arabian assistance. In addition, the falsehood of such rumours is obvious from the fact that Hungary has no weapons for sale of the type mentioned by the press." Foreign Ministry Spokesman Janos Herman told MTI that the Hungarian ambassador to Yemen has visited their Foreign Ministry twice in order to assure all the officials concerned that these rumours have no grounds. Hungary's official statement on the issue has been acknowledged.
