Opinions on the subject vary. Some people are satisfied: This year everything else is going up, but household-use electricity prices are steady. The price of household electric power in the Beijing region is 0.164 yuan per kilowatt-hour (including a municipal public service fee of 0.14 yuan which goes into local revenues). This was the price in 1958 and this was the price in the first half of this year. Some people complain that state-set electricity prices are too low, and that there is an urgent need to raise them. Some people are angry: "Going up again? It's costing us about a yuan per kilowatt-hour already. Is there any rhyme or reason to it?" Some people sound a warning note: "There's already a lot of pressure to raise everything, so they shouldn't be in any hurry to raise electricity prices." Some people are impatient: "I'm not in the mood to talk about the price of electricity: what I'm concerned with is the power shortage. The power's just on and off here. Why doesn't the state put a little more effort into it?" Everybody thinks that he is right. In the past few years, the reform of the price of electricity has made some progress and has taken a few steps. The program for more thorough reform of electricity prices that was issued this July resulted in a rise in household electricity prices, which had been steady for several decades. It, too, brought forth a chorus of differing opinions. Just what are we to think about electricity prices? If State Electricity Prices Are Not Adjusted, the Electric Power Industry Will Lose Money Across the Board The electric power industry relies on the extensive form of expanded reproduction: the more power you want to generate, the more equipment you need; and the more equipment you need, the larger the investment that is required. Where does the investment come from? That the electric power industry should rely primarily on the funds that it accumulates itself and should engage in self-supporting development is a basic principle of electric power development throughout the world. In Japan, 80 percent of the funding for the expanded reproduction of the 10 largest companies is furnished by the companies themselves. But countries differ greatly in their circumstances. China's centrally subordinate power companies had a debt of fully 96.7 billion yuan at the end of 1992 and the amount is rising at a rate of more than 10 billion yuan a year. This crushing burden gives them no breathing space. The principal cause of the problem is the price of electricity. Up to 1985, power industry construction in China was supported primarily by the central authorities, and the electricity price structure was uniform, with the prices set by the state (i.e., directive pricing). When the prices of fuel and transportation were raised, there was a corresponding rise in the price charged for electric power; thus, state-specified prices for electric power, which had not previously been adjusted, rose somewhat. Although the rise in the price of electric power compensated most of the great increase in power production costs that was brought about by increased fuel and transportation prices, the contribution of materials and equipment to power production costs had to be covered entirely by the enterprises themselves, and, as a result, the full cost of power production was still not adequately compensated by the price of electricity. In 1992, the cost of producing a kilowatt-hour of electricity in the centrally subordinate power companies was 2.5 times what it had been in 1980, but the average price charged for electricity had increased by a factor of only 1.3. As a consequence, the profit on each unit sold had decreased by 50 percent. The profitability rate of funds was 14.5 percent in 1985 but only 3.13 percent in 1992, far lower than the current Construction Bank interest rate on loans for electric power construction (11.16 percent for periods of five years or more). All of the earnings so arduously accumulated by the centrally subordinate power companies were inadequate to cover even the interest on the loans. Under last year's conditions, they lost nearly 20 yuan on each 100 yuan of expenditures. Since they were unable to accumulate funds, an infusion of funds from outside was unlikely. After the policy of replacing state allocations by loans was instituted in 1980, it was long impossible to recover electric power construction funds invested by the central authorities, and it became increasingly difficult to increase investments in electric power. In 1991, investments by the central authorities had fallen to 45.6 percent of total national investments in capital construction for electric power, compared with 81.6 percent in 1985. Borrowing money from banks was even more difficult. Recently, new bank loans, even for state key electric power construction projects, often required a great deal of coordinating work by the relevant departments before the banks could be induced to agree. It is not surprising that the banks were unwilling to provide the money, because the power companies were not in a position to repay it. By the end of 1991, the bank debt of the electric power industry had reached 30.9 billion yuan. In 1992, when the World Bank voted on the evaluation of the Zou Xian (Shandong) power plant project, the U.S. representative abstained; one of the chief reasons was that the price charged for electric power was too low. To compensate for the inadequate investment in capital construction for the power industry, between 1988 and 1991 the Ministry of Electric Power was authorized to issue more than 7 billion yuan in bonds of various types to the public; the accumulated capital and interest on these bonds was more than 10 billion yuan. This year, with repayment at its peak, more than 6 billion yuan is required. Unless new prices for electricity are instituted, where will this more than 6 billion yuan come from? If the industry cannot pay off its old debts, how will it be able to issue new bonds? The time has come for adjustment of the seriously inadequate directive prices for electricity. The Climate Is Excellent for Raising Funds for Electric Power; Prices Are the Key to Loan Repayment In view of the threadbare state of the centrally subordinate electric power companies, in 1985 the central authorities issued a new policy encouraging more organizations to produce power and instituted diversified electricity prices. As a result, the Huaneng group went into the power business, localities invested in power production, and joint power production bodies sprang up vigorously, producing an excellent situation. The key to raising funds for power production is "loan-repayment" power prices, or, in other words, prices sufficiently high that the power companies will be able to repay their loans and interest on time: these are "guided" rather than directive prices. This pricing system not only gave the investors access to electric power, but assured them of profits when the loan and interest were repaid. When the policy of diversified electricity prices was instituted, there was an abundant influx of funds: the diverse electricity prices policy not only made the Huaneng Group, which used primarily foreign capital, essentially capable of self-sustaining growth, but also brought about a burst of enthusiasm for local power production. In 1992, generating sets for which the investment funds came from the localities, enterprises, and foreign capital accounted for two-thirds of all newly commissioned sets nationwide. Electricity is a unique commodity. It cannot be stored and it must be consumed as it is generated, and thus optimized power grid layout and scheduling are needed in order to achieve the maximum economic effect from the generation and circulation of electric power. It must be admitted that the policy of allowing fund raising for power production promoted the development of the power industry, and revealed a new mechanism for power generation, and has resulted in successful experience. But we now know that before the new situation had taken shape, uncoordinated efforts to raise funds and go into power production also led to abuses. The investors called the tune and tended to emphasize their own particular benefits, which in turn sacrificed the overall interests of the power grid, so that it was difficult to assure optimization of the power grid and implementation of state energy policy. But why should we not make this sovereign remedy of loan-repayment pricing available to the centrally subordinate power-industry departments, so that they too will have the clout to raise funds for power production? Experience Shows That the People Can Bear Electricity Price Reforms A rise in the centrally controlled power companies, which account for 70 percent of the national total, will not be a trivial matter. The power industry is a basic industry, and if the prices charged by a basic industry are adjusted, price rises throughout the economy may result, and the people's livelihood may be affected. The state is taking a cautious approach to such matters. At present, the prices of coal and of most other raw materials, as well as the prices of grains and edible oils, have been allowed to float, and electricity price reform is bringing up the rear. But just how great an effect will changes in electricity prices produce? It is calculated that, given the fluctuations in the prices of coal and transportation, if loan-repayment prices were instituted in one step, the national average price of electric power would have to increase by only 34 percent above the 1992 price, or about 0.05 yuan. Assuming that a family of three consumes 60 kWh of electricity a month, an increase of 0.05 yuan per kWh would mean an additional outlay of 3 yuan per month, equivalent to one serving of ice cream per family member. In the case of the enterprises, an adjustment of the price of electricity would have a large effect only on those with high power consumption, but these represent only a small fraction of all enterprises nationwide, and since their product prices have already been allowed to float and to come into line with international market prices, they are fairly well situated to bear an adjustment of the price of electricity. In certain economically developed regions with significant power shortages, people are well acquainted with "high electricity prices." To meet the needs of economic development, these regions have made extensive use of small fossil-fired power plants. The fuel consumption of these plants is an order of magnitude higher than that of large fossil-fired plants, and the prices that they charge for electricity are correspondingly higher. Guangdong Province has 1 million kW of kerosene-fired generating equipment, and the cost of the electricity produced by these plants is as high as 1 yuan per kWh. Shenzhen instituted new prices for electricity as early as 1989, and users all stated that the price reform was necessary and that they could tolerate it. Experience shows that the more highly developed a region's economy, the greater the ability of the users to tolerate increased electricity prices. Adjust Electricity Pricing, But Rectify It Well Electricity prices vary from place to place; this is acceptable, because at present the distribution of primary energy resources is not in balance (electricity produced by fossil-fired power plants is a secondary energy resource that has been converted from coal and other primary energy resources). If loan-repayment electricity prices are instituted, a rational average nationwide electricity price level would be about 0.30 yuan per kWh; a price level of 0.5 to 0.6 yuan would be very high. At this point, some readers may exclaim, "Our electricity prices are well above that!" It is true: in many areas of the country, primarily rural areas, the prices that users are actually paying for electricity have long exceeded the loan-repayment price. It is reported that rural electricity prices on Hainan Island were rectified, lowering them from 1.35 yuan to about 0.8 yuan per kWh. The highest prices on rural Hainan Island exceeded 4 yuan per kWh. Excessive prices for electricity have forced the peasants in certain areas to go back to oil lamps in place of electric lights. Why is it that these electricity prices are so much above the standard? While in some locations power generation costs are indeed very high, the primary reason is that electricity price management is chaotic, and, in particular, that guided electricity prices are out of control in some localities. There are more than 10 state-approved categorized guidance prices for electricity. Many provinces and municipalities implement an overall use surcharge to guidance prices, in which the price excess above the directive prices is spread out over the power use of the entire area. Because most of the income from guidance prices for electricity is available for local distribution, if local governments at various levels approve guidance prices, the result may be the setting of high prices, price increases at each level, and collection of increased fees for electric power. Because electric power payments are easy to collect under the rubric of fees, a great variety of local policies involving "piggyback" fees have emerged: "Surcharges are a basket that you can put wherever you need it." Some localities even include birth control fees, highway construction fees and entertainment fees in the price of electricity. There are also cases when electricity fees for goodwill, influence, and connections are imposed on users. Thus electricity fees have become a catchall for a multitude of charges. In one city, the combined price rise included fully 35 components. One fee collector told a reporter: "It used to be that when you collected the electricity fee, you wrote out a bill; now you write out a whole stack of them." The director of the Guomian No. 3 power plant in Jinan said angrily, "The enterprises are paying more money for electricity, but is this money really being used to support power-industry construction?" The electric power departments also have their complaints. Director Qi Xinpei [2058 2450 1014] of the Jinan Power Supply Office stated: "Some users are accusing us of disguised robbery, but they don't realize that we are actually collecting the money for others: we're just the scapegoats." It would appear that while adjusting electricity prices, we should also rectify pricing and prescribe uniform electricity price management standards. Otherwise, a plethora of "electricity tigers" will open their jaws, and the situation will become intolerable for everyone. Electricity Prices Will Not Rise Sharply A kilowatt-hour of electricity can be used to produce several yuan or even several dozen yuan of industrial output value, but its price is only a few hundredths or tenths of a yuan. Those who understand the situation consider that the time has come for price adjustment. There has been some psychological preparation for the adjustment of electricity prices. Many plant directors have stated that so long as they get enough electricity, they will put up with any price in preference to power outages. Many members of the public state that they would prefer air conditioning to low electricity prices. But some comrades are concerned that since the electric power industry is highly monopolistic, if electricity prices are allowed to float, they might rise precipitously. This concern is unwarranted, however. Although the power industry must adapt to a market economy, it is a public utility; all countries have strict electricity pricing principles, and as public utilities, the power companies are not permitted to earn high profits. What profit rate is suitable for electric power enterprises? Experts believe that in this country, an average profitability rate of funds in the range of 12 to 15 percent would promote the self-supporting development of the electric power industry. Head of the Ministry of Electric Power's pricing office Huang Yongda [7806 3057 6671] believes that, "In the future, China should adopt a funds profitability model when evaluating and adjusting electricity prices." This July, the State Council approved a new electricity price reform program which raised the standards for price increases based on the costs of coal and transportation; in addition the central authorities took the initial steps toward loan-repayment prices and approved the first increases in household electricity prices. Furthermore, the accumulated price rises based on the cost of coal and transportation will be combined in the list price for electricity, providing an excellent basis for the rationalization of electricity prices. We are told that in the next few years, the Ministry of Electric Power plans to reform the procedure for increasing prices on the basis of coal and transportation costs, to implement loan-repayment pricing across the board, to institute peak and off-peak electricity pricing, and ultimately to arrive at rational pricing. Electricity prices are the lifeline that will bring the power industry to a beneficial cycle. Aristotle stated, "Give me a place to stand and I will move the earth." A high official in the Ministry of Electric Power stated: "Give us the electricity price lever, and we will make the power industry take off."
