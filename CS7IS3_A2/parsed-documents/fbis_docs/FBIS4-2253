Yet, owning to reasons on the U.S. side, the present contacts between the two armed services are quite limited, said Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission. "We welcome more U.S. friends to visit our country," he told former U.S. Defense Secretary Harold Brown here this afternoon. Brown, who is advisor to the U.S. Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), are [as received] here on a visit as guest of the China Center for International Studies. Some decade ago, Liu met with the then U.S. defense secretary here in Beijing. "You made positive contributions to the friendship between the two countries and the two militaries," Liu told Brown, while voicing the hope that the current visit be helpful to the development of Sino-U.S. ties. There are only a few years left in the running up to the 21st century, which, China hopes, would be one of peace and development, Liu said. Both China and the United States should contribute to the realization of such a goal, Liu said. Touching on the country's military, Liu noted that the Chinese Armed Forces are responsible for the national sovereignty, territorial integrity as well as the maintenance of national security and stability. Its military strategy is purely defensive, he added. On the Korean nuclear issue, Liu reiterated that China hopes to see a stable Korean Peninsula. China is in favor of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and it hopes the nuclear issue be settled through patient dialogues between all the relevant parties. Imposing pressure can only make things more complicated, he said. During the meeting, Brown expressed the hope that the U.S.-China ties be improved and the bilateral cooperation on regional, international security and other areas be strengthened. Also in the afternoon, Zhang Wannian, chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, met with Brown and his party.
