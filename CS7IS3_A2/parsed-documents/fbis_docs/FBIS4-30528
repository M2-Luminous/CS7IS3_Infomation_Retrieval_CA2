The exercise involved two overseas-based refuelling tankers and scores of fighter-bombers and assault planes of the U.S. Airforce in South Korea. The reckless play with fire was aimed at increasing the anti-North long-distance surprise attack capacity of the fighter planes of the U.S. Seventh Airforce. The U.S. imperialists deployed Japan-based pursuit-assault planes and electronic jamming planes in U.S. Airforce bases in South Korea on the same day.
