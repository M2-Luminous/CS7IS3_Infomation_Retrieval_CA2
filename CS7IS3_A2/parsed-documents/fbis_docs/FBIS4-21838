The bombing of the New York WTC may have connections to Denmark. The Arhus police four months ago arrested three Egyptians and charged them with attempted arson and purchasing chemicals for fabricating bombs. [see item 94WT0004B in 7 January Terrorism Report] In searching their residence, the police found telephone lists with names and addresses of some of those charged with attempted murder in the United States. "Therefore, we asked the FBI for help in clearing up our case. FBI colleagues have been in Denmark, and we have developed information. We don't know, however, whether those being held in this country have any concrete connection with the attempted murder case itself," said Arhus Deputy Police Chief Villy Sorensen. ARHUS STIFTSTIDENDE yesterday wrote that a fingerprint of one of those jailed in the Arhus case is on an "object" found in connection with the follow-up investigation of the New York bombing incident. "I won't comment on this," said Sorensen. He confirmed, however, that those being held in Arhus and those charged in the U.S. bombing attack are members of the same Islamic fundamentalist organization. According to the deputy police chief, there is nothing to indicate that the individuals being held in Arhus were in New York when the bomb exploded in the WTC basement. Nor have U.S. authorities requested that the jailed individuals be handed over for prosecution in the United States. Two of those charged in Arhus -- ages 30 and 36 -- are asylum-seekers, while the third, a 41-year-old man, has permanent residence in Denmark after having lived here for 10 years. The two asylum-seekers have told Danish authorities they are applying for asylum in Denmark because they are being sought in Egypt.
