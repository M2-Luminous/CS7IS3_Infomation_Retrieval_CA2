The lengthy talks between Clinton and al-Asad -- that were held in two sessions, first accompanied by senior political delegations of both countries, and then on private and personal basis -- were in fact preliminary discussions for bringing closer the views of the two countries on issues such as the crisis in the Middle East, the plans and efforts for a deal, and expansion of bilateral relations. Many political observers believe that no great deal should be expected from yesterday's meeting between the leaders of Washington and Damascus, and without doubt, if they had reached unexpected results in the talks -- the prospects of which are not strong -- it would not be possible to announce the results in the short term, and this would need at least several months. Basically, evaluation of talks held behind closed doors are made on the basis of official and open remarks of the participants usually made for the press, but these will definitely fail to present a full image of the secret discussions. In a joint news conference at the end of their meeting, Clinton and al-Asad emphasized the need for a brave peace in the Middle East region, but also acknowledged the existence of differences of views and interpretations. The Syrian president said: We want a true peace that would live, guarantee the interests of all sides, and re-acknowledge the rights of everyone. Hafiz al-Asad also said the return of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights to Syria was not sufficient for a comprehensive peace, and emphasized that according to historic facts, individual peace and minor solutions cannot establish true peace for the region. In his turn, the American President referred to the key Syrian role in establishing a deal in the region. The repeat of the Syrian stance by its president, and following his meeting with the American President, indicates that not only fundamental hurdles have not been removed on the path of a deal in the Middle East crisis, but also the meeting has not had an extraordinary achievement for American Middle East efforts. The only practical achievement of the meeting-for-a-deal between Clinton and al-Asad was the resumption of talks in Washington, which itself resembles a thin thread that neither America nor Israel wish to break, and which Syria prefers to hold on to rather than hold individual talks with Israel. In reality, the main hurdles in the Middle East region exist manifestly, and historic experience proves that until the real hurdles are not removed peace will not return to the region and signing of the so-called peace agreements cannot have a fundamental effect. The signing of a peace accord between Egypt and Israel in Camp David 16 years ago and the signing of the Gaza-Eriha autonomy agreement in Washington four months ago have failed to bring the Middle East crisis to an end or to stop the regional wars that are related to this crisis. The signing of these agreements have, in fact, led to the fall of elements such as Saddat and 'Arafat and their followers without allowing American and Israelis to achieve their aims. The signatories of peace agreements with Israel not only failed to bring legitimacy for the usurping Zionist regime but lost their own popular, political, and practical legitimacy and intensified their own crisis. In other words, although they held a superficial concern for confronting Israel until a deal was made, after signing [the peace agreements] they were confronted with a domestic crisis and had no opportunity to continue their rule. It is not possible to solve the Middle East crisis on paper and this will not come about through a deal with the Zionist regime. Those concerned about the historic Middle East and Palestinian struggle should concentrate on the destruction of the Zionist regime and the correction of the region's geo-politics. In short, and finally, it is possible to say that the most important and practical achievements of the Geneva meeting were in the possible expansion of relations between Syria and America, rather than a fundamental change in the regional process. This is so, despite the fact that America and Israel will try to exploit the meeting for their own particular ends.
