The president unequivocally favors the restoration and development of economic ties among the CIS countries and the states of Eastern Europe. At the same time he emphasized that the issue of restoring all previous interstate ties should not arise. Karimov also noted that Russia continues - and I quote here - to play the role of a dictator with regard to countries which used to form the USSR. The disintegration of the ruble zone is a good example of this, the president of Uzbekistan claims, for it was at that time that Russia made its partners face the necessity of introducing their own currencies.
