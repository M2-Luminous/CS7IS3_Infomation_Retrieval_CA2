City Government Will Decide How the Savings Share of Akava Employees Will Be Collected"] [Text] Deputy City Manager Antti Viinikka intends to propose to the Helsinki City Government that the city start discharging and furloughing its college-educated employees. Viinikka estimated that the number to be discharged would rise to 400-600 persons if the savings share of college-educated persons belonging to Akava [trade union for college-educated employees] is collected completely through layoffs. If Viinikka's proposal goes through, the city's various offices will be given the right to discharge and furlough as many college-educated employees as are needed to save 2.7 percent on their wage and salary expenditures, just as for the other personnel groups. In addition the offices have the possibility of saving people by reducing the offices' general 2-percent savings obligation. From this will come a total of 400-600 persons. Viinikka, who is responsible for the city's personnel matters, said that the employer no longer has any alternative. "The other organizations have demanded that those who have remained outside be treated at least in the same manner as those covered by the contract." There is a total of about 37,000 persons serving the city of Helsinki. About a fourth of them belong to the Akava trade union. The organizations representing all of the other employee groups have approved the local collective bargaining agreement, which is called the coping agreement. It will be signed on Friday [4 February]. According to the agreement only 40 percent of the vacation pay will be paid this year, which corresponds to a saving of 2.7 percent on wage expenditures.
