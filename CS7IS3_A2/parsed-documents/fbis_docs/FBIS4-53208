It was the SS (Tovlsk) of the former Soviet Union, the first ship to repatriate Koreans residing in Japan to North Korea. North Korea rented the ship from the former Soviet Union. Since then, the SS (Tovlsk) carried Koreans from Japan to North Korea on 157 occasions. On 20 August 1971, the Mangyongbong started its first voyage. The Mangyongbong was a 3,573-tonne passenger boat and served until the Mangyongbong-92 set sail in February 1992. These ships were named after Mangyongbong, which is located at Mangyongdae, Kim Il-song's birthplace. This was reportedly intended to make Korean residents in Japan remember Kim Il-song and his birthplace. The Mangyongbong-92 is 123.13 meters long and 20.40 meters wide. Its average speed is 20 knots (37 km) and its maximum is 23 knots. It takes 27 hours to sail between the ports of Wonsan and Niigata, which are 1,000 kilometers apart. Even though it is a 9,339-tonne ship, it cannot sail in strong winds and high waves. The ship has first class, second class, and third class. It can accommodate up to 220 passengers and a crew of 60 to 90 people. Every year, the Mangyongbong-92 carries 10,000 family members of Koreans who have already been repatriated to North Korea; goods to be sent to North Korean relatives of Korean residents in Japan; and businesses cargo controlled by the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan. It can carry up to 1,000 tonnes of cargo, including 10 large buses and 30 passenger cars. It was learned that each Korean resident in Japan must pay Y200,000, which covers the fare, accommodations, and transportation during their stay in North Korea.
