The remarks of the Japanese foreign minister are virtually tantamount to an official declaration that Japan will openly step up nuclear armament, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says, and goes on: We cannot but take a particularly serious view of this. Though the Korean peninsula is denuclearized, it will be useless and will not guarantee peace and security in this region, Japan's nuclear armament posing an actual danger. Hence, we have felt that the North-South joint declaration on denuclearization might be of no use, unless Japan's attempt at nuclear armament is checked. And this feeling grows stronger as the Japanese authorities take issue with our "nuclear issue" more blatantly in a bid to justify its nuclear armament. This makes us doubt whether the North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation is needed. Judging from all this, we may find ourselves compelled to reconsider our stand toward denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. In case of this, the situation will develop to an unpredictable phase and it will not be good to the United States and South Korea, either. The Japanese authorities should entirely be to blame for this. The Japanese authorities must act with discretion, deeply pondering over the grave consequences of their utterances.
