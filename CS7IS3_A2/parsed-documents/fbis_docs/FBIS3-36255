It clearly shows about 10 Japanese fishing vessels out of a total of 130 fishing vessels which violated the Russian state border on 21 January this year. [passage omitted] The video made by the Russian border troops left no doubts about the authenticity of the fact that the Japanese fishermen violated the Russian Federation state border. The video, made with the help of special equipment from a border troops' helicopter, clearly shows the registeration numbers and names of the vessels, in particular vessels with the numbers "H-K-2-20234" and "H-K-2-19082," and the schooners "Kosio-maru," "Tayio-maru," and "Nogisinko-maru." The video clearly shows the crews of two vessels covering the numbers of their schooners with improvised means in order to prevent the Russian border troops from recording the numbers. Andrey Nikolayev pointed out in an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent that he is ready to hand over the video to the Japanese officials, including the leadership of the Directorate for Security at Sea, if he receives such a request. "If there is no such request then we will hand over the video to Russian Television on arrival in Moscow," he said. It has become known to the ITAR-TASS correspondent that during the first, in Russian-Japanese relations, talks held today between the commander in chief of the Russian border troops and representatives of the Directorate for Security at Sea, the Japanese side was informed that the Russian border troops have a video which proves the violation of the Russian Federation border on 21 January by Japanese fishing vessels. Yet the Japanese border troops failed to ask for the video. It remains completely unknown what other issues were discussed at Andrey Nikolayev's meeting with his Japanese colleagues. Informed sources have told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the Japanese side insisted that there should be total confidentiality at the talks and that their contents should not be made public. According to sources, this is connected with the fact that Japan's attitude toward direct contacts with Russian border troops -- a country with which Japan still does not have a peace treaty, and that means no state border -- remains sufficiently painfully sensitive.
