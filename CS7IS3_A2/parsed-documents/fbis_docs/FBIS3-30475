[Jeszenszky] Perhaps I shall start, since at present I am responsible, with several of my colleagues, for the security of the country. I think that at the moment, no direct danger threatens us. I do not know of a country which would want to attack Hungary with its soldiers and army. However, Hungary has been occupied several times in the 20th century. [passage omitted] I think even a child knows in Hungary that in the past 50 years in Europe, peace was saved by NATO. Thus, in Europe, NATO is the only effective security organization in possession of armies and forces; I think it is totally understandable that I would like to see Hungary in NATO. [Horn] I agree with the foreign minister that there is no immediate danger. It is my conviction that none of our neighbors would have any reason or perhaps means to initiate any kind of attack against Hungary. [passage omitted] However, I feel that this region, Hungary included, is in a security policy vacuum. I fully understand NATO, that it did not want to take on this unstable region by offering NATO membership. Even if the Russian behavior, or the Russian issue does not mean a veto factor for them [NATO], they had to consider whether the region was a destabilizing factor for the world or for Russia. I would argue with Mr. Woerner on one point: I do not believe that if a new situation develops, any sort of consultation with NATO will help us. There is something else which is more important for me: The important thing is how can we come to an agreement with the neighbors and what sort of policies shall we follow in connection with Russia and other countries of the region. This will be the key question concerning our security. The other is our relation with the European Union. [passage omitted] [Szajer] [passage omitted] I think that the main principle of Hungarian foreign policy must be to ensure the conditions for Hungary to complete the integration strategies. The real token of this is full NATO and European Union membership. I think that there are no other priorities. [passage omitted] [Moderator] What is our hope, until perhaps NATO accepts Hungary as a member? [Kodolanyi] [We can trust] in the fact that Hungary is a stable country at present and no neighboring army threatens us. [passage omitted] [Horn] I cannot agree with the idea formulated by Jozsef Szajer that our only savior -- either from an economic or from security aspect -- is NATO membership. Because Brussels and Prague made one thing clear, and that is that a very long period has to pass before NATO will accept us. I understand this NATO position. But what should we do now? Will our security be doubtful until then? No. I see this: that the Partnership for Peace program is progress of a kind. [passage omitted] I do not narrow the question of our security down to our neighbors. However, I consider it a fundamental issue. All external attacks throughout history came from there. We have no say in the formation of parliaments and governments in the neighboring countries and God forbid that Hungarian foreign policy would become involved in this. This is the internal affair of the people living there. We have to cooperate with the people who are elected and considered legitimate in the respective countries, like it or not. I do not like quite a few members of the Romanian leadership, but I do not elect them. We must take the initiative in order that reconciliation should come about. We must strive for reconciliation and must not keep harping on about our historical grievances. Step by step, we have to establish the trust which is lacking. For this is the situation today. And the West will also be a partner to us in this. The West will be no partner of ours if we clash with each other and increase tension among ourselves. [Jeszenszky] I entirely agree with [Hungarian Socialist Party] Chairman Horn that we have to strive for good relations with our neighbors, this is obvious. This is also included in the program of the Hungarian Government. Anybody who followed the events of the past three and half years, can see that Hungary made several initiatives which were sometimes answered, sometimes not. My latest visit in Belgrade also indicates that Hungary always took steps even in situations laden with new conflicts. It is out of the question that Hungary would be responsible for these [present] relations. [passage omitted] I can most categorically state that the Hungarian Government and other responsible factors -- I include the opposition, too -- did everything possible recently to bring about a compromise with our neighbors. So this compromise is not up to us. [passage omitted] [Szajer] In reaction to what Mr. Horn said, I did not mean that NATO membership is the only guarantee for our stability. I also agree that approaching the European Union is the primary political goal of the country. [passage omitted] However, it could happen easily that we miss the boat, for signs already indicate that the West is taking more and more notice of Russia's opinion. [passage omitted] So we have to draw the conclusions from this and we have to relate to the situation in a pragmatic and realistic way, but at the same time, every opportunity must be utilized. [Moderator] But what will happen if the negative alternative comes about, that is, if Zhirinovskiy or the likes of him come to power in Russia? Since Mr. Kodolanyi has already referred to the possibility of having a common border with Russia again in the future. Are we prepared for this negative scenario? [Horn] I do not see the situation as being so dramatic. However, I consider the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon to be a big challenge and one must react to the situation by all means, because unfortunately, this phenomenon can find followers easily in other eastern-central European countries, too. However, the danger of this does not exist for the time being. As regards the issue of our neighbors, we should survey the past four years as a whole and there were manifestations during this period which did not do much good for our relations with our neighbors. However, let us leave this and look ahead. [passage omitted] It is not disputed by anybody that our wish to join NATO must be [officially] maintained. However, I have to add that when touring the country I found that people do not seem to think the same way about this. On the contrary, many people question the wisdom of joining NATO after having gotten rid of the Warsaw Pact. [passage omitted] This is why our party proposes to hold a referendum on the matter in order to form a true national consensus. For the West, the Soviet factor in the past, and now the Russian factor, has always enjoyed absolute priority. They have always approached their former allies -- today the central-eastern European states -- via the Soviet factor and Moscow. This will prevail all along as long as Russia remains a superpower and, chiefly, a main nuclear power. Unfortunately, this is the reality. And no matter how much we wriggle, we cannot avoid facing this. [passage omitted] [Jeszenszky] I do not want to boast, but Hungary -- and perhaps Poland -- played a very significant role in devising the Partnership for Peace program. When it was announced the first time, back in October, it was rather a lean offer. It was expanded a lot since then, and it was the Americans themselves who acknowledged at the Prague meeting that this was already something different from what it had been at the start. [passage omitted] The issue, where there is rather a sharp conflict between the HSP and other parties, is the issue of the referendum. I do not consider the method of referendum a good one, especially not before an election. I said a few days ago here on the radio that the MDF is in favor of NATO membership, but I did not say that everybody who wants NATO membership has to vote for the MDF. What I say is that if you vote for the MDF, or Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] for that matter, you vote for NATO membership at the same time. [passage omitted] I think that we can spare the country from an unnecessary and costly referendum if all parties state their position clearly in their election manifesto. [passage omitted] [Horn] As for the question of Partnership [for Peace], I would be cautious with the adjectives. I say that it is a clever invention which is rooted in reality and I can only support it, not that this matters much. On the one hand, it maintains the opportunity of cooperation but on the other hand, it does not oblige NATO to anything which would be impossible for NATO. [passage omitted] And just to remind everybody, to clear any misunderstanding, Hungary was not liberated by NATO. True, Western help was necessary, but in Hungary, a conscious process, directed from above, took place in the interest of changing the regime, in cooperation with the opposition at the time. I think you can all agree with this. As for the other issue, whether or not the Warsaw Pact or Moscow considered us as cannon fodder, I would be a bit cautious with this, I did not feel it that way. It was true that they wanted to create a buffer zone and this is how they looked on the central-eastern European states. I have to say that we weirdly encounter the same today in quite a few Western manifestations, when their policies in connection with Russia are discussed; we are a kind of buffer zone here. Let us not kid ourselves. [passage omitted] It is no use telling NATO or Mr. Woerner to handle us separately [from the other eastern-central European countries]. It became fully clear after the summit [in Prague] that these countries are handled together -- you can keep on saying the same in the next few years, it is totally unrealistic. [passage omitted] What is most important for us in these matters is that reality has to be taken into account to the greatest extent. It is not a bad thing for foreign policy to be adapted to reality and to be flexible, [while at the same time] preserving its essence. [passage omitted]
