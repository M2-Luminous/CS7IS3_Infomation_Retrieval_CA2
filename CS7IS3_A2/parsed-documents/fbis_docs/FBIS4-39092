All the murders were committed over a short period, from 31 May to 4 June. Speaking today at an emergency press conference in Dushanbe, the commander declared that the border guard leadership "does not intend to tolerate any more blows from behind and is adopting the most decisive measures to ensure the armed protection of its servicemen both at their duty station and at their family residences." Anatoliy Chechulin said that other action was also to be taken to ensure the servicemen's personal security. Authorized weapons and standard-issue military hardware were being made available for the protection of Russian citizens. The commander demanded that Tajikistan's law-and-order bodies should adopt all possible measures to catch the criminals, as well as a strict and objective investigation. "The criminals," declared Gen. Chechulin, "must be brought to justice for what they have done."
