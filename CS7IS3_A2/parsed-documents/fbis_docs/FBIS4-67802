In an interview with BBC, he said the supply of the aircraft is a commercial commitment of the American Administration for which Pakistan has already made payments. As for the American proposals relating to nuclear nonproliferation presented both to Pakistan and India, he said multilateral aspect of these proposals is quite interesting. Pakistan has agreed to move forward with some amendment in these proposals. He said we need to know about the American Administration's mind on the issue. The foreign minister said there is now a definite change in the thinking of the American Administration which is now prepared to look at Pakistan's position more reasonably. If this kind of confidence continues to develop, they would find answers to their problems without compromising their principles.
