At the same time, there are reports that the United States is drastically transferring its officials responsible for Asian affairs. People with discerning eyes know well that the Clinton administration is readjusting its Asia policies to improve ties with Asia. For some time, the United States has experienced difficulties in Asia. In the U.S.-Japanese trade talks, it insisted on taking a tough stand on "numerical targets." As Japan refused to give in, economic and trade ties between the two countries were unprecedentedly tense. On ties with China, the United States took the question of human rights as an excuse to wantonly interfere in and condemn China's internal affairs, which was naturally opposed by China. On the question of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the United States threatened to impose sanctions against the DPRK, while the ROK, Japan, and other countries intend to resolve the problem through dialogue and consultations. Moreover, the United States has also had disputes and quarrels with many other Asian nations on a series of issues. The United States meddled in the sentence passed on an American youth by Singapore for damaging public and private property and forced Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand to make concessions and accept U.S. requirements on labor, intellectual property rights, and other issues.... These aggressive U.S. policies have thrown it into a predicament in Asia. Moreover, they have also invited fierce criticism from the media at home and upset a number of government figures. U.S. papers have commented on the failure of U.S. policy toward Asia, describing it as "a train moving toward a steep cliff." In a memo to the Secretary of State written not long ago, a senior official in the State Department warned candidly that "relations between the United States and Asia have reached a critical stage." "Unless the principles are appropriately readjusted, we may damage U.S. influence and interests." It is ironic that U.S. Asia policy has run aground at precisely the time when the United States has continuously asserted that it "attaches importance to Asia" and intends to make Asia its "new friend." Since last year, the Clinton administration has clearly placed "economic security" at the top of its three major diplomatic goals. For this reason, President Clinton presided over the unofficial APEC meeting in Seattle last November in a bid to use Asia's economic prosperity and huge market to promote U.S. economic recovery and consolidate its "global leading position." As a matter of fact, the United States should have maintained good relations of trust with Asia in order to safeguard its economic and geopolitical interests. In its contacts with the developing Asian nations, however, the United States has considered itself to be a "big brother," used its strength to bully the weak, frequently made indiscreet remarks on the internal affairs of other countries, and even tried to impose its ideology and values on others. This cannot but evoke criticisms and objection from Asian nations. Moreover, these efforts by the United States in Asia will also fall through. Such results, which run counter to its desires, have precisely exposed the problems in U.S. policy toward Asia. If the United States wants to improve relations with Asian nations, it must acquire a deeper understanding of Asia's reality; respect the social systems, cultural traditions, and values of Asian nations; and get along with Asian countries based on an equal footing. In a word, unless the United States forsakes its "dominating" power politics of bullying others using the advantage of its strength, it will be impossible for it to restore its Asian diplomacy. It is time to pay more respect and make less threats to Asian nations.
