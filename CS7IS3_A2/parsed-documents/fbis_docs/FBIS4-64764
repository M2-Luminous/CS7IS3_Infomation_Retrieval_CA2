Last January, they had to suffer France's diplomatic about-face, pledging to stop selling arms to Taiwan in order to normalize its relations with Beijing. At the same time a political and legal scandal -- which is beginning to spread -- broke out on the island against a background of arms purchases in which the French were involved. The highly official LES ECHOS DE LA REPUBLIQUE DE CHINE is opening its columns to this mysterious case. It all started last December with the murder of Captain Yin Chin-feng, involved in the purchase of arms abroad for the Taiwan Government. The Taiwanese publication, which on this occasion mentioned "a case of bribes and secret military sales," has no hesitation in naming a French enterprise: "The main suspect is a man called Wang Chuan-Pu who was acting as local agent for several foreign firms including the Thomson company." Questioned on this subject, Alain Gomez' group said it was "not involved in this case in any way." Although the Taiwanese publication stalled by stressing that "Wang was not Thomson's legal representative, but a mere intermediary and nothing so far suggests that the French company was involved in Captain Yin's death," it is not impossible that this case, stirred up by internal score-settling between the Taiwanese Government and the opposition might have helped to curb Thomson's chances of arming the frigates sold as empty hulls in 1991. All the experts agree that the position of French industrialists in Taiwan has been considerably weakened. Some Means of Pressure Aside from the simple news item, it is more generally the issue of Franco-Taiwanese relations which is now in question. The publication of the article in LES ECHOS DE LA REPUBLIQUE DE CHINE, intended for a French readership, came just a few days after Edouard Balladur's visit to the PRC. However, although the Taipei Government reacted with moderation to the snub of the Franco-Chinese joint communique of 12 January, it was nonetheless angered by its content. And the public discussion of this case is now probably a means of reminding the French Government of its existence and showing it that it has some means of pressure. "Captain Yin was murdered after threatening to reveal the misappropriation of funds he had discovered in the awarding of arms contracts," the Taiwanese publication explained. Strangely enough, this case is being publicly discussed at a time when the U.S. Congress is authorizing Bill Clinton to increase arms sales to Taiwan. The blow seems particularly harsh for French arms manufacturers because the latter, encouraged by the Defense Ministry which is still in favor of selling "defensive" weapons, still hope to sell Taiwan some of the equipment for the frigates, armored vehicles and air defense missiles.
