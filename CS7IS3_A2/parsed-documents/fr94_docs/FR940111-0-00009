FR940111-0-00009 FR940111-0-00003 This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the revision of handling requirements set forth in the interim final rule. The Department's view is that this action will have a beneficial impact on producers and handlers, since it will authorize TDA road guard station personnel to require surrender of inspection certificates upon leaving the production area. Based on the above the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
