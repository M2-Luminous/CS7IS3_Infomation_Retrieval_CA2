The Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) won an absolute majority in the May general elections. "First, we have to try to stop financial balances from critically deteriorating in 1994," he said, adding that inland economic processes provide little chance for this. A supplementary budget should be presented to the new Parliament in order to prevent deficits from exceeding the level already expected for 1994, Bekesi added. The financial expert deemed it even more important to halt a further deficit increase in the country's current payment budget. "The situation is rather critical. This year's deficit is expected to amount to $3-4 billion," he said. It would not be expedient to raise or lower the real value of the forint, Bekesi said. However, its nominal revaluation is a different matter. Since the forint is regularly revaluated due to the gap between Hungarian inflation and the inflation in other countries belonging to the currency basket, the nominal devaluation of the forint is unavoidable. But it will not reach the 10-20 percent rate rumored by the press, he told NAPI GAZDASAG. Privatization should be made more effective, with techniques which completely stop or alter further frauds, Bekesi said. Moreover, capital-raising privatization should be launched which primarily concerns banks and major public utility works. The new government aims to increase investments by a more favorable taxation system, Bekesi said. Regarding agriculture tasks, the economics expert said that smashing up cooperatives should be ceased. Privatization must be completed as soon as possible, and the economic and legal foundations of uniting an atomized ownership structure should be laid. Sensible measures need to be implemented which protect the interests of the agricultural market, and are not discriminatory against Hungary's obligations undertaken in agreements with the European Union (EU) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Bekesi said. The acceleration of concessions for major infrastructure projects (i.e. motorway and railway construction, and telecommunications) would also result in economic growth, Bekesi continued. Hungary's economy would be promoted if it were to open up again towards Eastern European markets, obviously beginning with barters, he said. "The new government wishes to improve conditions for direct foreign investment. Here we consider re-establishing normative tax allowances, Bekesi said. We intend to liberalize the purchase of real estate -- excluding land -- to enable foreigners to purchase flats, houses, or shops in Hungary. The same measures cannot be applied to arable land as there is no market for land, therefore current land prices are not realistic." Bekesi also said that he deemed it expedient to revise certain points in the association agreement between Hungary and the EU. "The conditions set forth in the agreement for Hungary's agricultural, textile, steel, and metallurgical products are unfavorable, nor does the agreement cover conditions for a free flow of the work force; instead it leaves regulation of the issue up to bilateral agreements. These are the points that will surely have to be rediscussed. Additionally, conditions for penetration into the international market should be also improved," Bekesi told NAPI GAZDASAG.
