The plant generator is producing over 31 megawatts, near its top performance capacity. Chief Engineer Fermin Infante stated the generator is still undergoing tests without interrupting the electricity generation which, as we know, is attained by burning Cuban oil. To give an idea of the significance of using Cuban oil, all that is needed is to mention that from 1986 to date, this 35-megawatt unit has used almost 500,000 tons of oil which represents a saving of $22 million. The Jose Marti Plant will deliver an average of 19,000 megawatts a month and soon will be testing the Varamulsion mix, a higher quality fuel mixture containing Cuban oil.
