FR940810-0-00088 FR940810-0-00021 Various reasons were advanced for the presence of elevated exposure levels within negative pressure enclosures. Thus Dr. Sawyer testified ``I have seen configurations that not only don't work maintaining the enclosure integrity, but they actually can increase fiber burdens in the contamination area *␣*␣* (t)his involves *␣*␣* a HEPA filter by itself without a drive mechanism, without a fan to force air through it'' (Tr. 2176). ``I can anecdotally tell you what I've seen out there, but a lot of the systems just don't work, and some of them can actually increase the hazard to workers'' (Id at 2177&hyph;78). In view of the disparity in the submitted data, OSHA concludes that negative pressure enclosure systems, like other control systems which depend on proper installation, design and supervision for effectiveness, can vary in protection they afford to employees working within. Unlike engineering systems permanently installed which are capitalized by the facility owner, negative pressure systems are installed for the duration of the job, and economic pressures are exerted to hold down the time and cost of the installation. Thus, the support for the use of NPEs to reduce employee exposure is mixed. OSHA is also concerned that other health and safety hazards may result from work in negative pressure enclosure systems. For example, problems with toxic adhesives were noted in the record. Levels of methylene chloride, used to seal poly sheeting to underlying surfaces to contain work areas have been measured at over the PEL for that substance (Ex. 1&hyph;24). Some of the polyethylene used for sheeting may be combustible (Ex. 7&hyph;18). Certain industries reported particular hazards of NPEs. For example, a representative of Arco Products Co. commented that in the gasoline industry hazards included: build-up of gases inside the enclosure, heat stress, fire hazards, lack of good ventilation, difficulty in working with mobile equipment, difficulties in communicating and exiting during emergencies (Ex. 7&hyph;139). Various solutions to these problem were suggested. Thus, it was suggested that less toxic adhesives be substituted for methylene chloride; that poly sheets can be attached without adhesives (BCTD, Ex. 143); that heat stress be eliminated by increasing the number of air changes per hour within the enclosure; that a transparent window be installed in each enclosure to facilitate communication (Ex. 7&hyph;6); and other such adaptations. Certain of these suggestions were criticized as ineffective. For example, Union Carbide stated in its post-hearing submission, ``(w)e have observed that even when 8 to 12 air changes per hour are provided to the enclosure, on certain days the inside of the enclosure temperature has risen as high as 140 degrees F. The heat stress situation is further exacerbated by the body coveralls worn by the workers'' (Ex. 113 p. 6).
