He stated his wish to continue in an interview published Friday [15 April] by the paper KESKIPOHJANMAA. "I regard it as my duty to be in a position to defend what has been done over the period of the last three years," Aho affirmed. SUOMENMAA reporter Seppo Kuisma was indignant over Aho's interview. In a subsequent article, Kuisma accused Aho of betraying the Center Party's main press organ by announcing this through KESKIPOHJANMAA. Aho had not deigned to tell of his wish to continue when he spoke with SUOMENMAA reporters on Thursday. He cited as explanation as "simply for reasons of scheduling." It was made clear to Kuisma that it was a problem of KESKIPOHJANMAA's printing schedule.
