Myechyslaw Hryb noted that he fully supports the government programme for pulling the country out of the present crisis situation. He sees the speaker's task in helping legislators to come to mutual understanding on the basis of respect for opinions of opponents. The candidate pointed to the need to abide by law. "We shall pull out of the crisis after we unite and establish law and order in the republic," the legislator stressed. He noted that he is against changing the present foreign policy, does not intend to raise a question on remapping borders and advocates independence, the nuclear-free status of the republic and implementation of the signed international treaties. Hryb stressed that he supports the development of relations between Belarus and the east, above all with great Russia, which should not prevent the republic from establishing good contacts with the west. Speaking of crime, Hryb, chairman of the parliamentary commission on national security, defence and crime control, said: "There is much talk, but results are too modest". Accusations of lawlessness in the country forced former speaker Stanislav Shushkevich and two power-wielding ministers to step down. The present situation will possibly be a new stage in the political career of the chairman of the parliamentary commission which is also responsible for the negative operation of law enforcement bodies, condemned by the Belarusian parliament. The programme-setting speech by Mikhail Marynych was short. He said that he sees two main directions in the speaker's activities: rallying of lawmakers to tackle economic problems and to strengthen the young statehood of the country. Viktar Hanchar explained his decision to contest the speaker's post by desire to express "his protest at shadow politicians who regard themselves cardinals" at the Belarusian parliament. The legislator underlined that it is necessary to take a decision limiting powers of parliament speaker and vesting him with strictly speaker's functions. Hanchar advocated reasonable continuity of power: to hold presidential elections late in April and early general elections in September. Instead of electing a new speaker, which was scheduled for 12:00, local time, lawmakers began to discuss the candidates. Initially, this procedural item was forgotten in the heated atmosphere in the parliament building. The debate was brief. The floor was taken only by one legislator -- representative from the opposition Vitaliy Malashko. He said that the opposition did not intend to participate in "this cheap show" and called on all other lawmakers to follow suit. Then the session adjourned till 13:00, local time.
