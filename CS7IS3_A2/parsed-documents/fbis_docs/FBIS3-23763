In an interview granted OBSHCHAYA GAZETA on his return to Moscow he describes his impressions, justifies B. Yeltsin's position at the negotiations, and takes issue with deputies of the State Duma. [Silven] On the eve of B. Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi you were apprehensive as to how the Georgian public would greet the president.... [Pain] Yes, his circle was concerned about how B. Yeltsin would be accepted by representatives of the intelligentsia, with whom he was to meet. But the meeting was quite relaxed. There was a great deal of joking, but difficult questions concerning Russia and Abkhazia were asked also. The audience in the House of Scientists was in an exultant mood, virtually, and this was explained, I believe, not so much by the traditional Georgian hospitality as by the fact that people in Georgia are wishing for a miracle. Aside from the hope of this, they have nothing left. Yet they can hope for a miracle only from Moscow. In his speech Yeltsin said for the first time that Russia did not absolve itself of some of the blame for what had happened in Georgia also, and this enjoyed a phenomenal success. Generally, the previous democratic solidarity between the Georgian and Russian intelligentsia was recalled, in the main. The mood was one of forgiving Russia for everything that happened with Abkhazia and of recalling that which was connected with the formation of independent Georgia. [Silven] Recalled by whom? [Pain] Well, E. Shengelaya, head of the Union of Cinematographers of Georgia, and A. Tavkhelidze, president of the Academy of Sciences, for example. But I was struck most by the abrupt change of position in connection with integration with Russia. That same intelligentsia which had considered Georgia's independence a means of salvation from all troubles is now, having drained a cupful of independence, saying: "It is not we who are to blame, it was Russia that pushed us out of the Union." A desire to justify oneself is psychologically understandable, like the desire to find someone else to blame. In order to explain their own defeat they are also talking about the interference of a "third force." [Silven] And were you not concerned for B. Yeltsin's physical safety? [Pain] We were, of course, and this is why he was heavily guarded. But everything turned out alright. There was just one tiny episode: As Yeltsin was leaving the House of Scientists, a group of young street children tried to jeer him. And here E. Shevardnadze made an exceptional gesture: He slammed shut the door of his car and alone, without security, walked down Rustaveli Street. The mood of the crowd changed instantly. The public broke into applause, and he was greeted in such a way that I had the feeling that I was once again in August 1991, when Shevardnadze led a column of demonstrators to the Russian White House. The level of democratism demonstrated by Shevardnadze is convincing. Anyone may approach him unhindered--despite the fact that the situation in Georgia is extremely unsafe. The Russian president cannot be approached that easily. [Silven] How do you evaluate the results of the trip? An opponent of the treaty called it "a translation from the Georgian," maintaining thereby that the treaty is beneficial only to Tbilisi. What arguments could you in point of substance counterpose to the position of the councilmen? [Pain] I believe that if the reference is to practical matters, this treaty is more to Russia's advantage. Georgia has obtained credit, and there will be an increase in the supplies of gas and other forms of energy, but not on a scale such as might pull the country out of the present critical situation. This is more a symbolic, psychological gesture. For Russia, on the other hand, the treaty has solved certain most complex questions. The problem of its outlet to the Black Sea, for example. Russia has currently the sole small port of Novorossiysk. In accordance with the treaty, Georgia will make available to Russia its ports and, primarily, the tanker port of Batumi. An agreement was reached also on the creation of three military bases on the territory of Georgia. This is the first such agreement, I believe, throughout the time of the existence of the new independent states. It is not a question, incidentally, of new contingents of troops but of remnants of the units of the former Transcaucasus Military District. Their transfer to Russia and their ability to fend for themselves (together with their families) would have cost us more than the legalization of these formations in Georgia. Much is being said currently about the problem of Russians in the near abroad. They are fleeing Georgia, but fleeing hunger, cold, and the increase in crime, and by helping Georgia, therefore, Russia is alleviating also the position of its compatriots. [Silven] Why, then, did parliament declare its rejection of the treaty? [Pain] The solidarity with which all factions opposed the draft treaty is impressive. It could have arisen in the soil of the fact that all factions in the Duma are now of the opposition. But I believe that the position of Russia's Choice in this case is more the result of insufficient thought and a survival of the once-popular quasi-democratic idea of a nation's right to self-determination. This principle has not, as we all know, been elaborated in international practice, nor has Democratic Russia clarified its interpretation. Who has the right to self-determination: an ethnic group or the entire territorial community? Is self-determination following ethnic purges permissible? If so, any territory could engage in this. The protest of the other factions ensues from the doctrine, which is very fashionable currently, of vital interests and reintegration. And many people understand the latter in the medieval sense of the word, what is more: as Russia's territorial acquisitions. Not everything can be annexed today, naturally, and for this reason the supporters of reintegration are hankering after what is ailing. After "pieces" which, it would seem, are asking to be admitted to Russia themselves. Where would we be were we to put this idea into practice? The countries from which "pieces that are ailing" had been "ripped off" would become a zone of hatred around Russia and that same cordon sanitaire which all the councilmen in Central Europe so unanimously reject. The Duma has two political poles, conditionally speaking: "imperialists" and "isolationists." The first clash between them was played out over unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus: The "isolationists" were opposed, the "imperialists," in favor. In the Georgian business they were oddly on the same side of the barricades because the "isolationists" are opposed to feeding a poor Georgia, and the "imperialists" support openly or in veiled form the annexation to Russia of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. But how is it possible to advocate the integrity of Russia and at the same time deny neighboring states this right? This ambiguity is today widespread among Russian politicians. It has determined the Duma's decisions to a considerable extent. But at the same time I believe that a share of the blame for the treaty incident is borne by the executive also. Why did it not harmonize this document with a number of Duma committees and explain and, perhaps, emend individual wording in it before the president's trip? [Silven] You refer to the Duma's principal objections connected with article 3 of the treaty, according to which Russia undertakes to assist in the creation of a Georgian national army? It is said that this is tantamount to arming it for war against Abkhazia. [Pain] In actual fact, everything is the other way about. The treaty links military assistance with stages of a political settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict: initially agreements, then an army. Russia is interested in the creation of a Georgian army and border services. It is not a matter of indifference for it what the border with Chechnya looks like: whether this is a passageway in which armed detachments fight among themselves or the fortified border of a state firmly oriented toward Russia. According to the treaty, the parties would undertake to prevent border crossings by armed detachments. However paradoxical, incidentally, the Ossetians and the Abkhaz should have an objective interest in the formation of a regular Georgian army because it is not a regular army but uncontrolled formations that represent the main danger. As long as the latter exist, the danger of the ouster of Shevardnadze will remain. Any other Georgian leader--of those currently visible on the horizon--would be more frightening for Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Further, it is very important that Shevardnadze acknowledged for the first time--if only in a small group at the negotiations, publicly, nonetheless--the need for Georgia's political arrangement on the principles of federalization. This very term had previously been shunned in Georgia, now, however, this word was tossed into the negotiations. [Silven] It is maintained that the treaty is inopportune.... [Pain] Why so? There are no Georgian troops in Abkhazia, just as there are, for that matter, no Georgians at all--the largest ethnic group prior to the start of the conflict: An ethnic purge was carried out there. So the return of refugees--almost 200,000 persons--is inopportune? It was the mechanisms and technical conditions of their return that were discussed with his Georgian colleague by S. Shoygu, chairman of the Committee for Emergency Situations. As far as the idea of the impossibility of the conclusion of a treaty between Russia and Georgia prior to a political settlement of the disputes between Georgia and Abkhazia and South Ossetia is concerned, it does not, in my view, withstand criticism. There are just the same problems in the majority of CIS states. So we should not be signing a treaty with Ukraine until the latter regulates relations with Crimea? There are similar problems in Russia itself, come to that: Can we deny other states the conclusion of a treaty because relations between the federal authorities of Russia and Chechnya have not been completely clarified? This will not be achieved in a matter of days or months even. Leaving interstate relations unsettled, on the other hand, merely means stimulating a continuation of the conflict inasmuch as one of its main causes is contained in the uncertainty of Moscow's official position on the question of the territorial integrity and the borders of Georgia--notwithstanding the fact that Russian citizens are, as we all know, fighting on the side of the Abkhaz. The question of permissible forms of assistance to ethnically related peoples is a very serious problem. No one can prohibit cultural contacts between related peoples or economic assistance. Legal protection of ethnic minorities--kinsfolk on a different territory--via the system of international mechanisms is permitted in principle also. But the formation of illegal military detachments and the crossing of a border with weapons to participate in civil wars on the side of one's "own" ethnic community are absolutely impermissible. Nowhere do ethnic borders coincide with political borders, and were the world community to recognize the possibility of the armed protection by an ethnic metropolis of its diasporas in other countries, the world would be threatened by general carnage and total conflicts throughout the world. It is Russia's duty, therefore, as a member of the Security Council, to put a decisive stop to such operations.
