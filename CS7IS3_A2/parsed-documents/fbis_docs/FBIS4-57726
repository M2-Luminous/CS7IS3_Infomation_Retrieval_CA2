The U.S. ambassador was received by the lawmakers at the staircase leading to the Chamber of Deputies. UCR Deputy Elsa Kelly extended Ambassador Cheek a welcome in English. Without batting an eyelid, the U.S. ambassador replied in correct Spanish, leaving Kelly in quite an awkward situation. It seems the latter does not know that Cheek has not spoken his native tongue since he arrived in our country to begin his tour as ambassador. Leaving aside this language issue, UCR Deputy Ernesto Algaba described the meeting's outcome without resorting to euphemisms. He said: "This is a carrot-and-stick policy, pure and simple." Algaba emphasized: "When it suits them, we belong to the First World and when it does not, we belong to the Third World. On the one hand, they want us to enact legislation according to that of an industrial country, and on the other hand they treat us like an underdeveloped country in what pertains to trade matters."
