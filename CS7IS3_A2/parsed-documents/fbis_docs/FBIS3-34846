[passage omitted] The Fatah statement warned against a war being waged by the Shin Bet in a bid to "prepare the climate for a prolonged civil war." The statement said that "the Shin Bet aims to create suspect bodies that raise the national slogan and operate under different names within Fatah." It called on the movement's supporters "to act with alertness and high responsibility and not deal with these unofficial and illegitimate organizations." The statement stressed that "organizational statements" signed by Fatah in the West Bank and Gaza Strip "are approved officially by Fatah's supreme organizational committee in the occupied territories." Other statements are considered "unofficial," including those by "Fatah's organizational offices in the territories."
