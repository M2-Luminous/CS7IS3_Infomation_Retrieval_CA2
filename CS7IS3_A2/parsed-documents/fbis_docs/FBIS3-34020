The minister did not elaborate. However, an official Jordanian source said that four of the arrested people are charged with last Thursday's blast in Amman and that the other three are suspected of having a connecttion with the bomb attack in al-Zarqa yesterday. The source said that those arrested belong to groups of returnees from Afghanistan, adding that the explosive material, Acetone Peroxide, was used in both blasts but said that the explosives were prepared in a very crude manner which means that the group did not have enough experience in such explosions. The two explosions this week resulted in the injury of nine people, two seriously.
