The decree's single paragraph, signed by Franco, reads: "Any modifications to the subsidiary agreements and acts that may entail the revision of this agreement, as well as any acts that, according to the terms of Article No. 49, clause No. 1, of the federal Constitution, may entail demands or burdensome commitments on the national economy will be subject to the approval of the national Congress." This paragraph was included at the request of Senator Dirceu Carneiro (PSDB-SC [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Santa Catarina]), who coordinated the agreement. The agreement's main purpose is that the member states "accept the application of safeguards for all nuclear materiel used in all nuclear activities carried out within their respective territory, under their jurisdiction or their control at any site, with the sole purpose of assuring that the materiel not be used to produce nuclear weapons or other explosive nuclear devices." The agreement contains 98 articles and refers to the implementation of safeguards, the supply of information to the agency, inspectors' privileges and immunity, a common accounting and control system for nuclear materiel, subsidiary agreements, and the scope of inspections, among other issues. As for the subsidiary agreements, the most polemic subject during the agreement's debate by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, the agreement states: "Considering the accounting and control system, the ABACC, the interested member states, and the agency will reach detailed subsidiary agreements that will allow the agency to efficiently fulfill its duties specified in the current agreement."
