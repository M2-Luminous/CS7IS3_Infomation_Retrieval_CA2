According to a U.N. press release, following discussions held in Vienna during the recent months the DPRK authorities accepted the inspection activities requested by the IAEA in the seven declared nuclear facilities. The release said the DPRK representatives conveyed their authorities' acceptance following the explanations and clarifications that the agency had provided during the discussions. Inspectors would take certain measures, such as reloading of cameras and changing of seals, to facilitate future verification, it said, adding that the aim of the inspection activities was to verify that nuclear material in these facilities had not been diverted since earlier inspections. Welcoming the new development, the IAEA had confirmed today in writing to the DPRK the agency's readiness to send a team of inspectors to the DPRK as soon as the necessary formalities for entry had been arranged. For the past several months, the DPRK and the United States had had many rounds of negotiations on inspection activities.
