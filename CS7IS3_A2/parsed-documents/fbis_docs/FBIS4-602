However, South African printers may not have sufficient time for this, and IEC spokesman said the organization is going ahead with the planning of elections in kwaZulu-Natal because the IEC could not presume that election day would be impossible. But in the kwaZulu capital of Ulundi finance minister D. Madide said it was too late to enable the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] to take part in the poll. He said if the mediators accepted Inkatha's arguments and ruled that the interim constitution was not advisable, the new government should call a second election within weeks or months. He said failing international mediation, a guerrilla war- like specter, as was the case in the Middle east, would loom in the country.
