President Kim Yong-sam listened to former President Carter's explanations on the result of his visit to North Korea and emphasized that until President Kim Il-song proves his word, firm efforts based on the UN Security Council's [UNSC] sanctions against North must be maintained by the international society. President Kim Yong-sam clearly stated that even if the United States accepts President Kim Il-song's views, it must be carried out at the same time as efforts for UNSC sanctions against the North. Regarding the nuclear issue, President Kim Yong-sam pointed out that complete and thorough transparency must be guaranteed, and asserted that along with measures to freeze nuclear weapons in the future, past nuclear activities must be clarified. While recalling that in the past, North Korea avoided the international society's pressure and sanctions through scheming tactics and promoted nuclear development while buying time, President Kim Yong-sam pointed out that we must not slacken the reins of caution until President Kim Il-song's true motives are confirmed. President Kim Yong-sam repeatedly asked former President Carter not to be dazzled by President Kim Il-song's words. Former President Carter explained that North Korea's will to accept special inspection [tukpyol sachal] includes its past nuclear activities. It was learned that former President Carter conveyed to President Kim Yong-sam the need for the ROK and the United States to provide assistance in switching to the light water reactor. A high-ranking Chongwadae [presidential offices] official said that an overall assessment based on the former President Carter's remarks and the U.S. Government's material will be conducted. He emphasized: "Currently there is no change in the basic principle of completely securing North Korea's nuclear transparency and taking sanctions through the UNSC." On 17 June, U.S. Ambassador to the ROK James Laney visited Chong Chong-uk, senior secretary for Foreign and National Security Affairs of the Presidential Secretariat, to confirm such matters and provided explanations to Senior Secretary Chong on the series of matters regarding former President Carter's visit to North Korea. The official avoided further comment by saying, "As indicated by President Clinton's denial and definition of President Carter's remark in Pyongyang on the suspension of U.S. sanctions against the North, as personal opinion, the remarks remain merely reference material." The official added that the White House has denied the validity of this remark of former President Carter through the ROK Embassy in the United States, on the morning of 17 June (Korean time).
