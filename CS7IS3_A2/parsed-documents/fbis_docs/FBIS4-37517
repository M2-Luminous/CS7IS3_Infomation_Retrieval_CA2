They all met the speaker in New Delhi today and made a formal request to allot them separate seats. The members include, Mr. Rabi Ray, Mr. George Fernandes, Mr. Chandrajit Yadav, Mr. Nitish Kumar, Mr. Abdul Gafoor, Mr. Harikishore Singh and Syed Shahabuddin. Ten of them are from Bihar. At a joint news conference, the MP's claim to represent the real Janata Dal. They said following the refusal of Mr. V.P. Singh to assume the leadership, the Janata Dal has been without a sense of direction. He said there is no option but to split in order to revive the party. Leaders of the split group have decided to hold a national convention in August to formulate their future course of action. Mr. Rabi Ray claimed the support of majority of the Janata Dal parliamentary party and its state units. He firmly ruled out any of its member joining the Congress-I. This is the second split in the Janata Dal after 1991 general elections. In 1992, 20 MP's led by Mr. Ajit Singh broke away from the party. Later, 17 of them joined the Congress-I in two stages. The rest of the group led by Mr. Rashid Masood merged with the Samajwadi Party. The Janata Dal leader and former prime minister, Mr. V.P. Singh, has described the split as a logical conclusion. He expressed the hope that the new party will unite the forces of social justice.
