"The State Assembly probably will again have to take for discussion the personal issue of Mart Laar," Made said, mentioning that he had stopped short of calling it an issue of no-confidence. He said it was the government's attempt to submit the RAHVA HAAL newspaper directly to the government's control that may cause raising the issue in the parliament. Made and another opposition MP, the Centriat Party's Andra Veidemann, visited RAHVA HAAL's editorial premises in the Press House, Tallinn, today. The premises were taken under guard in the early morning today by a security company hired by RAS Rahva Haal, the state company that still owns the newspaper's trademark, but has lost most of the former staff in a conflict that led to the emergence of EESTI SONUMID, a new title published by RAHVA HAAL's former staff. The security guards, apparently acting under instructions to prevent possible takeover of the premises by ex-staffers who enjoy massive support by the newspaper's subscribers, today let the former employees in only in groups of two to take their personal belongings from their once places of work. Made also said he had been surprised to see that RAHVA HAAL's editorial premises were guarded by a security company owned by Agu Kivimae, one of the owners of the company Maag Ltd. that took part in bidding for RAHVA HAAL in the newspaper's privatization last year. The privatization authorities adopted a decision in favor of Maag, but the issue finally ended up in court after protests from Maag's competitors. Veidemann referred to the possibility of a legal offense, saying the blocking of RAHVA HAAL's premises had taken place without a court order. She said a court must now decide whether the steps taken by the state company's leadership were legitimate. The two MPs said they had seen no evidence in support of some recent allegations that the ex-staffers had stolen some of the property belonging to the state-owned newspaper. Security guards hired by the ex-staffers today called off their agreement and left the premises of the editorial office.
