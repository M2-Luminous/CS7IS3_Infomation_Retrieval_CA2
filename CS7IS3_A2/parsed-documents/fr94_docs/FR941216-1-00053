FR941216-1-00053 FR941216-1-00010 (B) Test rate. In applying section 1274 to a separate debt instrument described in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, the test rate for the separate debt instrument is the rate that would be the test rate for the overall debt instrument under ยง1.1274&hyph;4 if the term of the overall debt instrument began on the issue date of the overall debt instrument and ended on the date the contingent payment is due. (5) Gain on sale, exchange, or retirement. Any gain recognized by a holder on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a debt instrument subject to paragraph (c) of this section is interest income. The preceding sentence does not apply, however, if, at the time of the sale, exchange, or retirement, there are no remaining contingent payments on the debt instrument. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if a contingent payment becomes fixed more than 6 months before it is due, it is no longer treated as a contingent payment after the date it is fixed. (6) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. In each example, assume that the instrument described is a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. Example 1. Nonquotable contingent interest payments _(i) Facts. A owns Blackacre, unencumbered depreciable real estate. On January 1, 1996, A sells Blackacre to B. As consideration for the sale, B makes a downpayment of $1,000,000 and issues to A a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2000. The debt instrument provides for a payment of principal at maturity of $5,000,000 and a contingent payment of interest on December 31 of each year equal to a fixed percentage of the gross rents B receives from Blackacre in that year. Assume that the contingent interest payments are nonquotable contingent payments and that the debt instrument is not issued in a potentially abusive situation. Assume also that on January 1, 1996, the short-term applicable Federal rate is 5 percent, compounded annually, and the mid-term applicable Federal rate is 6 percent, compounded annually. (ii) Determination of issue price. Under ยง1.1274&hyph;2(g), the stated principal amount of the debt instrument is $5,000,000. The imputed principal amount of the debt instrument is $3,736,291, which is the present value, as of the issue date, of the $5,000,000 noncontingent payment due at maturity, calculated using a discount rate equal to the mid-term applicable Federal rate. Therefore, under ยง1.1274&hyph;2(c), the issue price of the debt instrument is $3,736,291. Under ยง1.1012&hyph;1(g), B's basis in Blackacre on January 1, 1996, is $4,736,291 ($1,000,000 down payment plus the $3,736,291 issue price of the debt instrument). (iii) Noncontingent payment treated as separate debt instrument. Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the right to the noncontingent payment of principal at maturity is treated as a separate debt instrument. The issue price of this separate debt instrument is $3,736,291 (the issue price of the overall debt instrument). The separate debt instrument has a stated redemption price at maturity of $5,000,000 and, therefore, OID of $1,263,709. (iv) Treatment of contingent payments. Assume that the amount of contingent interest that is fixed and payable on December 31, 1996, is $200,000. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, this payment is treated as consisting of a payment of principal of $190,476, which is the present value of the payment, determined by discounting the payment at the test rate of 5 percent, compounded annually, from the date the payment becomes fixed to the issue date. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the remainder of the $200,000 payment, $9,524, is treated as interest. The additional amount treated as principal gives B additional basis in Blackacre on December 31, 1996. The portion of the payment treated as interest is includible in gross income by A and deductible by B in their respective taxable years in which December 31, 1996 occurs. The remaining contingent payments on the debt instrument are accounted for similarly, using a test rate of 5 percent, compounded annually, for the contingent payments due on December 31, 1997, and December 31, 1998, and a test rate of 6 percent, compounded annually, for the contingent payments due on December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2000. Example 2. Fixed but deferred payment _(i) Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1 of this paragraph (c)(6), except that the contingent payment of interest that is fixed on December 31, 1996, is not payable until December 31, 2000, the maturity date. (ii) Determination of issue price. The determination of the issue price of the debt instrument, and B's initial basis in Blackacre, is made in a manner the same as that described in paragraph (ii) of Example 1 of this paragraph (c)(6). Accordingly, the issue price of the debt instrument is $3,736,291. (iii) Treatment of noncontingent payment. The right to the noncontingent payment of principal is treated as a separate debt instrument in a manner the same as that described in paragraph (iii) of Example 1 of this paragraph (c)(6). (iv) Treatment of contingent payments. Assume that the amount of the payment that becomes fixed on December 31, 1996, is $200,000. Because this amount is not payable until December 31, 2000 (the maturity date), under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, a separate debt instrument to which section 1274 applies is treated as issued by B on December 31, 1996 (the date the payment is fixed). The maturity date of this separate debt instrument is December 31, 2000 (the date on which the payment is due). The stated principal amount of this separate debt instrument is $200,000, the amount of the payment that becomes fixed. The imputed principal amount of the separate debt instrument is $158,419, which is the present value, as of December 31, 1996, of the $200,000 payment, computed using a discount rate equal to the test rate of the overall debt instrument (6 percent, compounded annually). An amount equal to the issue price of the separate debt instrument is treated as an amount paid on December 31, 1996, and characterized as interest and principal under the rules of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. The amount of the deemed payment characterized as principal is equal to $150,875, which is the present value, as of January 1, 1996 (the issue date of the overall debt instrument) of the deemed payment, computed using a discount rate of 5 percent, compounded annually. The amount of the deemed payment characterized as interest is $7,544 ($158,419^$150,875) which is includible in gross income by A and deductible by B in their respective taxable years in which December 31, 1996 occurs. The contingent payments made on December 31, 1997, December 31, 1998, December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2000, are treated in a manner the same as that described in paragraph (iv) of Example 1 of this paragraph (c)(6). (d) Rules for tax-exempt obligations _(1) Applicability. This paragraph (d) provides rules for tax-exempt obligations (as defined in section 1275(a)(3)) subject to this section. (2) Noncontingent bond method generally applicable _(i) In general. Except as modified by this paragraph (d), the rules of paragraph (b) of this section apply to tax-exempt obligations.
