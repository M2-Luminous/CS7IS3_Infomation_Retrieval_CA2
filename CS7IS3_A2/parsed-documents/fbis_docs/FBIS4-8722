FBIS4-8722 "dreeu074_k_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-074 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 CROATIA Official Threatens Use of Force To Subdue RSK Official Threatens Use of Force To Subdue RSK LD1604233494 Belgrade TANJUG in English 2258 GMT 16 Apr 94 LD1604233494 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Prague, April 16 (TANJUG) -- Zagreb is ready to use force if necessary by the end of the year to bring the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) into Croatia, a Croat official has stated. Slavko Degoricija, who headed a Croatian delegation to talks with the RSK on normalization of mutual relations, told the Czech news agency CTK late on Friday [15 April] that force would be used only if the reintegration process were not completed within six months. Degoricija said the position of Russia, the European Union and the U.N. Security Council was the same -- Krajina's reintegration into Croatia must be completed within six months, i.e. before the expiry of the U.N. peacekeepers' mandate. The reintegration would be carried out in three stages, with the first stage focusing on a truce, the second on the economy and the third on political issues, he explained. In case the Serb side should not agree, we shall inform the Security Council and take adequate steps for the reintegration of Krajina, the Croatian official said. The first round of RSK-Croatia talks at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb in March was completed successfully. The agreement on the cessation of hostilities and troop disengagement which was reached on the occasion is being fully honoured. In preparation for the second stage of the talks on normalization of relations, RSK officials have insisted with international mediators that this should in no way prejudge a political solution, especially as the two sides hold diametrically opposed views about the political settlement. RSK president Milan Martic ruled out any possibility of Krajina forming part of Croatia. The only way to peace is to keep the RSK and Croatia (?apart) because living toghther is absolutely out of the question, Martic told the CTK. He said the RSK was ready to make a compromise, not by accepting autonomy within Croatia but by restoring economic and other ties. "The basic (?condition) for this is equality between the RSK and croatia (?as) two independent states," he was categorical. [passage indistinct]
