Rammanohar Reddy; first paragraph THE HINDU comment] [Excerpt] After seven years of negotiations, yet another deadline (December 15) draws near for completion of the international trade talks. Meanwhile, claims and counter-claims continue to be made about what the Dunkel Draft holds for the Indian economy. C. Rammanohar Reddy takes a look at the issues of importance to India: the proposals on textiles, patents, agriculture, services and foreign investment. The name itself, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], is not easily comprehensible. It is an agreement and also an institution. It is supposed to have the last word on trade issues but it has no powers to enforce its rulings. In `green room' consultations at Geneva, representatives of the `contracting parties' to the GATT separate `amber' and `green' policies as they grapple with the aggregate measurement of support for agriculture in each country. It is appropriate then that one of the subjects now being discussed at the GATT has the acronym FOGS. To add to the opaqueness of language there is the lack of transparency in negotiations. Together they have made possible claims that range from a strong GATT ushering in an era of global prosperity to a GATT that will oversee recolonisation of the Third World. As yet another deadline (December 15) draws near for completion of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations of the GATT, a flurry of activity in recent weeks suggests that this time the talks may be actually completed. A dramatic change in either the agenda or its substance will not take place. For the most part, the Draft Final Act--the Dunkel Draft--with modifications here and there will be the basis for final negotiations. Since 1948 the GATT has overseen two aspects of international trade. One is the evolution of guiding principles for trade and the other is a reduction of import tariffs. Between 1948 and 1979, seven rounds of GATT-sponsored negotiations resulted in average tariffs on manufactured goods in developed countries being brought down from 40 to five per cent. Crucial eighth round What is unique and controversial about the ongoing eighth round is that on the agenda are issues completely new to the GATT. The impetus for beginning a new round came in the early Eighties from the U.S. Struggling to cope with a huge trade deficit and besieged by protectionist forces at home, the Reagan administration decided that the way out was to persuade the GATT to draw up a sweeping agenda that went beyond trade in manufactured products. New issues Thus, when the new round was finally launched in 1986 at Punta del Este in Uruguay, of the 15 issues on the agenda three were completely new ones (services, patents and foreign investment) and one that had been on the fringes of GATT (agriculture). The other 11 items on the agenda can be grouped into three broad areas: tariffs and trade of particular products; the effects of trade and, third, a review of the GATT. In the first area are tariffs; non-tariff measures; tropical products; natural resource based products and textiles. In the second area are safeguards, subsidies and countervailing measures; and dispute settlement. The third area covers multilateral trade negotiation agreements; GATT articles; and functioning of the GATT system (FOGS). The proposals in all 15 subjects, as they have evolved over the past seven years, are important to India. But it has been the ones on textiles, patents, agriculture, services and foreign investment that have generated the most controversy. Inclusion of textiles Since the mid-Sixties, textiles exports to the U.S. and western Europe have been regulated by the importing countries. These restrictions cover in minute detail the products and the quantities that each developing country--the main exporters--can sell in the advanced economies. The restrictions have been explicitly aimed at protecting the domestic clothing industries from external competition and they have been the inspiration for the innumerable voluntary export restraints that now operate in the European Community and the U.S. At present the restrictions on textiles are covered by the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA). Though textiles should never have been exempted from coverage by the GATT principles of trade, it is only in the Uruguay Round that their inclusion has been negotiated. The agreement on textiles, as in the Dunkel Draft, does visualise a winding down of MFA restrictions over ten years. But the transition will be backloaded--more of the ceilings will be removed at the end rather than during the 10-year period. During the transition period, only 51 per cent of textile imports would have been freed from restrictions. The remaining 49 per cent are to be integrated `immediately' after the transition period ends. Moreover, products that are now outside MFA have been included in the list of textile products that are to be freed from restrictions; thereby further backloading the transition. Even this transition is now under threat as the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, during his lobbying of support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, promised interested members of the U.S. Congress that the tentative agreement reached at GATT would be reviewed. An early major controversy was the proposal to include intellectual property rights (IPRs) in the Uruguay Round. Until now, IPRs in patents, copyrights and trademarks have been covered by separate international conventions. As these conventions did not have universal coverage--many countries had independently enacted legislation--and since the U.S. and the EC perceived breach of their national IPRs in the low and middle income countries, the subject was put on the GATT agenda as a trade issue. The basic objective was to tighten IPR protection the world over. In TRIPS, there are three areas of controversy: the impact of proposals on the Indian pharmaceutical industry, patenting of micro-organisms and protection for breeders of seeds. Product patents for drugs The Indian pharmaceutical industry will be affected if the present GATT proposals on IPRs are implemented. (In copyrights and trademarks the problem relates to stricter enforcement of existing laws). The two main issues are product patents for drugs and extending the period of protection. For food products, chemicals and drugs the Indian Patents Act of 1970 provides only process patents. The process to make a product can be patented but not the product. Domestic manufacturers, therefore, have had the freedom to use a different process to make what in another country is a patented product. Indian companes have been able to put on the market `patented' medicines at lower prices. The Patents Act of 1970 has also given the capability to Indian industry to quickly exploit international markets once the product patent expires abroad. India is not the first country to have only process patents. Until the late Seventies, a number of countries in western Europe provided only process patents for chemicals and drugs. The GATT proposals on TRIPS call for uniform application of the product patent regime. No longer will Indian companies be able to use the process route to make drugs that are under product patents abroad. The life of a patent in the TRIPS proposals has been put at 20 years, compared to seven years for drugs in India and there is a 10-year transition period for conforming to the TRIPS proposal. Amendment of the Indian Patents Act will, therefore, mean a rise in prices. The issue is by how much and for how many drugs. The prices of non-patented drugs should not be affected. The extent of price increases of product patented drugs is, however, not easy to estimate before hand. If they are produced in India they will not be priced at international rates, but they will cost substantially more than now. Drugs covered by patents in the advanced economies and now available here make up about 10-15 per cent of the total number on the Indian market. The GATT proposals will hurt Indian industry in the immediate term. But in looking at the issue from the point of view of health what is relevant is not the quicker and cheaper availability, at present, of drugs covered by product patents elsewhere but how many of such drugs are essential. On the World Health Organisation's list of some 250 essential drugs are 12 medicines which are under product patents in developed countries. However, the patents issue in drugs has to be looked at in its entirety--research and development capability, prices and exports. A different perspective on entirety has informed policy changes by other developing countries. One by one, countries earlier opposed to a product patent regime have already made changes. Mexico, Brazil and China have all embraced product patents and longer protection regimes. Their perspective has been one of signalling to foreign investment. Patenting of micro-organisms Also in the tentative TRIPS agreement is the proposal to patent micro-organisms which, if implemented, could have far reaching effects in the future. The Director-General of GATT, Mr. Peter Sutherland, has often said that under the Dunkel Draft the discovery of a micro-organism cannot be patented but only an invention. This is an extreme simplification of the TRIPS proposal. In the GATT proposal, tabled by the U.S., a mere discovery of a naturally occurring gene sequence cannot be patented. But if it is purified and multiplied and is of possible commercial value then a patent can be taken out on the micro-organism, even if there is no alteration of the gene sequence. The defining difference is the order of human intervention. If it is high--irrespective of whether or not the result is man-made cloning as in biotechnological research--then the micro-organism can be patented. This particular TRIPS proposal, which is being opposed by India, could mean that a company from one country that finds use for a micro-organism naturally occurring in another can, after suitable human intervention, obtain a patent. This could impinge on customary uses of the micro-organism in the home country. The ambiguity in TRIPS is how to decide what is a high order of intervention and what is novel about the invention. The latter, sui generis protection, that is on the cards is the subject of controversy. There are four broad issues raised by farmers' organisations and the Gene Campaign. First, the traditional practice of farmers retaining a part of their produce for seed will no longer be possible nor will they be able to exchange seeds among themselves or modify them for use. Second, domestic research will be affected. Third, there will be an increase in seed prices. Fourth, multinational companies will take over the Indian seed market. All these issues are linked to the provisions of plant breeders' rights (PBRs) contained in one kind of sui generis form of protection that is prevalent in western Europe and the U.S. and which could be the model for legislation in all countries. This is the Union Pour le Protection des Obtentions Vegetals, a convention more commonly known as UPOV. There is the UPOV of 1978 which was superseded by a tighter version in 1991. The UPOV 1991 extends protection to all plants varieties. (The 1978 version was applicable to only five species.) It also places restrictions on farmers' [passage omitted]
