T. Timofeyeva and V. B. Okhlyand, Certification Institute (A-U)] [Abstract] Individual means of protection (SIZ) play an especially important role in safeguarding humans in situations where there is a danger of interaction with harmful factors during production. Various SIZ have been classified according to GOST 12.4.011-89 and include 12 classes for hearing organs, nose, feet, arms, head, eyes, face, respiratory organs, and for falling from heights. At the present time, about 1000 SIZ items being are produced and used with varying degrees of protection. Effectiveness in using these means and devices depends not only on their protective properties, but also on their correct selection by taking into account the conditions under which they will be used. A decree of the GOSSTANDART established a system of certification for individual means of protection in 1993 which in turn established system structure and an order for conducting SIZ certification: starting on 1 Apr 93--SIZ for head and respiratory organs; 1 Jul 93--hearing organs, falling from heights and insulating garments; 1 Jul 94--feet, arms, SIZ made from plastics, and face, eyes, and skin; 1 Jan 95 special garments. The principles and order of SIZ certification is analogous to that of the European Community standards. A flow chart is provided which represents the structural system of the certification process. By the second half of 1993 ten certificates were issued on SIZ for respiratory organs and nine laboratories (centers) were accredited including the ITs [test center] ``Sorbotekhn'' and ``EKOTsENTER'' for testing filtration devices for respiratory organs (gas masks and anti-dust respirators).
