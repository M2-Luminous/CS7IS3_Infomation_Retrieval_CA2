Drivelling about "larger reforms", he blared that he would make the New Year a "year of liquidating the corruption and building a clean society" and charged the North with "suspected nuclear development". Dismissing his remarks as a foolish outcry of a doomed mortal forsaken by the times and the people, the news analyst says: The "reforms" launched by the puppets are intended to build up their "pro-government system" and consolidate the foundation of their rule. What the "reforms" brought to the South Korean people is, in fact, bloody sword brandishing and chronicle poverty. Now the South Korean people are waging an anti-"government" struggle, saying that there is no need to watch the Kim Yong-sam "regime" under the "civilian" veil any longer and they have nothing to expect from it and that there is no alternative but to overthrow it. Such being the situation, who would believe the advertisement about "larger reforms". The traitor Kim Yong-sam's provocation against the North over its "suspected nuclear development" is an act of one who has lost a normal mode of thinking. It is needless to say that the traitor is behaving recklessly, bereft of reason, urged by the sinister intention to put a brake on the DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost and stifle fellow countrymen through an "international cooperation system", vexed at the progress of the talks. The traitor Kim Yong-sam had better act with discretion, mindful that his treacherous utterances at the beginning of the year will only lead him more quickly to his grave.
