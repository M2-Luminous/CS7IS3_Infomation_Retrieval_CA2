But there is profound disagreement on whether the attack was necessary. After U.S. NATO planes shot down four Bosnian Serb planes, it is the Serbs who will decide if Denmark becomes a belligerent power for the first time since 1864. That is the view of retired Lieutenant Colonel Regner R. Moller, a jurist who was administrative chief of the Defense Research Service and a member of the Defense Research and Analysis Group until October 1993, following the first NATO attack in the alliance's 45-year history. "Denmark, as a NATO country, is not automatically at war with the Bosnian Serbs. But this was not a defense against an attacking adversary. This was an air attack -- whether or not there are UN resolutions. If the Serbs regard this as an act of aggression on the part of NATO or the United Nations and think they are at war with the aggressors, then Denmark will also be at war," he said. Unlike another military theorist, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Clemmesen of the Defense Academy, who considers the action logical and justified, Moller is worried that Denmark might be heading into a war because -- in his opinion -- U.S. F-16 planes overreacted in the air space over Bosnia. He sees many unclarified political pitfalls in the development. Among other things, the question of who gave the order to shoot the planes down is decisive: "Was it a NATO general or the UN system? If it was the United Nations, the world stands together. If it was NATO -- and the Serbs can seek support from Russia -- Denmark and NATO could be on their way into a conflict that could have incalculable political consequences." Moller -- who is a member of the Farum municipal council for the Liberal Party -- belongs to the wing of military theorists who want a low NATO profile in Bosnia-Herzegovina. And he is very concerned that the clearly superior F-16 planes shot down four outdated Serb planes. "That should not be necessary. It is the NATO hawks who have the upper hand. I fear this could Vietnamize the conflict in the Balkans," he said. Important Hours Lt. Col. Clemmesen has a firm and entirely different assessment of the events: "The Serbs must have perceived that the recent signals from Russia meant they could do anything -- as long as they did not touch Sarajevo. It looks like a quite deliberate move on the part of the Serbs. ``When six planes take off simultaneously and fly in formation, it is a crystal-clear violation of the flight ban. NATO regarded the action as a gross violation of the UN resolution. Quite rightly.'' Serb Provocation Clemmesen refused to call the shooting down of the planes a move on NATO's part. "It was a programmed action, entirely prepared for. The possibility that they would react if this kind of thing happened has been in the air. We are sending a signal to the Serbs that we will ensure that the UN role is fulfilled. But this is a striking change in the normal picture in Bosnia. It is a deliberate Serb provocation and the next 24 to 48 hours will be very important. If the Serbs -- as seems likely -- choose to deny that the planes were shot down, it will be a good thing. If so, they apparently accept the fact that they must try to avoid losing face to an even greater extent."
