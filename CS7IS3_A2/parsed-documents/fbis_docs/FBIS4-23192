FBIS4-23192 "drafr104_a_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-104 Daily Report 30 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Burundi Opposition Parties Demonstrate Against UN Envoy Opposition Parties Demonstrate Against UN Envoy AB3005212294 Dakar PANA in English 1622 GMT 30 May 94 AB3005212294 Dakar PANA English BFN [Text] Bujumbura, 30 May (PANA) -- Burundi's Union for National Progress, Uprona, former single party, and the Party for the Reconciliation of the People, PRP, on Sunday [29 May] in Bujumbura gathered a crowd of supporters to express their disapproval of the "biased" way the UN representative is carrying out his duties. Shouting "Abdallah out" and "Burundi is sovereign and mature enough to dispense easily with your tutelage", the two main parties of the opposition expressed their dissatisfaction in front of the hotel where the UN representative, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah, lives. As the OAU special representative, Senegalese Papa Louis Fall, who was forced to resign last March, Abdallah, a Mauritanian national, was also accused by the demonstrators of going beyond his duties of mere observer and facilitation in the restoration of state institutions. The accusations of partiality are not new, but the last straw was, according to the protesters, Abdallah's plan to organize in Nairobi from 1 June a week-long international conference on democracy and security in Burundi. The meeting, to which all the members of Burundi's executive, legislative, and judiciary have been invited, has stirred fears for their safety. They said plans to "gather at the same time all the members of the Burundian cabinet in the same plane" were suspicious. The UN representative came down to the hall of his hotel and asked to talk to the angry demonstrators. He said the demonstrators had a democratic right to demonstrate for action they deem right, but that it was also not right for them to accuse him without foundation. He said the Nairobi conference would be convened only if Burundi's main parties deemed it useful and wanted to attend. "I am not here to force anybody to act against his own will," he said. Observers said that the same opposition through similar demonstrations forced the OAU secretary-general's special representative to Rwanda to resign.
