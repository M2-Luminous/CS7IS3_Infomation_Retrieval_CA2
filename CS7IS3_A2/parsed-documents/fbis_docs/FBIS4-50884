The atmosphere is now riper and less fraught with difficulty. We still cannot expect too much, but the conditions for solving problems do exist. Mr. Poon said that both sides can talk over the financing package, make the credit limit flexible, and compromise with one another on the procedure for granting land. He hopes that both sides do not stop doing these necessary things merely due to some technical problems. He anticipates that the upcoming meeting may discuss the issue of the delay in the new airport project and resultant nonperformance of the stipulations of the Memorandum of Understanding on the Airport. He proposes that efforts should be made to start key airport projects before 1997, so that the Special Administrative Regional [SAR] Government does not have to shoulder heavy responsibilities after the British side's withdrawal. Poon Kwok-lim said that the first three financial packages proposed by the Hong Kong Government were unacceptable to the Chinese side, while the fourth package could be taken as the basis for talks. He said: The HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars] in loans prescribed by the Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on the Airport are negotiable, and it seems that the Chinese side will consider it at their discretion. According to the principles of the fourth financing package -- which has been disclosed -- the Hong Kong Government is going to invest a total of HK$60.3 billion in two projects so that total borrowing will drop to HK$23 billion. This is still considered to be too high, but, due to the fact that the cost of key airport projects has dropped over HK$7 billion, HK$8 billion of the cost of the new airport and the airport railway may, in the end, be made up. In addition, as the prices of land along the airport railway route have been soaring over the years, doubling the HK$40 billion value estimated in 1991, it is possible to utilize these funds so that the total amount of borrowing will be close to HK$5 billion. As the proceeds of land sales are far greater than the original estimate, and the Hong Kong Government has a large financial surplus, it is also feasible to invest additional funds in the projects if necessary. In his opinion, Mr. Poon thinks that the Chinese side will accept the reasonable and flexible arrangement of the credit limit. Regarding the controversial issue of airport railway land, Poon Kwok-lim pointed out: Naturally, the 62 hectares of land should be included in those annually granted by the Sino-British Land Committee, and the British Hong Kong side should work out and propose a timetable clearly listing the sites and quantities of land. If the Chinese side agrees to the proposal, the Land Committee can work on it. Poon Kwok-lim also said: The longer the talks on the new airport financing are suspended, the greater the possibility that many projects will be delayed. Moreover, we should beware of the risk that the SAR Government will be left with a heavy burden of railway construction if key airport projects cannot be completed by 1997. Hence, he and the Liberal Party advocate that the Chinese side and its British counterpart should seek common ground while minimizing differences; that is, they should utilize as many usable funds as possible to start key projects first and then continue to discuss their differences. On the other hand, Legco should examine and approve the allocation of airport funds on the basis of reason, urgency, nonviolation of the Joint Declaration, and leaving no burden to the SAR Government.
