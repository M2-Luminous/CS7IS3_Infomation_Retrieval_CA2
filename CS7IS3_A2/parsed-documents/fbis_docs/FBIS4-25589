However, as futures markets developed very rapidly, they were beset by many problems. Not long ago, the mainland's State Administration for Industry and Commerce and the China Securities Supervision and Regulatory Commission [CSSRC] issued a circular on rectification. According to incomplete statistics, there are already 40 exchanges on the mainland bearing the nameplates of "commodity exchange" and "futures exchange," of which 30 are officially registered, and there are nearly 300 futures brokerage companies, including more than 50 Sino-foreign joint-venture brokerage companies. If unregistered underground brokerage companies are added, the total number exceeds 500. There are over 50 items listed and traded as futures in existing exchanges, which fall into eight major categories, including agricultural products, petroleum, steel products, coal, nonferrous metals, ferrous metals, agricultural means of production, construction materials, industrial chemicals, and state treasury bonds. The mainland's futures market have developed so rapidly with such an enormous number of transactions that even government officials are surprised. As of now, the United States, which has the most developed futures markets in the world, has 24 exchanges, while Britain has just 11. It took several decades for the United States and Britain to develop their futures markets to what they are today. Nevertheless, mainland China has surpassed them in terms of numbers in a matter of years. Therefore, we can imagine how blindly its futures markets have developed. In fact, as laws and regulations, as well as supervision and controls, failed to keep pace with the excessively rapid development of the futures markets, numerous problems have occurred. Hence, the authorities adopted some measures to rectify the futures markets in April and May of this year. Zhu Li, secretary general and concurrently spokesman of the CSSRC said recently: The State Council has issued a circular urging the firm checking of the blind development of futures markets, strengthening macromanagement of the markets, and exercising unified guidance, supervision, and control over the markets. Then, the Beijing authorities dispatched five joint investigation teams to North China, East China, South China, northeast China, and central China to conduct thorough investigations and make reports. According to the authority's analysis, the results of the recent investigations will have a great impact on the development of the mainland's futures markets. It has been reported that the main problems are that exchanges are too numerous in number and are confused, the CSSRC is unable to exercise supervision and control, a "futures law" has not been enacted, and a lack of national standardization makes it difficult to put all exchanges on the right course. Moreover, exchanges in localities have simple and crude facilities and limited functions. As they are mismanaged, corrupt practices are prone to occur. It was precisely because supervision and administration departments were unable to exercise supervision and control that quite a few exchanges operated in their own ways and formulated their own "trading regulations." In particular, seizing this opportunity, Sino-foreign joint-venture or disguised joint-venture brokerage companies deceived their costumers using various means, thus causing an enormous foreign exchange drain. A certain futures company in Shenzhen is a case in point. After buying futures on behalf of its customers, the company, which claimed to be an agent of certain futures exchanges in Canada and Japan, did not produce any original transaction certificates while the clients' cash deposits given as collateral were sent abroad. When government organs investigated the case, personnel from the foreign side immediately pulled out of the company and returned to Hong Kong together with the relevant accounts. Almost all the clients lost money and the Chinese side of the joint-venture company also suffered a loss of 220,000 yuan. Those who really made fortunes were the foreign side of the company. Moreover, capitalizing on imperfections in the regulations, the existence of a double-track exchange rate system, and the lack of a commodity price formation mechanism, some underground futures brokerage companies carried out illegal activities, such as money-for-power deals and contract breaches, thus making the futures market more confused. Judging from this, the rectification of the futures market is indeed necessary. Therefore, the mainland's State Administration for Industry and Commerce promulgated the "Provisional Regulations Concerning the Management of Futures Brokerage Company Registration" in April. According to the regulations, for a futures brokerage company to operate, it must have capital of over 10 million yuan, suitable telecommunications facilities, and at least 20 full-time futures brokers; it must open a special account for customers' cash deposits used as collateral with designated financial institutions; and deposit at least 25 percent of its total registered capital as guaranty money. If it violates the regulations, it will be punished, ranging from a warning, confiscation of earnings, or the revocation of its license according to the seriousness of the case. Those violating the criminal law will be handed over to judicial organs for prosecution. In early May, the CSSRC announced a decision to close some problem exchanges (it is said they amounted to 50 percent of the total number) as one of its emergency measures for further rectifying futures markets. At the same time, Beijing stepped up efforts to enact a "futures law" and other related laws in a bid to bring the futures market into an orbit of legal, normal, steady, and healthy development.
