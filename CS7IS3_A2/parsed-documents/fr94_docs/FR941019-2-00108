Specifically excluded from the scope of the investigations are mechanical pencils, cosmetic pencils, pens, noncased crayons (wax), pastels, charcoals, or chalks. Background The Commission instituted this investigation effective June 16, 1994, following a preliminary determination by the Department of Commerce that imports of certain cased pencils from Thailand were being sold at LTFV within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. ยง1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the Federal Register of July 7, 1994 (59 FR 34865). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on August 25, 1994, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on October 13, 1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2816 (October 1994), entitled ``Certain Cased Pencils from Thailand: Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;670 (Final).'' Issued: October 14, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25912 Filed 10&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;M
