The Paraguayan Government believes these privileges should be the same as those established by the Vienna Convention on diplomatic ties. Ramirez Boettner's letter responds to a letter Glassman sent to Wasmosy. The letter states that the government has studied very closely the offer encompassed in the "Agreement between the United States of America and the Paraguayan Government on joint exercises known as Strong Roads 1994-South" and the "Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. State Department and the Paraguayan Public Works and Communications Ministry." The Paraguayan Government expresses its thanks for the U.S. "interest" in building six schools, six wells, and one clinic in San Pedro Department. "After a careful study of this operation, the value of which is not specified anywhere in the two aforementioned documents although the annex establishes that the amount is `to be specified' -- while statements to the radio and the press Your Excellency has said it will total $12 million -- we wonder if the amount will be invested in Paraguay through the works encompassed in this project, or if it represents the total cost that the United States will spend deploying 600 U.S. Army servicemen to Paraguay, the equipment (which will not be donated to Paraguay), and the maintenance of the personnel. In this case, it does not constitute cooperation for Paraguay but the financing of what the agreement calls `Joint Exercises' conducted in Paraguay." [passage omitted] After stating that the requirements of the Americans for their arrival are "very costly," the Government insists that Paraguay "would be allocating far more resources than the United States." [passage omitted] On the agreement to allow the entrance of U.S. servicemen, among other things, the government proposes "that the Paraguayan Army be the counterpart of the joint exercise, for which a sapper battalion will be designated; that the value the technical cooperation program be specified; that Congress authorize the arrival of the troops with their respective arms because this affects our country's sovereign rights; that the joint exercise will be carried out only in the areas specified, including ports, airports, and Paraguayan air space, clearly specifying the number and characteristics of the planes or helicopters to be used; and that the import of arms be restricted." The letter to Glassman also states that if these conditions are not met "It may be convenient for the Paraguayan Government to carry out these works with its own resources, without the cooperation of your country."
