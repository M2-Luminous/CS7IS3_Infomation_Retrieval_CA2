Maurizio Zifferero, assistant director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said around 35 kilograms (77 pounds) of irradiated fuel is to be transferred to Russia. A first shipment was flown out on board an Antonov-124 transport plane from al-Habbaniyah airport west of Baghdad on Sunday, the U.N. source said without specifying the quantity. "The second and final consignment will be shipped out early next year," the source said. Iraq agreed to have its irradiated nuclear fuel removed during a visit in April by Zifferero at the head of a team of nuclear inspectors. Zifferero has refused to give the precise cost of the multi- million-dollar operation, which is to paid for by Iraq. The IAEA dispatched around 12 kilogrammes (26 pounds) of enriched uranium to Russia last month. The United Nations ordered the destruction of Iraq's nuclear programme under Gulf war ceasefire resolutions eliminating its weapons of mass destruction.
