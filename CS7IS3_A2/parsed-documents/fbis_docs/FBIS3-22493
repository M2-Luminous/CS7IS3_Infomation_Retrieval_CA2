The number of HIV positive cases diagnosed in Cambodia last month nearly tripled the previous month with the victims tending to be male and with an average age of 26. Dr. Kruy Sunlay's Pasteur Institute found nearly 8 percent of patients seeking treatment for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) at the institute in September tested positive for HIV, while about 2 percent of blood donors at the National Blood Transfusion Center have been testing positive every month since January of this year -- 85 percent of donors are males aged 18 to 40. In total, 132 Cambodians were tested positive for HIV in September -- more than one a day. In the eight months from January until the end of August, a total of 82 people were found to be HIV positive. To date more than 200 people have tested HIV positive in Cambodia, but Health Ministry officials say WHO estimates put the real figure at between 1,000 to 2,000. "I think this is the second killing fields in Cambodia, but it will be in another ten years," Dr. Kruy said grimly referring to the time it would take victims to develop full blown AIDS. "The problem now is we have no funds for HIV testing," she added. Last months' victims ranged in age from 18 to 32. The 20 STD patients included two women -- 18 and 20 years old, while most of the men were in their twenties. "I think the Ministry of Health realizes how big the problem is, but they don't have any funds," Dr. Kruy said. "The important problem is not only diagnosis in the laboratory but health education on TV, radio, and in newspapers." "There's not enough information given to the population, they need more," she said. "I hope the new government will do something about this problem. I think it's outside my responsibility, but I know they have no funds." Dr. Kruy called for an AIDS education program to be introduced into high schools and universities around the country. "After peace has come, I heard the object of the government is developing the country, the economics sector, but the most important thing is that the country has good health. For example, with AIDS we might have in ten years we wouldn't be able to develop the country." Mr. Lars Meyner, head of the national blood transfusion program of the International Committee of the Red Cross echoed Dr. Kruy's call for more education and claimed popular ignorance could see Cambodia slide into a situation like Thailand where AIDS is reaching epidemic proportions. "Many young men here as we know have the first sexual experience with a commercial sex worker and because of this it is a big risk as serious or probably even more serious than in Thailand," Mr. Meyner said. "In Thailand the prostitutes are using condoms, here they don't have that awareness. If you asked the majority of the male population in Thailand they know what a condom is, here they don't." With HIV on the increase Mr. Meyner is concerned about the possibility of infected blood being used in transfusions. "Of course our first objective here is to give safe blood to the patients, with a high number of HIV positives we can never guarantee HIV free blood -- there is a window period of two to three months from when a patient contracts the disease to when it shows up in the antibody blood test." Mr. Meyner added that HIV would easily spread in this country through needle sharing -- a practice of many small provincial hospitals and pharmacies. "If you go to the local pharmacy at the market and he gives you an injection he uses the same needle for very many people and that's one way it's spreading here," he said. "I think maybe there is still no real understanding among the general population of exactly what AIDS is and what the consequences are if you get AIDS, it seems like the message has not gone out." The first HIV positive case was diagnosed in Cambodia in June 1991, such tests were not previously available here so it's impossible to tell when the first Cambodian contracted the disease. Several patients are already showing signs of AIDS related complaints. [passage omitted] She adds that the lack of visible symptoms in HIV positive patients contributes to the population's ignorance and refusal to acknowledge HIV is a problem in Cambodia. Most of Cambodia's victims are young men and many of them married, but few wives continue to stay with their husbands after hearing they are HIV positive. Most of Cambodia's HIV cases are believed to have been transmitted through heterosexual sex. It seems culturally acceptable for Cambodian men to visit brothels and locals estimate up to 95 percent of Cambodian males would visit a prostitute at least once in their life time. Dr. Kruy is not alone in her fear of an AIDS epidemic gripping Cambodia. The World Health Organization and several foreign non-government organizations have recognized the problem and started to take steps to combat it. Although more than 100 Cambodian HIV victims had been identified in 1991 and 1992, none of them were informed of their status as no counseling service was available, until February of this year. The decision not to inform victims before this time was made jointly by WHO and the then Phnom Penh government. But earlier this year ten Cambodians were trained to do pre-test and post- test counseling and HIV victims began to be informed of their disease. "There are only a few cases in the provinces. If we can stop the spread in Phnom Penh, we won't have a problem like Thailand," Dr. Kruy said. Dr. Mam Bun Heng, chairman of the National AIDS Committee, said the new government had put AIDS control on the high priority list, but funds and real commitment from the community were lacking. "We are trying now to get more money. We have produced a five-year comprehensive plan, but we need money -- $7.5 million," he said. "And we need a commitment from all sectors, education, administration, religion, and the economic sector... not only to talk but to develop the program." He said the first plan of the program was to educate high risk groups like prostitutes and STD victims. "The problem is information and education and how to spread it to the public," Dr. Mam Bun Heng said.
