[passage omitted] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this evening that the allies would not retreat when faced with provocations or attacks in Bosnia, wherever they came from. Alain Juppe spoke to Alain Pages of Radio France Bordeaux-Gironde: [Begin Juppe recording] The resolutions of the Security Council and the decisions of the alliance are very clear: they authorize UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] to ask for the use of air strikes when it believes that our soldiers on the ground are under threat. These conditions were fulfilled in Gorazde. If the conditions that occurred in Gorazde should, alas, happen again, if UNPROFOR is attacked, if one side or another, let us say the Serbs, do not respect the decisions taken by the United Nations, then of course air strikes must be used. We must make it clear that we shall not retreat when faced with provocations and attacks. [end recording]
