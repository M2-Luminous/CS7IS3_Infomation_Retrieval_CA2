For this reason he intends to try to attain an understanding with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin -- not necessary in the context of a national unity government -- regarding the continuation of the process. This understanding involves a compromise on the Golan Heights while preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state as part of the permanent arrangement. The circles add that there are other senior Likud figures in addition to Netanyahu who, in exchange for such an understanding, will give their support to a peace arrangement with Syria involving withdrawal from the Golan Heights buttressed by appropriate security arrangements.
