He expressed the hope that this will make it possible to implement the European Union peace plan, Bohl said on ARD TV's morning news program today. Peace will otherwise have to be brought about through military means. Bonn has actively worked for a unified NATO position "behind the scenes," he stated. The Federal Republic cannot itself participate in military actions for historical and constitutional reasons, but will give the decisions made in Brussels its full "political and moral support," he said. Bohl rejected the idea that Europe would be on the brink of war after possible air strikes against artillery positions in Sarajevo. To draw parallels between 1914 and 1994 is "false" and does not take into account the completely different situation now, he asserted.
