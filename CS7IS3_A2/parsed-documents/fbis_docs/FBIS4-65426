He said the investigation will be conducted to determine whether there were any premeditations, or whether the conversation was heard and taped by chance. Sarvan said that if it was determined that it was premeditated, the investigation will be conducted by Ankara State Security Court. He said that there have been no initiatives undertaken by the Prime Minister's Office or the Chief of Staff's Office on the issue, adding the State Prosecutor's Office has used its power to start the investigation on its own authority. The Turkish Constitution's Resolution No. 132 on crimes against the personal identity of the states [as received] and No. 195 on crimes on divulging state secrets would be considered during the investigation, he said. A scandal broke out last week when a man listened to a three-way telephone conversation between Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, and two cabinet members. The conversation was recorded because one of the ministers was using his phone car. In the conversation Ciller was asking her ministers to make necessary arrangements to extend the duty of the chief of staff, General Dogan Gures, for another year.
