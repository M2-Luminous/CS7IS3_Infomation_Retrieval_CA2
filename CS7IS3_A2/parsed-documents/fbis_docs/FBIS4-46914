FBIS4-46914 "jpusr062___94025" FBIS-USR-94-062 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 26 April 1994 RUSSIA REGIONAL AFFAIRS Chelyabinsk First Quarter Socioeconomic Statistics Reported Chelyabinsk First Quarter Socioeconomic Statistics Reported 944F0732A Chelyabinsk CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY in Russian 26 Apr 94 p 2 944F0732A Chelyabinsk CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY Russian CSO [Statistical Report by the Chelyabinsk Oblast Statistics Administration: "Socioeconomic State of the Oblast in First Quarter of 1994"] [Text] The main indices characterizing the socioeconomic state of the oblast during the first quarter of 1994 are as follows: First quarter 1994 First quarter 1994 as (actual prices) a percentage of first quarter 1993 (in comparable prices) Industrial production output - 68* Production of consumer goods, 272 68 billions of rubles including: food products 82.7 72 alcoholic beverages 41.7 76 nonfood products 147.6 64 Capital investments from all 211.4 71 sources of financing, billions of rubles Housing put into operation from 104,300 114 all sources of financing, square meters of living area Average daily dispatch of 118,900 66 freight by rail transportation (divisions of the Chelyabinsk Oblast Railroad), tonnes Freight deliveries by 8.4 41 public-use motor vehicle transportation, millions of tonnes Purchases of livestock products, all categories of farms: livestock and fowl, tonnes 16,600 73* milk, tonnes 54,500 65* eggs 13.311 billion 95* Retail trade turnover of 411.2 79 officially registered trade enterprises and public kitchens, billions of rubles Paid services, billions of 50.8 35 rubles Exports, millions of dollars 44 130 U.S. Imports, millions of dollars 22 139 U.S. Profit (January-February), 249.7 4.6-fold greater** billions of rubles Per capita monetary income (in 90,700 6.1-fold greater** March 1994), rubles Aggregate consumer price index 661 (March 1994 as compared to March 1993) * index of physical volume of production ** in existing prices FINANCE During January-February 1994, R249.7 billion [rubles] in profits were received by enterprises and organizations of the oblast. This represents a 4.6-fold increase in profits over the same period of last year. All sectors showed a positive financial balance over the course of the two months except for transportation, where losses amounted to R6.4 billion. Almost one-third of all the losses in the sector were incurred by virtue of the enterprises and organizations of Chelyabinsk. The nonpayments problem continues to be a critical one. The credit indebtedness of enterprises and organizations amounted to R2.3212 trillion as of 1 March 1994, of which R1.1673 trillion, or 50.3 percent, constituted delinquent indebtedness. The share of enterprises with delinquent indebtedness to suppliers comprised 65.6 percent of the total delinquent indebtedness; only 8 percent was indebtedness to the budget. Bank-credit debts totalled R331.9 billion over this period, including 23.5 percent attributable to delinquent debts. A large amount of the total indebtedness is attributable to industry. The indebtedness with respect to loans procured amounted to R11.1 billion. The large amounts of delinquent credit indebtedness are related to the presence of debit indebtedness. Thus, as of 1 March 1994, debit indebtedness amounted to R2.3379 trillion, including delinquent debit indebtedness of R1.3037 trillion, or 55.8 percent. A large portion of the delinquent indebtedness is attributable to the delinquent indebtedness of purchasers (R1.1673 trillion, or 89.5 percent of the total debit indebtedness). It is mainly due to the lack of funds in settlement accounts of enterprises and organizations of industry, construction, and agriculture that the timely payment of wages to workers is being delayed. The percentage of enterprises in industry that were in violation of the time frame for payment of wages was 34.6 percent of the total number of enterprises in debt. In construction, the percentage was 25.4 percent, and in agriculture--40 percent. LEVELS AND INDICES OF PRICES AND RATES The consumer price index characterizing the change in actual family budget expenditures was 134 percent for March as compared with December 1993. A determining influence on the overall consumer price index was exerted by sharp increases in the cost of paid services to the populace (costs rose 2.5-fold in March over the level of December of last year). The maximum rise in prices and rates was observed for housing and public-utility services (sixfold), including a 14.4-fold increase in services of the housing sphere. The rate of growth of passenger transportation costs continues--the March level was 307.6 percent of the December level. The trend towards accelerated price increases was maintained for consumer services (1.7-fold), communications services (2.3-fold), and tourist and health resort services (twofold). Prices of consumer goods were 28.4 percent higher in March 1994 than in December 1993. In general, price increases for consumer goods over the period in question slowed down significantly, especially with respect to food products. Food product prices rose 29 percent over December 1993 levels, including a 1.8-fold increase for fish and other maritime products, cheese, and vegetables; 1.7-fold increase for potatoes; and 1.5-fold increase for milk, dairy products, canned vegetables, and edible fats. Rapid price growth was maintained for vegetables, canned vegetables, and ice cream. Prices for nonfood products rose 28 percent over the levels of December 1993, including a 1.9-fold increase for printed publications, 1.7-fold increase for flaxen fabric and matches, and 1.6-fold increase for detergents, thread, toys, and gasoline. Accelerated price increases were characteristic of children's clothing and footwear, knitted underwear, rubber footwear, glassware, stationery, television sets, radios, and medicines. The consolidated index for wholesale industrial production prices was 144 percent in March over the December 1993 level. A significant price increase was noted in the fuel industry (price index of 171.4 percent over December). Increased prices in the fuel industry, the metallurgy complex (where the index was 116.5 percent), and chemical industry (116.4 percent) brought about price increases in the machinebuilding industry (where the index was 205.4 percent over December 1993). The index for output of the building materials industry increased 1.9-fold. Significant price increases were observed with respect to the output of light industry (154.1 percent) and the food industry (124.1 percent). INDUSTRY The sharp production decline continues in industry. Physical volume of production decreased 32 percent as compared with the first quarter of 1993, 34.1 percent in March. The production decline was most significant in ferrous metallurgy, machinebuilding, light industry, and the building materials industry. The financial condition of enterprises, the payments crisis, and problems with production output sales are ever more frequently forcing enterprises to halt production partially or completely, to shift operating mode to one of shorter work periods, or to direct employees to take unpaid or only partially paid leave. Whereas 35 enterprises monthly on the average stood idle last year, the number for the first quarter of this year was double, and in March production stopped at 94 enterprises. In the fuel and energy complex, electric power generation diminished by 19.8 percent, and coal production decreased 21 percent. In ferrous metallurgy, reduced demand resulted in a 36.6-percent decrease in the production of rolled metal, a 13.3-percent decrease in the extraction of iron ore, a 38.9-percent reduction in the smelting of cast iron, and 41-percent decrease in steel smelting. In the chemical and wood-processing industry, production of sulfuric acid decreased by 21.9 percent, and mineral fertilizer output by 31.9 percent. The reduction in output of synthetic resins and plastics was especially sharp--constituting only 3.6 percent of the level produced during the first quarter of last year. Only the output of medicinal preparations increased, their growth constituting a 13.3-percent increase over last year's levels. Timber-producing enterprises produced 137,800 densely packed cubic meters of commercial timber over the three months--42.1 percent lower than the level for the first quarter of last year. Sawn lumber production decreased by 33.8 percent. The most perceptible production decline was seen at machinebuilding enterprises. Production of metal-cutting machine tools, excavators, bulldozers, and tractors was reduced by more than half. Motor vehicle production decreased by almost 23 percent. The volume of sector output decreased by 42.3 percent on the whole. Production output of enterprises of the construction industry was reduced significantly in connection with decreased volumes of construction and the insolvency of clients. The volume of production output of these enterprises was reduced 37.5 percent. Production of cement decreased by 47.3 percent, asbestos-cement sheeting by 86.4 percent, precast reinforced-concrete parts and components by 33.5 percent, construction bricks by 43.3 percent, and construction glass by 40.5 percent. The output of commodities for the populace diminished to a greater extent than did industrial and technical production output. In January-March consumer goods were produced totalling R272 billion--32.2 percent less in comparable prices than in the first quarter of 1993. In this regard, production of food products decreased the least amount--by 27.5 percent, while production of cultural and domestic products decreased by 31.6 percent and light-industry commodities decreased by 56.6 percent. Light industry continues to experience deep crisis. Production volume in this sector was reduced more than twofold over the three months. The production output of light industry totalled R19.2 billion, or just a little more than R5,000 on the average per inhabitant for garments, knitted articles, and footwear. Production of knitted articles diminished by half, socks and hosiery--by three-fourths, and leather footwear--by almost 57 percent. THE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX As of the start of the spring sowing season, agricultural enterprises of the oblast were supplied to the 98.5-percent level with seed for spring crops, including wheat--96.7 percent, millet--117.5 percent, and buckwheat--80.9 percent. Seed potatoes were supplied to the extent of 86.1 percent. The insurance stock for spring-crop seed amounted to 29,400 tonnes (59.6 percent of the demand). As of the beginning of April of this year, agricultural enterprises had 4.4 times less diesel fuel on hand than last year, and 2.7 times less gasoline. As of the same date, 21.7 percent of tractors and 24.9 percent of trucks were in a state of disrepair. A significant portion of these were to be found on the farms of Varnenskiy, Nagaybakskiy, Nyazepetrovskiy, and Chesmenskiy Rayons. Over the three months of the current year, 27,600 tonnes of livestock and fowl (live weight) were sold for slaughter; 84,000 tonnes of milk and 151.7 million eggs were produced. These figures are smaller than those for last year by 0.5, 24.6, and 4.9 percent, respectively. One cow yielded 395 kilograms of milk on the average--91 kilograms (18.7 percent) less than last year's level. The average egg-laying capacity per hen decreased by 3.3 percent, amounting to 58 eggs over the past three months. The decreased livestock production volumes were caused both by the diminished productivity of livestock and fowl and by their reduced numbers. As of 1 April, agricultural enterprises had 622,900 head of cattle (88.9 percent of the level as of 1 April 1993), 221,500 cows (93.2 percent), 268,900 pigs (90.6 percent), 395,100 sheep (81.1 percent), and 7,666,600 fowl (98.3 percent). The share of total sales volume of livestock and fowl attributable to state purchases was 70.5 percent for the first quarter of this year; milk, 93.5 percent; and eggs, 91.4 percent. Some 16,600 tonnes of livestock and fowl were purchased by all categories of farms over this period, 54,500 tonnes of milk, and 133.1 million eggs. This is less than the levels for the same period last year by 27.4, 34.8, and 5 percent, respectively. In March the purchase price (not considering subsidies) of one kilogram of meat or poultry (live weight) amounted to R919, which was 3.1 percent less than the previous month's level. For milk, this figure was R201 (2.5 percent greater), and for eggs--R640 (3.2 percent greater). As of the beginning of April of this year, there were 7,191 peasant farms covering an area of 418,700 hectares (58 hectares per farm, on the average). CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION We continue to see a decline in the scale of construction. Volumes of capital investments directed towards development of this sphere amounted to R211 billion in the first quarter, a decrease of 29 percent from first quarter of last year. Operations at a number of construction sites came to a complete halt. As before, the main source of capital investments continues to be the funds that enterprises and organizations have at their disposal--R140 billion, or 66 percent. Some R71 billion, or 34 percent, were allocated from the republic and oblast budgets. Thirty-nine percent of the total volume of capital investments were used by state enterprises and organizations; 60 percent--by joint-stock companies. Fifty-seven percent of all funds were directed towards the construction of production facilities. The volume of capital investments directed towards housing construction decreased by 30 percent. The volume directed towards construction of schools, preschool institutions, hospitals, and clinics decreased by a factor of two or three. Total housing space commissioned amounted to 104,300 square meters--1,711 new apartments. This represents an increase over last year in housing commissioned of 13,000 square meters, or 14 percent. The number of individual residences put into operation increased 2.5-fold; individual builders constructed 57 single-family dwellings, totalling 5,300 square meters in area. Some R3.6 billion was targeted towards measures to eliminate the aftereffects of radioactive contamination, of which R3.4 billion went to the construction of residential housing facilities. PRIVATIZATION OF HOUSING As of 1 April 1994, 326,700 state apartments were privatized. This is 28.3 percent of the total number of apartments subject to privatization. In January-March of this year, 27,400 apartments were converted to citizens' property (8.4 percent of the total number of privatized apartments). TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS Freight shipments continue to diminish. The volume of freight hauled by public-use transportation decreased by 17 million tonnes (48 percent) from the level of first quarter 1993, amounting to 19.1 million tonnes. The volume of freight transported by rail decreased by 34 percent, motor vehicle transport by 59 percent, and air transportation by 55 percent. No improvement is being seen in transportation services provided to the populace. The number of vehicles being put into service is being reduced, and routes are being eliminated or curtailed. In March, 7 percent of the scheduled bus and trolley bus trips in Chelyabinsk were not completed, as was the case for up to 3 percent of the streetcar trips. With respect to suburban and intercity bus travel, 5,000 trips were not completed in the first quarter, and about 500 trips were accomplished with schedule violations. With respect to railroad transportation in January-March, 42 passenger trains (1.5 percent) arrived an average of 1.5 hours late. Regarding domestic airline traffic for Chelyabinsk Airport, 18.5 percent of flights were completed with schedule violations, the average delay being almost three hours. With respect to Magnitogorsk Airport, the applicable figures are 10.7 percent and 2.5 hours. Communications enterprises rendered services during the first quarter valued at R16.9 billion, including services to the populace of R3.9 billion. This is 10.7 times greater, in actual prices, than the figure for the same period of last year. At the same time, the physical volume of communications services rendered continues to diminish. THE CONSUMER MARKET OF GOODS AND SERVICES In January-March of this year, consumer goods valued at R411.2 billion were sold to the oblast populace. This is 5.3 times greater, in actual prices, than the figure for the first quarter of last year. In comparable prices, however, the volume of goods acquired was 21 percent less. The major portion of commodities (63 percent) were acquired in private stores. The share attributable to state trade was 27 percent, consumer cooperatives 6 percent, and enterprises of other forms of ownership 4 percent. The trade volume of public-kitchen enterprises amounted to R31.9 billion, 16 percent less than last year, in comparable prices. The share of production output done on premises was 65.2 percent. The volume of food product sales rose to R235 billion in January-March. In product volume, however, this represents a reduction of 10 percent from the level of the same period last year. The sales volume of main food products in organized trade is decreasing, including a 33-percent reduction in sales of meat and poultry, 48 percent in sausage products, 46 percent in fish, 32-39 percent in eggs and margarine products, and over 50 percent in canned meats and fish. A 12-percent smaller volume of vodka, beer, and other alcoholic beverages was sold. At the same time that sales volumes of food products in the retail trade network decreased, increases were seen in sales of nonorganized trade, on the kolkhoz markets, for example, where the sales turnover of agricultural products rose 1.4 percent on the whole throughout the oblast. The sales volumes of nonfood products decreased by 32 percent, in comparable prices, amounting to R176.2 billion. Paid services to the oblast populace during the first quarter of this year amounted to R50.8 billion, 9.2 times greater in actual prices than the 1993 level, but 65 percent lower in comparable prices. Privately owned enterprises provided almost 14 percent of the total volume of paid services and 39 percent of the volume of consumer services. MONETARY INCOME AND EXPENDITURES OF THE OBLAST POPULATION The monetary income and expenditures of the populace over January-March of 1994 rose more than fivefold over the level of the same period last year, reaching the level of R818.3 billion. The greatest rise in income was seen in February--a 1.3-fold increase over January income, amounting to R60 billion. The growth of income in March was 20 percent less than the February level (R54 billion). Calculated on a per capita basis, the income of oblast residents came to R59,200 in January, R75,800 in February, and R90,700 in March. A slowdown was also observed with respect to growth of ready cash at the disposal of the populace and withdrawal of monetary assets out of the oblast. In January-March 1993 this rate of growth was 13.5-fold, and this year--6.7-fold. The consolidated consumer price index for the full circle of goods and services continues to exceed the growth of income and consumer expenditures: 661 percent in March 1994 over March 1993, while incomes over this period rose 6.1-fold and consumer expenditures--5.6-fold. The amount of funds directed towards consumption in February of this year in all sectors of the economy, calculated on a per-worker basis, reached the level of R147,900. This is 6.7 times greater than the level of February 1993, and 2.3 percent greater than the level of the previous month. The level of average monthly wages reached R137,600 in February--6.6 times greater than the level for the same period last year and 1.2 percent greater than the January level. Average monthly wages in February decreased by 27.4 percent from the January level at institutions of culture and art, and by 16.9 percent at planning and research organizations for construction support. The highest wages in February were received by workers in financial and credit institutions and organizations--R332,400, and workers in transportation enterprises and organizations--R212,700. The lowest average monthly salary was observed at agricultural enterprises--R54,400. Wages in sectors of the nonproduction sphere were 5.9 percent higher than in the production sphere, amounting to R142,000. The highest wage in the oblasts of the Urals region was paid in Sverdlovsk Oblast (R143,500), the lowest was paid in Kurgan Oblast--R105,000. LABOR Average authorized worker strength in all sectors of the economy totalled 1,348,400 people in February, 4.3 percent lower than the level for the same period last year. Significant personnel strength reductions were seen in the organizations of data processing centers--by 19.2 percent, at procurement enterprises--by 13.4 percent, and at planning and research organizations for construction support--by 11.3 percent. The average authorized worker strength doubled at enterprises engaged in general commercial activity in support of the market, and increased by 17.2 percent at institutions of culture and art, organizations of housing and municipal services, and organizations of the nonproduction varieties of provision of consumer services to the populace. As of the beginning of April, 24,700 unemployed were registered with the employment service, including 22,600 people (91.5 percent) receiving unemployment compensation. Of the latter number, 34.9 percent constituted young people aged 16-29, and 64.3 percent were women. Some 14,100 individuals were entered in the register of unemployed over the quarter, of whom 94.8 percent were authorized to receive unemployment compensation. (During the first quarter of 1993, 9,200 unemployed were placed on the register, 8,900 of these being authorized to receive unemployment compensation). Some 7,300 unemployed were removed from the register over the accounting quarter, including 3,300 (45.1 percent) who were placed in job positions. On the whole, the number of workers being discharged is double the requirement for manpower. Thus, the number of persons unemployed will increase still further. FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS In January-March 1994, the oblast volume of foreign trade turnover through direct ties amounted to $65.98 million in foreign trade prices. Goods and services valued at $43.951 million were exported, including exports to industrially developed countries of $32.753 million (74.5 percent), to developing countries--$411,000 (0.9 percent), and to remaining countries (the former CEMA countries, republics of the former Yugoslavia, China, Korean People's Democratic Republic, and the Baltic countries)--$10.787 million (24.6 percent). Oblast imports through direct foreign trade ties were valued at $22.029 million. Some 54.8 percent of the total volume of imports was attributable to the industrially developed countries, 5.8 percent to developing countries, and 39.4 percent to the remaining countries. The foreign trade balance with respect to direct cooperation between oblast enterprises and organizations and foreign firms was a positive one in the amount of $21.922 million. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION A gradual decrease in pollution is being observed against the background of overall production decline. Thus in 1993, 1.5453 million tonnes of pollutants were discharged into the environment by surveyed enterprises. This is 34.4 percent less than in 1990 and 15.3 percent less than last year. The oblast Committee for Ecology and Utilization of Natural Resources is monitoring compliance with environmental legislation. Enterprises paid fines in the amount of R26.3 million for various violations of this legislation.
