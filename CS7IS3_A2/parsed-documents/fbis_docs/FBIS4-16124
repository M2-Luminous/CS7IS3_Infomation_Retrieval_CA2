The session was to be held on the initiative of the Latvian president and prime minister who insisted that draft agreements on the withdrawal of troops reached with Russia be discussed before the documents are signed. However, both Latvian top officials gave up their proposal in connection with Boris Yeltsin's order on the creation of a military base in Latvia. A request to cancel an emergency session of the Latvian parliament was sent by Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis from Paris, where he is currently staying on a visit. Ulmanis' letter says that in view of the fact that Yeltsin's order has not been withdrawn in a form demanded by Latvia, the signing of earlier initialed agreements in their present form is impossible. Ulmanis believes that a meeting with Boris Yeltsin in the near future is impossible either. This was announced to the general secretary of the European Council by Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs. In his letter the Latvian foreign minister pointed out that the Russian president's order was regarded in Latvia as a threat to its sovereignty.
