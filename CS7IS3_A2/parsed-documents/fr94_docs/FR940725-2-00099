FR940725-2-00099 FR940725-2-00063 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34388; International Series Release No. 686; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;14] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing and Trading of Options and Full-Value and Reduced-Value Long-Term Options on the Nikkei Stock Index 300 July 15, 1994. I. Introduction On April 19, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of options and long-term options (``LEAPS'') 3 based on the Nikkei Stock Index 300 (``Nikkei 300 Index'' or ``Index''), as well as LEAPS based on a reduced-value Index. On June 28, 1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 4 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 ``LEAPS'' is an acronym for Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities. LEAPS are long-term index option series that expire from 12 to 36 months from their date of issuance. See CBOE Rule 24.9(b)(1). 4 In Amendment No. 1, the Exchange (1) lowered the proposed position limits for Index options and Index LEAPS to 25,000 contracts on the same side of the market, provided that no more than 15,000 contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month; (2) specified that the total capitalization of the Index, as of march 31, 1994, was US$2.25 trillion; and (3) supplied data on the average daily trading volume in the component securities for the period commencing December 1, 1993 and ending May 31, 1994. See Letter from Eileen Smith, Director, Product Development, CBOE, to Thomas McManus, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated June 28, 1994. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register on May 24, 1994. 5 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the Exchange's proposal and Amendment No. 1 thereto. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34077 (May 18, 1994), 59 FR 26824 (May 24, 1994). II. Description of the Proposal A. General The CBOE proposes to trade standardized index option contracts based on the Nikkei 300 Index, an index comprised of 300 representative stocks of the first section 6 of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (``TSE''). 7 The CBOE also proposes to list LEAPS on the full-value Index and LEAPS on a reduced-value Index that will be computed at one-tenth of the value of the Index. Nikkei 300 Index LEAPS will trade independently of and in addition to regular Nikkei 300 Index options traded on the Exchange; however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index LEAPS and regular Index options will be aggregated. 8 The Exchange believes that options on the Index, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will provide investors with a low-cost means of participating in the performance of the Japanese economy and hedging against the risk of investing in that economy. 6 First section stocks are distinguished from second section stocks by more stringent listing standards. Telephone conversation between Eileen Smith, Director, Product Development, CBOE, and Francois Mazur, Attorney, Office of Derivatives and Equity Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (May 16, 1994). 7 The CBOE has represented that the designations ``Nikkei Stock Index 300'' and ``Nikkei 300'' are the property of Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. 8 See infra Section II.F. B. Composition and Maintenance of the Index The Nikkei 300 Index was designed by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. (``NKS''). The CBOE represents that Index component stocks were selected by NKS for their high market capitalizations and their high degree of liquidity, and are representative of the industrial composition of the broader Japanese equity market. On June 20, 1994, the CBOE formally executed a licensing agreement with NKS to list options on the Nikkei 300 Index. 9 9 Telephone conversation between Eileen Smith, Director, Product Development, CBOE, and Thomas McManus, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (June 28, 1994). As of March 31, 1994, the total capitalization of the Index was US$2.25 trillion. 10 Market capitalizations of the individual stocks in the Index ranged from a high of US$76.5 billion to a low of US$875 million, with a median of US$3.3 billion and a mean of US$7.5 billion. In addition, the average daily trading volume of the stocks in the Index, for the six-month period ending May 31, 1994, ranged from a high of 6,279,901 shares to a low of 11,525 shares, with a median of approximately 488,000 shares and a mean of approximately 846,000 shares. The highest weighted component stock in the Index accounts for 3.41 percent of the Index. The five largest Index components account for approximately 15.14 percent of the Index's value. The lowest weighted component stock comprises 0.04 percent of the Index, and the five smallest Index components account for approximately 0.20 percent of the Index's value. 10 Based on the March 31, 1994 exchange rate of Y102.75 per US$1.00. The Index is maintained by NKS. To maintain the continuity of the Index, NKS will adjust the Index divisor to reflect certain events relating to the component stocks. These events include, but are not limited to, changes in the number of shares outstanding, spin-offs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. The CBOE represents that NKS reviews the composition of the Index periodically.
