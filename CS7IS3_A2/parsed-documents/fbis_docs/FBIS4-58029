At the end of its general congress meetings, held near the Sudanese border with Uganda last week, the SPLM issued a statement. According to the statement, the SPLM congress formed an executive council and instructed it: 1. To seek self-determination for the "New Sudan" people. 2. To mobilize the country's resources for the war effort. 3. To separate civilian from military administration. 4. To create the necessary infrastructure for "New Sudan." 5. To create an independent judicial system. 6. To respect the law and protect human rights. 7. To issue a general amnesty for former insurgents. With these seven tasks and the announcement of this new organization, the SPLM has taken a serious step toward the formation of a state completely separate from north Sudan. The statement defines the borders of New Sudan as those areas in south Kurdufan in western Sudan, areas south of the Blue Nile in eastern Sudan, and the three south districts of Upper Nile, Equatoria, and Bahr al-Ghazal. According to political observers, the above resolutions run counter to all the agreements endorsed by the National Democratic Grouping [al-tajammu' al-watani al-dimuqrati; NDG]. The NDG's charter, which the SPLM had signed, calls for replacing the current regime in Sudan with a transitional democratic government and a multiparty system. Observers say that the views of several northern political organizations, who support self-determination in south Sudan, have encouraged the SPLM to make this difficult decision. According to African observers, Garang was under heavy pressure to take such a step. There has been unprecedented pressure for secession and the formation of an independent state in the south. Observers say that the 10-year war has taken its toll on the SPLM. The sudden tack by Garang's group coincides with mounting unrest in Sudan. Antigovernment demonstrations were reported in Madani and al-Qadarif. The protests could threaten the regime's survival if they spread to Khartoum. Observers say that the opening a new dialogue with Garang's SPLM would be useless so long as the National Islamic Front is in power. They add that Sudan's unity can only be preserved through swift action to bring down the regime.
