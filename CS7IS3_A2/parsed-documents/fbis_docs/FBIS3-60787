Another nine policemen and at least 20 civilians were injured. The homes in front of the Prefecture, which is on Espana Avenue in the area near the U.S. Embassy and the Sheraton Hotel, were totally destroyed and are now uninhabitable. The shock wave destroyed stores, businesses, and banks on Alfonso Ugarte Avenue, which is perpendicular to Espana Avenue. The terrorists detonated one car bomb against the Prefecture from Alfonso Ugarte Avenue. The explosion at 0545 local (1045 GMT) destroyed a police armored personnel carrier in which human remains were seen. It is therefore presumed that at least one policeman died inside. Another car bomb was detonated near the Prefecture at the corner of Alfonso Ugarte and Bolivia Avenues. Seven injured policemen, some in serious condition, were sent to the Lima Police hospital. Approximately 200 policemen have been mobilized to protect the area and search out the attackers.
