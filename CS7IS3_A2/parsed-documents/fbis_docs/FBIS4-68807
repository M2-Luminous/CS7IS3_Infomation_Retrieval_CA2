Now, once again, it will be possible to enter dozens of major villages on the bank of the Amur, including the rayon centers of Leninskoye and Amurzet, only on the basis of special passes. And yet not four years have passed since, by decision of the local Soviets of Amur Oblast and Khabarovsk Kray, which at that time also included the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, there was a rejection of strict border regulations everywhere in the area along the Amur. At that time, in 1991, many Far Easterners greeted literally with a hurrah the abolition of the border zones and the easing up of border regulations. And that was really understandable, because that radically changed the life of the border area: the bans and limitations were reduced to the minimum, and free access was opened up to the Amur and to its channels and tributaries in places where the border ran, and where the barbed-wire fences were removed, so that you could catch fish, relax, and enjoy the gifts of nature! However, many of the inhabitants of the Far East and other regions of the country perceived the liberalization of the border regulations as permissiveness. A rare day has passed sincethat time on the border without violations and all kinds of reported incidents. Criminal elements of all kinds have rushed into this area: some with the purpose of carrying out smuggling transactions with their Chinese counterparts, and others were attracted to the bottomlands of the Amur by untouched areas of marijuana. In the border rayons, where crimes used to be extremely rare phenomena, robberies, muggings, and other heinous crimes have become an everyday occurrence. The border guards now have many new things to worry about. In addition to their direct duty -- the protection of the borders -- they have had to catch and eject from the confines of their areas the narcotics dealers who have come here. It is not surprising that the population of the border area, which became accustomed during their long life behind the swing-down barrier to moderation and order, and which now is intimidated by this kind of bacchanalia, began almost immediately to demand a return to the old standards and rules. It took a long time for the local authorities to decide to take such a backwakrd step. But this is the first precedent. Probably the example of the Jewish Oblast will inspire the inhabitants of other territories to wage an even more aggressive struggle for a return to the previous regulations on the border. And the slogan "We want to go back to the zone!" will become even more popular in the area along the Amur.
