Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown on Wednesday [12 January] described his visit to the Middle East next week as the best indication yet of Washington's commitment to regional economic development as part of the Arab-Israeli peace process. Mr. Brown, who is due in Amman on Monday after visiting Saudi Arabia, noted that he would be accompanied by representatives of American businessmen and said one of the objectives of his trip was to identify areas where the U.S. private sector could be encouraged to interact with its counterparts in the countries of the region. Parallel to that goal, Mr. Brown said, he would also be "very aggressively" pursuing the U.S. quest to have the Arab boycott of Israel lifted. "I have raised (this issue) with every meeting I had" with the concerned governments, he said, noting that he was scheduled to meet with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) ministers in Riyadh on Sunday. "The U.S. is going to continue to push to eliminate all boycotts and I am going to press it with all the leaders with (whom) I meet, as I have done before, and as President Clinton has done," he said. Answering questions from businessmen and journalists from Amman, Cairo, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in a satellite interview from Washington, Mr. Brown declined to be specific on most issues, saying that all options were under consideration during his visit. The American official agreed that the continuing de facto blockade of the port of al-'Aqabah as part of the enforcement of the U.N. sanctions against Iraq was contrary to the new-found spirit of free international trade without any barriers. But he did not indicate when Washington, through its influence in the U.N. Security Council, would be moving to address Jordanian grievances over the high cost the Kingdom's importers and exporters have to pay for shipping to and from al-'Aqabah as a result of the costly delays posed by the inspection. Mr. Brown did promise, however, that he would study a report prepared by Jordanian businessmen and handed over to a U.S. fact- finding mission in September. He appeared to suggest that the sanctions on Iraq were somehow directly linked to the overall Middle East peace process by suggesting that once a regional peace settlement is achieved the Jordanian concerns could be addressed. "Vestiges of past tension have to be removed,' he said. "We hope to move as quickly as possible to that date..." The commerce secretary also agreed that there had to be a better "equilibrium" in trade between the U.S. and Jordan, but did not spell out whether the administration was planning specific action wherever it could help increase American imports from Jordan. According to Dr. Thabit al-Tahir, a former minister and a current member of the Jordan Businessmen's Association (JBA) who was one of Wednesday's questioners, Jordanian imports from the U.N. totalled $301 million in the first 10 months of 1993, while American imports of Jordanian products remained under $4 million. Mr. Brown acknowledged that one of his objectives during the visit was to increase U.S. exports to the region. "I also understand that a commercial relationship is a two-way street...there has to be an equilibrium...and that is what we are trying to create." Mr. Brown said Washington was "committed to the economic development" of the Middle East so that people can feel peace has brought changes" to their standards of living. His visit to the Middle East at "this crucial" point in time in the peace process, Mr. Brown said, is intended to be a signal of this commitment. "I think that is why this mission is so important," he added. "With the coming of peace people's expectations are high in all the countries involved in the region. People believe that their lives are going to change ..." According to Mr. Brown, economic development and cooperation in the region meant increased job opportunities as one of the most tangible results of the peace process for the ordinary citizen. The U.S. official said he and the businessmen accompanying him were looking forward to "creative kinds of proposals" from their interlocutors in the region. He described the level of American investment in the Middle East as very low and attributed it to a sense of lack of stability and security and said Washington wanted to find out "whether we can increase the comfort level ... the confidence level" of businessmen in investing in the region. "We are going to establish direct contacts between American businessmen and Jordanian, Palestinian, Israeli and Saudi businessmen," he said. In the context of the American role in Palestinian economic development, Mr. Brown specifically referred to a group of Jewish American and Arab American businessmen under the umbrella of a new group, "Builders for Peace," and said Washington would be closely coordinating with the group in terms of encouraging American businesses to invest. "Builders for peace" was set up under a Washington-encouraged initiative undertaken by former senator James Abourisk and former congressman Mel Devine. it groups many Arab-American as well as Jewish-American businessmen who have shown keen interest in investing in the occupied territories. Infrastructure for the Palestinians in the occupied territories is an area where immediate opportunities exist for potential investors, he said. "There is very little on that agenda (Palestinian economic development) that we are not talking about now," Mr. Brown told a Palestinian questioner from Jerusalem. "The United States has to put a stake in the ground," he said.
