That is not incomprehensible: On Capitol Hill the Republican opposition is shouting as loud as possible that this scandal is "a new Watergate" that could cost President Clinton his head. This conclusion is premature and completely wrong, but politically the Republicans are absolutely in the right. They are using "Whitewater-gate" to reduce Clinton's political clout and block reforms like those in health care. They also are hoping to win seats in November's congressional elections. Will Whitewater be the proverbial banana skin on which Clinton slips? Is it certain that the President and his wife were involved in a financial scandal in the period when Clinton was governor in Arkansas? It is unclear how deeply the couple have gotten themselves in a jam. Moreover it is doubtful whether the investigation by the independent prosecutor will yield criminal evidence. All the same Clinton and his staff have operated in an exceptionally clumsy way. The fact that people are talking about Whitewater-gate is the result of the Clintons' failing personnel policy. They surround themselves with friends whose quality is open to discussion. Bernard Nussbaum, the dismissed financial advisor, is just such a good friend, but a bungling lawyer. Peace will only return to the White House when the Clintons replace their pals, like the weak chief of staff Thomas McLarty, with political professionals. Keeping a tidy ship means not only being open in the Whitewater investigations, but also doing away with amateurism.
