FR940414-0-00032 FR940414-0-00010 The PBGC believes that similar relief should be available for plans terminating in distress terminations pursuant to section 4041(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the PBGC's distress termination regulation (29 CFR part 2616). Sections 2616.3(b), 2616.24, and 2616.25(c)(2) establish deadlines for filing a distress termination notice and related information with the PBGC. Section 2616.27(a)(1) establishes the deadline for issuing notices of benefit distribution in those few terminations where the plan is sufficient for at least guaranteed benefits and, accordingly, plan assets may be distributed to participants and beneficiaries in a manner similar to a standard termination distribution. (The notices of distribution are similar to the notices of plan benefits required in standard terminations under 29 CFR 2617.23.) Finally, §2616.29(a)(1) contains distribution procedures and deadlines that are generally the same as those in standard terminations; that section cross-references 29 CFR 2617.28 (c), (e), and (f) and provides the same 180-day (unless extended) deadline for distribution. The amendments in this final rule permit the PBGC's Executive Director (or his or her designee) to extend the above deadlines in the same circumstances as were provided for standard terminations in the interim rule. (The PBGC did not include distress terminations in the interim rule because the small number of distress terminations filed annually lessened the need for prompt action; however, these provisions are essentially procedural in that they establish alternative mechanisms for obtaining extensions of filing or other deadlines (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A)), and the notice and public procedure and delayed effective date requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 therefore do not apply.) E.O. 12866 The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12866, because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. List of Subjects 29 CFR Part 2606 Administrative practice and procedure, Organization and functions (Government agencies), Pension insurance, Pensions. 29 CFR Parts 2616 and 2617 Employee benefit plans, Pension insurance, Pensions, Reporting requirements. In consideration of the foregoing, the interim final rule amending 29 CFR parts 2606 and 2617, as published on August 24, 1993, at 58 FR 44738 and corrected on September 17, 1993, at 58 FR 48600, is adopted as a final rule without change, and 29 CFR part 2616 is amended as follows: PART 2616_DISTRESS TERMINATIONS OF SINGLE-EMPLOYER PLANS 1. The authority citation for part 2616 continues to read as follows: Authority: 29 U.S.C. 1302(b)(3), 1341, 1344. §2616.3 [Amended] 2. Paragraph (b)(2) of §2616.3 is amended by adding ``or, if applicable, no later than the due date established in an extension notice issued under §2616.10'' after ``date'' and before the semicolon. 2a. Section 2616.10 is redesignated as §2616.11. 3. A new §2616.10 is added to subpart A to read as follows: §2616.10 Disaster relief. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, when the President of the United States declares that, under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5121, 5122(2), 5141(b)), a major disaster exists, the Executive Director of the PBGC (or his or her designee) may, by issuing one or more notices of disaster relief, extend the due date for filing the distress termination notice pursuant to §2616.24, for issuing the notices of benefit distribution pursuant to §2616.27(a)(1), or for completing the distribution of plan assets pursuant to §2616.29, by up to 180 days. (b) The due date extension or extensions shall apply only to plan terminations with respect to which the principal place of business of the contributing sponsor or the plan administrator, or the office of the service provider, bank, insurance company, or other person maintaining the information necessary to file the distress termination notice, to issue the notices of benefit distribution, or to complete the distribution of plan assets (as applicable), is within a designated disaster area.
