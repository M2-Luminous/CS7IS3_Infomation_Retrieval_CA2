FR941212-0-00064 FR941212-0-00018 Following the Council's August 9&hyph;10, 1994, meeting, the Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Workshop (SAW) issued to the Council an unprecedented Special Advisory on Groundfish Status on Georges Bank along with its 18th Stock Assessment Report (SAW 18). The Advisory Report concluded that yellowtail flounder and haddock stocks have ``collapsed'' and warned that the cod stock is in imminent danger of collapse, as well, unless the sharply declining trend in spawning stock biomass is halted. Hence the report advised that, for Georges Bank cod and yellowtail flounder, current fishing mortality rates would need to be reduced by 60 percent and 52 percent, respectively, just to achieve the maintenance level (i.e., the point at which stocks will cease, on average, to decline). The report advised that in order to avert a collapse of cod and improve the prospects of stock rebuilding for yellowtail, fishing mortality should be reduced to as low a level as possible, approaching zero. For Georges Bank cod, SAW 18 concluded that the fishing mortality rate increased from 0.3 in 1978 to a record high of 0.91 in 1993, well over twice the definition of the overfishing level specified in the FMP. The spawning stock biomass continued to decline from more than 90,000 metric tons (mt) during the early 1980s to a record low of 37,200 mt in 1993. Projections for 1994 indicate that the spawning stock biomass will decline further to record low levels around 19,000 mt and that the landings for 1994 will be the lowest since the 1960s. SAW 18 results on the status of Georges Bank yellowtail flounder concluded that fishing mortality rates are about twice the overfishing level as defined in the FMP. Further, the spawning stock biomass of 3,010 mt in 1993 has declined from a moderate level of 17,385 mt in 1982 and from an earlier high of 25,000 mt in 1973. Similar grave reports came out of the last assessment for the Southern New England yellowtail flounder stock (Stock Assessment Workshop 17 (SAW 17)). Fishing mortality rates for this stock have been extremely high, reaching exploitation rates greater than 80 percent in recent years. In 1992, the exploitation rate was 84 percent, far exceeding the 35 percent exploitation rate associated with the overfishing definition. Spawning stock biomass declined 94 percent between 1989 and 1992, from 22,000 mt to 1,300 mt as the 1987 year class was removed from the spawning stock. Further, spawning stock biomass for 1993 has been projected to decline to 1,052 mt because year classes following the 1987 year class are weak. Recruitment in the last several years has been the lowest on record. Landings and spawning stock biomass for 1994 are projected to be less than 1,000 and 2,500 mt respectively, both well below average. The most recent assessment of haddock (Stock Assessment Workshop 13 (SAW 13)) indicated that haddock spawning stock biomass on Georges Bank has been reduced from 130,000 mt in 1963 to an estimated 10,000 mt at the beginning of 1993, significantly lower than the 130,000 mt required to provide an annual maximum sustainable yield of 47,000 mt. The haddock stocks on Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine are at all-time low levels of abundance, and the 1993 landings were the lowest in recorded history. Amendment 6 to the FMP and its Environmental Assessment/Regulatory Impact Review addressed the need for immediate action to protect these stocks. The conservation measures for haddock implemented under Amendment 6 have likely reduced fishing mortality and have afforded some protection to the spawning stock and to new recruits. The stock is still in a collapsed condition, but the harvest rate is probably below the level at which the stock is simply maintained. Amendment 5 was intended to eliminate overfishing of the primary multispecies stocks through incremental effort-reduction, mesh-size increase, and expanding spawning area closures, among other measures, over a 5- to 7-year period. When the Council adopted objectives for Amendment 5 more than 3 years ago, cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder stocks were being fished at a rate that was, on average, twice what could be sustained over the long term, so a plan was designed to reduce fishing by half. However, during the development and implementation period of Amendment 5, fishing mortality rates increased and the downward trends in stock size and yields continued to accelerate. Given the new information presented at SAW 18, the recently imposed management measures in Amendment 5 are inadequate and will not achieve the reductions in fishing mortality rates needed to rebuild the multispecies stocks. In response to these new, alarming assessments and advice, the Council has begun the development of an FMP amendment (Amendment 7) to implement the recommendations of SAWs 17 and 18 for severely depleted multispecies stocks, including Georges Bank yellowtail flounder, Southern New England yellowtail flounder, haddock, Georges Bank cod, and others, as needed. To this effect, a notice of intent to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement for Amendment 7 and a request for comments was published in the Federal Register on October 27, 1994.
