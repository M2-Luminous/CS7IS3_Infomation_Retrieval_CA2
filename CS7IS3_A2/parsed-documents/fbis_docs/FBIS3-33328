We now go to Oscar Navarro with the details. [Navarro] Just as you said, Jorge Madrazo, after presenting his preliminary report on the events of Altos de Chiapas, has said the CNDH has stated it has received and begun to investigate 218 complaints involving 727 individuals. Of these, 20 are due to acts perpetrated by the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN]; seventy-six are against members of the Mexican Army; four are against personnel from the Attorney General's Office; three are against employees and state government officials, and one is against the municipal presidents of Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and Tenejapa. In a lengthy communique, Ombudsman Jorge Madrazo has stated the CNDH has 218 case files regarding, among others, 56 murders, 30 cases of aggression, 427 kidnappings and disappearances, 25 cases of torture, 80 for illegal arrest, four for illegal property confiscation, two for intimidation, two for robbery, and four for air strikes. I believe we should hear what Jorge Madrazo had to say about the air strikes. [Begin Madrazo recording] It has been initially determined the projectiles used where the CNDH conducted its investigation are known as rockets. Their destructive capability, given the expansive range and effects of fragmentation, is less than that caused by what is commonly known as a bomb. [end recording] [Navarro] Madrazo added 404 cases of missing people have been solved; twenty-three are still pending. He also highlighted the fact that 20,000 people have fled from their homes in the areas where the EZLN is operating. There have also been reports of abuse against Indians. Let's listen to the report on deaths in the before mentioned municipalities. [Begin Madrazo recording] There were a total of 40 deaths; of these, 20 were identified as civilians; six were government troops, and 14 were unidentified individuals who have not yet been claimed and who could very well be EZLN members. This has not been confirmed. The total number of deaths reported at the CNDH is 145, including 14 members of the Mexican Army and 38 public security personnel. [end recording] [Navarro] The ombudsman explained CNDH intervention will not cease when the investigations conclude. The commission has agreed to establish a permanent program for Altos de Chiapas and the surrounding jungles, which will be to attend to the consequences in which the conflict will surely result. Madrazo concluded the CNDH has determined that several Indian chiefs, who in addition to demanding that the commission leave the Chiapas region, could jeopardize the peace process, just to defend their selfish interests.
