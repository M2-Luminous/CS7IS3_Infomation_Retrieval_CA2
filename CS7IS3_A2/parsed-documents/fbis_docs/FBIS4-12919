"There are three more attacks to come," Hamas said in a communique sent to AFP in Gaza City. On April 7, a suicide bomber blew up a bus at 'Afula killing seven Israelis and wounding 45 in the first attack to avenge the mosque massacre of 30 Muslims by a Jewish settler in Hebron on February 25. Hamas said it was proud to claim responsibility in the name of its armed branch 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam for Wednesday's attack at Hadera that left five dead apart from the bomber and 30 wounded. "The enemy prime minister (Yitzhaq) Rabin and his chief-of-staff Ehud Baraq can expect three more surprises to make them control the settlers," Hamas announced. "The Hadera attack is another victory for 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam's intelligence and security network," it boasted. "Our hero got through all of Israel's security checks." Israel "totally" sealed off the occupied territories after the 'Afula bombing in a bid to halt more killings and announced that security had been stepped up for Wednesday's memorial day for fallen soldiers and independence day on Thursday. Hamas warned Arabs living in Israel to keep away from public places where Jews gathered. "We advise them not to get on Israeli buses." The communique also criticized PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat for voicing regret at the murders. "'Izz al-Din al-Qassam swears by God and the gun to defend our national rights." [In a related report, Paris AFP in English at 0904 GMT on 14 April adds the following: "The young Hamas militant who died carrying out the Hadera bus bombing had been arrested several times for clashes with Israeli troops, residents of his home village said Thursday. ["They named the bomber as 22-year-old 'Amr Salih 'Amarnah and said he was from the occupied West Bank village of Ya'bad, east of Hadera where a bomb on a bus Wednesday killed five Israelis and wounded 30. ["Israeli troops had arrested 'Amarnah several times, villagers told AFP. ["Police said the assailant in the Hadera bombing, which coincided with Israel's memorial day for its soldiers who have fallen in battle, came from the West Bank but did not name him. ["They said he had also placed a second bomb in the Hadera central bus station, timed to explode 90 minutes after the first blast and at a time when Israelis observed a minute of silence for their fallen soldiers. ["Explosives experts blew up the second bomb."] [In another related report, Paris AFP in English at 0915 GMT on 14 April adds the following: "Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah, in an interview published Thursday, said the group was ready to halt deadly attacks on civilians inside the Jewish state if Israelis stopped `killing our children.' ["`The principle of reciprocity is the same everywhere,' he told the London-based Arabic newspaper AL-HAYAH. ["`When Rabin stops killing our children and our women, Hamas will stop attacking civilians and it will target only troops and settlers,' the spokesman said. ["`The shabab (youths) of the intifadah will do miracles and will prove that the Israeli army is a paper tiger,' Ghawshah warned. ["He also blasted 'Arafat for expressing regrets. `The blood of Palestinian children and women is not cheaper than the blood of Israeli civilians,' he said."]
