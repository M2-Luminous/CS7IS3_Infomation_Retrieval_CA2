Prime Minister Edem Kodjo, who has been snubbed by his opposition friends, has still not been able to form his government. This situation is a source of concern for Togo's donors, especially, the World Bank, which would like the new institutions to be set up quickly before reviving negotiations with international institutions. Olabire da Cruz reports from Lome: [Begin da Cruz recording] After two separate meetings with Prime Minister Edem Kodjo and President Eyadema on 18 and 19 May, the World Bank executive director for Togo, Mr. Jean-Pierre Noboude, said that he would like to see the institutions established quickly in order to have specific officials to talk to before new agreements are signed. According to Mr. Noboude, this should be done by the end of this month or at the beginning of June at the latest so that the country can benefit from some 20 billion CFA francs to be allocated, essentially for urban development and the procurement of drugs by the Health Ministry. For the people, Mr. Noboude's statement seems to be an answer to its SOS call to politicians to help them deal with the numerous problems resulting from the protracted sociopolitical crisis and the recent devaluation of the CFA franc. When is the government going to be formed? This is the question on the lips of Togolese, who are increasingly worried that possible aid might pass them by because of the institutional void which some people hope will be filled within the next few days or even hours.
