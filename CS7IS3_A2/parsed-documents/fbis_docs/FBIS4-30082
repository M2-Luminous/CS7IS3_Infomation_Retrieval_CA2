The law, which will go into effect next June, will be the first of its kind in Japan. The law was passed by the powerful House of Representatives June 15. In the course of debates in both chambers, a total of 16 appendixes were attached to the bill to ease the burden on consumers seeking compensation in proving a product is defective. Under the present system, consumers are required to prove negligence on the part of producers. The new law leaves the decision on whether a product is defective up to the court. Products covered by the law include medicines such as live vaccines and blood agents. Manufacturers must now work out new measures to cope with future legal action taken by consumers seeking damages and compensation, industry officials said. Consumer electronics makers have moved to consolidate and realign their in-house legal and intellectual property protection departments, they said. Similar moves will be taken by pharmaceutical makers, they said. The officials said medium and small enterprises have held seminars to get acquainted with the new law.
