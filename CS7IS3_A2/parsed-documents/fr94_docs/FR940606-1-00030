FR940606-1-00030 FR940606-1-00008 a. Cleaning operation. The notification of compliance status should include an identification of each cleaning solvent used at the facility, a description of the procedures to be used to ensure that bags and containers are kept closed when not in use and that cleaning solvents are stored in closed containers, the name of each cleaning solvent that does not conform to the approved composition list, and the vapor pressure test results of each. Specific to spray gun cleaning, the notification of compliance status should also contain a detailed description of all methods used to clean spray guns and an explanation as to how each cleaning method complies with the proposed standards. Information to be included in the semiannual report covers all noncompliance situations such as using a hand-wipe cleaning solvent that does not conform to the approved composition list or vapor pressure requirements used in a non-exempt operation. In addition, the semiannual report includes information on new cleaning solvents used for hand-wipe cleaning in the previous six months, as well as previously reported cleaning solvents no longer in use. The information to be provided is a list of any new cleaning solvents used in the previous six months, a list of new non-HAP cleaning solvents, if any, used, and, for new cleaning solvents used in hand-wipe cleaning operations, the composite vapor pressure of each. If the cleaning operation has been in compliance for the annual period, then an annual report would be required occurring every 12 months from the date of the initial report stating that the cleaning operation has been in compliance with the applicable standards. b. Primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations. For primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations, the notification of compliance status should identify the combination of compliant coatings, averaging, and control devices that were used to demonstrate that the facility was in compliance, and, for control devices, what operating parameters were identified for continuous monitoring in order to ensure continuous compliance with the proposed standards. Owners and operators complying with the organic HAP and VOC content levels for primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations would be required to report each exceedance of the organic HAP or VOC content level, as well as any time a primer or topcoat application operation was not immediately shut down when the pressure drop across the filters or waterwash was out of range. These reports would be submitted on a semiannual basis. If control devices are used, semiannual reports would be required that contain information on all days when the average values of the parameters required to be monitored were outside the ranges established in the operating permit. For incinerators, this would be whenever each 3-hour average temperature was below the average temperature established during the most recent performance test during which compliance was demonstrated. If no exceedances occur, each owner and operator would submit annual statements indicating that each affected facility has been in compliance. The annual reports for primer and topcoat application operations would also identify the number of times, if any, the pressure drop limits for each filter or waterwash system were exceeded. c. Depainting operation. The notification of compliance status for depainting operations should identify each chemical stripper used at the facility to depaint aerospace vehicles and the organic HAP content of each. Each chemical stripper that contains organic HAP and is used for decal removal, depainting of parts, and spot stripping would also be identified. In addition, the types of non-chemical depainting methods and techniques used at the facility and the manufacturer's recommended pressure drop across the filters for the particulate removal system, if applicable, would be identified. Finally, each owner or operator would be required to describe the depainting methods to be used during periods of malfunction of the non-chemical depainting methods. Information to be included in the semiannual report would include the name of any new chemical strippers used during the previous six months and the organic HAP content of each. For each chemical stripper used for depainting operations that undergoes reformulation, its organic HAP content after reformulation would be submitted with the semiannual report. The report would also be required if the owner or operator used any new non-chemical depainting technique at the facility since the initial report or any subsequent semiannual report. The semiannual report would be required to identify each 24-hour period where organic HAP were emitted from the depainting operation except from the exempt operations, any periods of malfunction of non-chemical depainting methods and techniques, and any periods where the non-chemical depainting operation was not immediately shut down when the pressure drop across the filters was out of range. For each malfunction that occurs, the following information would be reported: (1) The piece of equipment that malfunctioned, (2) the date the malfunction occurred and the date it was corrected, (3) a description of the malfunction, (4) the alternate methods used to depaint the aerospace vehicles during the malfunction period, and (5) the dates that these methods were begun and discontinued. Finally, the semiannual report would be required to identify all changes in the type of aircraft depainted at the facility and to identify the parts normally removed for depainting separate from the aircraft for each new type of aircraft depainted. For spot stripping and decal removal, an annual report would be required whenever the average volume per aircraft of organic HAP-containing chemical strippers used exceeds the limits specified in the proposed rule for the annual period. If the depainting operation has been in compliance for the annual period, then an annual report would be required every 12 months from the date of the initial report stating that the depainting operation has been in compliance with the applicable standards. This annual report would also detail how many times the pressure drop limits for each filter system were exceeded and report when the calculated annual average volume of organic HAP-containing strippers used per aircraft for spot stripping and decal removal exceeded the applicable limits. d. Handling and storage of waste. The notification of compliance status would identify each waste stream and identify whether it is RCRA or non-RCRA regulated. The notification would also include a description of the procedures to be used to ensure that spills are minimized during handling and transfer operations. Also included would be the procedures to be used to ensure that waste is stored in closed containers.
