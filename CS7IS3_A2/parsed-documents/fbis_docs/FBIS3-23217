He reiterated that the military had exerted itself to restore traffic along that important highway; adding he does not believe law-abiding people are capable of perpetrating terrorist attacks like the most recent one. He also pointed out that the URNG admitted on several occasions it considers bridges, electric towers, or GUATEL [Guatemalan Telecommunications Enterprise] pylons as military targets. "I do not believe the military or any other Guatemalan group could created another terrorist faction because we are genuinely striving to achieve peace rather than to increase poverty and polarization," he added.
