In its editorial today, the paper says that the new security policy is based on the availability of accurate and specific data about the terrorist organizations, their operational methods, hideouts, and modes of communication with each other in Egypt and with their financiers and instigators abroad. The paper adds: The facts prove beyond a shadow of doubt that these unbalanced young men, devoid of any true religious faith, have consciously or unconsciously become agents of foreign anti-Egypt schemes to undermine the country's successful economic reform program. The paper concludes: Now that the picture is perfectly clear and the identities of the murderers known, there is no alternative to an all-out confrontation using the law's sharp scalpel to excise this malignant tumor from the homeland's body.
