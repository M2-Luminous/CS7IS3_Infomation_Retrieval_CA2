He was commenting on the UN Secretary General's appeal to NATO headquarters to consider the possibility of air strikes designed to break the siege of Sarajevo. If Butrus Butrus-Ghali "heads an organization which is a subsidiary of some country" and "suppresses the freedoms of other countries," then "we and other East European nations will leave that organization," the LDP leader emphasized. His second-largest party group in the Russian State Duma is outspokenly pro-Serbian when the Yugoslav crisis is discussed. Asked whether he will propose any initiative if the Serbian positions were bombed, Zhirinovskiy said that "there is no if" for him. "We reject all kinds of violence. We do not want even to hear of air strikes against Bosnian towns," the LDP leader said.
