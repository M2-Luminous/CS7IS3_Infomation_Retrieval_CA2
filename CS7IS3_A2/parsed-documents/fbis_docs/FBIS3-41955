Those respective decisions had more to do with politics and diplomacy than with scientific or technological arguments. So one might well ask what the consequences of these decisions might be. Firstly, nuclear weapons -- like conventional arms -- grow old. In other words, only detonating them can provide sufficient information on such problems of ageing to ensure that the armed forces concerned remain confident in their respective nuclear arsenals. A second problem resides in the fact that France has not developed any new tactical weapons, especially when it comes to low- powered missiles. The United States is facing an entirely different problem, for it already has weapons of this type. Strategic experts believe that France, too, should have variable-energy arms, as well as the neutron bomb. Of course, those who oppose nuclear testing maintain that the same kind of information can be obtained through computer simulations. However, doing this requires vast computer programs which need the input of incredibly extensive databases compiled on the basis of previous tests. Yet, to our knowledge, French researchers do not have any such databases, unlike the Americans, no doubt, who naturally classify them as confidential. Furthermore, even if the performance of nuclear missiles could be simulated by computer, it would be difficult to estimate the damage caused by the electromagnetic shock generated at the moment of detonation. A wave of this kind can destroy the electronic components of monitoring and tracking equipment. In this area, the United States has gathered extensive experience through underground tests. We should also mention another argument advanced against resuming nuclear testing, namely the risk of radioactive pollution. However, in 1991 an international committee performed a series of measures at the French testing site in the Pacific and ended up finding no trace of radioactive elements that could have been produced by an explosion. Finally, prolonging the moratorium would risk causing the best available researchers to lose interest in this kind of work. This would then result in a loss of know-how which would be very difficult to overcome when the decision to resume tests is made. These, then, are the problems that will have to be taken into account by the members of the working group jointly appointed by the French president and prime minister on 15 July 1993 to "consider the effects on our nuclear capacity of the moratorium on nuclear testing." The working group, chaired by Admiral Lanxade, the French chief of staff, comprises two representatives of the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), two military figures, and the former research minister, H. Curien. Let us hope that despite the "wall of silence" surrounding the group's conclusions which are due to be submitted this month, the government will keep French citizens informed regarding the ultimate reasons behind the decisions that will surely have to be taken.
