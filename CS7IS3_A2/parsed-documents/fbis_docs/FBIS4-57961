The president disclosed that this commission will comprise an Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] representative as well as National Public Security Academy [ANSP] and PNC directors. In an 11 May report sent to the UN Security Council, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali states that former security corps sergeants are in charge of PNC criminal investigations, and members of the former antidrug unit are taking the posts of commissioners. The report adds that ANSP graduates are discriminated against because none of them have been appointed commissioners. Ghali has called for these mistakes to be corrected to avoid having the PNC become more militarized. The president, however, rejected these assertions. [Begin Cristiani recording] We disagree with this report. Last week, we brought everything up to date just as we had said we would do, including the public security topic. For the secretary general's peace of mind, a commission is being created to verify whether this is true. On no account have we attempted to militarize the PNC. [end recording] The commission that will verify the civilian nature of this new security corps will include ANSP Director Mario Bolanos, PNC Director Jose Maria Monterrey, and one Onusal representative. In the same report, Ghali explains that persistent deficiencies have been found in the training of PNC members in legal matters and in the use of force and firearms. For the president, these failures have an explanation: [Begin Cristiani recording] One must remember that we are trying to hurry and deploy the units as soon as possible and that exclusive courses lasting six months are being given with much effort. These courses are insufficient to create a completely trained public security policeman. To my way of thinking, once the PNC has been fully deployed, we need to continue to give members courses and training. [end recording] Likewise, Cristiani said that another special commission will be created to verify the enrollment of PNC members in the ANSP, which should not surpass 1,000 members or 20 percent of the total. According to the president, it was agreed in last week's meeting to clear all pending matters that the demobilization of the former security corps will continue until 31 March 1995.
