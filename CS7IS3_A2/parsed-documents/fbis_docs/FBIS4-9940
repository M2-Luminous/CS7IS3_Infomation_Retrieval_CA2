These manuevers are called the (Fleet-tex-2-94) Joint Exercise. Today's edition of the newspaper GRANMA points out that for the purpose of setting the inhabitants of all regions of the world at ease vis-a-vis the mobilization of its military forces, the U.S. Government usually announces that the maneuvers are routine or that they are merely innocent exercises. In this case, GRANMA adds, the U.S. Department of Defense says its goal is to put its stamp of approval on a large portion of those forces to be mobilized to Europe. It is difficult to understand the essence of that idea when the allegedly innocent exercises include approximately 13,000 troops; 23 ships, including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier; and more than 100 airplanes. GRANMA, which is the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, also emphasizes the participation of an Argentine destroyer and submarine, which join a very dangerous military buildup in regions very far from their home base. Last, GRANMA underscores the moral, derived from another Creole saying: The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
