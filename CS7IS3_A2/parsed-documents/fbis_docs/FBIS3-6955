The group has struck what appear to be promising crude, gas and condensate accumulations at three of the five wells drilled in block B8/32. That may represent the most successful rate among those obtained by foreign groups awarded concession rights in the last round of petroleum licencing called in July 1990. The results strengthen beliefs that more oil and gas deposits could still be found in other areas of the Gulf, other than those currently under production and development. According to Maersk Oil (Thailand) resident manager Niels Haun, well Tantawan-1 tested at 6,250 barrels per day (b/d) of crude oil and 25.7 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) of gas, while the second well Tantawan-2 flowed at 1,760 b/d of condensate and 70.5 MMcfd of gas. The last discovery well completed recently, Tantawan-3, encountered several hydrocarbon-bearing zones and subsequently five zones were tested with a combined flow rate of 40 MMcfd of gas and 8,862 b/d of crude oil and condensate. Tantawan-3, the fifth well drilled in the tract, was bored to 10,526 feet. The well was drilled from a surface location some three kilometres north of the Tantawan-1 well, the first discovery well. While the other two wells are dry holes, Mr Haun told Business Post the results of the $30-million exploration work carried out so far had been very encouraging. Consequently, the consortium decided to proceed with the drilling of two additional exploratory wells in the block which are expected to cost $6-7 million. Drilling of these wells will be carried out by a Sedco 601 semi- submersible, the same rig used to drill the first five wells, starting in mid-1994. Mr Haun said it is too early to say if the petroleum finds were sizable enough for commercial production. "We need to continue with evaluation and analysis and look into the results of the two additional wells before we can draw some conclusions. "With the exploration work already undertaken, the consortium has exceeded the obligations spelt out in the concession agreement awarded in August 1991, Mr Haun said. The consortium was obliged to spend a minimum of $13.5 million in exploration work over the 10,664-square- kilometre block during the first three-year obligation period. The work obligations included 4,000 km of seismic lines and drilling of three wells. Maersk Oil of Denmark operates the tract on behalf of the joint venture comprising Thaipo Ltd (31.67 percent), Thai Ramo Ltd (31.67 percent) and the Sophonpanich Co (5 percent). Maersk has a 31.67 percent interest in the tract. "We have been doing what we are supposed to do, then we leave it to somebody to evaluate whether it is successful or not. The only thing I can say is we are satisfied with the results we have obtained so far," Mr Haun said.
