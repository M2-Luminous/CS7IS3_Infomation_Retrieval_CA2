The Russian Presidential Press Office issued a statement today, saying that President Boris Yeltsin was worried by the trend toward expanding the NATO bloc. Such a trend contradicted the "declared intentions to build mutual relations on principles of trust, partnership and equilibrium," the statement said. NATO's expansion by admitting Russia's neighbors will "provoke a negative response" and "contribute to the development of negative sentiments within civilian and military circles." The statement added that Yeltsin believed that such a haste extension will in the long run "destabilize political and military situation" in the region. Yeltsin expected that heads of NATO member states and the alliance will desert dual stances in dealing with those issues vital to the fate of the whole world and the interest of Russian people. After disintegrations of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact, some East European countries and members of the Commonwealth of Independent States wanted to join in NATO to seek protection of security. But Russia strongly opposes these attempts, which, it says, is against Russia's interest.
