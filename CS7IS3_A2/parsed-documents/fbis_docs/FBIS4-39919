AL-QUDS appeals to Russians"] [Text] The opposition's "second echelon," having found an attentive audience at the festivities of AL-QUDS newspaper held in Moscow 3-5 June, has yet again called on Russians to unite to fight "Yeltsin's hateful regime." The appeals from A. Nevzorov, S. Terekhov, S. Umalatova, and Ye. Ligachev have by no means facilitated stabilization. "Thanks to our rulers, the people are being destroyed, both morally and physically," Umalatova stated. "They are like vampires, in need of blood," she continued. "We have had enough of demagogues, we have had enough of philosophers!" S. Terekhov has called on people not to believe in the "clannish struggle" inside the ruling camp. "They are preparing," he warned, and advised people to do everything to see that they do not take "patriots" unawares. Yegor Ligachev proposed a plan for the restoration of the USSR. Events with the participation of opposition leaders take place constantly. However, let us ask ourselves the question: Why is a newspaper with an Arabic name, published by Dr. Sha'ban Hafiz Sha'ban, and committed to the liberation of Palestine from Israel, attracting the Russian opposition to its pages and its parties? Why (as S. Umalatova has admitted) did Mr. Sha'ban fund the extraordinary congress of USSR people's deputies? The motives by which Dr. Sha'ban is guided are obvious. First, he is committed to changing Russia's foreign policy in the Near East, to redirecting it from supporting Y. 'Arafat to helping the leaders of the Palestine opposition. Obviously, a further aim of AL-QUDS is to destabilize the Russian Federation's relations with Israel. Second, in the event of the hardline opposition coming to power, the network of commercial enterprises headed by Mr. Sha'ban would obviously receive most-favored status from the Russian leadership. However, even if our assumptions are incorrect, one thing is clear -- the main aim of AL-QUDS and its publisher is the destabilization of the situation in Russia, Which, in our view, by no means does them credit.
