"A conference which does not bear fruit should cease to exist," Siladjzic said Sunday, refering to the UN conference on the former Yugoslavia which has led peace negotiations over Bosnia-Herzegovina with the European Community. "Under these conditions the Bosnian issue should be sent back to the Security Council, which would have to assume responsibility for Bosnia-Herzegovina," he added. Silajdzic threatened to boycott the Geneva talks if "Bosnian civilians continue to be killed," adding "we should bring the Europeans, the Americans and the Russians to negotiate in Sarajevo, under shell fire." The Bosnian premier, who held talks Saturday with Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament, said he was "not optimistic" that a settlement of the 21-month-old war could be reached. "We reached no political agreement," said Silajdzic, adding that "I wonder whether there will be any progress in Geneva." [passage omitted] In Athens, Bosnia mediators Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord Owen held talks with Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias, whose country currently holds the EC's rotating presidency. Owen said the prospects for a settlement in Geneva were not good given the intensification of fighting in Bosnia. Stoltenberg said Greece, which is close to the Serbs, fellow Orthodox Christians, had not officially presented a new peace initiative but had offered "an idea".
