He added that the economic recession hit bottom in the last quarter and that the economic recovery has now begun. Serra Puche said the price index decreased 17 percent between 1987 and 1992 as a result of the economic opening. He also reported that between 1989 and 1992, labor productivity increased by 6 percent annually, a higher rate than that observed in the United States. Exports of manufactured products grew more than 225 percent from 1985 to 1993. In the countries known as the Asian Tigers, the increase was 170 percent. According to Serra Puche, such results show that considerable progress has been made. "But we cannot stop here. We must consolidate those achievements and continue to make the efforts that microeconomic reforms entail," he stressed. Speaking to Mexican industrialists, Serra Puche said the country's productive sectors must fully assume their respective roles in accomplishing this task. The government, he said, should see that reforms are implemented at the federal, state, and municipal levels. Productive sectors must do their part by striving to modernize and increase competitiveness. Serra Puche added that attaining superior levels of competitiveness is a permanent and unavoidable task of all nations which, like Mexico, are committed to affirming their sovereignty, promoting growth, and substantially improving the welfare of the majority. He said that the experiences of all countries confirm that competitiveness is the only way to ensure the economic growth that will allow a better distribution of income and the satisfaction of housing, health, education, training, investment, and employment needs in the long term. He stressed that those are the real demands of social groups striving to overcome backwardness and neglect and to join modern life. Serra Puche noted, however, that lasting solutions to just social demands will only be found by eliminating the obstacles to sustained progress in competitiveness and employment. It is therefore urgent, he said, that productive sectors redouble their efforts to give all Mexicans broad opportunities for personal development and individual and collective improvement. In summarizing his ministry's actions to benefit the industrial sector, Serra Puche said that the office in charge of fighting illegal practices issued more than 157 antidumping resolutions in 1993. The resolutions can be broken down as follows: 82 in the initial phase of the investigation; 40 provisional resolutions; and 18 final resolutions, five which have been appealed and 12 of which were dismissed. He also noted that Nafin [National Financial Bank] funds totaling 11 billion new pesos have been channeled to benefit more than 22,500 companies in various sectors. Bancomext, [National Foreign Trade Bank] also issued credits for more than 24 billion new pesos benefiting 5,300 companies. Serra Puche said deregulation programs will continue and will be strengthened at the federal level. He added that in the last pact it was agreed to ask state governments to pay special attention to deregulation measures, particularly those regarding requirements for opening and operating companies and for cargo transportation and fares. In the financial area, the secretary said that efforts were made from the outset to grant credits to small and medium enterprises. For that purpose, business cards were issued, specific lines of credit were created, and other special mechanisms were established. The active interest rate, in real terms, remains high, and in that sense the financial situation continues to be a matter of concern for small and medium Mexican enterprises. Nafin, however, is making great efforts to confront the problem.
