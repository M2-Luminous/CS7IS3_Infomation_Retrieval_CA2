I believe that the situation in Rwanda is such that it is our duty to reconsider this mission. At this moment, Foreign Minister Claes is meeting with the UN secretary general to discuss the issue, because we do not want to make unilateral decisions. In my opinion, it would be a bit too easy to make a rash decision spontaneously and without consideration. That is not what we are going to do. We will first consult with the United Nations and its secretary general, and then make the necessary decisions in the next few hours, or days. [Correspondent] But the Belgians submitted a request to be relieved of their mandate. [Delcroix] It was not stated as such. At this moment, this certainly is not the case and I cannot confirm it, but I believe that the government will be able to make decisions in the next few hours, or tomorrow at the latest.
