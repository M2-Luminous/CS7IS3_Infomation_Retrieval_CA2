A resolution to this effect was adopted at a regional meeting at King William's Town at the weekend. The meeting was attended by the PAC's sole representative in the Eastern Cape legislature, Mr T T Letlaka. PAC regional secretary Mr Mvuyo Mhangwane said the organisation would work with other community organisations to eliminate no-go areas in the province and to strive to make it "peaceful enough" to attract investors. Mr Mhangwane said the meeting also endorsed the integration of Azanian Peoples Liberation Army members into the South African National Defence Force. Structures to prepare for the local government elections would be set up, he said.
