Kriel was born in Kakamas on November 14, 1941, and moved with his family to Wellington in 1947 where he started and completed his schooling. He obtained a BA and LLB from the University of Stellenbosch in 1964, and the following year took a job as public prosecutor in Bellville. In 1968, after completing his articles, he established his own law practice in Parow, and in 1978 entered the business world by establishing a mining company. He sold his interests in the company in 1980, when he started practicing as an advocate. Kriel was elected to the Cape Divisional Council in 1974 as representative for Parow. In 1976 he was elected the youngest-ever chairman of the council, and served on the executive of the Association of Divisional Councils and on the United Municipal Executive. In the 1977 general election he was elected unopposed to the provincial council, and in 1981, after being re-elected unopposed, he was appointed to the province's executive committee in the local government portfolio. In a 1984 by-election Kriel became MP for Parow. In September 1989 president FW de Klerk appointed him minister of planning and provincial affairs, to which national housing was later added. He also served as minister of local government in the Ministers' Council of the House of Assembly. In this portfolio Kriel was deeply involved with land reform and squatter issues. Under him, the separate Amenities and Group Areas Acts were scrapped, and controversy flared over the Residential Environment Bill, aimed at beefing up control over residential norms and standards, which was to have come in the wake of group areas. The bill was eventually dropped. Earlier, Kriel had reportedly said in a conversation with journalists that if black people wanted to bargain with the NP [National Party] for the scrapping of the Group Areas Act, they had to be prepared to give up something equally dear in their own culture -- and he mentioned the lobola [dowry] system as an example. He is also reported to have said he believes former Premier John Vorster is the father of political reform in South Africa. In June 1991 Kriel announced that fast reaction "squatter auxiliary units" were to be set up by the provincial administrations in cooperation with the police to deal with suspected squatting. On August 31 1991 he was sworn in as minister of law and order in place of Adriaan Vlok, who was sidelined to the correctional services portfolio after revelations that police had funded an Inkatha rally. Kriel immediately pledged himself to restoring the SAP's [South African Police] image as an unbiased non-partisan force. In March 1992, announcing a comprehensive anti-crime strategy, he said the government was "deadly serious" about clamping down on lawlessness. The strategy included the formation of an Internal Stability Division which would eventually be four times the size of its predecessor the Riot Squad and boosting the 94,000 strong police force by almost 16,000 new recruits. In May that year Kriel joined the government's Codesa [Convention for a Democratic South Africa] team, and subsequently became a leading and tough-talking government spokesman on negotiations. As political head of the police, Kriel has had to deal with criticisms of police conduct in the Trust Feeds and Boipatong killings, and with claims by Pathologist Dr Jonathan Gluckman of large scale killings of prisoners in police custody. In August 1992, after the compilation of the Waddington Report on Boipatong, he said 18 police generals would take early retirement, and admitted that a racist policy in the force had thus far prevented black officers from reaching the general staff. He announced the immediate promotion of officers who had been discriminated against in the past. Kriel and his wife Juliette were divorced in 1993. They had two daughters and a son.
