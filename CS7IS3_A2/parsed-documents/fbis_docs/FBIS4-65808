He believes that abandoning this mode of generation would harm technology exports. [Proissl] What would be the consequences for German industry of a hypothetical decision to abandon nuclear energy? [Roser] Such an abandonment would, in the long term, involve holding German industry back from the world market in nuclear technology and, with it, the entire European industry, for German political decisions on the subject will have repercussions throughout Europe. If Germany withdraws, then Paris will have a hard time explaining to the French people why France must be the only major European country still counting on nuclear energy to generate its electricity. In Spain, there is a de facto moratorium; in Sweden and in Belgium, no more nuclear power stations are being built. At the moment, France and Germany are the only countries where nuclear power stations can still be built. In short, a German withdrawal would pose major problems for France. [Proissl] What kind of consequences would this have for exports of German nuclear technology and know-how in this sector? [Roser] Negative ones in both cases. You merely have to call to mind the South Koreans' choice in favor of the TGV [high-speed train]. Countries seeking to purchase high-technology products only do so if they can assure themselves that they work well in their country of origin. For exports, we definitely need models of reference which have proved themselves. Naturally, a withdrawal would also result in a loss of know-how. It is already proving difficult to find young people who believe that they can build a future by making a career for themselves in the area of nuclear technology. The builders or managers of power stations are experiencing great difficulties in hiring young technicians. [Proissl] Which export contracts are currently liable to prove of interest to German builders? [Roser] At present there is only one call for tenders, put out by Taiwan, which wishes to purchase one power station and take out an option on a second. Nowadays, a power station represents a contract worth between 3 and 5 billion German marks (10 to 17 billion French francs). Three consortia have submitted proposals: one American-British; one American-Swedish; and one French-German. The French-German consortium is proposing a French power station. There is a simple reason for this. The latest German power station is approximately 10 years old. Since the Taiwanese want the most recent technology, they are opting for France, where power stations have been built much more recently.
