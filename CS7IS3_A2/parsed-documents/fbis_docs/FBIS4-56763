The Cuban foreign minister is one of the participants in the high-level sessions of the First World Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States, which is being held in Bridgetown. Robaina believes the presence here of a high-level Cuban delegation headed by President Fidel Castro and also including Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban parliament, and Minister Rosa Elena Simeon, represents a continuation of the policy Cuba maintains toward the Caribbean and the rest of the island states.

Cuba has significantly contributed to the various seminars of the governmental meeting and to the parallel meetings held by the Nongovernment Organizations [NGO]. At these meetings, Cuban delegates will speak about measures to combat natural disasters, technology for sugar-industry byproducts, the maintenance of agricultural production, and environmental protection and biodiversity. At the conclusion of yesterday's NGO session, the representatives recommended to the chiefs of state in charge of ratifying the Barbados Declaration that they include in it a call to the United States to obey the UN resolution that demands the lifting of the economic blockade on Cuba. Eight chiefs of state and government will speak at today's morning session, including Cuban President Fidel Castro, and 12 environment and development ministers, in addition to Assistant Secretary of State Timothy Wirth, who at the last minute replaced U.S. Vice President Al Gore, whose participation in the event had been announced.
