FBIS4-11395 "drlat080_r_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-080 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 Peru Appearance of New Shining Path Code Name Discussed Appearance of New Shining Path Code Name Discussed PY2504215594 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1451 GMT 23 Apr 94 PY2504215594 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 23 Apr (EFE) -- It appears that "Ricardo Z" has become the new leader of Peru's Maoist gang Shining Path [SL] after ousting Oscar Alberto Ramirez, known as "Feliciano." So far, Peruvian intelligence services have been unable to establish the real identity of "Ricardo Z." According to sources in the intelligence services, it seems that after Abimael Guzman was arrested, almost a year and a half ago, "Ricardo Z" stepped into the shoes of SL's imprisoned founder and main ideologist. Many analysts have reported that "Ricardo Z" could be one of the four SL leaders still at large, including Julio Cesar Mezzich, known as "El Doctorcito" ["the little doctor"], and Teresa Durand. They do not rule out the possibility that second-level SL leaders may have ousted their superiors, or that "Feliciano" -- who took over after Guzman was arrested on 12 September 1992 -- is now calling himself "Ricardo Z." The Lima daily EXPRESO quoted the National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) as stating that Ramirez could have changed his alias to evade security forces, which according to military sources are on his tracks in the mountains of Ayacucho Department. Dincote claims that "Ramirez has changed his alias to avoid an impending arrest." The same source indicated that another SL leader could have taken the alias "Feliciano." The news media also speculate that "Ricardo Z" could well be a leader of Colombian drug traffickers who are afraid of losing coca plantations in the Peruvian jungle, which they control with SL's help. "Ricardo Z" could also be a SL military leader who has staged a "coup d'etat" against the organization's high command. Former Deputy Alberto Valencia, an expert in subversion, told EXPRESO that he is under the impression that Teresa Durand, known as "the strongest military commander," could be calling herself "Ricardo Z." Valencia does not believe that Ramirez could be "Ricardo Z," although he did say that Ramirez had been entrusted with organizing the SL "people's guerrilla army." According to Valencia "neither could Mezzich be 'Ricardo Z,' as he has lost power and is looked upon as an upstart." All the experts agree that security forces are bound to defeat the SL, which has been going downhill since Guzman and 90 percent of the SL high command were arrested in September 1992. A military offensive is currently under way in Leoncio Prado, a jungle province of Huanuco Department, Peru's central mountain region. The objective of this offensive is to eliminate SL columns which are operating in the area, because these columns appear to be the strongest force SL has left. Various circles have criticized "Operation Aries," and there are witnesses who claim that the military have used helicopters to bomb civilians who are fleeing from the area.
