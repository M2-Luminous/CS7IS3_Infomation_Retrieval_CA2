Although everybody knows the might of science and technology in boosting agricultural output, the role played by agricultural science and technology is far from having been demonstrated. Accordng to deputies attending the current National People's Congress [NPC] session, China has achieved results in more than 25,000 agricultural research projects since the adoption of the reform and opening up policy, but many of these achievements have been shelved; and while developed countries can attribute their higher agricultural output to the application of 70-80 percent of their research achievements, China can attribute its higher agricultural output to the application of only 30-40 percent of research achievements. Why is it so hard to revitalize agricultural production through science and technology? The deputies maintained: The problem lies in popularization of agricultural science and technology. First of all, the number of technicians is inadequate. On the average, there is only one full-time technican for 7,000 mu of acreage, and only one animal husbandry technician for 2.3 million mu of grassland. Second, low morale owing to budget shortage. A deputy from Qinghai compared the current state of popularization of agricultural science and technology to "a severed thread, a broken net, and the departure of personnel." Deputy Liu Zhongzhu, president of the Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, maintained that irrational structure is also an important cause of ineffective popularization of agricultural technology. He said: Agricultural colleges are placed under the control of the education department; institutes of agricultural sciences are placed under the control of the science and technology commission; departments in charge of popularization of agricultural sciences are placed under the control of the agricultural departments; and the agricultural fund is placed under the control of departments in charge of planning, financial, and banking affairs. Because such controls are very unlikely to be merged organically, their strengths as an integral whole cannot be manifested. "The situation of popularizing agricultural technology has become even worse today." Shandong's NPC Deputy Yu Songlie said anxiously: "Under the new situation of developing the market economy, some local authorities have arbitrarily 'weaned' the organizations in charge of popularizing agricultural technology. Consequently these organizations have to find their own way out and many technicians have left the agricultural sector to do something else. When these people are gone, who is going to popularize agricultural technology and train farmers? This situation certainly will hinder China's agricultural development from reaching a higher stage." Fujian deputy Zeng Jinfeng said: Pushing the popularization organs to the market is likely to give rise to two problems, even if the technicians of these organs choose to stay: First, for the sake of incomes and profits, these departments will withhold the technology that ought to be popularized; and second, out of consideration for economic interests, the technicians will likely popularize only the profit-making technology which has nothing to do with grain and cotton production. Higher agricultural output depends on two factors: Larger acreage and higher per-unit yield. China's situation shows that it is hard to depend on the first factor, namely larger acreage, which is decreasing; and that increasing per-unit yield substantially through counting on scientific and technological progress has become increasingly important. For this reason, NPC deputies have urged the government that it should take measures as quickly as possible to stabilize and strengthen the ranks of agricultural technicians to make sure that agricultural science and technology can be successfully transformed into productive forces.
