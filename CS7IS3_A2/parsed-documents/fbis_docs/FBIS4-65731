Mr. Douste-Blazy, you're just back from the region; you came back just an hour ago. Can you give us the latest on the situation -- how many injured, how many refugees? [Douste-Blazy] I would like to say first of all: Stop the massacre -- and especially let us prevent the massacres of tomorrow. It is both terrifying and terrible. It is terrible, because it is, I think, the greatest genocide of the end of the 20th century: Between 200,000 and 500,000 people have been killed in two months; there are 2 million refugees. It is terrifying because it is a genocide. We are dealing with genocide: Not just the adults, but children are being killed. This morning, before I left, I heard a radio station in Rwanda saying: Let's not repeat the mistakes of 1959; let's not spare the children, let's kill them. This is absolute horror. From a humanitarian point of view, it creates enormous problems. We have hundreds of thousands of refugees coming to Tanzania, to Burundi, to Zaire. The Ngara refugee camp [in Tanzania] where I was yesterday has some 250,000 people. It is the largest refugee camp ever seen, with the attendant danger of epidemics. [passage omitted]. There is a lack of drinking water. We brought two large water purifying plants, which can process 125 cubic meters an hour, to save these people. The children are suffering from malnutrition, so we brought lots of energy bars, providing 2,000 calories a day. If we don't do something there will be a horrific carnage. [passage omitted] [Chazal] Talking about the problem is one thing. What can we do to help the humanitarian organizations on the ground, and what can the UN force do? [Douste-Blazy] On the humanitarian level, thanks to the Development Ministry and to Development Minister Michel Roussin, we have provided 200 tonnes of aid per air lift, and 300 more tonnes are on their way. We really have to support Doctors Without Borders, Doctors of the World, and International Action Against Hunger who are doing an incredible job. On the political level, there has of course been the UN resolution. [Foreign Minister Alain] Juppe was one of the first to call for this resolution. We have to send 5,000 men, but those men will encounter an absolutely apocalyptic situation. [Chazal] Will they be able to get to Rwanda in the first place? [Douste-Blazy] They will, but I would like them, instead of being a buffer force, to be in the country in such a way as to prevent the massacres being committed by the militias. [Chazal] Their mission for now is purely humanitarian. [Douste-Blazy] Yes, but one can wonder what an unarmed soldier can do in a country like Rwanda. I think that before the spark becomes a fire, we have to anticipate developments. I want to send out a warning about neighboring Burundi. The same ingredients are all in place: There are Hutus and Tutsis, hundreds of thousands of refugees will arrive in the north of the country, and are threatening to destabilize the precarious balance there. Our role is also to prevent tomorrow's massacres. I would also like to raise another question. UN observers are present. We know that there are countries neighboring Rwanda which are supplying arms. The Kalashnikovs are coming from somewhere. I think the observers have to tell us where the arms are coming from and when. On Tuesday [24 May], the UN Commission for Human Rights will be meeting in Geneva. This is [UN High Commissioner for Human Rights] Mr. Ayala Lasso's first mission, and I think that we have to bang our fist on the table, because crimes against humanity are being committed in Rwanda. It is absolutely horrible, the international community has to say this aloud. [Chazal] Is France prepared to send troops to support the UN force in Rwanda? [Douste-Blazy] Yes, the prime minister has decided that France should be present. France is very active in the humanitarian field. France will of course be present with UN forces. I would, however, like to say -- of course we have to go to Rwanda, we have taken anesthesiologists, emergency doctors, surgeons, we have to act in the humanitarian field -- but we must also prevent disasters in the political field, in particular in Burundi. This is my point of view. [Chazal] We have the feeling that we could fall in a Bosnia-like trap, where the UN found itself almost impotent. [Douste-Blazy] Absolutely. I think that the best thing for the UN is to arrive at the moment when they are accepted by both sides, and this is a way for the UN not to have to fight. The UN is there then -- but if we already have a fire here, an apocalyptic horror, then how can we ask the sides to respect each other if we go in without guns. I think that today we are seeing the limits of the UN. For Rwanda, from a humanitarian point of view, these 5,500 men must arrive immediately to prevent further massacres, but they must especially go to the neighbors, to Zaire, Burundi, of course, and Tanzania. Otherwise, I think we will be seeing similar massacres there in a few months. [Chazal] Thank you very much Mr. Douste-Blazy for giving us your impressions so soon after returning from Rwanda.
