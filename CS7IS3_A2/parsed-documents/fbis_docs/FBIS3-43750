The warnings were contained in a message sent to SAPA on Thursday. The BRA also declared war on the "communist anti-christian" Transitional Executive Council. The BRA previously claimed responsiblity for several bomb blasts, including last month's sabotage of a powerline tower near Boksburg prison. Two people died and at least 14 were injured when a minibus taxi hit dangling powerlines soon after the blast which, Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] said, was caused by explosives. Little is known about the BRA. It was founded in 1991 and sends facsimile advisories. Its leadership is unknown and unreachable. In its facsimile message on Thursday, it said its previous acts of sabotage had not been taken seriously. "Now intensive action will be taken." It warned foreign peace observers they would not be ignored in its campaign, but its main target would be the "heartbeat of the satanic money powers". The BRA said it would rather destroy everything the Boerevolk [Boer people] had worked for than hand it to alien money powers.
