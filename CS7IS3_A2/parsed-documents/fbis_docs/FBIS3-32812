Fujimori, in brief statements to the press, said his country could no longer tolerate attacks by the fundamentalist Maoist group; therefore he implemented severe measures, like the so-called "self-coup" in April 1992, when he dissolved Congress and assumed extraordinary powers. "What country in the world would accept 25,000 deaths (number of victims caused by political violence in Peru since 1980)? No developed country would have allowed this. That is why we took the appropriate measures; some of them were tough, but effective," the president said. The Peruvian president, who arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota this morning and met at noon with his Colombian colleague Cesar Gaviria, said his visit shows the good relations between the two countries. According to Narino House sources, Gaviria and Fujimori discussed basic topics like the fight against the drug-trafficking mafia and communist guerrilla groups, as well as the results of the Peruvian-Colombian Joint Commission to protect the Amazon jungle at their first meeting. After speaking with Gaviria, Fujimori met for a few minutes with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and laid a wreath at the statue of Liberator Simon Bolivar, located in the historic central plaza surrounded by the Congress and Bogota's main Cathedral. Tomorrow, Fujimori will explain to Colombian businessmen the measures he has adopted to internationalize the Peruvian economy to attract foreign capital. Fujimori arrived in Colombia accompanied by Prime Minister Alfonso Bustamante, Foreign Minister Efrain Goldenberg, Health Minister Jaime Freundt-Thurne, Fisheries Minister Jaime Sobero, and several ruling party congressmen and businessmen.
