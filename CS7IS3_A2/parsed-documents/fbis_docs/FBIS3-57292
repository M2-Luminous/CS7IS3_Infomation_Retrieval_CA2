Using his power to initiate legislation and "taking guidance from the principles of humanism," as the document says, and also following the adoption of the Russian Federation constitution, the president proposes that pardon be granted to those convicted of committing crimes "that do not constitute a great social danger." As Duma Deputy Chairman Mikhail Mityukov (Russia's Choice) told journalists, what is involved is "a limited range of people" which is "understandable, given the present crime situation in the country." Amnesty will not be granted to those who have been convicted of grave crimes (the edict enumerates 53 articles of the Penal Code), especially dangerous recidivists, those who maliciously break penal colonies rules, and also those who were once amnestied or pardoned but have again found themselves behind bars. Under the draft, subject to be released are those who "did their service in the active army or formations or took part in actions to protect the Motherland," as well as women, men over age 60, first and second category invalids, and persons serving their sentences for committing inadvertent crimes and sentenced to terms of up to five years (provided they have served not less than one-third of their terms), those under age with terms under three years, and those who have committed premeditated crimes but were also sentenced to terms under three years. The amnesty is also to apply to those convicted with suspended sentences or put on probation. Commenting on the presidential edict, Mr. Mityukov described it as a reasonable initiative, once again stressing that the proposed amnesty "is fairly limited in scale." The latter assessment is also shared by Viktor Ilyukhin (Russian Federation Communist Party), chairman of the Duma Security Committee, who nonetheless told SEGODNYA's correspondent about his negative attitude to wide amnesties in general. At the same time, Mr. Ilyukhin spoke in favor of granting a "political amnesty" which should, in his view, include the people arrested following last year's (February and March) demonstrations in Moscow, the 3-4 October events, and also defendants in the case of the State Committee for the State of Emergency. The president's edict On the State Duma Draft Resolution on Granting Amnesty is to be considered this week by the House Council (the speaker and faction leaders), then transferred to the committee on legislation and legal reform, and only then, with the requisite comments, be submitted to a full session.
