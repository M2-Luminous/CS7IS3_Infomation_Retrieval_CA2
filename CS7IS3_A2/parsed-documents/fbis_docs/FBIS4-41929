Some 400 delegates representing most Moldovan localities and numerous guests including Ion Solcanu, deputy chairman of the Romanian Senate and U.S. and Romanian Embassy representatives. Alexandra Mosanu, Congress of Intelligentsia (CI) chairman, stated in the report that "the socio-political movement, Congress of Intelligentsia, was born under conditions of political crisis which were caused in late 1992-early 1993 by the Moldovan president and forces supporting him." According to Mosanu, a short time after its set-up the CI succeeded in affirming itself in the political arena. The parliamentary elections showed that this formation "has established itself within the society." Specifying that the Peasants and Intellectuals Block won over 163,000 votes, thus 11 seats in the Parliament, Mosanu gauged that "in general, the election results were modest for this block." He also mentioned that "the pro-imperialist reactionary forces fight against the freedom conquered by the national emancipation movement and Moldovan independence as well. Subtly manipulated by officials, many citizens fell in the trap of Romanophobia, while others are overwhelmed by apathy and indifference or by nostalgia for the former communist regime." According to Mosanu, a major reason for the "the agrarian-interfrontists' victory" in elections was "the preservation of the old structures of the totalitarian regime in economic and state administration as well as the seizure of important positions in the national private economy by anti-national forces." At the Cl leadership's proposal the delegates changed the name of the formation to the Moldovan United Democratic Congress [CDUM]. Several changes were introduced into the statute and thus the adherence of certain parties to the congress was facilitated. Leaders of the Democratic Party and Christian Democratic Party declared their adherence to the Congress. They argued that the congress facilitated the conditions for adherence and that the objectives and social foundation of the parties are almost identical. They also said that it is necessary "to unite all national democratic movements." The wish to "merge with the Congress on the basis of its statute and program" was reiterated by most speakers. Nicolae Dabija, CI deputy chairman, stated that fruitful negotiations concerning a future merger with representatives of several parties were held. Deputy Valeriu Matei was elected chairman of the United Democratic Congress. According to the CDUM, the post of chairman can be retained two consecutive periods. The CDUM session -- the new name of the supreme meeting of the formation -- elected other leading organs.
