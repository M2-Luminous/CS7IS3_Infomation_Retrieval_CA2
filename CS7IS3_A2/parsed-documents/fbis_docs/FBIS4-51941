FBIS4-51941 "dreas087__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-087-A Daily Report 1 May 1994 ANNEX Japan DA Head Kanda Cancels Scheduled Trip to U.S. DA Head Kanda Cancels Scheduled Trip to U.S. OW0305103294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 May 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0305103294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The scheduled visit to the United States by the director general of the Defense Agency [DA] has been canceled. DA officials are concerned over the possible influence of his cancellation on Japanese relations with the United States because Kanda was originally scheduled to hold talks with Secretary of Defense Perry prior to the May expiration date for responses to the UN Security Council chairman's statement on measures to deal with the suspected nuclear arms development by the DPRK (North Korea). The Security Consultative Council will hold its meeting at the bureau-chief level as scheduled. However, it has been said within the DA that "the United States may doubt Japan's approach towards crisis management." If former DA Director-General Kazuo Aichi had been reappointed, it was originally planned that he would visit the United States beginning 1 May. However, immediately following the replacement of Aichi by Atsushi Kanda of the Democratic Socialist Party after the new cabinet was formed on 28 April, it was decided the visit should be postponed since "few results would be achieved due to insufficient preparations." According to a DA source: "Kanda did not insist on paying a visit to the United States." The original plan for the DA leader's visit did not include discussions only on measures to deal with the North Korean issue. The visit was also aimed at "somehow or other improving Japan-U.S. relations which have become rather stiff as a result of economic and trade friction, appealing to the fact the two nations still maintain a honeymoon relationship in security." As far as the Hata administration is concerned, it would have been the first visit to the United States by a cabinet member of the minority-ruled administration. Director General Kanda states: "I will give positive consideration to the visit if there should be any changes in North Korea." There is a growing hope within the Agency "that his visit to the United States will take place in June." However, when the long consecutive holidays come to an end, the cabinet will be busily engaged in deliberations over the draft budget bill for fiscal 1994. Since the future prospects for the cabinet remain cloudy, it seems most likely those concerned will have to share continuous concerns over this country's relations with the United States.
