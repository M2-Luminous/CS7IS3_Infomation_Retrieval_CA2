FR941021-0-00067 FR941021-0-00008 Federal Agency Comments Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and its implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Wyoming program. None of these agencies provided any objection to approval of the submittal. State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Comments As required by 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM provided the submittal to the SHPO and ACHP for comment. No comments were received. Environmental Protection Agency Concurrence Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM must obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before approving any provisions of a proposed State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq .) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq .). None of the provisions of this proposed amendment relate to air or water quality standards. Hence, no concurrence is needed. V. Secretary's Decision Based on the above findings, the Secretary is approving Wyoming's proposed program amendment as submitted on April 13, 1994. Because this amendment fully satisfies the requirements of the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c), he is also removing this condition. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 950 codifying decisions concerning the Wyoming program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. VI. Procedural Determinations Compliance with Executive Order 12866 This final rule is exempt from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review).
