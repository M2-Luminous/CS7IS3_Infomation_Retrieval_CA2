Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, made the remark at an annual general meeting of the chamber attended by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Referring to the current economic situation, Inaba said there is a slight sign of recovery in Japanese corporate sentiment concerning the prolonged economic slowdown. On strained trade relations between Japan and the United States, Inaba said, "we are in a severe situation." Japan should present some concrete measures to the U.S. to improve the bilateral trade in place of the numerical targets which Washington has been demanding, he said. But the prime minister was right to disagree with U.S. President Bill Clinton at their February summit in Washington on setting such objective criteria as part of the economic framework talks between the two nations, Inaba said. In a speech at the meeting, Hosokawa said, "The three working groups of the headquarters promoting administrative reform are expected to come up with effective measures. A bill is also going to be presented to the Diet to set up an independent body equipped with strong surveillance." He added that he hoped these combined efforts would also bring about positive results for the relationship between Japan and the United States.
