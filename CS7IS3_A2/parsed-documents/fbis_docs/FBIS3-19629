Now a new phase has begun." In a statement at Istanbul's airport, Cetin, who took part in the March 18 ceremony in Washington, described the agreement as a very important step for the preservation of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Bosnia. "As a country which gained the confidence of both the Croats and Bosnians, Turkey will continue its initiatives and efforts towards finding an equitable solution to the problem. We also believe that this first step should be reinforced by further steps," he added. He added that Turkey hoped the Serbian side to take part in this agreement, respecting the independence, sovereignty and integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Cetin, recalling that people were still being killed by Serbs in Maglaj, Bihac and Uskara, repeated Turkey's proposal to send troops to the UN forces in the region. "This agreement is one of the first test for the world after the cold war and the opportunity has arisen to pass it within legitimacy," he said.
