Despot: "Turning Point in Relations Between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina"] [Text] Zagreb -- "The most important achievement of the Washington Agreement and its documents is that the conflict between the Croats and the Muslims-Bosniaks, which was artificial from the beginning, has been ended. The Washington talks mark a turning point in global relations between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina with the signing of the preliminary agreement on stronger institutional relations between the two countries," said Ivo Komsic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and participant in the Washington talks, at a press conference held at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy. Expressing hope that the Washington constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation will be accepted on 28 March -- he announced that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly would convene that day -- Komsic said it was supposed to become effective at midnight on 29 March. The Constituent Assembly will be made up of deputies elected at the 1990 elections, except for those whose mandate had been canceled. The president and vice president of the Assembly will also be appointed that day; one a Muslim, the other a Croat. Apart from adopting the constitution of the federation, the Assembly is also entrusted with passing the election law for the forthcoming elections, which -- Komsic hopes -- will be held in a couple of months. According to Komsic, the importance of the Washington talks lies in reaching the federation agreement according to the principles laid down by the Sarajevo assembly held on 6 February, while the public of both countries will decide about the question of a confederation between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. There Will Be Resistance "I am aware that some people will resist the implementation of both agreements, both the one on the principles of the federation and that on the confederation agreement, but I expect the resistance to come from people who have been hindering the negotiations between the two nations from the beginning," said Komsic in reply to a question from the press, commenting on the views of the Croats from the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna that they will not accept the federation without firm ties with Croatia. However, he said that he expects people only to hinder the implementation, not to prevent it, for it was arranged at a high level under the auspices of the United States, which has finally become involved in solving the crisis on this territory and it will not allow the agreement to fall through. Asked whether the agreement was reached only as a result of U.S. pressure, Komsic said that the U.S. Administration had been restrained until the Croat-Muslim conflict broke out. It was then that the United States decided to get involved in solving the crisis and even go as far as -- unless there is another possibility -- to accept a possible agreement between the Croatian National Council and the Muslim-Bosniak leadership as a basis to which further pressure on the warring factions could be applied. "Fortunately, the Croatian authorities decided to make an about-turn in their policies adopting solutions advocated by the opposition," said Komsic, and added that the cantonal map drawn up by the Sarajevo assembly was accepted. "We agreed that central Bosnia will consist of two cantons, neither of which will have a predominant nationality, just as that kind of predominance was not planned in any other canton, regardless of the majority nation," said Komsic, explaining that the cantonal borders would be determined by expert groups. Herceg-Bosna Did Not Exist He explained that the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna has never existed, formally or legally speaking. During the war, some institutions of authority were established without legitimacy (which only the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina had all the while), but with great political power. He said that it was agreed that some institutions of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna will continue to function for another month after the adoption of the constitution of the federation -- which will refer to the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- and that, after that period of time, they should be abolished. Asked how the Bosnian Serbs would be included in the agreement, Komsic drew a distinction between loyal Serbs, who will be involved in the political life of the federation, and those in the occupied areas, who have not yet become involved in the negotiating process. Asked about the chances of the Croat-Muslim alliance attacking the Serbs, he said that the agreement excluded the military option and it was devised on the model of eliminating the causes of war. If the Serbs do not accept the agreement, they will have to consider a series of other possibilities and Komsic said it would be best to combine diplomatic and military pressure, according to the Sarajevo model. He said that there is absolutely no chance of a union of the Bosnian Serbs with Serbia, for that would mean destroying the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Serbs, who are aggressors both in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, must not be joined in one state as a reward. "We should not make any concessions to the Serbs; they must be politically and militarily defeated," said Komsic.
