At a meeting of the coordinative group for struggle against organized crime and corruption Tuesday [12 April], Brazauskas said criminals are able to freely cross the country's borders and to smuggle goods. The president said the introduction of stickers for sealing legally imported liquor and tobacco products was "a farce" because the stickers can be easily forged. "Enough defaming Lithuania," Brazauskas said. The meeting, devoted to smuggling problems, was attended by the leadership of the parliament, the Supreme Court, ministries of Defense and Justice, National Security Service, the Customs Department, the Border Defense Service, as well as officials from Ministries of Foreign Affairs and the Interior. The meeting's participants said liquor and tobacco are currently the principal contraband goods, but metals, drugs, weapons, radioactive substances and even helicopters and planes are smuggled, as well. Officials attributed the unsuccessful struggle against smugglers to imperfection of the legislation regulating activities of customs and border services. The meeting's participants also pointed to the lack of employees and the absence of a unified information network. Jurgis Jurgelis, director of the National Security Service, emphasized that corruption "has reached such an extent in our society that we are starting to be known as barbarians." President Brazauskas promised to work out recommendatory "formulas" for the institutions concerned and to hear reports about the work done at the next meeting.
