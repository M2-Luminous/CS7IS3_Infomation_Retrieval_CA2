FBIS4-61522 "drsov088_o_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-088 Daily Report 5 May 1994 Uzbekistan Karimov Addresses Parliament Karimov Addresses Parliament LD0505180194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1629 GMT 5 May 94 LD0505180194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 86 (576)] [Text] President Islam Karimov in a keynote speech at the opening session of parliament in Tashkent on Thursday [5 May] said his country was firmly on the road of independence. He spoke of intensive work under way to try to implement market reforms and promote private enterprise. Karimov put the number of state-run businesses falling into private hands at more than 800 with the number of private companies being doubled. He said the country's privatization process had no analogs adding that one in three workers was employed in the private sector. On the country's interim currency unit, the som-coupon, introduced six months ago, he said that although it was gaining in strength against other currencies, Uzbekistan was in need of a permanent national currency unit as an indication of its true independence. Karimov called to examine the experience gained by other countries to make the new currency unit prestigious. He expressed surprise why preference should be given to the Russian ruble rather than the currencies of neighboring states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan. This, he said, is throwback to the times when Uzbekistan depended on Moscow and was considered to be a net exporter of raw materials. "We are well aware that the ruble is stronger than the coupon. That is why Uzbekistan must also introduce a strong currency unit similar to Russia's to help us break into the world market," he said. Karimov said that the newly-built money-printing facility could help produce a sufficient amount of new banknotes and coins to be circulated soon, possibly in July. At the same time, he called for higher exports as a way of increasing foreign exchange revenues including the U.S. dollar which was stronger than the ruble. Karimov said this year's export earnings would run at 1.5 billion dollars or 40-50 percent of the country's potential of export trade. But the figure can be doubled, he said. Karimov spoke of widespread public support for economic reforms. But the process must evolve within the framework of law. In this connection, he stressed the need to step up the war on corruption which was capable of eroding government activity. The Uzbek leader called on commercial structures to do their job honestly. "If the businessmen break laws, the people will curse them," he said. Karimov accused whom he described as some CIS leaders of having engaged in rhetoric "which has led to bad results." He also spoke of the newly-emerging situation in Russia and a drive by some of its politicians to restore Russian clout to the region. Karimov is worried over LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky's statements which, he believes, "poses threat to the future of Uzbekistan." Karimov is also opposed to concepts such as common parliament, language and currency. The leaders of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan during a recent summit had agreed to drop the concept of a Eurasian Union, Karimov said. IF Note: The idea of a Eurasian Union complete with supranational structures to coordinate economic and defence policies was put forward by President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan during a visit to Moscow in March. He said such an entity could help pursue a common economic policy, introduce common frontiers and a supranational currency unit with national currencies kept intact. However, Nazarbayev's initiative has drawn little support from other CIS leaders. Our main task, said Karimov, is to preserve the country's independence and work together with other CIS states to try to bring an early economic recovery. No one will give us any reversal to the past, he said.
