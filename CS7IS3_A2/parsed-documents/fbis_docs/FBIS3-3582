Yunnan, a highland province with arable land making up a mere 7.5 percent of its entire area, has few effective water conservancy works while the land under cultivation is so weak that its productivity is far lower than the average across the country. Soil erosion is growing more serious because of frequent natural disasters such as drought, water-logging, flooding, earthquakes and mudslides with the living conditions in some areas being in jeopardy. Land under cultivation is still in decline as incomplete statistics show that the area of paddy fields were reduced by 149,300 mu in 1993 compared with the area in 1985. The use of land in the province is not yet under proper administration and some counties and cities have rushed to make use of arable land for the establishment of development zones without undertaking prior fasibility studies. The participants at the conference pointed out that damage to the ecological environment and land would result in waste and lead to a disastrous outcome. They called for greater awareness of the need for environmental protection in the province while at the same time asking for the drawing up of measures for the protection of land for proper use. Director of the Yunnan Institute of Economics Mr. Hu Tongyuan suggested that a dramatic adjustment of the agricultural pattern should take place. Ecological-safe agriculture, commerce-oriented farming and agriculture for the earning of foreign exchange should be painstakingly undertaken. Modern agriculture should be developed with a wider scope covering farming, forestry, animal husbandy and breeding together with comprehensive exploitation of the processing industry. The area under cultivation needs to be maintained in order to ensure a certain amount of agricultural output while few breakthroughs could be seen as far as science and technology were concerned in the improvement of farming conditions while at the same time demands for grains for consumption continued to grow steadily.
