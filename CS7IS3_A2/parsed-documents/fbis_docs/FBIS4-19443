A statement issued during a meeting of EU foreign ministers also appealed to the warring Hutu and Tutsi tribes in Rwanda to stop fighting and resume negotiations under the Arusha accord signed in August last year. The accord provides a framework for a negotiated settlement leading to democratic elections that would bring the minority Tutsis into government. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and wounded in Rwanda since inter-tribal bloodshed resumed on April 6.
