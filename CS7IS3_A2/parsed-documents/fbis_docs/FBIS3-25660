Addressing about 2,000 residents in the coloured township of Ennerdale, south of Johannesburg, Mr Ramaphosa said the way things were developing the NPF would barely have enough troops ready to provide one soldier per polling booth, whereas there should be at least 15. It would not be easy to convince the presently very cautious international community to send enough, if any, peacekeeping soldiers. "So we are going to have to rely on the security forces." There were some defence force and police members who would be unwilling to protect the interim constitution or those who wished to vote, but there were many, especially black security force members, who would be. Besides this, said Mr Rampahosa, "we must each become peace-keepers ourselves."
