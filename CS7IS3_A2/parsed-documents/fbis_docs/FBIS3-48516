U Ko Lay noted the people's support and praise for the State Law and Order Restoration Council's [SLORC] national development endeavors and the work being done by the National Convention. He enumerated the 39 basic principles laid down by the National Convention, saying the people have a duty to defend these principles. U Ko Lay said the SLORC -- which is based on the united Defense Services -- is working effectively for social, economic, and political development and the emergence of a modern state. He also urged the organizations in the jungle to return to the "legal fold." Continuing, he explained Burma's foreign policy and actions as well as the subversive activities of the "neocolonialists and their local henchmen," urging the public to safeguard the country's sovereignty. In conclusion, he called on the public to support the 104 basic principles laid down by the National Convention and support the USDA's five objectives. He called on the jungle-based organizations to give up the armed struggle, cooperate in working for the development of the union, and safeguard the country from external and internal threats.
