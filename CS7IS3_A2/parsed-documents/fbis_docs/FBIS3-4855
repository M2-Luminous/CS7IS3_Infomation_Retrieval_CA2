January tax revenues edged down 1.0 percent from a year earlier to 4.89 trillion yen, resulting in cumulative revenues of 35.60 billion yen for the April-January period of the current fiscal year, up just 0.1 percent. But a ministry official said, "We have a particular interest in stamp revenues," which he said have moved higher for the past two to three months. Revenue and other stamps are required for big-ticket purchases such as receipts, housing contracts and registrations, and reflects goods movements, the official said. January stamp revenues rose 0.1 percent from a year earlier to 105.76 billion yen. After only two or three months "it's still too early to judge," the official said, "but this is certainly a good trend." Proceeds from consumption tax also rose 6.7 percent to 253.00 billion yen, with revenues from domestic products performing "fairly well" although those on imports remained sluggish, he said. But he maintained a cautious stance in referring the trend to buoyant consumption. Also showing signs of recovery are liquor tax revenues, totaling 158.40 billion yen in January, down a low 0.7 percent. The official said beer sales picked up from the sustained sluggish performance since the unusually cool summer but poor whisky sales offset the tax revenues in January. Proceeds from securities transactions remained brisk in reaction to low trading volume last year, rising 28.2 percent to 33.20 billion yen. The overall tax revenues, however, remained lackluster because of mixed factors, the official said, citing relatively low proceeds from income, corporate and inheritance taxes. Revenues from withholding income tax stayed unchanged at 3,310.09 billion yen, mirroring the lower winter bonuses for December on which the revenues are based, the official said. He noted the unchanged figure came primarily on higher interest income. Corporate tax revenues fell 8.1 percent to 386.87 billion yen due to poor earnings at smaller firms. Inheritance tax proceeds dropped 12.3 percent to 191.80 billion yen in reaction to a sharp rise a year before. The April-January progress rate against estimated fiscal 1993 tax revenues of 55.68 trillion yen came to 63.9 percent, down from 65.3 percent a year earlier. The official said the major reason was the lower bonus capping increase in income taxes that account for some 70 percent of the overall revenues, and stressed that the overall trend "remains the same." He said the key to this fiscal year's tax revenues "is on declared income and corporate book-closing" both made in March.
