FR940706-2-00090 FR940706-2-00053 To address some of the Panel's recommendations for research, the principal topics of this priority are to better understand: (i) the determinants of changes in productivity and earnings, and how to develop better methods of projecting future productivity and earnings; (ii) the determinants of nominal and real interest rates and of how to project them; (iii) the determinants of fertility and how to project future fertility rates; (iv) the determinants of mortality and how to project future mortality rates; (v) the analysis of illegal immigration and how to project such immigration; and (vi) the conceptual framework for the current low-cost and high-cost projections. Among the questions to be addressed on productivity and earnings are: What are the determinants of linkages between productivity and earnings, particularly hours of work and fringe benefits? What are the effects of the changing quality (including the question of measuring quality) and demographic mix of the labor force? What are the effects of research and development by both the public and the private sectors? What are the effects of capital formation by the public sector (e.g., public infrastructure) and by the private sector? What is the effect of the increasing integration of U.S. and foreign markets? Are there analytical methods or strategies for selecting which averaging periods are most appropriate in determining the various economic assumptions? What is the long-term relationship, if any, between productivity and earnings and other economic and demographic factors? Among the questions to be addressed on nominal and real interest rates are: To what extent can the current structure of interest rates be used to predict future interest rates? What are the determinants of inflation and are there analytical methods for projecting future inflation rates? What strategies are optimal for incorporating both historical and current interest rate information into the projections? What is the long-term relationship, if any, between nominal and real interest rates and other economic and demographic variables? Among the questions to be addressed on fertility patterns in this priority area are: What are the determinants of fertility and changes in fertility? What is the relationship between age at first birth and the total fertility rate? How do birth rates of immigrants and of their children compare with those of non-immigrants and their children? Will future trends in fertility rates by race and ethnic group mirror past trends? For assumptions used in projecting fertility, can an analytical framework be developed to help decide how much weight to put on long-term trend information and how much weight to put on the most recent trends? Is there empirical evidence supporting alternative weighting schemes? Among those questions to be addressed on mortality are: What are the determinants of mortality and rates of change in mortality? What evidence is there for projecting changes in mortality for specific causes (e.g., cancer, heart, etc.) based on changes in smoking, nutrition, and other lifestyle patterns? For assumptions used in projecting mortality, can an analytical framework be developed to help decide how much weight to put on long-term trend information and how much weight to put on the most recent trends? Is there empirical evidence supporting alternative weighting schemes? Among the questions to be addressed on illegal immigrants are: Estimates of current numbers, labor-force participation rates, and rates of immigration of illegal immigrants; analysis of factors likely to affect future immigration rates of illegal immigrants and projections based on this analysis; the length of coverage and average earnings of illegal immigrants and the length of time they remain in the country; and the extent to which illegal immigrants receive benefits based upon their coverage under the system. Among the questions to be asked with respect to the conceptual framework for the current low-cost and high-cost projections are: Although theoretically, the current low-cost and high-cost projections represent a collection of extreme values for each of the variables, how should these bounds be interpreted_as absolute bounds on what could possibly happen, as confidence levels, as illustrative alternative projections, or as sensitivity analyses? (Attention should be given to the way in which rates of inflation are incorporated into the low-cost and high-cost projections.) Should the projections incorporate interrelationships among the economic and demographic variables (for example, among others, interactions among fertility, marital status, labor force participation, and birth expectations), and if so, which interrelationships are critical, and how should they be incorporated? Grant proposals must be based on well-developed rigorous analysis. Applications may be submitted for multi-year funding not to exceed 24 months in duration.
