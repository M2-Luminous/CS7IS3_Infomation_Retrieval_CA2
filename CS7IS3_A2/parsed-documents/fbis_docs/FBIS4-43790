The decision now seems to have been made for the former. Are you happy with that? Was not Belgium in fact inclined to give priority to integration? [Claes] No, we are certainly not happy with that. But the circumstances dictated otherwise. Under pressure from the large member states, we have accepted a compromise, with enlargement limited to four countries: Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, countries which have much to offer both in monetary-economic terms and politically. The number one priority of the European enterprise, stability on the European Continent, is being increasingly jeopardized by developments in Central and East Europe. We cannot remain an island of stability. But that must not rule out a deeper Europe: Otherwise the European enterprise threatens to be diluted into nothing more than a large economic area. The major, initial ambition was for Europe to become a political entity for everyone. The 1996 intergovernmental conference is of historic importance in this sense. It was still possible in Maastricht to cover up the fundamental contradictions with shaky compromises. That will no longer be possible in 1996. That could result in a two-speed Europe, within which, in addition to enlargement, a small group of countries opt for faster integration. The other member states would then have to settle for an economic area for the time being. [KNACK] That is also the idea recently expressed by Mr. Lamassoure, your French colleague for European affairs, in LE MONDE. [Claes] Yes, but he gives the impression that we were all invited to come together to pledge support for the Bonn-Paris alliance. I would like to say a few words about that, because that does not serve the interests of more democracy in the Union. [KNACK] Is the danger of this Bonn-Paris alliance not that it could prompt other alliances in response? [Claes] It is only logical for alliances to result in the formation of counteralliances. And that is not in line with our concept of a Europe in which smaller countries have their proper say and in which minorities are happy to go along with the view of the majority. Whether they originate in Bonn and Paris or London and Rome, these bilateral initiatives do nothing to promote EU credibility. [KNACK] How should we envisage a two-speed Europe? [Claes] The economic area which we now have is a sound basis. I genuinely believe that a couple of member states can fulfill a pioneering role. Provided that the door remains open to other countries to join them when they have met the conditions. Such a construction was already envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty: Monetary Union is also to be achieved in stages. It could result in a structure with two levels of decisionmaking, depending on the competences. At the second level, only those included would decide. Can you tell me how the present institutional system can work if tomorrow we find ourselves with 20 or more members? How are the wheels going to turn? I do not believe there is any alternative. [KNACK] European Commission President Delors will be outlining his white paper at the Corfu summit at the end of this month. How can he develop a coherent employment policy if the EU is unable to pursue a common fiscal and social policy, with the fraud and social dumping which results? That can jeopardize everything decided at Corfu. [Claes] Most certainly. I will again be accused of looking with regret to the past, but that is not true; I have no problem with a market economy, provided there is sufficient control. The market economy always neglects the long term; the focus is more on profit than on people. I believe that any social or economic policy should focus on people. The Union is very ambitious in terms of economic integration, it even accepts that it cannot be achieved without sufficient economic convergence, without a sufficiently concerted economic policy. But the EU has too few resources to develop a voluntarist policy as proposed by Delors. But that is what we need. The latest most striking example is the failure of the Commission in the steel sector. Commissioner Karel van Miert's plans failed, because not enough players wanted to participate. How is any coordinated cross-border policy possible in such circumstances? If it can't succeed in the case of steel, what chance of success is there for modern technologies? These are going to help determine the shape of society and no doubt open up ideological debates. Delors is not exaggerating when he compares in his white paper the development of modern technologies, the combination of the written and spoken word and the image, with the first industrial revolution. The increasingly concrete applications of these technologies are creating new services as well as changing the way of life of people in the West. We cannot just leave all this to forces governed solely by the short-term profit motive, and which are thus much less interested in the very important side effects of this new industrial revolution. A sound democratic institution such as the EU must give direction to these forces. [KNACK] Are you thinking of the success of Silvio Berlusconi in Italy? [Claes] I didn't need to wait for Berlusconi to come along to feel concern about what happens when the same people who decide what information is to be circulated and what is not are also responsible for deciding policy. That is a worrying development. [KNACK] So you want to update [French philosopher] Montesquieu and include the media as the fourth power in a system of separation of powers? [Claes] It is a long time since we have seen a proper balance in the functioning of the three perfectly separated powers, as I am sure everyone will agree. Nothing is eternal, and perhaps Montesquieu does need a little revision. The Chinese also used to have a fourth power, the administration. In our case it is the media. [KNACK] The press as the fourth power, you are not having a dig are you? [Claes] No, but another question is whether what is happening now is good for the necessary independence of the individual journalist. [KNACK] The failure of the common foreign policy in the former Yugoslavia has not much for the EU's credibility. [Claes] Foreign policy must also be debated in 1996. The problem is that a consensus must first always be obtained. The second cornerstone of the Maastricht Treaty is the need for an approach based on an intergovernmental philosophy. One article in the Treaty also says, however, that a decision by a qualified majority can be implemented, there is just a reluctance to apply this in practice. This does not alter the fact that under the Belgian presidency, a number of joint actions were established, such as in the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia, and South Africa. That was not bad, but it was not enough. There is then the question: Who is going to pay? As it is a common policy, there must not be any doubts on this point, but this decision has not yet been taken. You are therefore developing a policy without knowing how you are going to pay for it. But we should also remember that Maastricht has only been in force for seven months. It is not therefore so surprising to find that national policies are being pursued which are contradictory to the EU directives. This should progressively improve. [KNACK] But there is the feeling that EU diplomacy is not taken seriously at the international level? [Claes] In the conflict in Yugoslavia, there was clearly going to be an attempt to achieve a common position under the United Nations'supervision. Talks then developed with Washington and Moscow, to which London and Paris were invited as members of the UN Security Council. The EU as such was not present, was not even invited. Europe is not therefore a player on the world stage. For the large member states, their membership of the Security Council remains much more important than the EU as such. The Yugoslav experience taught us that. [KNACK] How difficult is foreign policy for a small country? Belgium's actions in Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi have not been outright successes. [Claes] It would be pretty stupid to claim the opposite was true. However, objectively speaking, it must be said that the entire continent of Africa is a mess. In a recent report, the United Nations also came to the conclusion that it is necessary to move away from the policies being followed, not just for countries that have bilateral relations with that continent, but also multilateral relations, via major organizations. Since the early 1970's, Africa has steadily moved backward despite the impressive sums given it by the international community. Politically, too, there is no glimpse of success. The requirement of democratizing authoritarian regimes has not yielded much, with the exception of South Africa. So should we turn our backs on Africa? No. In humanitarian terms, it is inexcusable to leave hundreds of millions of people to their fate. Nor would that be a good thing politically. Africa's instability can cause serious disturbances on other continents. Of course, I do not have a miracle solution, but I do still believe in the need for a cautious democratization policy which puts the emphasis squarely on the respect of human rights. It would also be sensible to give policies a more regional flavor. We will have to work in larger units, since bilateral approaches have had too little success. [KNACK] What does that mean for Belgium in concrete terms? [Claes] It is not because the democratization process in the three countries where we are very active has failed that we have to reconcile ourselves to the preexistence of these corrupt and authoritarian regimes. I am totally opposed to that. However, Belgium cannot take up the challenge alone. Reconstructing even small countries such as Rwanda or Burundi using Belgian resources alone is impossible. We can indeed play a pioneering role, and play the role of advocate for these countries vis-a-vis the IMF, the World Bank, and major donors. Moreover, I would like to raise the issue of the share of blame which lies on the Africans themselves for this mess. At the end of the day, they are the ones primarily responsible, and in most cases they have not been paragons of ethics, democracy, or efficiency. One cannot say that Africa does not have an intellectual potential on which to draw. However, I cannot really appreciate the fact that perhaps the majority of African intellectuals trained in our universities opt to stay with us. They must go back and assume their responsibilities. There must be something other than the policy of the outstretched hand. [KNACK] From the African side we hear the criticism that we must not impose our values and institutions. Do you stick by the universality of human rights. [Claes] Yes. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is part of the foundation of the UN Charter. The next century will be more international than ever, so there must be some basic rules, and these include universal human rights. I would like to draw some distinctions as far as political systems are concerned, certainly over time. I want to gain an understanding of the problems facing political leaders in countries which sometimes have hundreds of millions of inhabitants. The situation cannot be turned around just like that. This calls for pragmatic views, which must not lead us away from the final goal. [KNACK] They will tell you that it is easy for you to talk: Human rights were invented by the West. Some Asian countries assert other values, and put a fundamentally different emphasis on things. [Claes] It is generally the leadership groups in those countries that do that. Massive proletariats are being created in those countries, as was the case with us earlier. In the medium term they will come to the conclusion which led to emancipation in the West. So we are on the edge of a profound movement. This does not mean that I have no eye for other values or standards. For this reason I am not inclined to make many concessions in the area of human rights. [KNACK] In recent years, it has been hypothesized that the conflicts of the future will be conflicts between large cultures, for example between the West and the Islamic world. [Claes] I do not believe in such a conflict. Mohammed's teachings do not impose intolerance or blind hatred. However, in the past we too have had to deal with religious radicals. Moreover, fundamentalism is supported not just by religious fanaticism, but also by social and economic abuses. How can we fight that? Not by getting mixed up in discussions about the interpretation of a belief, but by assuming our social and economic responsibilities. The European troika was in Algiers recently. We had to help those people there who view universal human rights as an end goal. They are working to form a system of democratic pluralism. We must help them improve the social and economic situation of the people. [KNACK] But the IMF has just imposed very tough conditions on Algeria which will surely not improve the lives of people in that country. This is happening in many Third World countries. Are we not part of the IMF? [Claes] It is correct that the IMF has often imposed reforms that resulted in young democracies suffering heavily, or which dramatically worsened social situation. That is an old complaint. I think that in the meantime there has been a strategic move away from this approach. In Algeria, the IMF action was inevitable for monetary reasons. The question now is whether the West is prepared to minimize the rough edges of this operation. In any case, a major debt rescheduling program has been arranged. I believe that a consensus has formed within the IMF for a more friendly policy vis-a-vis the Mediterranean area, especially the Maghreb. [KNACK] In a recent speech you warned against the legacy of Byzantium. Did that speech not emphasize the clash of cultures? [Claes] I simply wanted to say that it would be naive to try and explain everything from a Western viewpoint. In countries where the Byzantine civilization made its influence felt for centuries, this is reflected in structures which differ clearly from those of the West. This has little to do with the traces of 70 years of communism, because before then the Byzantine civilization had already put the emphasis on other areas. It is not that I want to be proven right, but you cannot ignore the warning of Czech President Vaclav Havel, when he expressed his fear about populist reactions to the social disappointments in the economic reform process. I still believe that blindly moving to a market system must lead to unacceptable social wrongs, which then play into the hands of populist-reactionary politicians. The reform of the economic system was and is necessary. However, this must be done gradually. I have never believed in the so-called economic blitz strategies. I can remember the great Russian professor who came to my office to explain that he had a plan for reforming his country's economy in 500 days. I told him: "With all due respect, professor, you are forgetting that you are working with people." The postcommunist election successes in Lithuania, Poland, and Hungary are undoubtedly a signal sent by a large proportion of the population that they expect more attention to be paid by their politicians to the social interests of the people. Central Europe does not want to have anything to do with brute liberalism, in which a small stratum of people will become scandalously rich while the rest sink into unemployment without any coverage for the major social risks. [KNACK] Yes, and what about Russia? [Claes] Russia presents the picture of a humiliated superpower which does not intend to be left alone. The economy has deteriorated, and is largely controlled by a new type of mafiosi. There have been elections and there is a constitution. That is good, but the text might as well have been written especially for Boris Yeltsin. I try to imagine what would happen tomorrow if Aleksandr Rutskoy or Vladimir Zhirinovskiy were to become president. It is not encouraging. Washington is flooding us with optimistic analyses of the situation in Moscow which I have never shared. I am not saying that Russia no longer has a chance to consolidate its democracy or to modernize its economy, but what we know about it today does not lead to optimism. I am primarily concerned about Ukraine. It is a large, strategically located country which has nuclear weapons. The EU offered it a partnership as a way of giving it some basis for gaining control of its social and economic shambles and to give a boost to its democratic forces. Ukraine is not really making any progress with denuclearization and is torn between an eastern part that wants to join Russia and a western part that does not want to belong to Russia. There is also the quarrel about how to divide up the Black Sea Fleet and about control over the Crimea. There is plenty of instability, and that can make the much faster integration of a number of Central European countries into our institutions inevitable. I hope it will not lead to this scenario, but all the signals I receive every day just push me toward certain intellectual exercises. [KNACK] Could not our institutions have prevented things from taking this course? [Claes] I think that NATO and the Western European Union, on the one hand, and the EU, on the other, could not have done any more than they have done so far. What else could NATO have done besides the cooperation involved in the Partnership for Peace? The alternative was to offer some Central European countries full membership, thus drawing a new East-West border on the map of Europe. That would clearly have been a negative sign for those countries which did not qualify. In actual fact, they would have been pushed back into the Russian sphere of influence. However, that does not mean that we must avoid a dialogue with Moscow. With that kind of military superpower it must be possible to make specific arrangements. The EU also followed the only possible strategy: association agreements with potential members, aid programs, and political dialogue. These actions have prospects. Immediate accession was not an option: That would have loosened European cohesion and would not have done those countries a favor. Their economies are not strong enough to follow the pace set by European policies. We have made it clear to those countries which are not called upon to become members that we would go as far as possible with them. This means partnership agreements, which involve far-reaching cooperation in a wide variety of areas. Surely, all this represents a responsible and homogeneous approach? There is no other conceivable strategy at present, unless, I repeat, unforeseen events rule out that scenario. [KNACK] Is it correct to assert that the West has expanded its institutions eastward, but that it is letting Russia keep its "nearby foreign countries": i.e., the republics of the former Soviet Union, with the exception of the Baltic states? [Claes] No. We also offered partnership agreements to the other republics of the former Soviet Union. [KNACK] Not a whole lot of work was put into that. [Claes] No, but they did not apply either. Moreover, you have to draw a line somewhere. I do not agree with Russia's definition of "nearby foreign countries." That seems to clash with our concept of the independence and territorial integrity of countries recognized by the international community. Of course, there is the problem of the tens of millions of Russians who live in other republics. They have to apply for a minority status. However, Moscow feels that that is no reason to take military action on the territory of other countries, unless they asked for it themselves. [KNACK] Has Russia already taken action in Georgia? [Claes] That is a delicate question. To what extent can these kinds of operations take place, whether or not behind the screen of the CSCE? Only if the CSCE procedures are respected. However, if the CSCE acknowledges that there is reason for an intervention, then those people, who today criticize Moscow, must dare to admit that no single European country can give or wants to give the CSCE the resources it needs to play its role. We said quite clearly to [Russian Foreign Minister] Andrey Kozyrev: "A little moderation please." If he asks whether we are prepared to send troops or provide financial support, nothing will come of it. We have to tell things like they are.
