Pursuant to §§770.15 and 772.1(g) of the Regulations, upon notification that a person has been convicted of violating the AECA, the Director, Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, shall determine whether to deny that person permission to apply for or use any export license issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA and the Regulations and shall also determine whether to revoke any export license previously issued to such a person. Having received notice of Schwartz's conviction for violating the AECA, the following consultations with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, I have decided to deny Schwartz permission to apply for or use any export license, including any general license, issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA and the Regulations, for a period of 10 years from the date of his conviction. The 10-year period ends on January 29, 2002. I have also decided to revoke all export licenses issued pursuant to the EAA in which Schwartz had an interest at the time of his conviction.
