Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, the president of the Armed Forces Joint Command and commanding general of the Peruvian Army, stated the drug seized is comparable to 50 percent of all the cocaine seized in the Peruvian Amazons jungle over the past three years. The basic paste, from which cocaine is refined, was stored at an abandoned airport at Boca Manu, in the jungle Department of Madre de Dios, adjacent to Bolivia and Brazil. According to authorities, drug traffickers have started to use this area in the past three months. Apparently, the basic paste was coming from Bolivia and was to be shipped to Colombia. The operation was prepared by the Army, the National Drug Police, and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration personnel. Gen. Hermoza stated that the drug cache belonged to drug trafficker Cachique Rivera, another Peruvian drug kingpin who was unknown to the public up to now. During the past three months, Madre de Dios residents have been reporting airplanes in the area; possibly Colombian airplanes picking up basic paste in Peru. Last week, the police seized a shipment of 30 tons of sulfuric acid which was being transported by three persons--who were also arrested--to the Palmapampa area in the southern Andean Ayacucho Department. The drug traffickers have also established bases in this area. Sulfuric acid is indispensable to producing cocaine basic paste. The weekly SI publication reported today that drug trafficking prospers "under the very noses of the Army" in the Huallaga Valley area in the jungle Department of San Martin. The weekly notes "a large part of the Huallaga population lives off drug trafficking money, in one way or another. There is no authority or institution that has not been infiltrated by drug terrorism." According to the SI publication, Colombian Waldo Vargas Arias, alias "Ministro," pays $100 a month to teachers in several towns to improve their wages. "Ministro" is a partner of drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez, alias "Vaticano," who was arrested in Cali (Colombia) on 14 January and sent to Peru on that same day. The weekly reports that drug airplanes leave the Bellavista community regularly although nobody sees or knows anything. "Don't forget everybody here eats when there is a flight," a local authority, who asked his name not be revealed, told SI. However, since former Army Major Evaristo Castillo charged complicity between military personnel and the drug traffickers--charges he reiterated yesterday, Sunday--authorities have initiated operations to find "Ministro" and assert he will soon fall into the hands of the police. Authorities announced on Friday the Drug Police have arrested nine drug traffickers, five of them Colombians, members of the organization headed by "Ministro" in Bellavista. The Bellavista community is close to another community called Campanilla, where "Vaticano" used to have a mansion. However, community residents told reporters they do not know Chavez or if he lived in this town.
