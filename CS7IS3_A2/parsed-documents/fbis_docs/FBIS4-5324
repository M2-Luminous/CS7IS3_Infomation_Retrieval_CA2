Senator Evans told journalists in the Cambodian capital that the Khmer Rouge was a diminishing force with no credibility. He said the guerrillas continue to loose their power and influence and predicted that Cambodian Government troops would remain in control of the faction's former stronghold of Pailin, which they captured last month. Senator Evans said for the Khmer Rouge to engage in a proper reconciliation process, it would have to give up areas it still controlled, end its military campaign, and recognize the legitimacy of the Cambodian Government.
