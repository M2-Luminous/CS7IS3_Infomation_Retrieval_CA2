Since 5 April when Ricupero was installed, there have been two crises -- and they have not been resolved yet -- between the members of the first team of advisers and secretaries, on whom the new minister counts for waging the war against inflation. No solution has been found to the public confrontation between Finance Ministry executive secretary Clovis Carvalho and Federal Revenue Secretary Osires Lopes Filho. The latter wants the approval of a project to restructure the Revenue Secretariat, which Clovis Carvalho has opposed. Lopes has threatened to resign if the minister does not support at least some of the proposed measures. Carvalho is not calm either. The only member of Fernando Henrique Cardoso's team who was unknown to Ricupero, Carvalho will remain in his post but will lose coordination power to diplomat Sergio Amaral, the cabinet chief and adviser to the minister. Another problem for Ricupero is special adviser Edmar Bacha's unwillingness to remain in the government. The information on Bacha's resignation reached the minister's cabinet in the middle of the difficulties caused by the congressional debate on the provisional measure for implementation of the economic plan. Bacha's resignation might have been caused by his willingness to resume academic commitments in Rio de Janeiro, where he is a UFRJ [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro] professor. Difficulties -- The conflict between Osires and Carvalho also seems far from being settled. Ricupero has known Lopes since the beginning of the 1980's as his fellow professor at Brasilia University. As for Carvalho, the minister only has some good references of him, which he received from some common friends. It is believed that if the minister does not approve at least the creation of three coordinating boards for improving the tax control system -- as is provided for in the new Internal Revenue Department regulations -- Osires Lopes will actually resign. Some government members consider that the minister's style in dealing with this type of problem consists of encouraging internal problems in the hope that they will reach a natural, spontaneous solution. For Ricupero's direct advisers, however, things are not quite like that. They explain that he is a deeply thoughtful man who, rather than taking a hasty step, prefers to delay a decision. In order to avoid losing Bacha, they said, Ricupero might name him to the new Central Bank executive board, which will take care of circulation of the real, independently of the fact that the minister will guarantee immunity against political pressure to spend more than what is permitted by the government's fiscal situation. The economic team now is mostly concerned about the possibility of a new fiscal crisis after approval of the Social Emergency Fund and on the eve of the new currency's circulation. During the first quarter, the Treasury registered a deficit of $250 million, despite the fact that the Revenue Department's monthly income has surpassed last year's average value by $1 billion. The increase in interest rates since December, which aimed at fighting price speculation, forced the Treasury to disburse $1.1 billion, compared with $540 million spent in the same period in 1993. Relations -- With such high interest rates, the economic team fears a reaction by President Itamar Franco, who might again talk about the economy at any time. Without the shield of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who kept Franco's explosive personality under control, Central Bank technicians are preparing for just about any presidential offensive. The finance minister, despite his "good chemistry with Franco," as an adviser put it, addresses the president with the reverence due a superior, which is the typical attitude of a career diplomat.
