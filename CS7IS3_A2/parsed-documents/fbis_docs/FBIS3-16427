Estimating Kozyrev's trip, Gogitidze said that major tasks were fulfilled: An essential agreement of both sides was reached and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is ready to resume the negotiations. The Russian side is convinced both the Israelis and the Palestinians are adherent to the peace process and would like further talks. "The Russian side stressed that in case of resumed dialogue the main attention should be given to the soonest completion of negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho project. Measures to implement the project should immediately follow," said the diplomat. In his opinion, "this would help to cool passions and guarantee, to a certain degree, security on the occupied lands". Russia will take more efforts to achieve the soonest completion of negotiations on Gaza-Jericho and help the implementation of agreements, said Gogitidze. "Today's priority is the adoption of a Security Council resolution on Hebron. If the resolution is adopted there will be no obstacles for the resumption of Israeli-PLO negotiations," he stressed. The settlers' problem that has grown most acute may be discussed "parallelly with the resumption of Israeli-PLO negotiations. A form of its solution can be found with the assistance of Russian diplomats, the co-sponsors and in direct contacts between Israel and the PLO," said Gogitidze.
