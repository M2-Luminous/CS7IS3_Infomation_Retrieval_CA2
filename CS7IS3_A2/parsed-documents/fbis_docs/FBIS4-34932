Fujimori said, however, that "with or without support," Peru is carrying out a firm and constant struggle against drug trafficking. He recalled that the contribution made by the U.S. AWACS and Orion airplanes with modern equipment for detecting airplanes had been very effective when they were cooperating with the Peruvian Air Force, until May when the U.S. Government decided to withdraw that support. In a news conference, Fujimori said that with that help, "our airplanes were able to persecute and shoot down" the airplanes of Colombian drug traffickers entering the Peruvian jungle region to pick up the basic cocaine paste gathered by drug traffickers. Fujimori added that the U.S. radar installed in the jungle region, which was also deactivated, was not effective as it is obsolete equipment used during World War II. He said that the reestablishment of the aid for detecting the airplanes of drug traffickers would be a positive step. He reiterated that the struggle against drug trafficking is an international problem, which is the responsibility of drug producing and consuming countries.
