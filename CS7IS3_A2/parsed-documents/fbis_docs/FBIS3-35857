The president respects the voters' right to elect anyone they like, but if the president of Crimea violates the Constitution of Ukraine, the president of Ukraine will annul unconstitutional decisions using the extra powers granted by the parliament. Vyacheslav Chornovil, chairman of Ukraine's Popular Movement [Rukh], said in his comment: "What happened had to happen; it is another loss for Ukraine's leaders. The unconstitutional presidential elections in Crimea should not have been allowed. We can only hope that Leonid Kravchuk will remain president of Ukraine and use the extra powers granted to him to annul the decisions of the Crimean autonomy. "I do not see any absolute tragedy here; making speeches is one thing, pushing a plow quite another. I believe that in 18 months' time the Crimean residents will be disillusioned with Yuriy Meshkov's policy. Besides, I believe he has given Leonid Kravchuk an advantage with regard to the statement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, since that document guarantees the territorial integrity of its signatories."
