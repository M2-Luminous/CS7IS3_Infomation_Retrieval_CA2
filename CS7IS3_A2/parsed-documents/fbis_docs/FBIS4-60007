The letter said the crackdown on the movement of Iranian pilgrims to and from the camp has seriously hampered the pilgrimage of Iranian Muslims. Saudi commandos have been stationed in front of the headquarters barring people from entering or leaving the building. Since this morning, Saudi military helicopters have started flying at low altitude over the headquarters and filming all movements around it. The deployment of scores of armored personnel carriers, water cannons and a large number of armed-to-the-teeth commandos around the camp indicates that Saudi Arabia has purchased large amounts of riot equipment for fear of outbreak of domestic unrest and rebellion. According to an Egyptian pilgrim, who is a member of the armed forces of that country, Saudi Arabia has been deeply worried about possible domestic unrest in recent years particularly since the deployment of American forces in holy Islamic lands during the Persian Gulf war which prompted public outcry. Due to such concern, he said, Saudi leaders have spent billions of dollars on purchase of anti-riot equipment and training some of its military units in suppressing domestic riots.
