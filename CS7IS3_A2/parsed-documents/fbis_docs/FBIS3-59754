Overview As Japan's economy and society evolve and change, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and farming and fishing villages face issues such as demonstrating highly productive capabilities that can accurately answer diverse consumer needs; securing local workers in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; regional activation; and the formation of attractive regional societies. On the other hand, the management of Japan's overall finances involves dealing with even more thorough expenditure estimates. Given such a situation, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) re-examined its system and policies along the lines of "Trends in Government Policies on New Foodstuffs, Agriculture, and Farming Villages," which pointed out the trends in policy developments geared toward the new age of the 21st century, and formulated its FY93 budget from the viewpoint of steadily implementing new policies in stages. General account expenditures in FY93 for agriculture, forestry, and fisheries amount to ¥3.3855 trillion, including the agriculture, forestry, and fishery budgets of the Prime Minister's Office and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Health and Welfare. In that the Expenses for Promotion of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery S&T are ¥73.0 billion, which is an increase of 3.9% over that of FY92. The following describes the MAFF budget in terms of the main policies. B. Implementation of R&D To Cope with Important Policy Issues In order to cope with important policy issues relating to agriculture, forestry and fisheries, the MAFF will implement research that deals with improvements in agricultural productivity, diversification and sophistication of consumer needs, and global environmental and tropical agriculture problems. 1. R&D for Improvements in Agricultural Productivity The MAFF will implement new types of regional research involving "technology development for rationalizing regionally managed agriculture." This research will entail the comprehensive and systematic development of technology to cope with the problems directly facing the regions. The objective is to make practical the innovative technology needed for large-scale, high-productivity agriculture. The MAFF will also conduct surveys for building a research strategy aimed at the development of future agricultural machinery and the establishment of agricultural technology adapted to that. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.
