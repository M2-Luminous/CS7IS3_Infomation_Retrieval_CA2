I want to talk about the constitutional issue. As national youths, we all believe that you are a leader elected through constitutional means. Now we want to discuss the issue of the national leadership succession. Being your sons because we are from KNPI [National Youth Committee], I want to discuss your earlier remarks on the leadership succession, but first let me tell you that we are impressed by the detailed explanation you gave us on our national development stages. Our regeneration process is natural, not by passing the baton as in a foot race. The leadership mechanism proceeds smoothly every five years. Therefore, if the People's Consultative Assembly, our highly esteemed state institution, still wants you to serve as president after 1998 for the second long-term development plan, we beg you to be ready to serve for another term [words indistinct]. [Suharto] In 1998, how old will I be? Seventy-seven years old, right? I have thought about it, [words indistinct]. However, we cannot stop the law of nature, which I must take into account [words indistinct]. [Sitompul] But we pray to the almighty God for your ... [Suharto, interrupting] [Laughs] Thank you. As I once said in the past, I knew nothing about economics, but now, the younger generation is smarter and faster in learning things. What did I do when I knew nothing about economics? I enlisted the assistance of economists like Mr. Wijoyo and his friends. I allowed them to carry out debates on economic matters, and I just listened to them. [laughter] After a few months, I began to take part in the discussions. Finally, because I had to make decisions, I began to learn things in a gradual way. We should not be discouraged, because God will certainly show us his way. Besides, our struggle still has a long way to go. [Sitompul] We do not want to talk about the heir apparent issue, but in view of the leadership model that you have given all of us, the beloved Indonesian people, we hope that at least there will be somebody that will inherit your leadership qualities, because after 25 years or even 30 years, we do not want to see a new leader with new policies. We must firmly and resolutely adopt the Pancasila [five principles] ideology and the 1945 Constitution. [Suharto] I think the system makes sense because what a president does is bound to be within the GBHN [Broad Outline of State Policy]. Therefore, if his actions are against the GBHN, or he wants to do as he wishes, he must be corrected, and the House of Representatives is entitled to summon him, but it is the MPR [People's Consultative Assembly] that is authorized to impeach him. So there is the safety valve system. We must admit that nobody is perfect, and everybody must do his share to help the country so that things will turn out smoothly. Therefore, we should not be alarmed, and my duty is to create a situation where everybody can work and show his achievements. People can produce achievements in different areas, and the MPR may begin to judge their performance and discuss them through their parliamentary factions. As you know, I will certainly not abandon our struggle in the second long-term development plan. There are three main principles in the ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] leadership, and one of them is [words indistinct]. Even if during my absence, we must still adopt the principle of Tut Wuri Andayani [providing education to children by supporting them from behind], and we will never abandon our responsibility to our nation's struggle. Let us pray to God for his blessings. Thank you, and peace be upon you.
