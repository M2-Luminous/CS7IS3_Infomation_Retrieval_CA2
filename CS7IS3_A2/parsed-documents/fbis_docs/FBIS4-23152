President Mandela said it would be senseless to hold parallel talks with the Volkstaat Council and the CP. He said the talks between the government, the Freedom Front, and the CP would be headed by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. Indemnity for right-wingers, who committed political crimes since December 1993, was also discussed. At a news conference after the talks President Mandela announced that Dr. Hartzenberg would hold urgent talks with Justice Minister Dullah Omar on indemnity. Dr. Hartzenberg said he wanted to give input on the bill Mr. Omar was preparing before it went through Parliament. When asked whether the government was planning to hold talks with AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche, President Mandela said the government's door was open to all who wanted to negotiate, but added that nobody would be forced to talk to the government.
