Boggiani] [Text] Fray Bentos -- President Luis Alberto Lacalle said yesterday that he has maintained the predominance of civil society over any other power, and that in making unpleasant decisions he had sought "the common good." During a break in his tour of the riverside region, the president agreed to answer some questions from reporters during an informal news conference at a century-old school. Asked about his opinion on the fact that he is the president who ordered the largest number of arrests after the military regime, Lacalle replied that "it is not a matter of counting episodes which, if considered in an isolated manner, have no significance in themselves." "We proudly assumed the post of commander of the armed forces, and because of family tradition and because of my own ideas, I feel deep respect for the military profession," he said. "I visited all the military units of the country, I entered them through the front door, I have had a frank relationship with the commanders, and I have always observed hierarchy," he noted. He added that his decisions in the military area were motivated by a high republican objective. "When I had to make decisions -- which at times were unpleasant -- I made them taking into account the common good, which is what I have to safeguard, and the predominance of civil power, which was elected and made legitimate by the votes," he said. He also addressed the Common Market of the South, Mercosur, in which he admitted the existence of difficulties, although he did not rule out the possibility of finding solutions. "There are difficulties, yes. Just think, if Germany and France still have difficulties in achieving unity after almost 40 years of integration negotiations, imagine how difficult it will be for us to pin the tail on the donkey," he said. He admitted that there are difficulties between "the Argentine and the Brazilian economies, or because of the difference in size and magnitude between Uruguay and Brazil, or Argentina." "Yet in June we will have something certain. This is, in my opinion, the most valuable result of the Mercosur summit in Colonia," he said. The president ruled out the possibility of problems with Brazilian President Itamar Franco, who last Monday left before a lunch that Lacalle hosted for his Mercosur colleagues. "First, President Franco is a man of a certain age. He was with us in Anchorena, and needs regular resting periods. He does this at all meetings, so do not try to make anything else out of it, do not try to see nonexistent things, because there aren't any," he added. Asked about the electoral campaign, the president said he would prefer a short campaign. "We want no contradictions between the electoral year and the work year. I believe both things can and should be done," he said. He added that it is necessary to have "more time to do things, and time is necessary to advertise the proposals, the names, and to explain why people are being asked for their votes." Asked about the contents of his message to the General Assembly on 15 March, the president said he is satisfied "with being able to show very good achievements which -- obviously -- we hope will be surpassed in the future." He said the government has received much criticism, but noted that he is not in a sports game -- "to see whether we win three to two, or five to one" -- and that he has always tried to choose the positive side. "I believe the current government, despite its limitations because of its lack of a majority, as everyone knows, will present a very good account of its term," he noted. Asked about the constitutional reform project, he said it will surely be approved, and despite the fact that it is not the ideal project it is major news. "The news I have that the Broad Front will in principle support the initiative leads us to the conclusion that there will be a comfortable two-thirds majority at the General Assembly, which also leads us to conclude that the plebiscite will also 'obviously,' as people usually put it, approve it," he emphasized. He said that the proposed reform "is not the reform we would have liked. Some issues were sidelined, but the single candidacy of parties is one of the most important issues." "This will strongly promote party unity," the president said. Lacalle also emphasized the significance of the bills that the Executive Branch submitted to Congress at the conclusion of the interpellation of the ministers of industry and finance this week. The atmosphere leading to the interpellation showed that several sectors were demanding the adoption of new measures. Well, now the initiative is in the hands of Congress, not the Executive Branch. We are sure there will be a rapid answer," he predicted.
