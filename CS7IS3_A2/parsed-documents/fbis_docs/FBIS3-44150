In his brief remarks during the opening of the talks, President Museveni said, in order to promote trade between Uganda and Eritrea, it will be highly beneficial to rely on businessmen in the two countries. He added that businessmen are crucial in promoting trade because they have to control themselves in their daily transactions and are also disciplined by fear of bankruptcy. Mr. Museveni noted that there is a complementarity [as heard] between the two countries and it is important for businessmen to study and carry out a survey, especially on items that can be offered by each country for the sake of profitable interaction. He said that Eritrea can also offer salt and other products to Uganda while Uganda can give grain and other food products to Eritrea. President Museveni noted that air links are crucial for businessmen to carry out trade. He said that businessmen need to be facilitated with fast and reliable means of travel so that they are able to carry out transactions profitably. He added that it is important for Eritreans and Ugandans to interact so as to dispel the problem of ignorance and lack of information that hinders easy exploitation of available opportunities. On his part, President Afewerki said that there is need to harness economic cooperation at regional and subregional levels in the context of the higher competitive global markets. He expressed gratitude to the people of Uganda for their hospitality shown to him. He commended the leadership of the National Resistance Movement, which he said has given him enlightenment on how to approach and stimulate the economy to ensure growth and development as well as an approach to bilateral cooperation. He noted that the relationship between the two countries is essential and could be implemented in the subregion which has many opportunities to offer. [passage omitted]
