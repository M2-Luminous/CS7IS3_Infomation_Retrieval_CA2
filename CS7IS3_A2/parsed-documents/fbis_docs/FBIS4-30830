The co-chairmen of the peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen of the European Union and Thorvald Stoltenberg of the United Nations, as well as U.S. special envoy Charles Redman and his Russian counterpart Vitaliy Churkin, were also invited, an UNPROFOR statement said. Akashi will be accompanied at the Geneva meeting, to be held Thursday and Friday [2-3 June], by UNPROFOR commander for ex-Yugoslavia Lieutenant-General Bertrand de Lapresle, and the UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, the statement added. Akashi, in letters sent to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Friday, "drew attention to the presidential statement adopted by the UN Security Council on 25 May 1994 in which the Council reaffirmed the urgent need for a comprehensive cessation of hostilities throughout the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina." Next week's meeting aims to build on Akashi's May 21 initiative "putting forward a framework for an immediate cessation of hostilities between the parties, including provision for the disengagement of forces and the interpositioning of UNPROFOR troops between the forces." The announcement comes after France hosted two-day talks between the so-called contact group on Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the European Union, Russia and the United States -- and Bosnian Croats, Moslems and Serbs Wednesday and Thursday in the Alpine hideaway of Talloires, not far from Geneva. The session reached no apparent agreement, but another round was scheduled in the French resort town on June 6 and 7. The contact group negotiators tried in vain to get the factions to agree to a four-month ceasefire and to accept a European plan for partition that would give 51 percent of territory to a Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent to the Serbs.
