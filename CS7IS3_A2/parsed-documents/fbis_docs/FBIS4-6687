Koichiro Matsuura, former deputy foreign minister, made the remark at a lecture in Tokyo. The framework talks have been stalemated since the Feb. 11 breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit over objective criteria. Matsuura, commenting on the Group of Seven (G-7) summit scheduled to open July 8, forecast that Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's successor is likely to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton immediately before the summit. Regarding the April 15 talks in Marrakech, Morocco, between Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, Matsuura said Kantor's comments seem to show "serious U.S. intentions" to settle the framework talks.
