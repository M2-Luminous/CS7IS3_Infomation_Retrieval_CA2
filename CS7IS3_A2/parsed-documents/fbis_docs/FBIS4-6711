Here is our report. It is the first visit to Vietnam by the Czech foreign minister, and the foreign minister of an Eastern European country since the disintegration of the Eastern European countries. Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec spoke to newsmen about the significance and objectives of his visit to Vietnam. [Begin Zieleniec recording in English] Now I finish the third day of my visit in Vietnam. We feel that this is an important visit for the Czech Republic. I have met my colleague Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and Minister of Trade Le Van Triet. I have met Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and President and Speaker of Parliament Nong Duc Manh. These were useful and important talks for us. You know that the Czech Republic has traditional contact with Vietnam. There are many people here in Vietnam who know us, who speak our language, who study in my country. And there are also quite a considerable number of people in my country who know very well of Vietnam. This is a good basis for mutual relations. There were big changes in both countries in the last years. It is important to find new conditions, new ways for cooperation. It is important to find new contact for economic and trade cooperation. This is the reason for which we discussed especially economic programs. We discussed the whole set of treaty which is needed for proper cooperation between our business communities. We discussed also political issues. We exchanged views on developments in both countries. We discussed also our views on the issues connected with discussion about human rights and other issues. I think this visit shows that relations between my country and Vietnam has very big potential, and it is possible to continue traditional intensive contact and good cooperation, also after changes in my country and in Vietnam. [end recording] On the first day in Hanoi, the Czech businessmen attended the Vietnam-Czech economic seminar held in Hanoi by the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Czech Embassy. Foreign Minister Zieleniec attended the seminar. Both Czech and Vietnamese businessmen discovered great possibilities for economic and trade cooperation. Mr.Rudolf Baranic, president of the Association of Czech Businessmen said: [Begin (Baranic) recording in Czech fading into English translation] The balance of trade between Czech and Vietnam has reduced over the last few years due to main changes in the Czech Republic. Czech's export to Vietnam has been reduced by half, and Vietnam's export to Czech reduced by one fourth. However, there are possibilities to further improve the trade balance between the two countries. Most interesting is that almost all those who are involved in export activities to the Czech Republic were Vietnamese who had studied and worked in the country. There are many Vietnamese who know the Czech language. It is an advantage in cooperative relations between the two countries. [end recording] At the press conference in Hanoi, the Czech foreign minister also said that he was not the first high-ranking Czech official to visit Vietnam. A delegation of the Czech minister and trade and industry, and a parliamentary delegation have visited Vietnam. The Czech minister of labor also plans to Vietnam and is expected to sign an important agreement on labor cooperation between the two countries. The Czech Republic will continue helping Vietnam in education and personnel training. As with previous delegations, the Czech delegation discussed the completion of a trade agreement between the two countries, and agreement on investment guarantee and promotion, and the agreement on avoidance of double taxation.
