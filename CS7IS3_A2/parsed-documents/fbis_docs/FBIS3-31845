Some might respond to such a statement by saying that it is precisely the duty of a man like Virgil Magureanu to keep silent. He is the director of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI]. In this position, it is not only his duty, but also a priority to be as discreet as possible in the area of our public activity. In this respect, Virgil Magureanu is an exception to the rule. For a long time, he was a true star of present-day Romania: Statements in the press and on television, long conversations in magazines and on various wavelengths, more or less flattering photographs, and televised talk shows. Lately, however, Virgil Magureanu has no longer displayed the same self-possession in public. He no longer gives so many interviews or news conferences, and especially, no longer makes public appearances. From the difference between his former and current conduct, we may draw the conclusion that Virgil Magureanu keeps quiet. In [writer] Marin Preda's "Delirium" there is an extremely interesting scene. It takes place during the night of the Iron- Guard uprising. Horia Sima's supporters are destroying stores, setting fire to houses in which Jews live, and attacking soldiers. Bucharest is reverberating with gunfire. There is tension in the streets. Gathered in a room, a few figures in this novel ask themselves with concern: Why is the general keeping silent? The general being, of course, Romania's future Marshal Ion Antonescu [wartime military dictator]. Many strange things are happening in our country these days. A number of people belonging to the executive power have been accused of espionage for a foreign country. The minister of defense, Niculae Spiroiu, one of the most fervent advocates of army modernization and integration in North- Atlantic structures, has been accused of corruption. The campaign against him is based on information that is believed to have come from the Romanian Intelligence Service. The son of General Marin Pancea, secretary of the Supreme Defense Council and presidential adviser, has been accused of being involved in dishonest deals. One of his partners, Radu Popa, was crudely arrested. Iosif Boda, the presidential adviser most convinced of the need for dialogue with the opposition and Romania's orientation to the West, is to leave for Switzerland as ambassador. True, the country is thus gaining an intelligent representative abroad. It loses, however, because the group of reformers around Ion Iliescu is weakened, while the conservative group represented by Marin Pancea and Vasile Ionel triumphs. Although it is clear to everyone that this will harm Romania's image abroad, negotiations are conducted to create a nationalist-communist government, the government of the so-called Red Pentagon. On his return from Washington, Petre Roman said the State Department would not like such a shift to the left. The leaders of the Red Pentagon, mainly Adrian Nastase, wince and say the Americans did not broach the subject. These are strange things. They do not, however, match the strangeness of those during the Iron-Guard uprising. Virgil Magureanu is not Ion Antonescu either. Nevertheless, keeping a sense of proportion, we can copy the characters in "The Delirium" and ask: Why does Virgil Magureanu keep silent? There is, however, a connection between Ion Antonescu and the strange things during the night of the Iron-Guard actions. The order in the country depends on the leader of the state. It was normal for simple citizens to ask themselves why the general keeps silent. In this respect, one could argue that there is no connection between the strange things of late and Virgil Magureanu. And that, thus we cannot ask, as in Ion Antonescu's case, why the SRI director keeps silent? Close study, however, shows that this argument is unjustifiable. The strange things these days are closely linked to Virgil Magureanu. Not only because he could clarify the enigma of them, but also because they began to happen exactly when Virgil Magureanu fell silent. There have been so many strange things since the SRI director withdrew from the public scene that we would risk nothing by asking another question: Do they not happen, by any chance, just because Virgil Magureanu keeps silent?
