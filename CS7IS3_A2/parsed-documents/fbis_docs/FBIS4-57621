They were born from the longest, the most excruciating, and the most important historical convultions of our nations. This is why we are a real, genuine, and excluding political force in the forging of the present and the future of our countries. To become what we are now, during the 1970s the FMLN and the FSLN endured dispersion, ideological struggles, and the emulation of strategies and tactics. This was followed by a process of rediscovery and reunification, which was the foundation of our success and final victory and our influence on society as a factor for progress. It was fortunate for the FSLN that the internal struggle of the 1970s only managed to produce three trends. These trends did not rupture the Sandinist foundations, and because of this, the movement's reunification process was a profound one. In El Salvador, the struggle among revolutionary forces led to the creation of five revolutionary parties. The rediscovery of our ideals brought about an alliance of parties that waged the 12-year revolutionary war. We were, however, unable to come together as one. Once the war was over, we became a party of parties. It is easy to imagine the operational problems that this can create. Now the FSLN and the FMLN are both living a renewed political and ideological struggle, which has flourished from our overturnings, shortcomings, and mistakes, and also from the crumbling of socialism in East Europe and the former USSR. The latter opened the way to an overwhelming and overpowering global anti-socialist feeling, bolstered a thousand times over by the unlimited proportions of modern communications. Having said this, we could say that we have completed the list of reasons for our current unity crisis. The fall of socialism gave us, however, freedom to think with our own minds and the ability to formulate our own way of thinking and our own ideology, based on our own reality; with much fewer distortions than those produced by centuries of ideological, political, and theoretical centrism around Europe. We must use this liberty and not run straight into one of the old-fashioned enclosures, where everything is prepared for us. We are so unfortunate. We must draft a new revolutionary philosophy and simultaneously defend ourselves from the pressures of conservatives, who have certainly modernized themselves but who are the essentially same, while poverty multiplies itself and the growing unsatisfied social needs demand solutions here and now. Poor little us, because we were unable to distinguish between ideology, theory, and politics. That is why we need to wage a political and social struggle to provide the necessary solutions to the theoretical issues and to the renewal of the revolutionary ideology. "Today, as yesterday, we revolutionaries need this debate among ourselves, but we also need our strategies and tactics to be put to the test. This is decisive. However, it is much more dangerous to do this today than it was yesterday, because we are now facing a contender who is utilizing tactics of triumphant psychology, with even more material, political, theoretical, and ideological resources. Instead of being a process of creative development, the result could turn out to be the temptation to fill this power vacuum, following that well-known basic law of physics. Should we then remain immobile? No. Immobility is not the strength of a revolution. The answer is in our own history: Our strength is in our unity." Our unity, hopes, and the people's strength rely on our unity as well. The possibility for us to remain faithful to the ideals of freedom, justice, and social progress and to the revolutionary ideals depend on the people's strength. The possibility for us to measure our innovations, strategies, and tactics also depends on the people's strength. Today we now need a more intelligent union than yesterday. We need a more open, more flexible union in which each current of thought can express its identity and assume its role. We need a union in which each current of thought can prove to itself and to others its successes and virtues. We need a more intelligent and flexible unity than the one the FSLN had in the 1970's. Unity is indispensable to resist, to consolidate ourselves, to move ahead, and to renew ourselves and to continue being revolutionaries. With this outlook in mind, we greet the victorious African National Congress and President Nelson Mandela, the pride of humanity. He is an example of revolutionary skill. We greet so many other leftist parties and movements that have found the path to understand their new role, to maintain their unity, and to come out ahead. Receive, my brothers, the hug of all FMLN members without exception. From our hearts, we hope this FSLN congress will have the greatest success. The FSLN needs it, it wants it, and the Nicaraguan people expect it. The FMLN also needs the success of the FSLN congress. Thank you very much.
