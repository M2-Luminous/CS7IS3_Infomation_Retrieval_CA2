By noontime, half of the voters had already voted, and the primary result was achieved. By the time the polls closed, 80 percent of the voters had visited them. According to the official information supplied by Tsentrizbirkom [Central Electoral Committee] Chairman Boris Chochiyev, 41 electoral districts had been created. However, elections were held in only 36 of them, with the rest falling in Georgian villages. The question posed by one of the members of the CSCE [Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe] mission who was in Tskhinvali at the time of the elections--why were 28,000 members of the Georgian population given only 5 seats in parliament, while 35,500 Ossetian voters got to elect 36 deputies--remained unanswered. Thus, unlike the parliament of Abkhaziya, which had been exploded by the quota principle of representation, the elections to the South Ossetian nykhas demonstrated once again that Tskhinvali ignores Tbilisi, and the local Georgian population ignores the local Tskhinvali authorities. Nevertheless, many, including the commander of the Russian peacekeeping forces in South Ossetia, Nikolay Pavlov, even the day before the elections had serious doubts that the elections would take place without any excesses. Three days earlier, a hostage was taken in the Georgian village of Nuli, and a group demanded a ransom of 50 million rubles (R) for him. Certain circumstances surrounding this incident force us to believe that this was not an ordinary criminal action. After a thorough investigation, official Tskhinvali authorities never were able to determine who took the hostage. The R50 million were prepared. However, the members of the CSCE mission, together with the Russian peacekeepers, never did meet the middleman for transfer of the money. Meanwhile, the Georgians responded to this by seizing eight people (the six women and two children were freed after negotiations). The Georgian population blocked the roads in all directions leading to Tskhinvali. The peacekeepers were seriously concerned that if the situation could not be diffused, there would be a chain reaction of mutual violence. The incident really did give reason for mutual suspicions. The Tskhinvali authorities accused the Georgian authorities of wanting to undermine the elections. The commander of the Georgian battalion of peacekeeping forces, Nodar Tatarishvili, expressed the supposition that this was the work of Ossetian radicals who had decided to heat up anti-Georgian sentiments before the election. However, be that as it may, no hostages have been taken here for over a year now. Moreover, the sum of the ransom, contrary to accepted practice, was extremely high (usually they demand from R1 to R3 million, depending on the "status" of the hostage). And although General Pavlov was full of decisiveness to oppose the bandits, the situation has not yet been fully resolved. Nevertheless, the elections were held, even though they had an entertaining topic: There were 151 candidates running for 36 seats. A large part of the candidates were party nominees--12 parties, associations and unions entered into the struggle, and the most active among them was the Communist Party. The opposition became concerned when it discovered that many independent deputies, who in the former Supreme Soviet did not comprise the majority, turned out to be unable to withstand the promises to "bring back" the Soviet Union. Also playing a role was the fact that the leaders of the former Supreme Soviet, Torez Kulumbekov and Alan Chochiyev, had long ago left South Ossetia. This overshadowed the farewell with the former Supreme Soviet and had an effect on the reputation of the remaining deputies. And although the current chairman of the Supreme Soviet, Lyudvig Chibirov, believes that "the line of the former parliament will not be subject to revision, despite the fact that, according to the estimates, the make-up of the deputies will change by 60 percent," many believe that not only will the state nykhas be more "moderate," including in regard to Georgia, but that it will be simply an unprofessional and pliable organ. The absence of any active policy and self-sufficient organ of administration has already brought South Ossetia to the brink of catastrophe. Chairman Chibirov himself has not yet been elected to the new parliament but, like most of the deputies running in the city districts, has remained for the second round. His rival, the minister of foreign relations of South Ossetia, represents the Republic Party for People's Unity of Ossetia--a party representing the higher segment of power structures. The members of the CSCE mission, who are trying to renew contacts between Tskhinvali and Tbilisi, believe that Chibirov is a perceptive man. However, sensing the acuteness of the moment, he himself is in no hurry publicly to break down the "wall of China" which, in his words, has arisen between Georgia and Ossetia over the last five years. Chibirov announced that "if the parliament of Georgia has repealed the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia, we too will not escape this same verdict. But this is of no consequence for us. South Ossetia has its own constitution, on the basis of which we held the elections, placing a legal foundation under our republic."
