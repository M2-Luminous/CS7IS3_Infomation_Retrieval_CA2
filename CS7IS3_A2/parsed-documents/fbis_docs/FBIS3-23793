First on the scale of the former USSR, and now in Russia. As a result the USSR and RSFSR ministries of land reclamation and water resources were utterly devastated, followed by the USSR Ministry of Water Management Construction and the Vodstroy State Concern. The sector has been practically eliminated in Russia itself. The Main Administration of Land Reclamation and Water Resources, which has survived under the Ministry of Agriculture, the Vodstroy Joint-Stock Company and the Rosselkhozvodstroy and Tsentrinzhselstroy corporations now unite water management construction and planning organizations only on a voluntary basis. Moreover, it was found that in comparison with other sovereign states that formed atop the ruins of the great country, the Russian Federation has the smallest percentage of reclaimed agricultural land (11.5 million hectares, to include 6 million hectares irrigated and 5.5 million hectares drained). But not only has this foothold not enjoyed any growth in the last 3 years, it has even decreased by more than 1.2 million hectares. This has been due to indiscriminate abandonment of reclaimed land as a result of higher taxes on it and continually growing operating expenses. Things can get worse--the need for financing all reclamation work only out of local budgets has recently been pondered intensively in government circles. If such a policy is adopted, in the next 3 to 5 years Russia's reclaimed land will be practically eliminated. The natural question that arises is this: Does Russia need such land anyway? Could it be that the need for it was substantiated by ignorant scientists and specialists who saw only personal gain in the development of land reclamation? Let's look at history to get a dependable answer. According to available documents, development of land reclamation in Russia goes back more than four centuries, while planned irrigation and drainage did not begin here until the last century, in the reign of Nicholas I. A hundred years ago the Department of Land Improvement, the first state body dealing solely with the problems of land reclamation, was established in the Ministry of Agriculture. At that same time, at the end of the last century, large expeditions were organized under the leadership of famous specialists and scientists such as I. P. Zhilinskiy, M. N. Annenkov and V. V. Dokuchayev. As a result irrigation and drainage systems that were large for those days appeared in different corners of the country. We can divide the Soviet era into a prewar period of peoples' reclamation projects, when a number of large systems were created in Central Asia and Russia, and two postwar periods--up to 1953 and after 1960. At that time land reclamation was carried out practically in all regions of the former USSR, but to the greatest extent in republics such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Belorussia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. It must be said that there were failures as well, due to inadequate justification of some projects. These mistakes led to secondary salinization, swamping and overdrainage of part of the land, exhaustion of springs, and the advent of the Aral ecological crisis. In Russia itself, irrigation was developed in the Northern Caucasus, along the Volga and in Western Siberia, while drainage projects were carried out in the Nonchernozem Zone of the European territory and in Siberia. The relatively small amount of reclaimed land has until recently provided for the production of 100 percent of the rice, 80 percent of the vegetables and 80 percent of rough fodder. In other words the contribution to agricultural production has been substantial. Returning to the question raised in the article's title, let's now consider the experience of highly developed foreign countries. The 15th International Congress on Irrigation and Drainage was held in September 1993 in The Hague, with 80 countries participating. For the first time in the last 30 years, Russia was not officially there as the successor to the former USSR. Sad, but true. It was noted in the general report given by John Hennessy, president of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage, that irrigation and drainage remain the sole dependable means of stabilizing and intensifying agricultural production in the 21st century, providing for execution of the food program of developing countries. This was the road traveled in the past by the United States and Germany. Reclaimed land now makes up over 60 percent of agricultural land in these countries, while in the Netherlands it is as much as 80 percent. This is believed to be the optimum ratio here, and there are no plans for increasing the area of reclaimed land in the next 5-10 years. On the other hand emphasis is now being laid on the work of operating and rebuilding existing systems, raising their ecological safety and reducing their energy-intensiveness. Developing countries must make use of the modern technical level of reclamation to carry out their food programs. The congress examined two questions. The first concerned establishment of systems of a new generation distinguished from former ones by their ecological safety and resource-conserving nature. This means economical use of both natural (land, water) and economic (capital-intensiveness, energy-intensiveness, metal-intensiveness etc.) resources. The second question had to do with the forms of financing of reclamation work. It was noted that in all developed and developing countries investments are financed both by the state budget (70-80 percent) and with assets from municipalities and farm associations. Moreover construction of water intakes, reservoirs, major canals and pumping stations is proceeding only at the expense of the state budget, while projects at the farms themselves are financed both by the state budget and with assets of the farm associations. State low-interest loans are being granted for reconstruction and reorganization of systems in commercial farms. Then, after the client's work is 70 percent completed, loans are paid off by the federal government. In comparison with the countries discussed above, Russian agriculture is in more complex climatic conditions. The country's southern regions are subjected to frequent droughts, while the central and northern sections are distinguished by excessively wet farmland. This means that experience should not be carried over blindly: Our climate and our economic resources need to be considered. Simple arithmetic shows that in order to establish stable and highly productive agricultural production, we need to subject an area of 30-35 million hectares of land to reclamation--that's 20-25 percent of all agricultural land. When done in integration with other forms of land improvement (forest, biological, chemical, erosion control), this can successfully solve the problems of producing feed with a balanced protein concentration, as well as sugar, vegetables, fruits and other valuable food products. But let's be realistic. In today's economic conditions it is impossible to consider extensive development of land reclamation. Maintaining the land we already have, transforming it somewhat in correspondence with the agrarian reform, and rebuilding and reorganizing farms must be the priority objective. Russia does of course need reclaimed land! But the kind that would have a caretaker, and would support stable, highly productive production of ecologically clean products.
