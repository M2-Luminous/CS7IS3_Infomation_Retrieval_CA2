[Carnogursky] The speech was general and did not address those parts of the president's speech that described the actually existing negative features of Slovak politics. Moreover, he tried to give himself the air of someone who has been fighting for Slovak statehood since time immemorial. I, however, remember the meeting in the Vikarka restaurant [at Prague Castle] in January 1991, when he signed all points on the future constitutional setup submitted by President Vaclav Havel. The prime minister said that matters raised only in one-to-one conversations between himself and the president should not be made public. Yet this is exactly what he himself did last year with regard to his talks with Ludovit Cernak, the then chairman of the Slovak National Party [allusion to Meciar's claim that, in a private conversation, Cernak had asked for funds from the state budget for his party]. Vladimir Meciar simply did not convince me. As for his proposal that he will step down one minute after the president tenders his resignation, this is sheer demagoguery because, if the president of the Slovak Republic resigned, there would be no one to accept the prime minister's resignation. [Pankovcinova] Olga Keltosova, minister of labor and social affairs, called on deputies on Thursday [10 March] to consider the possibilities arising from Article 106 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic. This article deals with conditions under which the NRSR can recall the president.... [Carnogursky] This was a display of demagoguery and arrogance because, by proposing a broad-coalition government, the president did not make himself guilty of anything [constituting grounds for impeachment] under Article 106 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic. The very fact that a minister dares say anything of that sort about the president is brazen. [Pankovcinova] How long will the formation of the coalition government last? [Carnogursky] It cannot last long. The government must be formed within the next few days. [Pankovcinova] Will you seek a change in the post of NRSR chairman? [Carnogursky] I think that this issue will be topical. [Pankovcinova] Are you personally interested in any government post? [Carnogursky] No, it will be a government without party leaders. [Pankovcinova] Which government departments does the Christian Democratic Movement intend to fill? [Carnogursky] That is a matter for political parties to agree upon.
