It is subsidized by both world Zionism and chauvinist circles. Those who may come to power in Russia will pursue a policy which will be very dangerous for Ukraine. It is now becoming clear that the public should reach the conclusion that we must not disarm. Nuclear missiles are a guarantor of peace not only in Ukraine but throughout the world. Zhirinovskiy will be at war with Ukraine the moment the last ballistic missile equipped with a nuclear warhead is removed from Ukrainian territory. It is a great danger to Ukraine that President Kravchuk does not realize that nuclear weapons are a guarantor of statehood and security. Our government and structures of power are operating a pro-Moscow policy: Even now Ukraine is buying goods from Russia paying six times as much [as we should] and selling them for eight times less [than we should]. Ukraine's budget is plummeting and all that is aggravated by such a dangerous force appearing as Russian communist fascism. So the USDP position is that, as a nuclear state, we can only carry out nuclear disarmament when it is adequately matched by other nuclear states' disarmament.''
