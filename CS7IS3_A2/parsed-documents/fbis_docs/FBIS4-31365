Cani: "Defection or Theft of `Brains'?"] [Excerpts] Belgrade -- "The emigration of experts from our country has assumed worrying proportions recently. We would like to establish the exact number of those who have left the country, try to reduce this number, and create the conditions for their return." This was stated yesterday by Ratko Uzunovic, assistant republican minister for science, technology, and development at the consultations devoted to this problem at the Institute for International Politics and Economy. According to the information collected by this institute, 1,060 scientists have left the country in the last 15 years. However, as Dr. Vladimir Grecic said, this figure is not definite. There are many institutions and organizations that have not filled out the questionnaires that were sent to them. It is estimated that some 1,400 experts have left the country. These experts were mainly at the age considered to be best for creativity; 251 of them hold PhD's, 215 hold masters degree, and another 594 hold various degrees. The greatest number of those who have left are experts for electronics, physics, mathematics, chemistry, and medicine. [passage omitted] The largest number of experts has gone to the United States (277), followed by Canada (194), Australia (82), Switzerland, Austria.... As stated yesterday, particularly worrying are the indications that some countries will increase the number of entry visas for experts in certain fields. According to the representative of the republican Ministry for Education, this represents additional (deliberate) form of sanctions against Serbia and Yugoslavia. It should be mentioned that Canada, for instance, has announced that it would grant around 10,000 immigration visas this year.
