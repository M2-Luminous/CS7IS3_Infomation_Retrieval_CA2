Wijetunga was due to leave on May 8 on a five-day tour of China which was to be his first foreign visit since coming to power in May last year. State-run newspapers said Wijetunga had put off the trip indefinitely, but gave no reason for the move. However, the privately-ownned Sinhalese language Divaina newspaper said the decision was due to serious squabbling within his party. Sections of the ruling United National Party (UNP) have openly questioned Wijetunga's ability to lead them to victory at national elections later this year, following the UNP's humiliating defeat at a local election last month. The March 24 defeat in the southern provincial council elections, is seen as the most serious set back for the UNP since it came to power in 1977.
