FR940429-0-00232 FR940429-0-00015 Discussion: The Secretary has considered the suggestions from the commenters that some minimum standards be set out in the regulations to establish qualifications for the hearing officer, but does not believe that any such actions are appropriate. The hearing official is charged with the responsibility of resolving the issues requested in the appeal, and the parties bear the responsibility of presenting the issues in controversy. The hearing official meets requirements for experience and capability in accordance with internal Department procedures, and no additional requirements are needed in these regulations. Additionally, the hearing official's decisions involving limitations, suspensions, terminations and fines may be appealed to the Secretary under this subpart. This appeal to the Secretary provides an additional procedural safeguard that the issue will be resolved fairly in a manner that is consistent with other decisions issued by the Secretary. The Secretary does not agree with the suggestion that additional regulations are necessary to permit the participants to inform the hearing officer of details of the issues due to the generally complex issues involved in some cases. Under the regulations, any party may request a prehearing conference that would address how the parties could present the relevant issues to the hearing official. In addition, the parties have the opportunity to make their position known in the pleadings required by the hearing official. The Secretary agrees with the commenters that an institution or third-party servicer who is the respondent in an administrative hearing should be provided with a copy of a transcript when one is prepared by the Department of Education. Under current procedures, a transcription is routinely made of any adverse action initiated under this subpart, and a copy of the transcript is provided to the respondent. The Secretary disagrees with the suggestion that the regulations establish a ``reasonableness'' standard to limit the liabilities of parties participating or providing servicing of the Title IV, HEA programs in good faith. Institutions and third-party servicers are fiduciaries that are entrusted with properly administering the Title IV, HEA programs. Establishing a lesser negligence is inappropriate, particularly given the advance system of Title IV, HEA funding used by the overwhelming majority of participating institutions. As fiduciaries, these parties are held to one of the highest standards of accountability, and it is inappropriate to excuse or reduce a liability that is caused by a subjective good faith belief purportedly held by the institution or third-party servicer. Business decisions that concern the degree of care and oversight required by institutions and third-party servicers must take into consideration their responsibility for adhering to the applicable program requirements. The Secretary also rejects any suggestion that the hearing official be given discretion to refuse to apply applicable regulations to a dispute. The regulations constitute final determinations by the Secretary concerning the requirements that must be followed by institutions and third-party servicers to participate in the HEA programs. The hearing official must apply the regulations as written. This process provides certainty to all parties, and enables the development and enforcement of a consistent body of administrative rulings. The Secretary appreciates the suggestion of commenters who urged that guidance issued by the Department in the form of manuals, handbooks, other publications or Dear Colleague letters should be binding the hearing official in the same manner as regulations. However, such guidance does not have the same legal force as regulations issued pursuant to formal rulemaking. The Secretary believes that such guidance does provide a foundation against which the reasonableness of the institution's or third-party servicer's conduct may be judged. In the context of resolving whether the institution or third-party servicer violated a regulation or statute, or breached its fiduciary duties, the hearing official should evaluate the institution's or third-party servicer's actions based upon whether it made a good faith effort to apply and follow the guidance issued by the Department. The Secretary believes that actions taken contrary to such guidance would be presumptively improper and should be viewed as such by a hearing official. The Secretary further believes it will be a rare instance where a party can demonstrate that it fulfilled its fiduciary obligation and complied with statutory or regulatory requirements while failing to heed or apply guidance issued by the Department of Education as to the proper application of statutory or regulatory provisions. The Secretary does not agree that it is necessary to list all possible authority binding on the hearing official. The parties are free to cite any authority they feel may govern a particular case or issue. Section 668.89(d) is included to preclude hearing official from ignoring or refusing to apply departmental statutes and regulations. If a hearing otherwise fails to apply applicable authority, a party may appeal to the Secretary. The Secretary does not agree that an adverse action initiated against a third-party servicer must necessarily include any institution that has a contract with that servicer who could potentially be affected by the Secretary's action. The particular facts in each case will determine the party or parties against whom an adverse action is taken, and in some instances it may be appropriate for an institution and its servicer to both be named as respondents. In some cases, a third-party servicer against whom an adverse action is initiated may ask the Department to expand the administrative action to encompass the institutions that are relevant to the administrative action. Again, the Secretary believes that the particular facts of each case will have to be considered to determine the appropriate actions, rather than expanding the scope of the regulations to require such participation by other parties in every case. The commenter also suggested that such participation by a third-party servicer's customers should be considered because an adverse ruling would have an impact on every other client for that servicer, especially where a termination or debarment action were sought. However, the resulting impact of a termination or a debarment of a third-party servicer on the servicer's customers is not a sufficient basis for these parties to be given a right to be represented in any prehearing conference. To invite all potentially affected parties to the hearing would complicate the proceedings. The proper focus of the administrative proceeding is determining whether the limitation, termination, or suspension should be imposed based upon the cited program violations.
