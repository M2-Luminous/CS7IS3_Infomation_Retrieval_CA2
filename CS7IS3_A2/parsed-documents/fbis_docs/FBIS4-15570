According to Bagdasaryan, Armenia's borders with Iran and Turkey were controlled exclusively by Russian troops. The treaty of 1992 was ratified by Moscow in 1993 but remains to be ratified by the Armenian parliament. A number of Armenian legislators would like to rewrite some parts off that document. They raise objections to the articles on preferential treatment for Russian servicemen and the creation of troop deployment areas in their republic.
