In the statement, Geoana mentioned Romania's recent efforts to advance bilateral talks on the issue. Herman agreed that a treaty is in the interest of both sides, but declined to predict any deadlines for reaching an agreement. Romanian senior officials had said that they expected an agreement on the debated issues, i.e. on the inviolability of borders and the question of minorities, before June 1. The Hungarian spokesman said there had been certain hints in the statement suggesting that the elaboration of the treaty could be based on formulas given by NATO, the U.S. and some Western European countries. Herman said that while the Hungarian side had not received any such formulas relating to the treaty, Hungary has, in a broader sense, accepted suggestions from NATO and the U.S., for instance, by signing the Partnership for Peace agreement.
