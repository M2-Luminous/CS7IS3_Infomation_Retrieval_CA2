Up to the end of last year, the savings of the Agricultural Bank of China and credit cooperatives had already reached 827.9 billion yuan, 157.2 billion yuan more than at the beginning of the year. The balance of various loans was 968 billion yuan, 176 billion yuan more than at the beginning of the year. Last year, the Agricultural Bank of China at all levels, proceeding from the overall situation, exercised strict control over the total volume of credit, comprehensively implemented relevant rules, and collected 5.8 billion yuan of funds lent in violation of the rules. Under circumstances in which savings slid and banks had difficulties with funds, the Agricultural Bank of China and credit cooperatives at all levels always put the organization of funds in the most important position and rural savings reached 610.2 billion yuan by the end of the year, 126.3 billion yuan more than at the beginning of the year. This has laid a firm foundation in terms of funds for providing support to agriculture in the future. The Agricultural Bank of China, taking ensuring payment as the prerequisite, gave priority to meeting the need for funds for agricultural development and to the purchase of agricultural and sideline products and focused its support on developing "high output, high efficiency, and high quality" agriculture, invigorating agriculture with science and technology, and helping the poor and providing relief to victims of natural disasters. In 1993, the Agricultural Bank of China and the credit cooperatives granted agricultural loans totaling 232.9 billion yuan, 30 billion yuan more than the previous year. To give support to the purchase of agricultural and sideline products and to ensure purchasing enterprises would not give IOU's to peasants, in 1993 the bank and the credit cooperatives granted loans for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products totaling 243 billion yuan, 1.3 billion yuan more than the previous year, thus ensuring the smooth progress of the purchase of agricultural and sideline products throughout the year.
