He also emphasized his concern "about the misery that is the result of the lack of jobs." He made these remarks in a speech he delivered at the closing session of a meeting of OAS specialists who addressed measures of confidence and security. Menem also praised Brazilian Joao Banea Soares, the outgoing OAS secretary general, who in his speech emphasized the devotion to peace of the region's countries, highlighting the example of Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, which signed agreements establishing nuclear controls and banning chemical weapons. In referring to Baena Soares' speech, Menem said: "Those agreements should serve as guidance for future steps we can take regarding our relations." The president previously emphasized that in regional integration efforts, diplomacy plays a major role, adding that there is "cooperative diplomacy," along with "preventive" diplomacy "to prevent confrontations that can be irreversible and irreparable." Menem also admitted that in the continent "there are some minor conflicts, but which are conflicts nonetheless," noting that "we should tackle them in order to solve them." As an example to be followed, he mentioned the recommendations of the OAS meeting's final document, which covers matters referring to cultural, educational, and military affairs. Recommendations The conclusions of the specialists' deliberations were considered "modest" but predictable within the path toward designing a new security system for the region, sources consulted by CLARIN said. The six-point document states in point three that it is necessary "to recommend that member countries regularly communicate to the appropriate OAS offices about the implementation of measures to promote confidence." Specialists have said that this point, especially the periodical nature of such communications, is the beginning of a system of consultations. This is one of the most significant matters approved on 18 March. Likewise, the OAS Special Hemispheric Security Commission (presided over by Argentine Ambassador Hernan Patino Mayer) was urged to continue with the examination of measures for strengthening confidence, "and among others, the measure regarding the peaceful settlement of controversies and the prevention of conflicts." This is different from an Argentine proposal to create a permanent center for the prevention of conflicts. It was not possible to establish a mechanism for regular defense ministers meetings either. However, a new meeting was set for 1995 in Chile.
