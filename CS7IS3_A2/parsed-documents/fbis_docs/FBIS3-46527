The change was so great that Professor John K. Galbraith even called it "The Age of Uncertainty." The situation worsened in the 1990s, since everything became unpredictable. In my opinion, we are now living in a period of "social diastrophism" that is creating all sorts of gaps. With respect to the industrial world, we have already faced many crises in the past, such as the Nixon shock, the first oil shock, the second oil shock, and the influence of the strong yen on the export-dependent Japanese economy. Drawing on our resources, we were able to tide over each of these crises. When the value of the yen against the dollar came close to 100 yen recently, I was as scared as if a guided missile had been launched against Japan. Japanese high-technology industry will indeed suffer catastrophic damage from a sudden appreciation of the yen, as if it had been attacked by a missile. In February, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen. Then, it plunged about 20 percent in a very short period of time. Under such circumstances, our business will not be viable. The rise of the yen against the dollar is at the root of the current recession. Of course, this is not the only cause, but there is no doubt that the strong yen is weighing considerably against the national economy. In discussions about the appreciation of the yen, nine people out of ten have no doubt that the yen's rise is encouraged by Japan's trade surplus, and they are generally sticking fast to their opinion. Is what they say really true? In September 1985, the dollar was quoted at around 240 yen. In its trade with the United States, Japan marked a surplus of 11.9 billion dollars in the fourth quarter of that year. When I met Carla Hills, the then U.S. Trade Representative, toward the end of 1991, we were just then informed that Japan's trade surplus with the United States had totaled 11.7 billion dollars (figure announced at that time by the government) in the third quarter. And the value of the yen against the dollar was between 120 and 130. These figures clearly show that the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States had remained basically unchanged despite the high appreciation of the yen. Despite these facts, Director C. Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics, who is reportedly a prominent economic brain trustee of U.S. President Bill Clinton, still reiterates the need for a stronger yen. "International cooperation, such as the introduction of a reference range, is needed to promote a rise up to 110 yen, or even up to 100 yen, in the value of the yen, to bring down Japan's trade surplus," Bergstan said, when he came to Tokyo in February 1993 to give a lecture. According to his theory, if the yen rises at an annual rate of one percent against the dollar, Japan's current trade surplus with the United States will be cut by one billion dollars in two years. If that is the case, will the surplus decrease by 10 billion dollars, with a 10 percent rise of the yen, which is equivalent to a fall of the dollar by 10 yen? That cannot be. Professor Lester C. Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is also very emphatic about the necessity of improving the value of the yen up to 100 yen. How can such a view remain unchallenged? It is because all trade statistics have always been valued in dollars. If dollars are converted into yen, the quarterly value of Japan's trade surplus with the United States in 1985 would be equivalent to some 2.5 trillion yen. This year, the same value would have dropped to some 1.1 trillion yen. Everyone can read in newspapers that in other countries, like France or Germany, trade imbalances are valued in their currencies; that is to say in French francs or in Deutsche marks. Japan is the only country using the dollar from beginning to end. `The Yen-Valued World' and `the Dollar-Valued World' The French or the German case is just one example. What I would like to emphasize most is the importance of fact-finding. People should speak out only after shaping their ideas based on facts. Let me give one or two more examples. A famous Japanese economic analyst told me: "In the early 1980s, Japan's national defense spending was criticized as being too small. However, the attack from other countries gradually eased in the latter half of the 1980s, thanks to Japan's efforts. As a result, I also escaped being criticized by American and European economic analysts, and I could preserve my honor." So, I asked him, "Did Japan double the number of its military planes or its warships? Did Japan double the number of Self-Defense officials?" As a matter of course, that could not be. What is certain is that in the latter half of the 1980s, the dollar plunged sharply against the yen, from the 240-yen level to the 120-yen level, following the Plaza Accord reached by the Group of Seven in 1985. Therefore, dollar-valued national defense spending has increased considerably. However, the rise was more apparent than real. Although he is a well-known economic analyst, he was unable to recognize that what had occurred was the result of exchange-rate magic. Another example is the gap between domestic and global prices, which is often taken up for discussion between Japan and the United States. It is really regrettable to see that there are so many unsubstantiated arguments that remain unchallenged. For instance, Mr. Bergsten points out that although Japan does not impose any import duty on foreign semiconductors, it raises nontariff barriers equivalent to 107 percent. Where did he get this data? I found that his argument was based on a paper written by a Japanese university professor. In his original text, the professor said that in Japan, a domestic integrated circuit is about twice the price of a foreign integrated circuit imported from Taiwan or from a Southeast Asian country. However, after a thorough investigation, I discovered that the two integrated circuits mentioned in the paper were not of the same kind. Mr. Bergsten denounces Japan's nontariff barriers using incorrect data obtained from such an improper comparison. His argument is totally irrelevant. With regard to integrated circuits, Japan is making a great effort to increase the purchase of foreign products. If we take these efforts into consideration, it is not too much to say that Japan is even applying a negative tariff rate on foreign products. By the way, the price of a haircut is 3,500 or 3,600 yen in Tokyo. The barber fee has gradually increased since the end of the war, with the current of the times. This price will not change even if the dollar falls to 100 yen. For example, even if the barber can buy a pair of Solingen clippers for 10,000 yen instead of 12,000 yen, thanks to the yen's rise, the price of a haircut would never become lower, because "the yen-valued world" differs from "the dollar-valued world" in real economy. Despite the difference, I have seen many comparative lists of commodity prices indicating the barber fee in New York and the one in Tokyo, by simply converting yen into dollars or dollars into yen. This is really amazing. In 1991, Japan's gross national product was about 470 trillion yen. The export-import value amounted to 500-odd billion dollars, which is equivalent to some 60 trillion yen, at an exchange rate of 110 yen against the dollar. This represents less than 20 percent of the gross national product. This means that the portion that is directly affected by exchange fluctuations does not even reach 20 percent of the GNP. More than 80 percent of the GNP corresponds to "the yen-valued world." With a wise look, some commentators used to base their argument on "the law of indifference," which I find strange, when they had to refer to the gap between domestic and global prices, during debates on the sudden rise of the yen. For example, let us suppose that a Japanese TV set worth 20,000 yen was sold at 100 dollars in the United States, when the dollar was quoted at 240 yen. I believe no one would have found anything strange about that. However, when the dollar dropped to 180 yen, people began to put the price gap into question. This is because if the same TV set continues to be sold at the same price in the United States, its yen-valued price would fall to 18,000 yen. There has not been discussion about the gap between domestic and global prices, since the dollar reached the 180-yen level. However, it does not always follow that the price gap is caused by the yen's appreciation, since the retail price could remain unchanged because of the U.S. distribution system. There is now a growing call for economic deregulation. Thanks to various efforts, such as the rationalization of business routines, the purchasing power parity of the yen against the dollar, which was more than 400 yen after the end of the war, has already improved to less than 200 yen. Needless to say, Japan should continue to make efforts in that direction. However, I do not want to see Japanese people repeating the foolish mistake of taking the yen's sudden appreciation for granted and to accept it without due consideration. The yen's rise is nothing but a result of a speculative move made by young speculators. The economic fundamentals of "the yen-valued world," which corresponds to 80 percent of the national economy, are almost not affected by exchange fluctuations. As for "the dollar-valued world," which represents the remaining 20 percent, even if the value of the yen becomes about 20 percent stronger against the dollar in a mere six months, it does not mean that its economic fundamentals will also undergo a similar change. Such a change is beyond possibility. We are now living in a period of time when it is not possible for our country to stand by itself. Speaking of Japan's relations with the rest of the world, Japan-U.S. relations are the most important. I have stressed for a long time that Japan is like a younger brother of the United States. After the end of the war, our brother helped us out of difficulty. One day, we should return the kindness. Meanwhile, if we compare the two brothers, we can see that the United States is rather interested in software. Attracting many persons of remarkable talent, the United States is already living in an age of highly advanced information. This is why the percentage of Americans working for manufacturing industries is decreasing more and more. According to statistics released in 1990, only 16.7 percent of the U.S. working population was employed by a manufacturing industry. Meanwhile, Japan continues to spend money to buy high-quality software from the United States. Thanks to its excellent manufacturing technology, it develops new products from U.S.-made software. New products are then supplied to the United States. It seems that the United States has finally begun to understand this situation. However, discussions between the two countries are still not going smoothly. For example, I thought that everything would be resolved once Japan and the United States reached agreement following ministerial level bilateral talks, such as meetings between the Japanese international trade and industry minister or the Japanese posts and telecommunications minister and the U.S. secretary of commerce or the U.S. trade representative. However, things were not so easy. Japan Has a Masochistic Tendency of Self-Condemnation There is the problem of increasing Japan's purchase of foreign semiconductors to more than 20 percent of its market. This is a striking example showing the discord between the two countries. The text of the new U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement states that the Japanese Government "recognizes that the U.S. semiconductor industry expects foreign-made chips to gain more than a 20 percent share of the Japanese market by the end of 1992." However, the text also says clearly, "Both governments agreed that this numerical target does not constitute a guarantee, a ceiling, or a floor." Despite the contents of the agreement, once the semiconductor issue comes to the fore, Americans get excited and start talking about penalties in the case of failure to meet the target. Although there are only a few Japan-bashers among U.S. congressmen, when the matter becomes serious, the United States has a tendency to resort to punishment, even if there is no basis for it. The Japanese Government as well as the Japanese news media should become more conscious of this. They should tell people the truth, by calling what is right, right, and what is wrong, wrong. I do not know why, but Japanese people have a masochistic tendency to immediately take the blame before even trying to ascertain the truth, when they are severely criticized by people of other countries. Moreover, Japanese people have another strange mentality: they are strongly inclined to believe more in press reports dispatched from abroad by a Japanese correspondent than those compiled by journalists based in Japan. Japan should not let the United States speak as it likes. On the contrary, it should answer back in the same way. In certain cases, it should be prepared to speak out twice as much as the United States; otherwise it will not be able to face this country which speaks in a loud voice. Frankly speaking, what the United States is doing now is like saying, "You buy this, you buy that," with a gun in one hand. In the case of semiconductors, the United States has hinted at revival of the Super 301 clause of the Omnibus Trade act, if the targeted 20 percent market share is not achieved. The way the United State speaks can be seen as if it wants to intimidate Japan into submission. To begin with, the United States should understand that marketing is an absorptive phenomenon. It is not because a trader has tried hard to intrude an article upon consumers so that he will find a big market for it. People will never buy articles that do not meet their needs. The desire to buy should come first. Now, people often use the word "symbiosis." Among different antagonistic parties, which are the two parties which must live together in symbiosis? This should be the most important point, when we think of symbiosis. The confrontation between producers and consumers is never put in question on the occasion of international trade disputes. It is the antagonism between producers of different countries that is always at issue. Consumers are completely neglected during trade negotiations. European and American business leaders say that Japanese people work too hard. They criticize Japan's ratio of labor income distribution. They also point out that Japanese companies have a low pay-out ratio. However, it is not proper to overreact to these comments by European and American business leaders, without having a critical mind. The pay-out ratio increases considerably when companies suffer a decline in profit due to a recession. This is quite natural because companies continue to pay dividends, despite the decrease in profit. instead of raising or lowering the dividend at once, Japanese management makes it a practice to increase the dividend gradually, so that it can maintain the level even in case of a decline in profit. Stability is very important in Japanese management. It is very bad if Japanese people are unable to give a clear explanation like this. As for the ratio of labor income distribution, it is true that there is a gap between Japan and the United States. The U.S. ratio is about 80-81 percent, while Japan's ratio is around 76-77 percent. Japan still has to invest considerably in plants and equipment, since it is still based on manufacturing industry. Meanwhile the United States, where the service industry is already predominant, has no need to spend so much money on plants and facilities. If someone wants to comment on Japan's ratio of labor income distribution, he should make a proper comparison of the two countries, as I did. How can two antagonistic groups coexist? This is the idea of symbiosis. For example, we can say that parents and children live together in symbiosis, since there is always a certain antagonism between them. Although they have a different sense of values, they try to overcome the gap to live together happily. Professor William G. Ouchi of the United States has tried to clarify Japanese management methods by comparing two types of companies; Type A companies versus Type Z companies. Type A is a typical company with top-down decisionmaking. Type Z is a company having a participative approach to decisionmaking: it tries to reach a consensus by listening to what people of minor positions say. Originally, Japanese companies had the same characteristics as Type Z companies. However, they have now changed a little bit because the lifetime employment system is transforming to what I call a "continued employment system." In terms of employment, Japanese companies have become less stable due to an increase in the employee turnover rate: instead of hiring only new graduates, as they did previously, Japanese companies have begun to take experienced hands into service. However, Japanese companies are still more steady than the Type A companies of the United States. We are introducing favorable management methods from the United States, while keeping what is good in our management. For instance, under the Japanese system of lifelong job rotation, personnel changes used to be made in an arbitrary manner. Today, many Japanese companies are asking their employees if they have a request, so that they can reflect their wishes as much as possible on the occasion of their job rotation. As for NEC, we have adopted a U.S. review system under which all employees will be appraised according to their achievements, and not according to the amount of hours they have spent on the job. The Japanese Economy Suffers From Second-Stage Cancer If we compare the current economic situation to a cancer, we can say that there are already many symptoms showing that the cancerous growth has entered its second stage. I think the national economy got cancer toward the end of 1992. On 28 August 1992, the previous government announced a package of economic-stimulus measures worth 10.7 trillion yen. It had to convene an extraordinary Diet session from the end of September through October to pass a supplementary budget so that the package would be implemented as soon as possible to maximize its pump-priming effect; otherwise "pure water," or real government spending, would have become smaller than the mentioned figure. Unfortunately, for several reasons, the convocation of the extraordinary Diet session was put off from day to day. It was around 10 December that the Diet finally passed a supplementary budget to finance the program. The impact of the long-awaited pump-priming package was weakened because of this delay. At that time, I was already stressing the need for income tax cuts in addition to building up a counter argument against the tenacious view that the issue of deficit-financing bonds should be absolutely avoided. Basically, the Government should not issue bonds to cover the budget deficit. This is a matter of common sense. For instance, if we do not have enough money to wine and dine, it is not good to borrow money for that. But taking another view, let us suppose that you get cancer. Your doctor tells you that it is still operable because it was detected in its early stages. But for that, you will have to pay one million yen. In such a case, you should try to recover your health, even by borrowing money from your friends or obtaining a loan from your company, because cancer can be cured if spotted early enough thanks to the power of contemporary medical science. If the surgical operation is delayed, your cancer will enter its second and third stages. The doctor's fee will run up even higher and you may still die in the end. No one will be able to bring you back to life. Toward the end of 1992, I was strongly calling for a quick remedy to recover the national economy, by comparing the current recession with cancer. With respect to income tax cuts, I said "some 100,000 yen per household." I proposed an income tax reduction worth 3 or 4 trillion yen. As a matter of course, income tax cuts of this scale are not sufficient to prop up a sluggish economy. I added that we should also make efforts to create a better atmosphere to induce people to spend money. For example, if consumers begin to feel that the employment situation will not become worse, that they will be able to return their housing loan somehow, and that the economy has now bottomed out, they will certainly spend 70,000 to 80,000 yen out of the 100,000 yen they receive from income tax cuts. However, if the surrounding atmosphere remains gloomy, after spending 10,000 or 20,000 yen, consumers would prefer to put the remaining money in a bank. After all, economic performance is highly influenced by social psychology. In other words, it is a question of thinking. Therefore, I said that a reduction in income tax of 100,000 yen per household would be effective if a package of other measures, such as a cut in interest rates, a revision of the capital gains tax, and the bolstering of the stock price of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, is implemented at the same time. Initially, the government predicted that the GNP would grow at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in fiscal 1992. In the middle of the year, it revised the figure to 1.6 percent. By the end of the fiscal year, it announced a 0.8 percent growth. Last year, Japan's economy shrank by 0.4 percent (later, the figure was revised to 0.6 percent) during the July-September period compared with the previous quarter. The government reported the drop in the GNP only at the beginning of December 1992. It means that it needed more than one month to make such an important announcement. This is incredible, and no one has taken the blame. As for us, we must take the responsibility as company executives for even a small decline in profits. For instance, in the case of NEC, it was decided to cut the bonus of each executive by 25 percent. If necessary, a further reduction will have to be implemented. Company executives make sure to take the blame for what they have done, because they are entrusted by stockholders. Frankly speaking, the government policies adopted until now were wrong. It is all right if the government believes that deficit-covering bonds are unnecessary. It is good if the government thinks there is no need for income tax cuts. The only point I would like to stress is that the government should take the responsibility for that. Now Is the Very Moment To Carry Out Currency Reform When I attended a meeting of the Advisory Group for Economic Restructuring [a private advisory panel to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa] some time ago, I spoke with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura about what the administration should be doing. I told him that the government should first set a target. I explained that administration is needed to help people reach a goal. I also added that administration becomes impossible where there is no target. For instance, the government should first say, "This year, the targeted economic growth rate is such and such." How can we work out an economic policy without fixing a target? First of all, I want government officials to become more aware of the importance of setting a target. With regard to public investment, which has always been considered the centerpiece of an economic-stimulus package, I would like to ask government officials to come up with a well-balanced program. Here, the word "well-balanced" especially means that public works spending should concentrate mostly on projects that meet the needs of the times. I am not against the idea of appropriating public works spending for the construction of bridges. Public works used to be the symbol of destruction and reproduction, workers are digging in and filling in the ground over and over again." I think we should try to improve this image of public works by introducing the idea of new social infrastructures that meet the needs of the times. I have been stressing the importance of improving social infrastructures in consumer-oriented areas. The previous pump-priming package, which was worth 13.2 trillion yen and was adopted in April 1993, called for fiscal spending to expand and improve new social infrastructures. A supplementary budget passed the Diet on 10 June 1993, to finance stimulus measures. I hope that the idea of new social infrastructures will be reflected also in the budget for fiscal 1994. For instance, improvement of administrative information systems based on computer networks should always be included in public works spending from now on. Until now, public works were concentrated mostly on projects to construct state-owned facilities or such infrastructures as bridges and roads. However, if the situation remains unchanged, we can no longer meet the needs of the times, as we are now living in an age of an information revolution. In December 1991 when he was still a senator, Vice President Al Gore proposed a bill, which was enacted later by then-President George Bush as the "High-Performance Computing Act." Now, on 15 September 1993, the U.S. Government announced a project called the "National Information Infrastructure Program," which is to be promoted by a special task force headed by the secretary of commerce, and comprising officials of the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Health and Human Services, and directors of such institutions as the Technology Standards Institute. Japan will not be able to keep pace with the times if the government does not seriously tackle the question of the growing importance of information from now on. The government should compile the budget for the next fiscal year keeping in mind the key point that we are living in the information age. In addition to income tax cuts and public spending emphasizing the improvement of new social infrastructures, we need one more measure, which would have a special impact on the economy. I propose that the government carry out currency reform. Many people are strongly opposed to currency reform, saying the government should not implement such a costly measure while the national economy is still sluggish. On the contrary, I rather say the government must spend money, more aggressively to some extent, especially because of the recession. Although the national economy remains weak, it does not mean that Japan has no money at all. So why not spend it? In Japan, postal savings alone amount to 170 trillion yen in total. Moreover, it reportedly shows an annual increase of 10-odd trillion yen. If we add other personal savings as well as corporate savings, the total amount would reach 1 quadrillion yen. There are calls for investment tax cuts. However, I do not think this measure is immediately necessary, because companies will not invest as long as there is no demand. They will start to invest only when there is every indication that individual consumption will pick up. Investment tax cuts will be helpful once there is an upward trend in demand. Currency reform would help create new special demand. Some people even say that it would have an economic impact worth just under 5 trillion yen. As for the cost needed for currency redenomination, the implementation of tax cuts for the sake of policy would be one way to finance one part of the total cost. Currency reform will help invigorate the stock market. Stock prices will more or less tend to go upward thanks to redenomination. This is not the only merit of currency reform. I hesitate a little bit to speak about the other advantage, because people might say, "Every miller draws water to his own mill." But anyway, I would like to point out that if people see a sector hit hard by the recession, like our software industry, regaining strength thanks to currency reform, it would have a big psychological impact. Employment destabilization is now a big problem. It the employment situation becomes more stable, consumers will decide to spend more money. Some people often say that consumers spend less money because there is nothing new to buy. However, I do not think so. In the past, for instance, there was a period of time when consumers used to have two or three cameras at home. Individual consumption is highly influenced by psychological factors derived from the economic trend. One more advantage is that by improving the prestige of the yen, the currency reform might help halt the unjustified attempt by the United States to encourage a further appreciation of the yen against the dollar. I do not know why, but since around 1987, Professor Lester C. Thurow has been reiterating that the value of the yen against the dollar should be 95 yen. Let us suppose that the dollar drops to 95 yen. If the Japanese Government carries out currency reform, one dollar will be worth 0.95 new yen. Such a situation would probably be inadmissible for a proud country like the United States. I do not say that the appropriate value of the yen against the dollar is 100 yen. However, currency redenomination would prove significant, if it helps avoid at least a further appreciation of the yen above the 100-yen mark. For the moment, I do not feel a strong will to invigorate the national economy on the part of the government. People attribute the current recession to the speculative bubble economy, to the sudden appreciation of the yen against the dollar, to cyclical fluctuations, etc. These opinions might be true. However, what is more important is to take the necessary actions. Unfortunately, it seems the government has no intention of making efforts to improve the current situation. Politicians may be too occupied with political reform to think about the economy. However, that should not be the case for government officials who, unlike politicians, do not have to run in an election. I want government officials to show a strong will to help the economy recover, because it is time to compile the budget for the next fiscal year; otherwise, the national economy will never be revived. There is still a feeling that the economy will take a favorable turn by itself, even leaving the recession as it is, or that the economic climate will soon improve little by little since we have already suffered hardships for so long. Unfortunately, the current situation no longer allows the entertaining of such an optimistic view. "The government should not issue deficit-covering bonds, which would weigh upon public finances until the days of our grandchildren." If there are people who continue to say this, at a time when we should concentrate on the urgent question of how to pull ourselves out of the current difficulty, I should say that they are really dreamers.
