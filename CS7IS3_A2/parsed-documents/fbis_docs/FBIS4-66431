Develops Recycling Technology for Galvanized Steel Scrap 94FE0402H Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 11 Nov 93 p 13 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94FE0402H Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] On 10 November, Toyota Motor Corp. announced that it had developed recycling technology that efficiently separates and recovers steel and iron from galvanized steel scrap used in automobiles. The technology involves heating galvanized steel under a low pressure to vaporize the zinc, which has a low boiling point, and then solidifying and recovering it, along with obtaining high-purity iron. A facility for the new technology, which was jointly developed with Toyokin Co., went into operation in October at Toyokin's main plant. The facility's processing capacity ranges from 4,000 to 5,000 tons per month. This is the first recycling technology of its kind in the world. For some time now Toyota has been using the iron scrap of pressed edge materials, etc., to produce casted parts (in-process recycling). However, because the zinc components in the scrap reduce the durability of the melting furnaces used in casting, since 1987 Toyota has been removing the zinc by means of shot-blast processing, which blows fine iron beads into the scrap. With that method, however, the zinc removal rate is only 85%. In addition, recovering the zinc is difficult, and pig iron had to be mixed in. A strong point of the new method is that scrap containing a large amount of impurities can be handled in a vacuum furnace, which requires a high degree of purity to maintain air-tightness. With the new method, scrap cut into massive pieces is heated to about 700ï¿½C in the vacuum furnace (0.0001 atmosphere) to vaporize the zinc, then that zinc is collected by solidifying it, and the iron is recovered by cooling it. The zinc removal rate is 97% or more, and 99%- and higher-purity zinc is recovered efficiently. The new method helps to lower costs because only small amounts of pig iron need to be mixed in.
