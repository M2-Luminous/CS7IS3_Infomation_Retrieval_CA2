FBIS4-54748 "dreeu086_d_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-086 Daily Report 2 May 1994 SLOVAKIA SDL's Weiss on Disagreement With Minister SDL's Weiss on Disagreement With Minister AU0305133694 Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 2 May 94 p 5 AU0305133694 Bratislava PRAVDA Slovak BFN [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left, by Stefan Hrcka; place and date not given: "Discrimination in Privatization?"] [Excerpts] At a meeting of the right-wing club in Zvolen on 27 April, Milan Janicina (National Democratic Party-New Alternative), minister for the administration and privatization of national property, said that privatization by means of so-called employee stock ownership would be applied only rarely. We asked Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], whether this view is shared by the whole coalition. [Weiss] I was surprised by this statement of the minister for the administration and privatization of national property, not because privatization by means of employee stock ownership is in the SDL's program but because the equality of all privatization methods is explicitly mentioned in the recent Policy Statement of the Slovak Government, which is the joint work of all coalition partners. This means that no method will be preferred or, on the other hand, suppressed. I also want to stress that the equality of privatization methods and procedures is also laid down in the valid law on large-scale privatization. [passage omitted] I would like to add that a number of decisions involving the privatization process belongs to the jurisdiction of the government as a whole and not just to that of individual ministers and ministries. [Hrcka] In other words, no decision on excluding employee stock ownership from privatization has been made, and no discussion of this issue has taken place in the government coalition? [Weiss] There has been no such decision. This is the personal view of the minister for the administration and privatization of national property. There are discussions in the government about the concept of privatization. This concept should be drawn up in cooperation between the Ministry for the Administration and Privatization of National Property and branch ministries. At any rate, the SDL will be pushing in the government for the equality of individual privatization methods. We will oppose administrative decisions made in advance, without an analysis of the situation of individual enterprises earmarked for privatization and without an evaluation of the quality of individual privatization projects, determining how many billions worth of property will be privatized by this or that method and, above all, decisions made in advance about which contenders or methods have better or poorer chances of being successful. After all, this is exactly what we criticized about the previous government.
