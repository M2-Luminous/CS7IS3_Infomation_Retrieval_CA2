Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. For further information on these submissions contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632&hyph;0276. Persons wishing to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, room 3235 NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;3561. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0466. Title: Section 74.1283, Station identification. Action: Extension of currently approved collection. Respondents: Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 200 responses; .166 hour average burden per response; 33 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: Section 74.1283(c)(1) requires an FM translator station whose station identification is made by the primary station to furnish current information of the translator's call letters and location (name, address and telephone number). This information is to be kept in the primary station's files. The information is used by the primary station licensee and/or FCC staff in field investigations to contact the translator licensee in the event of malfunction of the translator. OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0473. Title: Section 74.1251, Technical and equipment modifications. Action: Extension of a currently approved collection. Respondents: Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 75 responses; .25 hour average burden per response; 19 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: Upon the installation or modification of transmitting equipment for which prior FCC authority is not required under the provisions of ยง74.1251(b)(1) the licensee shall place in the station records a certification that the new installation complies in all respects with the technical requirements of this part and the terms of the station authorization. Section 74.1251(c) requires FM translator licensees to notify the FCC, in writing, of changes in the primary FM station being retransmitted. The certification of the new installation is used by licensees to provide prospective users of the modified equipment with necessary information. If no such information exists, any future problems could provide difficult to solve and could result in electronic frequency interference for long periods of time. The notification of changes in the primary FM being retransmitted is used by FCC staff to keep records up-to-date and to ensure compliance with FCC rules and regulations. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2753 Filed 2&hyph;7&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
