The task force, headed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, will hold its first meeting on Thursday evening to discuss possible agenda items and a timetable for its activities, the top government spokesman told a news conference. The establishment of a government team on employment is the first since 1986 under the administration of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, when the nation was smarting from a sharp appreciation of the Japanese yen against the dollar. The task force comprises all cabinet ministers except for the justice minister. Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was appointed acting head of the body. Deputy heads of the body are Economic Planning Agency Chief Manae Kubota, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi, Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato and Takemura. Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the eight million-strong Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), has been seeking the establishment of a government task force on employment as the nation's job situation is rapidly worsening. Government reports show the ratio of job openings to job seekers fell to a seasonally adjusted 0.65 in November, off 0.02 percentage point from October, while the nation's unemployment rate in the month climbed to a seasonally adjusted 2.8 percent, up 0.1 percentage point.
