A RIA correspondent was told this by Sergey Yerofeyev, director for international links at the All-Russian State Television and Radio Company. He said that in line with existing global practice, a country or a specific television and radio station broadcasting a program within its territory from another state must not only itself accept the expenditure involved, but often also pay considerable money for the right to relay these programs. In the territories of the former Union everything is the other way around. Except for Turkmenistan, Belarus, and certain other CIS countries, which have assumed responsibility for the expenditure involved, the other states are producing uncertainty by their statements that they cannot pay for the reception of Russian television and radio broadcasts.
