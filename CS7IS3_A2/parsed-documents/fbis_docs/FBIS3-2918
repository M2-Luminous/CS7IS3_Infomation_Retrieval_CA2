During this reporter's coverage of the Second Session of the Eighth National CPPCC Committee, the most intensely discussed topic among CPPCC members was participation in the administration and discussion of state affairs. The progression from political consultation to democratic supervision to participation in the administration and discussion of state affairs is unquestionably a new leap in the work of people's political consultation. At 49 discussion venues in seven guesthouses and hotels in the capital city, CPPCC members, citing a multitude of facts, proved the creative work carried out in people's political consultation over the past year, which had resulted in a higher and new level of participation in the administration and discussion of state affairs by CPPCC members. At the secretariat of the session, the reporter leafed through special investigative reports, all of which embodied the painstaking work carried out by CPPCC members. Members of the Economy Committee under the National CPPCC Committee, when discussing their work over the past year, noted: In participating in the administration and discussion of state affairs, CPPCC members should adopt proper viewpoints and correct topics. Since its formation a year ago, the Economy Committee has carried out work in light of some important problems in current economic construction and in reform of the economic structure, producing six special-topic reports which attracted the attention and favorable comments of the party Central Committee, the State Council, and relevant central departments. "Several Proposals for Tightening Macroeconomic Regulation and Control and for Reining in Inflation," made by the Economy Committee last June to deal with problems in the national economy, maintained: Inflation is now in evidence in our country. Central policy-making organs should form clear judgments and adopt forceful measures. The proposals suggested: To rein in inflation, we must restore banking order and strictly enforce fiscal discipline. Only by doing so can we stop the runaway investments in fixed assets and thoroughly dampen the property boom, the craze in building development zones, and the stock market boom. The proposals emphasized: A fundamental solution to economic problems is to allow the market to play a primary role in deploying resources through reform. Moreover, the government must establish an effective system of macroeconomic regulation and control and introduce greater changes to the banking, financial, taxation, and investment systems. After perusal by Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National CPPCC Committee, the proposals were forwarded to the CPC Central Committee's Political Bureau Standing Committee for review, attracting close attention from central leading comrades and relevant departments. Copies of the proposals were printed and distributed to vice premiers and state councilors after central leading comrades had provided written comments on them. They were also forwarded to comrades in charge of the State Planning Commission, the State Economic and Trade Commission, the State Economic Restructuring Commission, the Finance Ministry, and the People's Bank of China for careful study. The relevant departments concurred with the National CPPCC Committee's proposals, saying that they correctly analyzed and judged the current economic situation. Many of the views outlined in the proposals were incorporated into documents issued shortly thereafter by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on tightening macroeconomic regulation and control and on reining in inflation. General Secretary Jiang Zemin, during an informal discussion with non-CPC people last June, specifically talked about the proposals. He said: "The National CPPCC Committee, various democratic parties, and people with no party affiliation are very concerned about the current economic situation and have offered many valuable opinions and useful suggestions for reform, opening up, and economic construction. The party Central Committee and the State Council highly value these opinions and suggestions, have forwarded them to relevant departments for study, and are assimilating and adopting them in their work." Members of the Economy Committee under the National CPPCC Committee, in reviewing work related to people's consultation over the past year, said of their profound understanding: To allow people's consultation to play a genuine role, we should show concern for major state affairs, keep overall interests in mind, adopt proper viewpoints and correct topics in light of our own special conditions, and build on our advantages. Members who took part in the Economy Committee's investigations said that the reason their proposals were valued and adopted by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council was because they drew on the collective wisdom of members and offered sound opinions and suggestions for solving the most pressing problems in the current stage of national economic development. Almost all members of the 15 committees under the National CPPCC Committee shared the feelings of their counterparts on the Economy Committee. Members of the Women and Youth Committee, in discussing last year's special investigations, maintained: The establishment of a sound socialist market economic structure will surely lead to greatly expanded services for women, youth, and children, as well as some new circumstances and problems. The focus of the Women and Youth Committee's work in the period ahead is to conduct investigations and study with regard to certain salient problems and to offer feasible countermeasures and proposals. Last November, members of the Women and Youth Committee conducted investigations in Guangdong and Fujian to ascertain the conditions of female and young workers in "partly or wholly foreign-owned" enterprises in open coastal areas. During their investigations, the members were given to understand that some "partly or wholly foreign-owned" enterprises did not pay due attention to the rights and interests of their workers and staff members; that there were some problems regarding the employment of workers, work hours, and the protection of workers and staff members' dignity; and that some of those problems were quite serious. To this end, the members made four proposals for protecting the legitimate rights and interests of workers and staff members in "partly or wholly foreign-owned" enterprises, compiling them into a special-topic investigative report. The report drew the attention of leading comrades at the State Council and was very well received by leading party and government departments in coastal areas who thought that the Women and Youth Committee had addressed a currently important problem demanding prompt solution. Mindful of the widening gap in the levels of development between minority regions and developed coastal areas, the yet-to-be-solved problem of poverty in some areas, and the host of new problems in the course of building a socialist market economy, the Nationalities Committee under the National CPPCC Committee sent two investigative teams last August to Sichuan and Guizhou to investigate issues pertaining to poverty relief efforts and economic development, producing three investigative reports that served as very useful references. After reading the reports, State Councilor Luo Gan convened a special meeting of comrades in charge of relevant departments to hear briefings by comrades on the investigative teams. Luo Gan fully affirmed their investigative work, suggesting that the Nationalities Committee's proposals be incorporated into the report being drafted by the State Nationalities Affairs Commission on behalf of the central authorities. Comrades from the the CPC Central Committee's United Front Work Department and Policy Research Office, after reading the reports, said that the reports were of great value and that they were studying the problems reflected in the reports. When discussing their understanding during the session, CPPCC members who had conducted the investigations focused on this topic: One of the important things to do in participating in the administration and discussion of state affairs is to conduct special investigations and study, which should be in-depth, oriented toward practical results, and designed to aid practical work. According to statistics compiled by the National CPPCC Committee's General Office, the various special committees under the National CPPCC Committee have, over the past year, conducted special investigations and study on some important issues concerning the two civilizations and united front work, producing 24 investigative reports. The views outlined in many of those reports have attracted the attention of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the departments and localities concerned, and quite a few opinions have been adopted. It has become the keynote of the new term of the National CPPCC Committee to guide participation in the administration and discussion of state affairs by promoting awareness about reform and opening up, and to encourage such participation by harnessing the CPPCC's unique characteristics and advantages so as to adapt participation in the administration and discussion of state affairs at high levels to the need for establishing a socialist market economic structure. During the current session, CPPCC members noted: From now on, we will participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs while bearing in mind the central task of the party and the state; improve practical results; harness the advantages of the CPPCC's intellectual pool, information sources, and broad channels at both higher and lower levels, so as to actively promote socialist modernization.
