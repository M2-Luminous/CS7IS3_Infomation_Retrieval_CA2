According to the document, the presidential election will be held based on the general, equal, and direct electoral law in the form of a secret ballot. If this provision is approved by the Supreme Soviet, the election will be closed to citizens found incapable by a court decision as well as citizens who are incarcerated or held in custody. The draft also says that only Belarusian citizens over 35 years of age are eligible to vote, and only those who have lived in the Republic for at least 10 years can be elected. The president's term of office would last five years. At the same time, the same person cannot be elected for more than two terms. According to the document, candidacies for the Belarusian president will be put forward by at least 70 legislative deputies as well as by Belarusian citizens, who must collect at least 100,000 signatures of the electors. All expenses connected with the organization of the election are covered by the state budget. The commission for state building suggested that the submission of presidential candidates should start in 75 days. The Central Electoral Commission has to register an initiative group in charge of collecting signatures for presidential candidates within five days. Lists of the signatures are to be submitted to rayon, city, or city district electoral commissions at least 55 days before the election. So, simple calculation shows that the legislative commission considers two weeks or so a sufficient time for collecting 100,000 signatures from citizens.
