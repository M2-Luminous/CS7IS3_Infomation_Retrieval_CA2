Embraer's commercial manager Paulo Cury said the prototype is based on the standard Tucano EMB-312 plane. The current Super-Tucano configuration [as published] was initially developed to meet the specifications of the U.S. competitor JPATS (English acronym for Primary Aircraft Training System). Cury said Embraer has already completed the blueprint of the plane, which was ordered by the Aeronautics Ministry, and is now preparing the technical and commercial specification prior to the construction of 50 to 70 planes. The program will last 5 years and the planes will be supplied to the Brazilian Air Force (FAB). Cury said the new Super-Tucanos will replace the Xavante plane. The new configuration of the Super-Tucano, which is built for primary training purposes, will incorporate advanced training features and a weapons system based on machine guns, an air to ground system, and rockets. Cury stated that the Aeronautics Ministry wants to use the new plane for border control and interdiction within the Amazon Control System (Sivam). The Super- Tucano is a stretch version of the basic Tucano and has a more powerful engine -- 750 horsepower. The Aeronautics Ministry has already created a work group to draft the technical and commercial aspects of the new plane, which has been designated the ALX. Cury added: "By the end of March we will have the bid document ready." He could not give an estimate of the investment required for the ALX program. He indicated that an export version of the Super-Tucano will cost $3.8 million. Negotiations with the Aeronautics Ministry for the development of a plane with new specifications began in 1989 with the engineering aspect. The formulization of the agreement with the ministry came during the second half of 1993. The program is currently defining the basic operational demands, work schedule, and the drafting of an estimate of the resources to be disbursed.
