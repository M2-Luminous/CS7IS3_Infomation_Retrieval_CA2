Someone of the journalists waiting on the air field for the plane carrying the U.S. President pointed this out to a guard--let your bosses know. The guard replied irritably: There is a special person responsible for the flag. And, lo and behold--the man "in charge" soon appeared, and the flag was fixed. All of this reminded me very much the situation of our state, which has become "entangled" in a multitude of economic, political, and other problems. Except that we are still waiting for the man "in charge" to fix the situation. It does appear, however, that an attempt was made that evening in Borispol to deal with one of the most burning issues of modern times--nuclear disarmament. President Clinton, for instance, quite justifiably lists it among the problems that came into existence because of the end of the cold war. This knot has been tightened even more lately. In your opinion, what is the image of the Ukrainian people in the eyes of the ordinary man in the West? Undoubtedly they are seen as aggressive, trouble-making, and with double standards. This is not surprising. Over the past few years people in the West have heard about Ukraine almost exclusively in connection with two conflict situations: nuclear weapons and the Black Sea Fleet. The West does have reason to be jittery. After all, Ukraine has in its possession no less than the third mightiest nuclear arsenal in the world. It is obvious why the American President's statement that those 176 missiles and about 1,500 warheads will be eliminated on our soil became a sensation: These missiles were not aimed at nothing--they were aimed at the United States. Russia conducted its propaganda quite successfully by playing up this factor. Still, the greatest contribution to creating this negative image of Ukrainians in the world was... our own doing. A Ministry of Defense officer of my acquaintance, who is closely involved in nuclear armaments issues, once remarked bitterly: "These days every politico wants to play the nuclear card." This was quite noticeable when our independent state was making its first steps. At that time, unfortunately, Ukraine's foreign policy was being generated not by MFA ((Ministry of Foreign Affairs] professionals but by parliament members not versed at all in serious policy matters, let alone military ones. Having crowed to the entire world that Ukraine would not join any bloc and would maintain nonnuclear status, they counted on "compensations, subsidies, and investment" flowing to us in a steady stream. This did not happen, though. And then our state machinery began to hurriedly put itself into reverse. The "doves" in the Supreme Council simply could not comprehend that Ukraine's nuclear complex could not be severed from the rest of it (within the borders of the former USSR) overnight. This extremely complex organism could be restructured only gradually, and even then only on the condition of goodwill on the part of Russia. We all remember well that everything was developing in exactly the opposite way. As for us, we simply did not have our own foreign policy--it was all essentially a "response" to Russia's actions. And the United States, too, took a very uncompromising position. Initially it offered a laughable amount in compensation--$127,000, and proposed as a compromise solution to temporarily store missiles on the territory of Ukraine under international supervision (very attractive at first glance, except that it is well known that where international supervision begins, the real rights of a "supervised" state end). The terms Clinton is proposing now look quite different. For the first time the United States has shown a serious interest in Ukraine. This is especially underlined by Clinton's visit to Kiev, which is absolutely meaningless from the business point of view--what can be possibly discussed in two hours? Eduard Lisitsin, a researcher with the Institute of World Economics and International Relations [IMEMO] of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, described the positive points of potential trilateral agreements: --Russia finally agreed to compensate Ukraine for the losses incurred by having its tactical nuclear missiles taken out. We will be given substantial economic aid. We were promised guarantees of security. There is hope that the world will finally understand Ukraine and its problems. The situation in the economy and the military-industrial complex will relax; military reform will begin. ...Let us stop and think, however: Do our people really crave to get rid of nuclear weapons? Obviously not. On the other hand, public opinion may change--depending on the results of agreements. Besides, if there are no results, the world community will simply come to the conclusion that the strong United States simply "overpowered" Ukraine (were L. Kravchuk's rather unusual and somewhat confused behavior at the press conference, his pale face and forced smile not signs of precisely such pressure?) In Lisitsin's opinion, by emphasizing the special role of the Ukrainian president, Clinton unwittingly drove a wedge between Kravchuk and the Supreme Council. The decisions that may be adopted at the meeting in Moscow are capable of aggravating the situation and leading to a crisis of presidential power or, vice versa, to hard pressure on the parliament. Neither is needed now. Joint efforts of both branches of power are needed (if this is at all possible) to restore the economy destroyed by incompetent bureaucrats and shamelessly pilfered by embezzlers. I think it is appropriate to recall here the thesis of the American President, who especially emphasized that in the 21st century the best guarantee of a state's security will be its economic might. Let me also quote L. Kravchuk, who once uttered a sacred truth: "A state may maintain only the kind of an army, the kind of armed forces, that its economy permits." This probably also is a strong argument for nuclear disarmament. Having to choose one of the two--guns or butter--we should probably choose the latter. Although perhaps everything would be different had Ukraine been capable of formulating and skillfully implementing a farsighted foreign policy. This was not to be, however. Sergey Vlasov, chief of the Europe department at the Ukrainian IMEMO, believes: "Stronger states, such as the United States and Russia, have formulated this policy for us. To make us accept it they used a carrot-and-stick policy, where Russian played the stick and the United States the carrot." Does this mean that these countries are indeed those "in charge of the flag," who are taking our state ship out of the political dead end? And something else. Having declared our own independence a bargaining item (and there is no other way to describe the situation of backtracking from a pacifist course to flexing nuclear muscles), we ourselves showed to the world how much we "value" this independence. I think that in the near future the real meaning of the notion "Ukrainian independence" will shrink like shagreen leather. We will find ourselves tightly tied to one of the poles of the United States--Russia axis. Most likely the latter. But this is a subject for separate contemplation.
