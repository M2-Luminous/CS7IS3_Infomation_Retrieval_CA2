The statement said that "considering the fact of the arrival in Baku of the personal envoy of the Russian president, (Vladimir) Kazimirov, and Deputy Defence Minister (Georgiy) Kondratyev, as well as taking into account the ceasefire agreement in effect since March 1, the leadership of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces has issued an order to all units on the front line to cease fire and ignore provocations." However, in the first few hours of ceasefire Azerbaijani positions came under intensive artillery shelling which also continued on March 2. "Today large forces of the Armenian Army launched a large-scale offensive supported by armoured vehicles in the southwest of the republic. This jeopardises Russia's mediating efforts," the statement said.
