Twenty people's deputies who had expressed their proposals with regard to the three blocks of basic problems, took part in discussing the agenda. Parliamentary chairman Ivan Plyushch included the issue of the economy and the budget, the fight against corruption and abuse, the payment of pensions, and raising salaries for workers in education whose representatives picketed the Supreme Council this morning, in the first block. The second block consists of issues connected to the elections in the Crimean Republic. Three hundred and four deputies voted to submit the additions to point 7-2 of article 114-5 of Ukraine's constitution, according to which the president of Ukraine would be given the right to repeal "acts of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, ministerial acts, and acts of other central bodies of Ukraine's state executive power as well as acts of the central bodies of power of the Republic of Crimea in the event of their incompatibility with the constitution and laws of Ukraine and decrees of Ukraine's president." From the third block of issues, concerning nuclear disarmament, parliamentary standing commissions on foreign affairs, defense, and security, and on legislation and legality are to prepare, by 25 January, a resolution on the compatibility of the trilateral statement by the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. presidents with the earlier adopted parliamentary resolution on the ratification of the START I Treaty. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ukraine's security service have been charged with preparing information on the course of the investigation into the affair of the attack on the Rukh secretariat and the disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, Rukh's head of secretariat. A report of the special deputies' commission concerning the activity of the leadership of the "Blasko-Black Sea Fleet concern" will be heard on 26 January A Supreme Council resolution on the renewal of direct radio broadcasts of plenary sittings and presentations in the form of reports on TV, was adopted. Deputies heard a report from Ukraine's first deputy minister of the economy, Valentyn Popov, on the plan of the economic and social development for 1994. The speaker gave several indices that characterized the state of the economy: national income fell by 15 percent compared to 1992; social labor productivity fell by 13 percent; the decline of industrial production is 7.4 percent of last year's level and it took place in more than half of industrial enterprises. Last year 16 percent fewer consumer goods were manufactured, including foodstuffs (9.4 percent fewer) and emission amounted to 12.3 trillion karbovantsi. Among the plan's basic directions are structural changes in the economy on the basis of state priorities, the attraction of investments from all kinds of sources, and the creation, on the basis of state ownership, of economic subjects that are fully responsible for the consequences of their activity. The Cabinet of Ministers is counting on an increase in the rate of the karbovanets to 16,000 karbovantsi to the U.S. dollar, maintaining prices for coal throughout the year at the level of the first quarter of 1994 and an increase in the population's money incomes by 5.1 times at a price of 4.45 times. In the words of Valentyn Popov, these indices could be achieved by conducting a tough credit policy, introducing more flexible mechanisms of regulating the consumer fund, developing the process of clearing up enterprises' finances [sanatsiya pidpryyemstv], privatizing small and medium size enterprises, incorporation [korporatyzatsiya] of large enterprises, and increasing control over prices at all levels.
