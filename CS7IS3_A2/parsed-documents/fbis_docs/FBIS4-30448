The sum, which would be proposed during the coming annual summit, would partly finance a plan to solidify safety shields of the exploded reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the official said. The remainder would be used to remodel several other reactors currently under construction in the former Soviet republic, the official said, noting that these reactors, basically identical in design to the exploded reactor, must be reconstructed with Western technology. France and Germany recently proposed the aid program. In April 1986, one of four reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded, resulting in the worst nuclear accident in history. Of the three reactors left, two are still in operation, causing global concern over a possible repeat of the Chernobyl disaster. During the Naples summit in July, the G-7 nations are expected to press for closure of the two reactors, which Ukraine claims are necessary as major power sources for the economically ailing country, the government official said.
