UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata has delayed a visit to the former Yugoslavia planned for this week because of current tensions, Sylvana Foa said. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said last Wednesday that all heavy weapons should be withdrawn from around Sarajevo or handed over to UN control within 10 days, or they would be bombed. "We are not sending non-essential personnel to areas where there could be problems (...) but all essential personnel remain in place," said Foa. Asked about their safety in the case of a possible NATO airstrike, she said there were "contingency plans for every situation, but we feel rather comfortable" about it at the moment. However the UNHCR was worried about the situation in Mostar, in southern Bosnia, where Croatian shelling has claimed many victims, she added. Aid convoys to east Mostar, under Moslem control, had been blocked by snow which made it hard to detect landmines. "Incessant" bombing by Bosnian Croats had caused 37 deaths and 130 injuries in the first five days of February. "Fifty thousand people in East Mostar are living literally like rats in cellars, without water, electricity or sanitation," said Foa. In west Mostar, at a psychiatric hospital, around 100 patients were caught in crossfire between the two camps. Despite local authority promises, it was still proving impossible to move these patients to another site in a Croat-controlled zone, she said. The Moslem enclave of Bihac in western Bosnia was another black spot, the target of heavy Serb bombing since February 6 which had caused at least six deaths and 100 injuries in its first few days. This offensive disrupted the distribution of food aid to the region, which had been effective until now, and the UNCHR feared "large movements of displaced persons" as a result, the spokeswoman said.
