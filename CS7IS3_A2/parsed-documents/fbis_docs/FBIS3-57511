A.V. Rutskoy's Name Defended in `Trust Case'"] [Excerpts] A brief report that Moscow City Prosecutor's Office passed a decree dropping the criminal case, brought on the basis of Russian Federation Security Council material, concerning former Vice President A.V. Rutskoy's involvement in financial transactions of the foreign firm Trade Links Ltd. and in its account at Zurich's Indosuez Bank was glimpsed fleetingly on the air and seemingly vanished forever in the zone of silence. The reason is understandable. On the one hand it was awkward for journalist colleagues to refute their own recent pages-long "exposes" of Aleksandr Vladimirovich's involvement in certain alleged dealings with the firm's Swiss accounts. After weak and unconvincing attempts to "catch" Rutskoy constructing his own dacha, hints at his links with foreign currency accounts abroad seemed a much bigger scoop. The propaganda machine worked without respite during the August days. From the very first salvoes of this attack it became clear that the battle against the vice president was being waged by a force much more powerful and influential than simple reporter's curiosity. Rutskoy "came under fire" from not only the president's apparatus but also the very highest echelons of behind-the-scenes world power. [passage omitted] On the basis of all the material obtained the prosecutor's office deemed it necessary to drop the case against Rutskoy. Rutskoy is now a prisoner at Lefortovo. Everything associated with his name in the month to six weeks before the tragic events is now apparently no longer of any great importance. But this seems so only to people like Makarov [former chief of the administration for supporting the commission for combating crime and corruption]. The Moscow City Prosecutor's Office decree says reassuringly: The name of Aleksandr Vladimirovich Rutskoy has been defended, albeit with a tragic delay. While the criminal case brought on the basis of Russian Federation Security Council material has, quite naturally and normally from both the moral and legal points of view, provided grounds for bringing another criminal case -- for libeling the former vice president under Section 3, Article 130 of the RSFSR Criminal Code.
