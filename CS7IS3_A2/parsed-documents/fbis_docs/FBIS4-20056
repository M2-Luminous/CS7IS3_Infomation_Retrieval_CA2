Umberto Bossi [Northern League leader] returned immediately to Milan to inaugurate the League's "managerial school." Before giving the first "lesson" he sent a strong political message yesterday that is destined to weigh heavily in the battle over the division of seats in the government. "First," he said, "comes a stable government, then federalism." This is how he reached the crossroads. [Brambilla] Senator Bossi, what did you say to the president of the republic? [Bossi] That we agree with Berlusconi being given the task because there is no way out, but we also highlighted the risks entailed by a decision of this kind. A person like him, who heads a strong economic empire, could find himself in an awkward situation daily, with all his personal and private interests, nothwithstanding his willingness and his capabilitites. Especially in view of the lack of specific laws concerning checks and balances. In addition, the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] has untried political forces behind him and thus he finds himself in an almost autocratic situation. [Brambilla] What was Scalfaro's reply? [Bossi] He seemed very receptive. The president has demonstrated that he is well aware of the risks involved. Especially because, I repeat, in Italy there is no form of "blind trust" and no law of guaranty. [Brambilla] The countdown has started. How do you intend bringing the League into the government? [Bossi] The battle begins on Wednesday.... We want controlling positions to ensure that democracy does not fall apart. This means that we will ask for important ministries. [Brambilla] Roberto Maroni as deputy prime minister is not enough? [Bossi] No, he is not enough. It would only be a small step. The problem of the ministries remains, especially the Interior Ministry: That must go to the League. If it were to go to somebody from Forza Italia that would be like assigning the task pro tempore to Berlusconi. [Brambilla] Your request for the Interior Ministry has been noted. In the past few days you have made it clear that would you like to control four ministries overall and, in addition, coordinate the agricultural sector. Could this be the list: Interior Ministry, Treasury, Industry Ministry, plus one more? Is this right? [Bossi] More or less.... [Brambilla] Is the last one unknown? There is talk of Post and Telecommunications.... [Bossi] I am only saying that it will be a big surprise. [Brambilla] A lot of names are being circulated.... [Bossi] There has been no talk of names to date. However I think that the ministers should all have one characteristic: If possible, they must be politicians from the majority political parties and not tied to the old regime. Now is not the time for technocrats, who would inevitably receive their input from Berlusconi. [Brambilla] What about [Radical leader] Marco Pannella? [Bossi] The Pannella problem does not exist because he will have no job. [Brambilla] What about the rumors regarding [Police Chief] Parisi? [Bossi] This story about the police chief is not clear to me. I do not understand.... [Brambilla] Will Dini [Bank of Italy Director General] also find access to the Treasury blocked? [Bossi] I repeat: We are against technocrats.... [Brambilla] What fundamental role will the League play in the government? [Bossi] With their votes the people stated that they wanted a stable government and we must guarantee this. After an overdose of instability for years, the citizens decided that a stable government is for the good of all, a good that surpasses any other possible type of change proposed, including federalism. This is a paradox because we got this far precisely in order to change... [Brambilla] Federalism can wait then? [Bossi] For the moment the League will join the government.... After that, the day after, months after, some time after, when the League has shown that it is a force in government, all the old values of change, like federalism, will reemerge and they will finally become a common heritage.
