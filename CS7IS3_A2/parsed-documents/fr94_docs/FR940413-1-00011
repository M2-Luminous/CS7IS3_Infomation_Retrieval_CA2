FR940413-1-00011 FR940413-1-00004 Proposed Amendments to 10 CFR Part 50 The petitioner proposed that in ยง50.54, paragraph (t) be revised to read as follows: ยง50.54 Conditions of licenses. * * * * * (t) A nuclear power reactor licensee shall provide for the development, revision, implementation, and maintenance of its emergency preparedness program. To this end, the licensee shall provide for a review of its emergency preparedness program nominally every 24 months by persons who have no direct responsibility for implementation of the emergency preparedness program. The review shall include an evaluation for adequacy of interfaces with State and local governments and of licensee drills, exercises, capabilities, and procedures. The results of the review, along with recommendations for improvements, shall be documented, reported to the licensee's corporate and plant management, and retained for a period of five years. The part of the review involving the evaluation for adequacy of interface with State and local governments shall be available to the appropriate State and local governments. * * * * * Conclusion The petitioner states that the existing rule is not necessary to ensure an adequate emergency preparedness program. It provides an overview to direct management attention and resources to observed performance deficiencies. The petitioner indicates that the proposed rule would continue to require an adequate minimum provision for program overview based on existing industry performance. Therefore, the petitioner believes that annual audits are no longer commensurate with the benefit gained based on the commendable performance by the industry in this area. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 7th day of April 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. John C. Hoyle, Assistant Secretary of the Commission.
