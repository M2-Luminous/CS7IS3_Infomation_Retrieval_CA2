As a result, there are about 70 places contaminated with radioactive substances on the premises of Moscow's enterprises and even in the vicinity of apartment blocks, the Moscow Environmental Protection Committee told Interfax. Almost all of them have been eliminated by now, except 18 storages of low-radioactive waste in Krylatskoye, Lyublino, Strogino and some other districts. The Moscow Environmental Protection Committee believes that as such these sites pose no threat to the population. But before building housing on them decontamination measures must be taken. The decontamination of one of such site, 26 kilometers from Moscow, is being completed. The same source reports that there are more than 1,500 enterprises and organizations in Moscow which use nuclear reactors, radioactive materials and products. The worst danger is coming from 769 enterprises which create radioactive waste. In 1993, radiation control inspectors revealed 288 instances of violation of safety rules. The Moscow Environmental Protection Committee announced that on the whole, Moscow's radiation level is light and measures 7 to 14 microroentgen per hour.
