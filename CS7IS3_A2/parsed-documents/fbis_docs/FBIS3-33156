This fact is taken as a basis for the peace agreement. Considering "the people's war to be the greatest social revolutionary movement in Peruvian history...." and "the strong point, the most developed in the democratic path....," it describes clearly how difficult it will be for those defending true democratic interest to reach a peace agreement when faced with this SL fundamentalism. The greatest majority of Peruvians want peace and an end to the attacks, the blackouts, and the car bombs. We would also like an end to the cases of disappeared prisoners and a reduction of the number of provinces in a state of emergency so that we can gradually return to our normal lives and to the full state of law throughout the land. We would like to see differences among Peruvians on the grave problems afflicting the country resolved through democratic mechanisms. This and nothing else was the lesson derived from the 1976-78 struggle that allowed us to recover our democracy and to end 12 years of military government. Even the 5 April self-imposed coup, the legitimacy of which will be decided by history, had to withdraw some of its initial objectives and allow CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] and municipal elections. The authoritarian characteristics of the present government, which were useful for the initial coupist project, are today increasingly isolating the government from the masses. If the wearing effect is still slow to affect this government it is only because of the mistakes made by those who from government positions ransacked democracy or as a result of errors by those who from radical and alarmist opposition positions showed a resounding lack of loyalty. The start of the SL armed struggle was, undoubtedly, a growing destabilizing factor that affected our democratic achievements. If we look at the 13 years of internal warfare in hindsight we will not only see the dead, injured, and maimed; damage to the Peruvian economy, displaced persons, the culture of violence, and the arming of peasants; we will also see the overall weakening of democracy, the growing military presence, and, particularly, the disintegration of people's movements and the crisis of those who wanted to assume their political representation. It is clear, then, that the so-called SL people's war has not served to establish any democratic path. On the contrary, it has served directly or as a pretext -- together with other factors -- to advance toward more authoritarian positions. In fact, Abimael's boast that he had given "harsh blows" to the three mountains -- feudalism, imperialism (including the "social- imperialism" of the USSR), and bureaucratic capitalism -- does not stand any analysis. This is because, first, the large landowners of the semi-feudal era had already been virtually eliminated as a result of the agrarian reform of [Juan Velasco] Alvarado by the time he started his war. Second, the Unites States, as we all know, enjoys good health and it has consolidated its position as a world hegemonic power. The disintegration of the USSR can be explained in many ways, but it would be preposterous to link it to any SL or MRI [Internationalist Revolutionary Movement] actions. Now, and because of the importance Abimael grants it, let us analyze the "harsh blows" by the SL to the so-called "bureaucratic capitalism." As we all know, Mao referred to a capitalism that was linked to feudal large landowners' interests in the China of the 1930's and which joined forces with the imperialist interests of the time to monopolize state powers and were politically represented by the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek. Mao identified four large families that directly benefited from this Chinese bureaucratic capitalism. It seems that, at the beginning of the 1970's, Abimael fell in love with the term and in an anti-Marxist way defined it the way he saw fit in order to continue to defend the characterization of Peruvian society as "semi-feudal" and justify its peasant war strategy. Therefore, all objective discussion on industrial progress, the growth of cities, the relative decrease of the importance of agriculture in the country's overall economic and political structure were for him nothing but the confirmation of the semi-feudal character of the country and our developing capitalism was only consolidating this semi-feudal system. It is not clear if the murders and pillages perpetrated against small retailers who live on the mountains, against private agricultural companies, and against SAIS's [Social Interest Agricultural Association] in the countryside, are the harsh blows dealt to the "bureaucratic capitalism." Perhaps, Guzman is referring to the dynamite attacks on bank branches and the burning of some industrial facilities in Lima. If he alluded to the former, the result of his action only served to deepen the agricultural crisis that batters the country and to increase our dependence on foreign foodstuffs; in other words, to favor agricultural producers from "imperialist" countries. If he referred to the dynamite attacks, his action was instrumental in helping insurance companies and leading security companies -- established precisely through "bureaucratic capitalism" -- to increase their profits. If he intended to "dismantle" government investments in the economy, in fact by blowing up nearly 2,000 high-tension towers he merely managed to leave many little villages without electricity and to facilitate pretexts for laying off staff from large companies which were affected by the crisis and which lost less money by being closed down than by producing. The bulk of these losses were passed on to users by hiking the price of electricity rates and reducing -- or at best by freezing -- workers' salaries and wages. In fact, a better and more efficient dismantling of the state economy occurred during the current administration, from which not even the National Bank seems to escape. The consolidation of a true bureaucratic bourgeoisie is also under way by all those who, with or without debt notes, stand to gain with the so-called privatization process. Notwithstanding this, by "applying the ideas of MLM [Marx, Lenin, and Mao] in a creative way, and specifically the PG [Thoughts of Gonzalo, that is Guzman's Plan]," we might venture to suggest that the SL's greatest contribution has been to the drug trafficking business. The "novelty" of all this has been the attempt to displace hirelings, mafias, and small "firms." Initial efforts were rapidly absorbed by powerful foreign and domestic interests that capitalized on the terrorists presence to consolidate a new hegemony that considered the interests of representatives of the different armed powers present in the region. Following a brief encounter, the "firms" decided that SL members who had settled in areas under the control of traffickers would handle the stocking and transportation of up to 50 kg of "cocaine paste." Other, more powerful individuals, receive "orders" under the protection of the SL for consignments of 400 or 500 kg and guarantee its transport to the airstrips where Colombian light aircraft land and take off. Even though it is not explicitly mentioned in the document -- possibly due to the context in which it was written, with his captors present and the need to use a "diplomatic language" given the present circumstances -- it does not refer to the "harsh blows" dealt to the Armed Forces, which were hitherto considered as the main stanchion of the three mountains. Neither does it refer to "the generals specialized in defeat," as he did in previous documents when, using an impassioned language, he deceived his followers into believing that an SL victory was imminent. During the 11 years the Armed Forces have combated terrorist subversion, they had a little more than 800 casualties -- merely 0.7 percent of their personnel. Losses suffered by the PNP [Peruvian National Police] during subversive actions total 1,500 -- nearly 1.3 percent of its personnel. If we look at the situation that faced the Armed Forces in relation with society and the state in general before they engaged in the fight against terrorism, we can see that the situation has greatly improved. Deployment throughout the interior has been stepped up as have the advantages they achieved in the emergency areas and in the Military Political Commands are countless. They also played a decisive role by taking on in the true ruling of the country -- if we leave aside all euphemisms. Abimael Guzman is right when he says there has been a centralization of power, which in turn has strengthened the conditions ("formed the basis" in SL jargon) for the "successful development of a bureaucratic capitalism." Guzman believes a long- term project and a government to "manage it and implement it" have become a state "need" (and therefore, there is nothing we can do but accept it). He is completely mistaken on this point. The need to maintain the current correlation between military commands and Fujimori's reelection may surely be urgent for some, but not for the entire Peruvian society. Cynically, he notes that the people advocate peace and answers that "he realizes the need...." The truth is that for a long time his so-called people's war has been rejected and caused resentment among the absolute majority of the population. What does he want? Did the cowardly murderers of Maria Elena Moyano, of the children of the Ashaninka Indians whose throats were sliced, or the car-bomb in Tarata create support for his fundamentalist craziness and his interminable desire for power? About 1,300 mayors and councilmen -- including candidates for those positions -- thousands of humble peasants, lieutenant governors, and community leaders as well as hundreds of teachers, and district and union leaders have been murdered in a cowardly manner; some of them out of rage, by SL detachments who put into practice the "Great Military Plan" meticulously prepared in Guzman's morbid mind. Thousands of youngsters who became fanatics through the "thoughts of President Gonzalo" were tortured, killed or are missing. Many others were killed in clashes with the police. Undoubtedly, also thousands of innocent individuals were jailed, are missing, or were shot in their heads and buried in clandestine graves. But don't let that lead to confusion. We do not want to put at the same level the action of terrorism and the violation of human rights by the Armed Forces. The spark that started the fire was purposely programmed by Guzman. His objective was to set the meadows on fire. For a long time the Armed Forces, in their effort to put out the fire, made the mistake of throwing fuel instead of water. Everything that has happened cannot be erased with a simple change of language which is now called "diplomatic." The fact that now Guzman uses the phrase "Mr. President Alberto Fujimori" instead of "sly hotshot who acts as president" does not change in the least the past events and the responsibilities of having shed blood in our fatherland. In the document, Abimael does not rule out a people's war. Curiously enough, he points out that six or seven years are required to resolve the problems of today's world and, we would add, today's Peru. In a nutshell, Abimael is proposing to suspend his armed actions until the second Fujimori administration ends. Abimael wants "to form close links with the masses" and fight his foes through a hatred based on class differences. If we consider Abimael's proposal for "objective convergence" with the current Armed Forces echelons, and the acceptance of the Fujimori administration for "historical needs," against whatever -- or whomever -- the neo-SL people fight in their effort to get close to the masses? Abimael boasts that his followers have always been "politically strong." In a party that has fanatic militants who voluntarily express their "physical submission" to "President Gonzalo," and a totalitarian internal structure, it is not hard to imagine the party's effectiveness in the mass struggle. The APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance] people from the time of the buffaloes and truncheons -- the times of the communist workers guard -- will seem like a kindergarten compared to the events in store for us. As Abimael admits in his second letter, and confirms in the document on which we are commenting, the identity of the SL is expressed by the struggle against "revisionism." The SL understands that revisionism basically represents accepting elections as a way to reach power. Therefore, the work with the masses, mentioned by Abimael, does not seek to gain strength for future elections. The goal actually involves fighting the "electioneers" (the traditional parties, especially the legally established left) who are working within the people's organizations. All this considered, we reaffirm our stance that, if there is a transition toward a "war without bloodshed," we will have a sort of semi-legal neo-SL, with a shock apparatus linked to obscure interests in Peruvian politics until they decide to resume "a bloodletting policy." Let's hope we are mistaken!
