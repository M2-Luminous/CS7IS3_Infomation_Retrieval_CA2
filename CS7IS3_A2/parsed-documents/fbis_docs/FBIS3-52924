The officials believe that such joint action should prevent any foreign aggression against any Arab country and that it should guarantee nonintervention in these countries' internal affairs, amend the Arab League charter, and set up an Arab court of justice to settle inter-Arab disputes without foreign intervention. In statements to the MENA correspondent in Baghdad, a number of these officials expressed Iraq's interest in and support for joint Arab action in light of the great challenges facing the Arab nation. They also expressed Iraq's genuine desire to settle inter-Arab disputes because, as they put it, this "will help lift the blockade against Iraq." Ambassador Nabil Najm, Iraq's permanent delegate to the Arab League, said his country has presented its opinions of Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid's paper on Arab reconciliation. He said that, in this way, Iraq has proved its desire for interaction and allowing the opportunity for dialogue and an exchange of views to improve the situation. The Iraqi delegate added: Many of those who talk about Arab reconciliation consider the so-called Gulf crisis to be the primary challenge the Arab nation has faced. They believe that this crisis caused the current situation, while Iraq thinks that perhaps the Gulf crisis was the result or one of the results of the bad situation that had existed before. Ambassador Najm said Iraq believes that anyone who contemplates reconciliation must overlook past conflicts and establish a new groundwork that would enable us to bring about the desired Arab situation. He said that his country is ready to positively and constructively discuss all issues pertaining to Arab reconciliation if there is a serious dialogue to achieve reconciliation on a new, sound basis. He noted that there are many challenges facing the Arab nation and that the reconciliation process should not ignore these challenges, particularly the cultural invasion, the growing military power of the Arab countries' neighbors, the water shortage, and Israel. The Iraqi delegate spoke about the Kuwaiti prisoners issue--a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that many consider the primary cause of Arab nation's division. He said: Iraq does not hold prisoners, but there are cases of people who have been missing since the war. Baghdad already agreed to receive Arab League envoys on the issue and is about to receive another envoy to ensure that all the prisoners have been released. In a statement to MENA's correspondent in Baghdad, Iraqi National Assembly Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih affirmed his country's willingness and sincere desire to work for Arab reconciliation. He added: We hope there will be a distinction between what are called the Kuwaiti prisoners and the issue of the missing people because Iraq does not have any Kuwaiti prisoners. Perhaps there are missing people. He said that Baghdad will welcome any Arab League envoy who wants to investigate the Kuwaiti prisoners issue.
