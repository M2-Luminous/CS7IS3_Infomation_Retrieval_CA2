Therefore, without giving priority to the ideological reeducation of the popular masses, it is impossible to successfully solve manifold difficult and complicated problems in the building of socialism and defend the gains of the revolution from the anti-socialist offensive of the imperialists. NODONG SINMUN today stresses this in an article headlined "Definite Priority to Conquest of Ideological Fortress, Decisive Guarantee for Accomplishment of Socialist Cause." The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is quoted as saying: "If we are to build socialism, we must conquer two fortresses, ideological-political and material. "Of the two, it is particularly important to conquer the ideological-political fortress." The author of the article says: To conquer the ideological fortress means to educate all members of society in revolutionary ideas and assimilating them to the working class and the intelligentsia in order to train them into versatile communists. In order to build socialist society, two fortresses, ideological and material, must be conquered and the conquest of the ideological fortress must be given definite priority. Because it is a primary and decisive condition for the building of socialism. Socialism wins when the popular masses are educated in socialist ideology and united on that basis and it collapses when they are sick ideologically. The superiority of socialism to capitalism is that of ideology and the might of socialism lies in that of ideology. The experience in building socialism in Korea clearly shows that only when definite priority is given to the conquest of the ideological fortress can socialism be built successfully. Our party haspbeen able to successfully build socialism because it has rallied the masses around the party and the leader, always giving definite priority to the ideological revolution. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il propounded the chuche-oriented theory that the ideology of man decides everything and has constantly rendered greater depth to the work of capturing the ideological fortress in keeping with the development of the revolution and construction to a higher stage. Our people firmly defend the bulwark of socialism, foiling the challenges and acts of aggression of the imperialists at every step. Especially, the historical lesson of the deplorable realities of former socialist countries is that the cause of socialism can be accomplished only when the conquest of the ideological fortress is given priority. The main cause of the frustration of socialism in those countries is the neglect of the work for the conquest of the ideological fortress. Socialism won at the cost of blood was frustrated in those countries because socialism lost the powerful motive force for its development and failed to get a solid socio- political foundation. Historical facts show that when a country, even if it is a big power with strong military forces and vast economic potentials, fails to strengthen its driving force and enhance its role by giving definite priority to the ideological revolution in the building of socialism, it cannot withstand the anti-socialist offensive of the imperialists and reactionaries and prevent the frustration of socialism.
