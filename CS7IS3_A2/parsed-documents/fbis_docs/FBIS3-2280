Kooijmans, a professor of international law, is a former UN investigator on human rights in China. His first official contacts were with public prosecutor Zhang Siqing and Zhu Muzhi, chairman of the China Human Rights Society, the Dutch embassy said. Kooijmans is due to lunch with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Tuesday, and will meet Justice Minister Xiao Yang and External Trade Minister Wu Yi. His visit came after several dissidents were arrested by police as part of a massive operation apparently aimed at intimidating opposition groups. According to informed Dutch sources, Kooijmans has expressed a wish to visit Wei Jingsheng -- China's most famous dissident -- during his stay. Wei was interrogated by police for about 30 hours last week and decided Sunday to leave Beijing to "rest for a few days", his press secretary said. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrives in Beijing on Friday for talks with Chinese leaders. Kooijmans' visit will also discuss the planned opening of air links between Beijing and Amsterdam. Since 1983 the Dutch airline KLM has been the only European carrier to fly to Taipei daily under its own colours. As a result, China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, has refused to grant KLM landing rights. Other European airlines, like Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa, opened routes to Taipei last year, but use subsidiary airlines for these operations.
