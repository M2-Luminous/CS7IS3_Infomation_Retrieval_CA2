Throughout the night combat activities were considerably stepped up in the northern and southwestern sections of the front where Muslim forces pounded Rajlovac, Ilidza, Hadzici, and Nedzarici with artillery weapons, among others. Positions of the Vogosca operative group of the army of the Serb republic were pounded with antitank grenades and 82-mm mortar shells from the direction of the Muslim strongholds at Sokolj and the city's main waste disposal location. The Serb side returned fire and according to Serb military sources, one Serb fighter was wounded in the attack. Overnight, Muslim forces carried out a strong mortar attack against Kasindolska Street from the direction of Butmir and across the airport runway. The 82-mm caliber shells were filled with poison gases, that is, tear gas. During the night Muslims stepped up fire against the Serb defense lines in Hadzici and Zuc hill from the direction of Goduse, Kralupa, and Ormanj Hill. There is also evidence of Muslim forces concentrating in the area of the cold-storage plant at Stup and in Sokolovic Kolonija.
