FR940812-2-00177 FR940812-2-00065 Parties submitting reply comments in this proceeding were critical of the MPAA's rejection of acceptance of future redesignations and its admonition urging the Copyright Office to set guidelines. See Force Amusement Enterprises, Inc., reply comments at 2; NAB, reply comments at 4; INTV, reply comments at 6. Force underscores that the Commission specifically declined in its Report & Order to make wholesale changes in the major television market list, and that ``[u]nless and until such a major policy shift is actually considered by the FCC,'' reason dictates following the Commission's case-by-case redesignations. The reply commentators were also critical of the MPAA's recommendation that we adopt guidelines to evaluate the copyright consequences of future redesignations. They state that MPAA offers no argument or suggestions as to_1) why the criteria used by the FCC in making such redesignations are inadequate for copyright purposes; 2) what criteria, other than those employed by the FCC, the Copyright Office should use independently to evaluate market redesignations; or 3) the policy justification for, in essence, creating two separate major market lists. NAB, reply comments at 4. Another commentator argued that adoption of guidelines would also be an unjustified rejection of our 1987 Policy Decision to accept Commission redesignations for cable license purposes. INTV, reply comments at 6&hyph;7. d. Response to Question 4. Question # 4 raises the issue of possible future reranking of markets on the §76.51 list and asks what effect reranking should have on the copyright status of distant signals. Since the FCC has not received a petition for reranking of markets, several commentators have suggested that the copyright implications of such an action are not ripe for decision. Parties aligned with cable interests support the view that current cable system carriage of permitted distant signals should be grandfathered, while copyright interests argue that the grandfathering of distant signals would be bad copyright policy resulting in considerable harm to the compulsory license royalty scheme. In announcing its practice for handling future revisions of the §76.51 list, the FCC did not address the possibility of reorganizing the order of the top 100 markets. See Report & Order, 8 FCC Rcd at 2979 (1993) (FCC not ready to consider reranking on basis of present record). We noted in our NOI to this proceeding that since the Commission did not announce a definitive position on reranking of markets, ``[i]t is therefore possible that future changes to the §76.51 list may include both reranking and renaming, although probably in limited circumstances.'' NOI, 58 FR at 34595 (June 28, 1993). Reranking would present the possibility of changes in the number of permitted/non-permitted distant signals that a cable system located in a top 100 market could carry, since the §76.51 list also had significance for the Commission's former distant signal carriage rules. For example, a cable system located in a second 50 market can generally carry two distant signals at the permitted base rate copyright royalty fee. Additional distant signals must be reported at the more expensive non-permitted 3.75% royalty fee. If a reranking of markets occurs and the cable system moves into the top 50 markets, then, according to the FCC's former distant signal carriage rules, the cable system could potentially carry three permitted base rate signals, instead of just two. If a reranking resulted in a cable system moving from the top 50 to the second 50, then the cable system would lose a base rate distant signal and possibly incur the 3.75% royalty for that signal. Concerned about the potential for a change in royalty status of current distant signals, we sought in Question # 4 to elicit comment as to the possibility of grandfathering the royalty status of signals despite the effects of market reordering. Because the FCC has yet to receive a petition for reranking of the §76.51 list or to consider the issue, several commentators urge that the copyright implications of a reranking are not ripe for decision. Press Broadcasting, comments at 9; Professional Sports, comments at 1; NCTA, comments at 3. Noting that the questions involving market ranking versus market redesignation involve ``very different considerations,'' INTV urges that ``until the FCC is willing to revisit the ranking aspect of §76.51, the Copyright Office need not rush into the matter.'' INTV, comments at 22. Professional Sports also urges restraint, encouraging the Office to seek further comment at such time as the Commission does consider reranking. Professional Sports, comments at 9&hyph;10. Commentators aligned with cable argue that the Copyright Office must apply grandfathering principles to any reranking of television markets. See comments of United Video, Providence Journal, NCTA, INTV, and Joint Cable Operators. Citing the ``no rollback policy'' used by the Commission to apply its former distant signal carriage rules, these commentators state that the grandfathering of carriage of distant signals is critical to continued carriage of existing distant signals. The FCC specifically allowed for grandfathering of distant signals which had been carried prior to a rule change, so as to prevent carriage disruption. See, e.g., 36 FCC2d 143 (1972) (grandfathering signals carried prior to new distant signal and syndicated exclusivity rules); 54 FCC2d 265 (1975) (grandfathering distant signal sports imported prior to new restriction). The commentators note that the Copyright Office has also observed the practice of grandfathering. See Letter of Dorothy Schrader, Copyright Office General Counsel, to Peter H. Feinberg of January 31, 1990 (grandfathering of permitted signal after change in station's community of license from major market to nearby smaller market community); Letter of Dorothy Schrader, Copyright Office General Counsel, to Irving Gastfreund of December 11, 1986 (grandfathering of permitted distant signals where area formerly located outside all markets becomes smaller market). Joint Cable Operators argue that there is no precedent for the Copyright Office to refuse to grandfather carriage of existing distant signals at the permitted base royalty rate. Thus, where a cable system moves from the top 50 to a second 50 market, or from a top 50 or second 50 market to a smaller market, we could not assess the 3.75% royalty rate against distant signals formerly carried on a permitted basis.
