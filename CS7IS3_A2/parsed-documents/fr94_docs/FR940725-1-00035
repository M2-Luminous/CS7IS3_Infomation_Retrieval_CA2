FR940725-1-00035 FR940725-1-00009 In formulating the four criteria initially, and in providing additional policy clarification, OJJDP recognized a need to distinguish an optimal system, where a juvenile detention center would never be collocated with an adult jail or lockup, from a system where States can use collocated facilities that meet the regulatory requirements for a separate facility by creating and maintaining an atmosphere that is appropriate and conducive to the care of alleged juvenile criminal-type offenders who require a secure detention environment. Given the limited level of funds available to States under the Formula Grants program, and the need to expend these funds to address a variety of priorities and needs identified in the JJDP Act and State plans, OJJDP has sought to provide States with sufficient flexibility to achieve and maintain compliance with JJDP Act mandates while, at the same time, addressing needed delinquency prevention and other system improvement initiatives. The proposed regulation clarifies the four criteria by providing that: (1) Total separation in spatial areas of juvenile and adult facilities can be achieved by providing for no common use areas or by time-phasing common use areas, provided that the arrangement precludes even haphazard or accidental contact between juvenile and adult residents and adult facility staff at all times and provided that time-phasing of common use areas cannot extend to sleeping or living areas. Under either approach to total separation, written operational plans, policies and procedures must be in place to insure that the objective of total separation is achieved; (2) total separation in juvenile and adult program activities requires the formulation of an independent and comprehensive operational plan for the juvenile facility which provides a full range of separate program activities for juveniles. While program space, equipment and resources may be shared by both juvenile and adult facility populations subject to the requirements of total separation in spatial areas, the key feature of this policy is the express requirement that the juvenile population receive a full range of services in circumstances where collocation of facilities is approved; (3) separate juvenile and adult staff_management, security and direct care_is essential to the maintenance of an appropriate atmosphere for the care of juveniles in detention. The regulation distinguishes between staff who routinely have day-to-day direct care responsibility for juveniles and specialized service staff not normally in contact with detainees. For security and direct care staff (including management), the 1992 Amendments require that these functions be vested in totally separate staff. This requirement is designed to ensure that a facility's security and direct care staff are both well qualified to serve, and appropriately focused on, the needs of the juvenile population while providing juvenile facility services; (4) in States that have standards or licensing requirements for secure juvenile detention facilities, a collocated facility must meet the standards (on the same basis as separate facilities) and be licensed as appropriate. The proposed regulation establishes an express requirement that a responsible State authority must certify that State standards and licensing requirements have been met and that the architectural configuration and operational procedures and policies of the facility assure total separation between juvenile detention center and adult facility populations. OJJDP intends these clarifications to strengthen the four requirements for a separate facility and to establish reliable parameters for States completing final steps to achieve and maintain full compliance with the jail and lockup removal requirement. The regulatory language committing OJJDP to the ``rule of reason'' represents a further attempt to place the collocated facility criteria in perspective. Finally, States are reminded of their oversight responsibility to insure that the separate character of any collocated juvenile detention facility is fully maintained following its classification as a separate juvenile detention facility. The 1992 Amendments require States to reassess the separate staff criterion in all collocated facilities, including those classified as such by the State and concurred with by OJJDP prior to the effective date of this proposed regulation.
