[Ilyushin] Even now, Germany is our closest partner. As a result of such a visit, the relations will become even more intensive and even more friendly. [STERN] However, the relations are not completely unclouded. There is a controversy between you and the FRG Government over the farewell for the Russian troops in eastern Germany. Russia wants a joint parade with the Allies, while the West is against it. [Ilyushin] Kohl and Yeltsin will find a dignified form. [STERN] Kohl and the West do not know either whether Russia will accede to the NATO program, "Partnership for Peace," like other former Eastern Bloc states. [Ilyushin] Proceed on the assumption that Russia's position is determined by its president. Controversies in the Cabinet are natural. This is democracy. [STERN] Will Russia accede to it? [Ilyushin] Russia will sign it. However, in the dialogue with NATO, Russia's place and role indeed have to be clarified. It is a mistake not to reckon with Russia in world politics. This is shown by Yugoslavia's example. [STERN] Rumors that President Yeltsin is fatally ill and that the West might lose its guarantor of a predictable Russian foreign policy continue to be heard. [STERN] I work with him every day -- for 12, 14 hours and more. A sick man would not be able to keep this up.
