They succeeded in foiling repeated assaults by the forces of the al-Ahmar gang, and delivered deadly blows to those forces in the depths of their defensive positions, with the help of almighty God and by virtue of the determination of the fighters, who arise from the just cause they are defending and their certainty of winning a clear victory. As this military communique was being written, our forces were delivering crushing blows to the hostile forces in the area around Kirsh, inflicting vast casualties, and forcing them to retreat and surrender. On the Abyan axis, our heroic forces are continuing their pursuit of remnants of hostile forces, and are mopping up the remaining pockets of resistance. This morning our forces foiled every desperate assault made by units from the scattered hostile forces. Our forces inflicted major defeats on these forces, to the satisfaction of our heroic fighters and the good and loyal inhabitants of Abyan, who face the prospect of certain victory in this destructive war -- unleashed against our people in the southern governorates by the bloody, fascist al-Ahmar gang.
