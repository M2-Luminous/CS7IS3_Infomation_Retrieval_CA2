While word of coming "skinhead" demonstrations and other fascist and nationalist activities caused fear in minority communities, the weekend's events showed discord among rightist factions and a lack of support from the general public. The separation of Czechoslovakia was precipitated by the March 15, 1939, invasion of the Czech lands by the German army and Slovakia's declaration of independence a day earlier. Memories of conflict and mistrust were evoked by the meetings of rightist political parties in the big Czech and Slovak cities, while ethnic tension in smaller towns was aggravated by processions of skinheads and calls for the rehabilitation of Slovakia's pro-German wartime leader. The various groups often clashed in their proclaimed interests, however much they may seem to have in common. Police were quick to state that skinhead activists represented no more than a marginal problem. Miroslav Sladek, leader of the Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC), made speeches at rallies in Prague and Brno, condemning as "apologist" President Vaclav Havel's statements on the deportation of Sudeten Germans after World War II and calling for "the highest possible penalty" for any politicians "opening the door to the Germans." "Whenever the Germans have wanted to expand into Europe, they have always turned to Czechoslovakia first," pronounced Sladek form his podium at the Jan Hus statue on Prague's Old Town Square. "We should learn a lesson from Jan Hus, who struggled for the purity of the Czech nation and was murdered by Germans, and not from Saint Vaclav, who, like his modern namesakes [Havel and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus] in today's government, opened the way for German intervention." Preaching to a crowd of predominantly older men, Sladek accused the Klaus government of breaking up the Czechoslovak federation and weakening it before an expansionist Teutonic neighbor. "The Germans did the same thing in Yugoslavia: They encouraged rival factions to fight, and then in the ruins they bought up the Adriatic coast for a few pfennigs." The demonstrations were interrupted by outbreaks of violence. In Brno, anarchists clashed with the republican crowd March 14. The Prague demonstration speakers were heckled by skinheads who criticized Sladek for inconsistency in his beliefs. About 400 skinheads attended a "White Rock" concert March 19 in the Karlin district of Prague. The event was organized by skinheads in honor of two of their number whom they claim were killed by Romanies. The Czech press reported that Romany children in some areas of the city were staying away from school as groups of the notoriously anti-Gypsy skinheads arrived. Two days before the event, an arson attack at the restaurant hosting the concert scorched part of the interior. Firefighters said it could have burned the whole building. Skinheads, undaunted, flocked from all over the country to hear bands such as Hatred 88, Attack and Flag. In Preroy, northern Moravia, skinheads also marched through the town chanting anti-Romany slogans. The Patriotic Front association organized the demonstration to remind citizens of the case of 17-year-old Libor Buzik, who allegedly was attacked by two Romanies last November and who still has not recovered fully from his injuries. Further demonstrations by skinheads are anticipated on the anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birthday in April. Police said they expect a skinhead celebration of some kind in the eastern Bohemian town of Hradec Kralove to mark the date. Meanwhile, in Bratislava, Slovak opinions were divided and emotions ran high as past political passions merged with present ones. Competing demonstrators called for both the rehabilitation and vilification of Jozef Tiso, the Roman Catholic priest who was president of the "puppet government" during the war. Singing the Slovak national anthem, a crowd of about 500 gathered near Tiso's grave in the Martinsky cemetery, while the deacon of Banov, western Slovakia, said it was time for the younger generation to hear the truth about Tiso and what he represented for the Slovak nation. In the central Slovak town of Zilina, Slovak Peoples Party Chairman Ludovit Adamov described the Tiso years as "a Slovak miracle" and defended Tiso's inclination toward Nazi Germany as a "lesser evil" among the options then available.
