"It is impossible for the topic of Temelin not to appear at the meeting," Spacek told journalists. He added, however, that it was impossible to expect that the debate on the nuclear power plant would be conducted on "some specific level." The discussion will probably be on how to ensure nuclear security in Europe, Spacek said. Klestil intends, during his meeting with Klaus on Friday [15 April], to convince the Czech president of the necessity of new steps concerning the Temelin nuclear plant. In an interview with Green representatives in Vienna today Klestil promised that he would seek to table discussion on the ecological impact of the construction and would contribute to the renewal of talks on planning permission.
