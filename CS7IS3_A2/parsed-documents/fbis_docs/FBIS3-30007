Kong, in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, said South Korea and Japan should maintain close cooperation in seeing that North Korea accepts adequate international inspections of its nuclear facilities to ensure against development of nuclear weapons. He said settlement of the matter should be made a precondition for consideration of North Korea's participation in regional organizations and activities, such as the Tumen River Development Project near the North Korea-China border and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Kong said Tokyo and Seoul still face unresolved issues, such as addressing the suffering of so-called comfort women, who said they were forced by the Japanese Imperial Army to provide sex to soldiers during World War II. But he said South Koreans were very touched last year by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's war conduct and its colonization of the Korean peninsula. President Kim is scheduled to visit Japan in late March.
