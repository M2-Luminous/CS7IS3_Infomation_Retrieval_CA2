FBIS4-48697 "drafr101_d_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-101 Daily Report 20 May 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique Investigation of Troop Training in Tanzania To Continue Investigation of Troop Training in Tanzania To Continue MB2005131794 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 0800 GMT 20 May 94 MB2005131794 Maputo Radio Mozambique Network Portuguese BFN [Text] The Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] has decided to continue investigating the alleged training of a battalion of government troops in Tanzania, following complaints by the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] in April. In its report, Renamo named a witness who is now missing. The government does not agree with continuing the investigations, saying that this should take place only if the missing witness is presented. The commission -- made up of government, Renamo, and UN members -- worked twice with Renamo's witness in Nampula. Raul Dique, Renamo's representative in the CCF, said that (Renuge Paconote), who was living under Renamo protection, requested to visit his family, with whom he spent the night. Brigadier Dique says that on the following day, 10 May, the witness went missing. Renamo believes that (Renuge Paconote) was detained or killed by the government to hinder the investigations of the alleged training of a military battalion in Tanzania. Renamo says that the troops would be used should the Mozambique Liberation Front lose the October elections. Lieutenant Colonel Ozorio Mateus of the government delegation in the CCF believes that the absence of the alleged Renamo witness hinders the continuation of the investigation of the Tanzania battalion issue. Ozorio Mateus said that on previous occasions Renamo alleged violations of the General Peace Accord by the government, but nothing has been proved on the ground.
