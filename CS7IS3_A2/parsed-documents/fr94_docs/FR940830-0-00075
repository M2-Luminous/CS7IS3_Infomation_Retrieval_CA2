FR940830-0-00075 FR940830-0-00013 Definition of Fungibility Comment: One commenter saw a need to define fungibility in the rule. The following definition of fungibility was proposed: ``Fungibility. The ability to exchange CIAP or Comprehensive Grant program dollars or work items prospectively or retroactively, between any years covered by an ACC, Five-Year Action Plan or Needs Assessment.'' It was also noted that additional references to ``fungibility'' should be altered to conform to this definition. Response: Fungibility is a concept reflected throughout the rule. Fungibility permits a HA to substitute any work item from the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan to any previously approved CIAP budget or CGP Annual Statement and to move work items among approved budgets without prior HUD approval. This definition of fungibility appears in the rule. Retroactive Fungibility Comment: NYCHA indicated that applying fungibility only to those jobs included in the current Five-Year Action Plan is too restrictive. This HA wanted to be able to apply the fungibility principle to unobligated work items_past, present, or future (currently in either an approved implementation schedule or their needs assessment (including both CIAP and CGP-funded items)). By authorizing ``retroactive fungibility'' in the CGP rule and with guidance in the Handbook, NYCHA expected a significant increase in PHA flexibility and responsiveness to modernization needs. NYCHA suggested that retroactive fungibility will allow a PHA to close out its older programs on schedule and will also aid in reprogramming underruns. With respect to the time period for the fungibility of work items, it was suggested that full fungibility should be allowed within the five-year period spanned by a Five-Year Action Plan's rolling base. If fungibility is tied to our initial Five-Year Action Plan (submitted in FFY 92), they expected to move work items from FFY 96 into their FFY 94 CGP budget, but not items from FFY 97. If fungibility is tied to the rolling base Five-Year Action Plan, developed each year by dropping off the initial year and adding a subsequent year for their Annual Submission, they could move work items from FFY 98 into their FFY 94 CGP budget. Another commenter found it would be much simpler to have a fixed five-year period with changes and updates made annually to that plan. In the fifth year a new Five-Year Action Plan for the next five years would be submitted and approved. This HA found a lot of difficulty in trying to explain to residents that the first year of the 1993 budget was the same as the second year of the 1992 budget but that they were different because some items had been revised or changed. Response: HUD does not agree with the suggestions that fungibility should apply to all unobligated work items and any work items in the Needs Assessment. If HUD permitted the use of the Needs Assessments for purposes of fungibility, the five-year planning and resident partnership processes could be circumvented. The Five-Year Action Plan has a rolling base and is updated annually. The approval of the Five-Year Action Plan submitted for the current FFY supersedes other previously approved Five-Year Action Plans. For example, the current Five-Year Action Plan may cover FFYs 1994&hyph;1998. However, a HA may substitute a major work category from the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan into a 1992 CGP or a 1991 CIAP budget, but it cannot substitute work that only appears in the Needs Assessments. It should be clarified that HUD approval is not required for moving previously approved work among previously approved budgets. In addition, HUD approval is not required for reprogramming if funds remain after completion of a work item where the funds will be used for any item in the latest approved Five-Year Action Plan or an approved CIAP budget or Annual Statement. The HA may also self-execute a time extension, if necessary, to use the leftover funds. Post-Obligation Fungibility of Dollars Comment: In the proposed rule, fungibility centers on the interchangeability of work items between funding programs prior to obligation. However, for one large HA, fungibility of dollars during the expenditure period would be just as useful. Numerous circumstances beyond a PHA's control can make it impossible to close a contract, and with it the funding program, within the five-year statutory limit. When such circumstances occur, the monies remaining in a funding program about to expire should be used for payments on contracts in later funding programs. In a sense, PHAs would be creating post-award, ``split funded'' contracts. Fungibility of dollars is the expenditure version of using old money first. Post-obligation fungibility of contract dollars would allow PHAs to closeout old funding programs within the five-year funding deadline and would yield a more accurate picture of the PHAs ability to expend modernization funds. The rule should provide directly for post-obligation fungibility, and this important subject should not be left for handbook interpretation, as suggested in the proposed rule's preamble. Response: As previously noted, there is no statutory five-year funding deadline. HUD wishes to emphasize that fungibility relates to major work categories, not dollars. The dollars approved in a particular grant, e.g., 701, are tracked against that grant number. A HA may fund work categories in total or in part from a particular grant. If the cost of a work category is in excess of the funds available in 701, the HA may charge up to the total amount of funds remaining in 701 and add that work category to another grant, e.g., 702. The Department issued Notice PIH 94&hyph;13 (HA), Expediting Obligation/Expenditure of Modernization Funds in the Pipeline, on April 6, 1994. HAs should refer to this Notice which specifically discusses methods which HAs may wish to use to obligate and expend their oldest modernization funds before charging work against newer programs. Comprehensive Grant Process Comment: One commenter suggested a revised CGP process. It would require an approval process only every five years. The plan would be updated annually with changes made to reflect actual funding costs as tasks are completed, items added and/or deleted from the Plan or moved to different years. A new fifth year would not be added each year. Only new items added to the Plan would require HUD approval and interim year changes would require documented consultation with the tenants at a public meeting. PHAs could expend funds from any grant year against any item in the approved Plan. An example of a Plan was also provided.
