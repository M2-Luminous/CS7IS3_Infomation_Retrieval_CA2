During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten repeatedly advocated that Hong Kong was an "international asset," and such a concept gravely violates the most fundamental principle laid down in the Joint Declaration. The most basic principle in the Joint Declaration is that the recovery of Hong Kong is the common aspiration of the entire Chinese people, the Chinese Government has decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong effective 1 July 1997, and the Government of the United Kingdom declares that it will restore Hong Kong to the PRC effective 1 July 1997. This basic principle in the Joint Declaration shows that Hong Kong is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory, and by no means is it an "international asset." Chris Patten said that the Chinese side's criticism of his visit to Australia shows it is "playing the international card" and "has a lack of understanding of Hong Kong's role and importance in the world." According to Chris Patten's logic, all cities that have an important role in the world are inevitably "international assets." However, no one would fail to see the important role of such cities as London and New York in the world, can we say that those cities are "international assets" too? Does it follow that all countries may possess them and share their assets? Obviously, Britain would not agree with that point, nor would the United States tolerate it. Chris Patten's wicked motive lies in instigating all countries to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs, thus impeding China's resumption of its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong by relying on international political forces. During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten also said: "Britain has a moral obligation to Hong Kong after 1997," "the idea that the Joint Declaration means to say that Britain will no longer have moral obligations and interests in Hong Kong is entirely contradictory." This is a distortion and vilification of the Joint Declaration, which stipulates that British rule in Hong Kong will terminate in 1997: where do British "moral obligations" come in after 1997? Chris Patten's big lie can fool no one. One has only to read the article, entitled, "Our Basic Position on the Issue of Hong Kong," and its annotations in volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, to have a clear picture that, in the course of the Sino-British talks on the future of Hong Kong, the British side repeatedly insisted on its position of prolonging its right to rule over Hong Kong and maintaining British influence over Hong Kong after 1997. Nevertheless, the British side's stubborn position deservedly met with the Chinese side's firm opposition. It was under such circumstances that the British side had to sign the Joint Declaration. On this point, Mrs. Thatcher recorded clearly in her memoirs, "The Downing Street Years," in which she said that on 14 October 1983, she sent a letter to the Chinese side: "At this point, I have to make the decision that we shall return sovereignty to China as well as the right to rule," "this shows that we do not expect that power links between Britain and Hong Kong will continue to exist after 1997, and Britain will no longer have any obligations toward Hong Kong." Related annotations in the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping also indicate that in the wake of the British Prime Minister's letter of October 1983, "the British side has ascertained that it would no longer insist on British rule nor would it plan for any form of condominium, and has the understanding that China's plan is founded on the prerequisite that sovereignty and right of rule of Hong Kong in their entirety should be returned to China after 1997. Thus, the removal of the main hurdle to Sino-British talks began." Therefore, we can see that Chris Patten's remarks that "the idea that the Joint Declaration means to say Britain has no moral obligations and interests in Hong Kong after 1997 is entirely contradictory" runs counter to the true meaning of the Joint Declaration as well as historical facts. During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten also threatened: "If we think the Chinese are violating the solemn commitments they have made in the Joint Declaration, we are sure to raise this question in the international community...I am sure Britain will inevitably make some choices." The truth is that the British side has violated the Joint Declaration and its commitment to converge with the Basic Law and the Sino-British diplomatic understanding and accords, but Chris Patten went to the Australia and made false countercharges against the Chinese side in an attempt to confuse public opinion and shift the responsibility to the Chinese side; at the same time, he presented the British "choices" characterized by the "three violations" to the international community to dupe people the world over and fool them into giving their support. However, all this is in vain. During his stay in Australia, Chris Patten made many remarks which obviously violate the Joint Declaration; in actual fact, he has only revealed the evil plots of the British side in its attempts to thoroughly break faith with the Joint Declaration. It would be helpful to the international community and public opinion to have a clear picture of the truth, and see through his hypocrisy. This being the case, the "international card" Chris Patten played during his visit to Australia can only help the British side in the opposite direction. As the Hong Kong governor who must be responsible for maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and realizing a stable transition in the last few years of the transition period according to the stipulations of the Joint Declaration, should Chris Patten have gone to another country to distort and trample on the Joint Declaration, should he have stirred up trouble; this shows that Chris Patten has not the slightest intention to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and to insure the smooth transfer of government according to the stipulations of the Joint Declaration. Whereas the British Government has given a free hand to Chris Patten to talk a lot of nonsense in the international community and spread remarks that obviously violate the Joint Declaration. This also exposed the British Government in its attempts to openly express its position of refusing to implement the Joint Declaration to the international community. Such a practice is rare in the history of international relations and is amazing. Regarding this, we must show grave concern. However, China's position of resolutely safeguarding its sovereignty and implementing the Joint Declaration will not move a bit. The British Government should rein in from the brink of the precipice and should take responsibility to publicly clarify Chris Patten's absurd remarks.
