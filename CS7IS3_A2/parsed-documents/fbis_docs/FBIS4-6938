However, the environment surrounding the FTC has become increasingly severe. MITI Opens Way to Revision In the comprehensive economic measures decided on 8 February [1994], a clause was inserted to "clarify the criteria for the handling of mergers and stock shareholding." The criteria is called "merger guidelines" and will serve as the standards for judgment as to whether the FTC will recognize mergers. They are important guidelines that may be regarded as the "constitution" for FTC investigation of mergers. The path to "constitutional revision" was paved by MITI [Ministry of International Trade and Industry]. The Industrial Structure Council, an advisory organ to the MITI minister, pointed out in its interim report drafted in late November 1993 that "the positioning of elements other than domestic shares is unclear," and that the element of shares in the global market should be added to the investigation criteria. The FTC had resisted at the outset by saying that "there is no problem with the current criteria" (Economic Department), but it was eventually overruled by MITI. Demands are submitted to the FTC not only domestically, but also from overseas. The U.S. Government submitted a document requesting measures for competition within the framework of the Japan-U.S. economic talks, and it demanded easing of the regulation on premiums. The U.S. companies, which frequently use premiums to promote sales, complain strongly that strict regulation of premiums serve as a barrier to entry into the Japanese market. Other Ministries Remain Cool Although the FTC is passive regarding the U.S. proposal and says that "the regulation concerning premiums is firmly in place," it is actually showing signs of relenting. In the air travel industry, the practice of offering free air travel coupons according to flight distances is spreading. However, it clearly violates the Premium Display Law which restricts premiums to "within 10 percent of the original transacted price, and under 50,000 yen." Nonetheless, the FTC tacitly approves it because "the unique circumstances of international air travel makes it difficult for Japan's rules to be applied" (Premium Display Guidance Division). A view is even expressed that "perhaps the sense of the FTC is at variance with the international trend in the industry" (MITI executive). Late last year, the FTC's study group (Chairman Toshimasa Tsuruta, professor of Senshu University) made public a report on the government regulations. It spelled out a basic policy of "abolishing, in principle, regulations on entry and pricing" and clarified the guidelines on the problems of government regulations by individual industries such as distribution and communications, in addition to ways to ease them. Despite the fact that "the contents were quite penetrating" (an FTC executive), the other ministries took it rather coolly, saying: "We were not aware that such a report was issued" (Ministry of Transportation). The FTC report was obscured by the report of the Economic Reform Study Group [Hiraiwa study group] (an advisory organ to the prime minister; Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman), which was announced about the same time and which also advocated abolition of economic regulations in principle. In the first place, the FTC's study group was hastily convened when deregulation became a major theme in the Economic Reform Study Group, and it was felt that "the FTC must also do something." In addition to being frequently shaken by domestic and foreign pressures, the FTC could not hide its weak-kneed statements. Strict Surveillance of "Discount Sales" Despite its passiveness concerning deregulation, the FTC keeps a sharp eye on "discount sales" amid the trend toward price-cutting. In November 1993, it issued orders to exclude four major discount stores on men's clothing for violating the display law. The reason given was that unfair double-standard prices were displayed to give the impression of lower sale prices. Professor Ushio Nakajo of Keio University stated that it is natural to strictly control violations. However, he questioned the posture of the FTC, saying: "The FTC should have other matters to tend to." His contention is that the FTC should give priority to grappling with deregulation and prosecution of "dango." Strengthening measures for competition is one of the four pillars of an open market policy that the government will draft by the end of March [1994], and "the role of the FTC is being elevated to an unprecedented level" (Hiroshi Iju, adviser to Mitsubishi Research Institute). Enforcement of the Antimonopoly Law is often swayed by pressures from politicians and foreign countries, as well as by demands from the industries. Of course, there are tasks that the government as a whole must grapple with, such as the buildup of the investigation sector which is said to be understaffed. However, unless the FTC adopts a firm stance regarding its policy on competition, the raison d'etre of the FTC itself will be questioned.
