FBIS TRENDS-20MAY94-CHINA Beijing Pledges Power Sector Reform, Solicits Foreign Investment Beijing Pledges Power Sector Reform, Solicits Foreign Investment SUMMARY In a renewed bid to close the gap between China's rapidly expanding economy and sluggish growth in power production, Beijing has stepped up its efforts to boost foreign investment in the power industry, promised new state loans for power projects, and reaffirmed an agenda of sweeping market reforms announced last year. However, continued administrative control of investment return rates may discourage a rapid increase in foreign investment. END SUMMARY Underscoring the power ministry's renewed drive to court foreign investors, the 17-23 April issue of Beijing's English-language paper China Daily reported that Minister of Power Industry Shi Dazhen had begun an official visit to France, Spain, and Israel to "bring in investment." While in France, the article said, Shi was expected to "sign an agreement" to extend a "10-year power cooperation treaty" due to expire this year and to "explain China's energy policies" to French government and business leaders. The article went on to describe Shi's visits to Spain and Israel as "important" because Spain is the home of the "European power union" and Israel has "ties" with financial organizations "worldwide." Revealing that Shi's trip was part of a larger series of overseas visits planned to attract investment or assistance for the struggling power sector, the article quoted a ministry spokesman as saying that other delegations will be dispatched to unnamed "Western nations" this year with "proposals for cooperation." Investment Gap Shi's trip and other current initiatives are part of Beijing's ongoing effort to remedy serious shortages in the power sector, which power ministry officials have long warned is dangerously underfunded. Since Shi took office a year ago, PRC media have increasingly stressed the urgency of bringing power production into line with economic growth, claiming that the present 20 percent shortfall in power capacity not only curbs current industrial output but also poses a serious obstacle to continued economic development. Revisiting this theme, the 17-23 China Daily article stated that Beijing has "planned" for only 12 of the average 17 million kilowatts of new capacity needed annually to sustain a 9 percent economic growth rate until the year 2000. Ten billion of the 66 billion yuan needed to pay for an increase of this size, the article said, is "not available." Although the article indicated that this "capital shortage" would be eased later in the year, it complained that the government had reduced funding for large power plants in order to control inflation and quoted power ministry officials as warning that this shortage would "jeopardize" long-term economic growth. Promotion of Market Reform Consistent with his efforts over the past year in spearheading a drive to increase funding and introduce sweeping reforms in the power industry, Shi Dazhen was quoted in a 3 May China Daily article as saying that "plans are under way" to "lift price controls" on electricity, introduce a "shareholding system" into the power industry, and launch a publicity campaign to encourage energy conservation. -- Price reform. Seeking to correct the longstanding problem of low state-set electricity prices that have resu1ted in massive waste and have severely constrained power sector development, the article reported Shi as reiterating his call of last December (China Daily, 28 December 1993) to establish a "rational pricing system" for the power industry in the "next three years." Allowing electricity prices to "ref1ect market demand," Shi asserted, is the "best way to attract domestic and overseas investment." Arguing that price reform would attract foreign investment and financial assistance, the article said that an "American expert" abstained in a 1992 World Bank vote on investment in a power plant because electricity prices "failed to reflect market demand." The article went on to paint a grim picture of acute power shortages and waste, noting that electricity prices were set in 1958, and, "although adjusted for the first time last year," are still "extremely low." -- Institutional Reform. Shi also reaffirmed his plan for a radical restructuring of the power industry along market lines. He called for "breaking free from the planned economy" and for turning "al1" state-owned power enterprises into "shareholding firms" that will "operate free of government interference" and assume responsibility for profits and losses. Elaborating on this reform agenda in a keynote article appearing in Renmin Ribao late last year, Shi had insisted that China must "take the road" of "unconventional" development and that power enterprises must be reorganized into "standardized joint-stock" companies--or corporations--and must "experiment with newer and more dynamic management forms" (19 December 1993). The joint-stock system, he said, would "clearly define property rights," provide "a legal guarantee for the real separation of ownership from management power," and "ensure the legitimate rights and interests of investors." Shi also indicated that the new system would allow for a radical decentralization of decisionmaking power. Some power companies, he said, would be "managed by investors on their own" and some power plants would be "run by other industries." In addition, he reaffirmed 1987 State Council guidelines--which were apparently never implemented--that allow provincial and transprovincial power grids to operate as commercial entities responsible for profits and losses and enjoying autonomy in raising and allocating funds for development. The "key issue," he declared, "is to firmly establish the concept that electric power is a commodity" and to create "a policy environment ensuring fair competition." Limit on Investment Returns Although eager to attract foreign investment, Beijing has also expressed concern over perceived foreign exploitation of power- starved localities and has responded by setting administrative limits on the rates of return that may inhibit the increased flow of foreign funds. A 7 May report in Zhongguo Xinwen She, Beijing's news service for overseas Chinese, announced that the State Council had fixed the "rate of return" for foreign investment in joint venture power projects at "between 11 and 12 percent." The State Council was "greatly concerned," it said, because "some provinces and municipalities" had agreed to a rate of return that was "too high" in order to "seek early success" in negotiations with foreign parties. Independent Hong Kong media have confirmed high rates in some areas and investor concern over arbitrary limits. The well-connected Hong Kong daily Ming Pao reported on 7 March that some southern provinces had accepted a Hong Kong company's request for a "50 percent return" on its investment in a power project. A 6 May article in the prominent English-language Hong Kong daily South China Morning Post reported that unnamed foreign investors believe that a rate of return of 15 to 18 percent would be "reasonable." New Infusion of State Loans While Beijing has undertaken high-profile measures to attract foreign investment, it has also taken steps to beef up state loans to the power industry and has signaled that state investment, funneled through new institutions created by the recent wave of banking reform, will continue to play the major role in power sector development. For example, a China Daily article on 18 May reported that the recently established State Development Bank will grant 7 billion yuan in loans to ease "capital shortages" for large power projects. Apparently attempting to emphasize the state's commitment to the power industry, the article said that the loans--only the "first batch" for the year--would account for fully 36 percent of all bank loans Beijing plans to grant this year. Similarly, the article reported that 40 percent of all power sector funding this year will come from the state, whereas foreign investment is expected to account for only 10 percent. Implications Under increasing pressure to provide adequate power for China's booming economy, Beijing is straining to draw more capital into the power sector and is using the energy crisis to prod powerful bureaucrats into implementing radical market reforms. Because of the limited ability of state coffers to address China's rapidly growing power needs, efforts to attract more foreign investors are likely to expand. However, these efforts may be undercut by Beijing's continuing administrative control of investment return rates. (AUTHOR: VOSS.
