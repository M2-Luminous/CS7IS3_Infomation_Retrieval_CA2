Yu Xiaosong, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission and a mainland member of the economic sub-group, stated: If the United States takes measures against China's state- owned enterprises, this will mean creating new contradictions in Sino-U.S. economic development. After visiting the One Country, Two Systems Research Center on 2 May, when asked about the question of the U.S. extension of MFN treatment to China, Gao Shangquan said: Whether or not the United States grants China MFN is also extremely important to Hong Kong. If China's MFN treatment is not renewed, Hong Kong's interests will suffer. Moreover, not only does the issue have a bearing on Hong Kong, but it is also very important to the United States itself. It is thought that entrepreneurs and ordinary people in the United State all hope that China will have MFN renewed. He criticized the United States for always setting all sorts of conditions every time the MFN question is discussed. This has also been the case in the past. It applied pressure against China on the issue. In regard to a report that the United States will take measures against China's state-owned enterprises and levy heavy tariffs on their products, Gao Shangquan said: State-owned enterprises constitute a very big part of China's national economy. Reforming state-owned enterprises is the focal point of economic reform. What is detrimental to China's state-owned enterprises will also be detrimental to U.S. enterprises, because China's state-owned enterprises are involved in all cooperation and trade activities between China and the United States. Moreover, Hong Kong will also be affected as a result. Prior to the visit, Yu Xiaosong remarked: The United States should not take measures against China's state-owned enterprises, otherwise, it will create new contradiction in Sino-U.S. economic development. This will have very bad effects on both sides. If the United States take measures against state-owned enterprises, this will affect other fields in its economic ties with China. He did not think that current Sino-U.S. relations had become quite tense because of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan or a meeting with the Dalai Lama by American leaders. He maintained that these issues had nothing to do with the economy. When asked of his confidence in MFN renewal, he stated: This is a matter for the Americans. You must ask U.S. President Bill Clinton or the secretary of state.
