Gdlyan, chairman of the Russian People's Party, who is in Armenia on family business, has given his prediction regarding the development of political events. He put forward two possible avenues: "Zhirinovskiy may quite possibly prefer a bloc with the Agrarians and the Communists in order to combat the democrats. But, once it has conquered the latter, the coalition would inevitably fall out among themselves." Gdlyan believes that there are definite Western forces and mafia structures behind Zhirinovskiy. Touching on the subject of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader's possibly coming to Armenia, he said that he has information that Zhirinovskiy receives financial backing from a number of influential Armenian businessmen in Armenia as well as in Russia.
