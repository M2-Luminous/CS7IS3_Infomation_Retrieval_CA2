C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA) -- The 1994 energy research & development and technology transfer seminar of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum opened at the Taipei International Convention Center Wednesday [2 February]. More than 180 industry, academic, and government representatives from 17 APEC member countries are taking part in the two-day energy seminar. Discussions focus on three main areas -- "technology to convert wastes into energy sources," "efficient energy utilization technology in urban areas," and "the effective utilization of energy for the creation of improved amenities." This is the first time that Taiwan has hosted an APEC seminar since it joined the regional organization in 1991. The energy seminar is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Addressing the opening ceremony on behalf of Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng expressed the hope that this seminar and other similar gatherings will help strengthen cooperation among APEC members on energy conservation and efficiency improvement. The Asia-Pacific region, which had the world's fastest economic growth over the past decade, still faces the challenge of solving the "3e" problems of energy, economics, and environment, Sheu said. It is therefore most appropriate that "new and efficient energy technology to create a safe, clean, and comfortable environment for the next decade" has been chosen as the main theme of the forum, he explained. In Taiwan, he noted, the government is also plagued with "the emerging problems in energy demand and their environmentally unfriendly potential, both locally and internationally." In addition to increased domestic reserach in new energies, waste management, and efficiency upgrading, Taiwan has also initiated "research programs, that take on a more universal significance, in carbon dioxide omission control and alternative refrigerants," he pointed out. APEC, founded in 1989, groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States, Papua New Guinea, and Mexico.
