International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai also suggested at a press conference that Japan would bring its case to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the world trade body, if the U.S. used the report as a basis for imposing trade sanctions. Japan was among 39 countries and trade blocs the U.S. Government quoted as unfair traders in its annual trade barrier report published Thursday. The report lists 43 trade barriers in Japan under seven industry categories. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told a separate press meeting that Japan should "not be now glad, now sad" with the annual report. "It is only a reference for the U.S. in specifying (unfair traders) at the end of September," he said. Washington plans to draw up a list of "priority" countries that will be subject to "Super 301" trade measures. Hata also indicated that Japan has no fresh plans to allay the growing U.S. frustration with its trade deficit with Tokyo. He said Japan will focus on drafting macroeconomic measures which the market-opening package unveiled earlier this week suggested will be drawn up by June.
