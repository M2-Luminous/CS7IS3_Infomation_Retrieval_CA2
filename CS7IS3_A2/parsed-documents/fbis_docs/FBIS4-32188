Attila Fekete: "It Was an Accident, According to the Police"] [Text] Police Lieutenant General Sandor Pinter, national police commissioner, announced at his news conference that Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, suffered a traffic accident on 5 May, between Nyekladhaza and Emod on Highway 3. The police investigation has been unable to confirm rumors of foul play. After the news conference the defense attorney for Horn's driver said that the police had not ruled out foul play definitely. As we have reported several times earlier, a Saab 9000 car (registration number DFG-070) transporting Gyula Horn from Miskolc to Budapest collided with a disabled IFA [Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau] truck that was parked in the left lane of the 159.7-km section of Highway 3, between Nyekladhaza and Emod. The occupants of the Saab were: Gyula Horn, chairman of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]; his driver Istvan Mosolygo; and Horn's bodyguard, retired Police Major Jeno Zsidei. All three suffered serious, but not life-threatening, injuries. According to the official police report on the inspection of the scene of the accident, the disabled IFA truck had been parked in the left lane--relative to the direction in which Horn's car was heading--between 0.7 and 1.2 meters from the road's center line. In his statement to the police, the truck driver said he had not parked at the side of the road to change tires because the truck was hauling 80 quintals of canned food, and he was afraid that the vehicle might overturn. In addition, it would not have been possible to change tires on the road's soft shoulder. The technical experts confirmed the truck driver's arguments. They established that the truck did have a flat tire. In other words, the truck had not been positioned there intentionally for the subsequent accident. The tire on the right rear wheel of the truck's trailer had a 46-cm rip that had been caused by fatigue. By the weak light of a flashlight, the truck driver was just loosening the nuts on the wheel when the Saab crashed into the truck. Two technical experts presented their findings at the news conference. They had established beforehand, in agreement with the Saab factory's experts, that the structural deformations of the car's body and frame indicated an absorption of kinetic energy equal to the energy generated by the car at a speed of 55 to 60 km per hour [kph], which in practice means that the damage was what would have occurred had Horn's car crashed into a concrete wall at a speed of 55 to 60 kph. Of course, the truck's body likewise suffered serious damage in the accident, and the Saab's kinetic energy slowed down significantly also during the breakup of the truck's body. After impact, the car kept skidding for about 40 meters and then stopped. Technical expert Gabor Meleg concluded from all this that, at the time of impact, the car's speed must have been between 98 and 102 kph. Laszlo Vincze, the other expert, estimates that the car's speed must have been between 85 and 109 kph. The car was equipped with an automatic braking system; therefore it was impossible to determine at what speed the car had been traveling before impact, and whether and when the brakes had been applied before impact. However, reconstruction of the accident on a computer excludes the possibility that the Saab might have been traveling substantially faster than 100 kph. At a speed of 140 kph, the car would have landed in the ditch on the right side of the highway, relative to the direction in which it was heading. The investigation determined that the Saab had just been returning from the left lane when a third of its front end crashed into the truck. The police were unable to explain why the Saab had been in the left lane. The highway along the given section was straight, and the possibility of drifting was ruled out. The police likewise found no clue indicating that somebody on the side of the road might have startled the car's driver, and that might have been the reason why he wrenched the steering wheel to the left and crashed the car. The police established that the flashes of light Jeno Zsidei mentioned in his statement may probably have been the glittering street lights in Emod. The defense attorney for Istvan Mosolygo, who in the meantime has become a defendant, attended the news conference and listened to the reports. Afterwards, with Police Lt. General Pinter's consent, he outlined the line of defense his client would offer. The gist of it is that from the very beginning the police had regarded the crash as an accident and had not investigated the possibility of foul play. The police have recommended that the public prosecutor charge Mosolygo with causing a traffic accident through negligence. At the end of the news conference, Sandor Pinter announced that, until the end of the second round in the elections, he would maintain his offer to provide a Mercedes--complete with communications equipment, a driver and a bodyguard--for each major political party, upon their request.
