Salaries of officers and civilian personnel, food, nuclear security and combat training were among the priorities. It was pointed out that the withdrawal of Russian troops and their accommodation required an unprecedented amount of money. As for the funds set aside from military appropriations to pay for the state defense orders, they were used mainly to pay for the production of combat management and communications hardware, high- precision weapons and radio and electronic counteraction means. According to a Defense Ministry statement, the meeting was told that financing the army activities involved long delays, while the state's debt to the army and the defense industries continued to grow.
