FR940926-0-00064 FR940926-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 092194A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the allowance of the total allowable catch (TAC) of pollock for the offshore component in the BS. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time, (A.l.t.), September 24, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. The allowance of pollock TAC for vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the BS was established by the final 1994 initial groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and a subsequent reserve apportionment (59 FR 21673, April 26, 1994) as 799,662 metric tons (mt). The Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), determined, in accordance with ยง675.20(a)(8), that the allowance of pollock TAC for the offshore component in the BS soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director established a directed fishing allowance of 789,662 mt after determining that 10,000 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the BS. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for pollock by operators of vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component in the BS effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., September 24, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under ยง675.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: September 21, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
