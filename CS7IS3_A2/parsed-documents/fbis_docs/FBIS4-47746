FBIS4-47746 "drafr085_c_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 3 May South African Press Review for 3 May MB0305112694 MB0305112694 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR De Klerk, Pioneer -- Considered a "stolid apparatchik" when he became leader of the National Party, De Klerk "slowly but surely" "led his party to face up to true democracy," notes an editorial in the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 3 May on page 10. Still a president, about to become a deputy president, in making that transition "and in making it the way he did, F. W. de Klerk has secured a unique slot in history. He deserves, especially at this moment of profound change, tribute for his courage." "Most presidents are remembered for the manner of the conduct of their presidency. Frederik Willem de Klerk will be remembered above all for the manner of the laying down of his presidency. His new role as deputy to his erstwhile captive will automatically be historic. May it also be blessed with respect and distinction." BUSINESS DAY New Freedom -- "For Viljoen and the Freedom Front, the election result is a double-edged sword," notes an editorial in the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 3 May on page 8. Although it "will be able to claim that several hundred thousand people want a volkstaat [homeland], a closer look at voting figures confirms the larger picture which always made the idea an impossible dream in a post-apartheid South Africa." The Front's "strongest showing is in areas like the Northern, Eastern and the Northwestern Transvaal and the [Orange] Free State -- areas where the ANC's own support mostly exceeds 75 percent." The results demonstrate that "volkstaaters exist within tiny islands scattered around a multiracial country" and the most Viljoen "can expect is that the so-called volkstaat council" can be established "as a more or less permanent body" that is "charged with looking after the cultural and linguistic interests of those Afrikaners who seek that protection." If some are dissatisfied with "this limited agenda," a "5 percent grouping" "could not make much headway" against a "movement representing 60 percent of the population." SOWETAN Watershed Elections -- While the election bill is "more than half the budget expected for housing," and could go higher, "it was money well spent," concludes an editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 3 May on page 8. More good news about the way the elections were conducted "is that every party and every other commentator is complaining. They must have been, if not entirely without hitches, at least quite fair." "We will look back at the clumsy birth of democracy with great fondness" and "many legends will come from this watershed in our history." "The economy of South Africa will not only pick up after the elections but we are likely to get fair amounts of investment from the rest of the world" as the world's "enthusiasm has been sparked by the peaceful way in which these elections were held." Regional Leaders -- Most leaders set to become premiers of the regions "are well-known people with good track records," a second editorial of the 3 May SOWETAN notes. Toyko Sexwale is a "well liked, well respected man who has the image, in more ways than one, to lead the most important region in the country" -- the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]. Popo Molefe, who has been "a hard working man and mostly eschewed the glare of the spotlight, justly deserves his election to lead the North West Region." Matthew Phosa "is amply qualified to head the Eastern Transvaal Region, and Terror Lekota is a natural for the Free State." "Notwithstanding the fact there is a nagging fear of an overblown governance for the future, the leaders will be forced to assume a hands-on job with their communities, bringing government closer to the people."
