At approximately 2145, two leaflet bombs [bombas panfleteras] exploded a few seconds apart near Espana Plaza. One of the bombs went off at a Mexican restaurant located accross the street from the plaza and the other at the Mexican Consulate in this capital. In the incident at the consulate, the bomb was hurled at the building from 13th Street in Zone 9, between Reforma Avenue and 7th Avenue. Both explosions caused great damage, particularly the bomb at the restaurant, as you can see in this film clip made by the Municipal Firemen's Public Relations Department. The link between these incidents and the internal conflict in Mexico became evident with the dissemination of leaflets with phrases such as: Let us back the Zapatists! Viva Bishop Samuel Ruiz! Long live the Indian movement! Viva Andres Giron! The other side of the sheet read: Viva Menchu! The sheet also bore the letterhead of the Peasant Unity Committee [Comite de Unidad Campesina -- CUP]. A few days ago, a similar attack was carried out in downtown Mazatenango. Nevertheless, popular organizations are categorically rejecting any link between Guatemalan popular groups and the Mexican guerrillas. They say claims of such links are resulting from a clumsy manipulation of the Mexican problem.
