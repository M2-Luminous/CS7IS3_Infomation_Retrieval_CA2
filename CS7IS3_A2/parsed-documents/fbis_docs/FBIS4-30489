This program was approved by the Miyazawa cabinet in June 1992 on the basis of a report submitted by the Economic Council. The program provided for the major objective of diverting emphasis from a corporate society that stressed efficiency to a society that emphasized the perspective of individuals and consumers, and it suggested the basic direction for management of the economy until fiscal year 1996 calling for improvement of the living environment and shortening of work hours. Specific goals included land measures to enable the purchase of quality homes in urban areas at a cost of five times the average annual salary and shortening annual work hours to 1,800. An increase in cost burden of the program goals to be imposed on the public was considered inevitable, but was to be minimized to the degree possible.] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] I see that in your book Failure or Recovery--Urgent Proposals for the Japanese Economy, you assert that an affluent nation is not feasible as an extension of a Japanese-style economic giant. [Uchihashi] I believe that we were able to become an economic giant because we chose a method that kept us from becoming an affluent nation. We cannot hope to become an affluent nation just because we succeeded in becoming an economic giant. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Just what are you trying to say? In postwar Japan, ultra-low-interest policies were used to provide industry with low-cost funds through financial institutions. As a result, industry was able to build production facilities which were adequate in terms of international competition. "Operations using the buying power of underlying assets" in the form of the collateral value of differences between book value and market price was also encouraged. On the other hand, low-interest rates on savings and soaring land prices obstructed household efforts to accumulate wealth and families were forced to buy goods at prices that exceeded export prices. Unless we take measures to alter this transfer of income from households to industry, goals such as emphasis on the individual and consumer as stated in the Five-Year Program for an Affluent Nation will merely serve as catchphrases. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] On the other hand, I hear that erstwhile growth policies have reached their limits. [Uchihashi] It has come to the point where the Japanese economic specialty of pursuing the effects of mass production is no longer effective. Specifically, automobile, electronic equipment, and machine tool manufacturers would compete in the world market by increasing production and attaining growth through reducing manufacturing costs on a unit basis. However, the makers now face a situation in which the costs of pursuing the effects of mass production now exceed the benefits of such mass production. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Why is it that they have reached such a limit? [Uchihashi] Continuing pursuit of the benefits of mass production requires a massive consumption market, but the domestic market has ceased to grow. The U.S. market had served as a bottomless consumer of the difference in Japanese domestic supply and demand, but the United States under the Clinton administration nows says that they do not welcome such an approach. On the other hand, the marketing approach of generating replacement buying through design changes on a short four-year cycle is no longer effective. In addition to the inability to borrow based on undeclared book value which has made fund procurement more difficult, the cost of capital expansion has also skyrocketed. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the switch to dependency on the Asian market? [Uchihashi] Considering the present situation in which dependence on the U.S. markets has hit a brick wall and direct investments in Asia have increased sharply in response to the strong yen, the industrial world hinges its future on the formation of a yen-based Asian economic sphere. However, I feel any attempt of that nature will not succeed. East Asia already comes under the U.S. sphere of influence and is a member of the dollar-based economic sphere. Excessive export-dependence-style growth structures are also unsustainable. In the future, we need to establish strong consumer markets in Japan. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What sort of ideas do you have in that respect? [Uchihashi] We need to build social capital systems that rest on concepts that minimize social costs, such as those arising from commuter congestion and traffic accidents, by providing roadways that permit the coexistence of people and vehicles such as those in Europe which are partitioned into two-level, triple conduits providing for movement of people, bicycles and motorcycles, and motor vehicles. I am speaking of building a new infrastructure that gives priority to conditions conducive to providing for comfortable lifestyles and attendant expansion in domestic demand. Further, as is the case with the German Workers' Property Formation System, the program should provide for construction of urban environments and aggressive government promotion of preferential fiscal and tax treatment for formation of individual assets such as privately owned homes, thus contributing to the building of a strong consumer society. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It appears that you also foresee a change in the environment for businesses. [Uchihashi] Strong competitors for businesses such as consumer cooperatives have arrived on the scene. People have come to realize that businesses are not the only providers of goods and services. I also think that, as the unemployment rate climbs, we will see the formation of workers cooperatives which will allow workers themselves to take the initiative in finding new employment. Government assistance to be extended to such organizations will also mostly likely become policy issues.
