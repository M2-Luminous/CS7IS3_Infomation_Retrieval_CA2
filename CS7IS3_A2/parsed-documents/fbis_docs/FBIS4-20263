While modern technologies have helped revolutionise the manufacturing sector, agricultural penury persists. Tia Maria Silva, a 63-year-old fruit picker in Lagamecas, edging the Alentejo, earns 2 pounds an hour. She lives in one of the pockets of poverty and underdevelopment described last week by President Mario Soares as "thorns on the rose of Portuguese democracy". But the country has also entered the modern era: it has one of the highest rates of digital phone use in Europe; there are projected new multi-media data highways, and plans for science and technology parks and industry-oriented research centres. The Auto-Europa plant, a Joint Ford-Volkswagen venture, is evidence of Portugal's growing competitive edge since it entered the EC in 1986. The project is credited with helping push the country's manufacturing infrastructure into the next century. The first generation of children born in the democratic era, dubbed the "blue jeans and ecology set", are also coming of age. Raised in a multi-party system that tolerates free speech, their values are different to those of their parents, who lived under the fascists and were taught to respect church and authority. But the new generation has its problems, mostly caused by the generally low standard of the universal and formerly free education. Schooling is a national Achilles heel, there were 16 governments between 1974 and 1987, each with its own education programme. The young are locked in a battle for jobs and security and face a tide of hard drug and alcohol abuse. Racism, against black immigrants is growing. Senhor Eduardo Almeida Catroga, the Finance Minister, recently warned that manufacturing competitiveness was being compromised by poorly-trained managers, while "generally low national levels of schooling" were hurting the modernisation drive. His concerns are shared by parents and students, whose regular protests have rattled the government over the past two years. There was relief in Europe when the present ruling Social Democrats won the first of two straight parliamentary majorities and secured political stability. The revolution restored democracy, opening the door to EC membership, and Senhor Soares, then foreign minister and Socialist Party leader, never tired of saying: "The EC is Portuguese democracy's life insurance policy." If one figure towers over the rest it is Senhor Soares. Polls published this week show 54 per cent of those questioned regard him as having the most significant influence on public life since 1974. His efforts laid the groundwork for the modern Portugal, and many citizens are clearly grateful.
