FR940114-0-00003 FR940114-0-00001 Emergency Action The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an emergency exists that warrants publication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to prevent the Mediterranean fruit fly from spreading to noninfested areas of the United States. Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the Federal Register . After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the Federal Register . It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive Order 12866. This interim rule affects the interstate movement of regulated articles from the Wilmington area of Los Angeles County, CA. There are approximately 223 small entities that could be affected, including 122 fruit sellers, 21 nurseries, 6 distributors, 7 growers, 50 vendors, 6 food banks, 1 farmers' market, and 10 swapmeets. These small entities comprise less than 1 percent of the total number of similar small entities operating in the State of California. In addition, most of these small entities sell regulated articles primarily for local intrastate, not interstate, movement, and the sale of these articles would not be affected by this interim regulation. In the new quarantined area in Los Angeles County, the effect on those few small entities that do move regulated articles interstate from parts of the quarantined areas will be minimized by the availability of various treatments that, in most cases, will allow these small entities to move regulated articles interstate with very little additional cost. Also, many of these entities sell other items in addition to the regulated articles so that the effect, if any, of this regulation on these entities should be minimal. Further, the number of affected entities is small compared with the thousands of small entities that move these articles interstate from nonquarantined areas in California and other States. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
