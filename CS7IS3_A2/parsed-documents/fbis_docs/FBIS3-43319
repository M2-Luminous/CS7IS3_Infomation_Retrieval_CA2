Christophe Nkurunziza visited Mugongomanga commune. [Begin recording] [Nkurunziza] Bujumbura rural is a province which had become peaceful after the tragic events experienced in Burundi. However, after the New Year's festivities, a resurgence of violence has been seen in the communes of Isale and Mugongomanga. The governor of the province of Bujumbura rural, Dr. Aloys Hakizimana, will give us the facts. [passage omitted] How many houses were burned, how many people died, and how many were injured? [Hakizimana] According to a report sent to me by the head of the Kibuye Zone on 2 January 32 houses were burned down with five people seriously injured and one very seriously. Three of them were transferred to [words indistinct] Kamenge while 15 others who were slightly injured were treated at the health center in Kibuye, and they have returned home. In Kibuye [words indistinct] we counted [words indistinct] 20 houses burned. In Mugongomanga, [words indistinct] reports of the commander of the district of Bujumbura say that ten houses were burned down. [end recording] After investigations, the number of houses burned down is put at 12 for Mugongomanga, while 52 were burned down in Isale. The reported violence has an ethnic connotation. The governor of the province of rural Bujumbura has this to say: [Begin Hakizimana recording] It is very clear. Mugongomanga Province is predominantly Tutsi while the Isale commune is predominantly Hutu. On both sides, in Mugongomanga and Isale, there are Hutu who fled some localities of Gisagwe where there were confrontations during the crisis. The second phase of the crisis was in Mugongomanga commune. In Mugongomanga there is a Tutsi population which was displaced, which fled Isale commune. So, it can be called ethnic.
