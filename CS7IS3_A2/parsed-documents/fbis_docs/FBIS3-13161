The three had planned to stab Jews and stage a big terror attack in downtown Jerusalem. Our police affairs correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that the three admitted they had planned to stab a settler, a policeman, or a soldier and that they had thrown stones at policemen and worshipers at the Western Wall. The police investigation revealed that 24-year old Jamal Basti and his two cohorts, whose names were banned from publication, had planned to steal an Israeli car and use it to smuggle arms out of Tulkarm in order to stage a terror attack in Israel. The Jerusalem Magistrates Court remanded the three in custody until the end of legal proceedings.
