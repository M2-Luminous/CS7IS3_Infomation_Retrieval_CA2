He gave him a message from Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the Presidential Council chairman, to Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The message concerns ties between our country and the PRC as well as the latest developments in our country. The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that during the meeting, Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential Council member, briefed the Chinese vice president, and through him the Chinese leadership, on the events and the bloody battles imposed on our people by the forces of apostasy and secession, which have violated the will of the people and dealt a treacherous blow to their aspirations and great achievements. Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani stressed that Yemen rejects any attempt to interfere in its domestic affairs. He also underlined the need to respect the political aspirations of the Yemeni people in unity, democracy, and progress. The brother Presidential Council member voiced the appreciation of Yemen -- both people and government -- for the attitude displayed by the Chinese Government in the international forums in support of the Yemeni people's aspirations, unity, and democratic march. For his part, the Chinese vice president welcomed Brother 'Abd- al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani. He reviewed the ties between the Yemeni and Chinese peoples and stressed the need to continue and improve cooperation in all fields. He also said he regrets what is going on in Yemen and said he hopes problems will be resolved through dialogue. He asked the Presidential Council member to convey his and the Chinese president's greetings to the Yemeni leadership and people. In a related development, a lengthy meeting was held between 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential Council member, and Qian Qichen, China's vice premier and foreign minister. The brother Presidential Council member reviewed all developments in our country and shed light on all attitudes and attempts by our country's political leadership under Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the Presidential Council chairman, to resolve the political crisis. That crisis started in 19 August 1993 and escalated since then according to a planned scheme by the gang of apostasy and secession, starting with the seclusion [of Ali Salim al-Bid] and the political maneuvers, and ending with the ill-omened declaration of secession, which directed a stab to the will of our people and their national principles. He also stressed that all legitimate constitutional institutions are keen to start the dialogue within the framework of the national constants, particularly unity, democracy, and respect for constitutional legitimacy and its institutions. He explained that the political leadership has responded favorably to all the good initiatives by the brothers and friends. He stressed that Yemen abides by UN Security Council Resolution 924 on the situation in our country and supports all the efforts seeking to help resolve problems within the framework of the national constants, respect for the principle of noninterference in domestic affairs, and the protection of Yemen's sovereignty and unity. The Chinese vice premier and foreign minister voiced his appreciation for the clarifications made by 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al- Ghani, Presidential Council member. He said China was among the first states to support Yemeni unity when it was established in 1990 since Yemen, a country with a great history and an old civilization, has always been a united country. He regretted the fighting in Yemen and wished Yemen, a friend of China, unity, prosperity, stability, and progress. He underlined his country's position, which supports the solution of crises through peaceful dialogue and noninterference in the others' affairs since this is one of the most important principles on which international relations are based. The two meetings were attended by Brother Ghalib Sa'id al-Abukhi, our ambassador in Beijing. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential Council member, received at his place of residence in the Guest House in Beijing the brother Arab ambassadors and heads of diplomatic missions, as well as the Arab League representative. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani gave a comprehensive review of the developments in our country. He also answered the ambassadors' questions. They all wished Yemen stability and prosperity under the canopy of its unity, which is considered a gain for all citizens of the Arab and Muslim nations.
