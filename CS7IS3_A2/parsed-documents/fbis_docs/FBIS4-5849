Several important conferences such as the provisional meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are scheduled for the month. Among them, one that commands special attention is the seven-nation (G-7) meeting of financial ministers and central bank presidents. Normally, the G-7 meetings are preceded by a G-2 meeting between Japan and the United States. Past practice called for the two nations to meet and to attend the G-7 meeting after arriving at a basic understanding. It has not been the case that a complete agreement would be reached on all issues and there were times when the meetings would result in unanticipated problem areas. However, a comparison of notes in advance enabled a more meaningful debate during the formal G-7 meetings. But, this time around, the picture is different. A deadlock in the Japan-U.S. collective talks on trade has led to a complete suspension of a Japan-U.S. dialogue. Even the "Japan-U.S. Yen-Dollar Committee" which once served as an important venue for exchanging information and discussing policy matter has ceased to function. The coming G-7 conferences will be held under unusual circumstances. Moreover, issues to be laid on tabled will be of major proportions. Just as Japan will be asked to implement economic stimulus packages, the other nations face major issues. However, if an attempt were to be made in focusing on a single common issue, that topic would cover the question of whether a rise in long-term interest rates can be stopped. Expansion in international balance of payments deficits, an expensive yen, and cheap dollar serve as a background for an incipient rise in U.S. interest rates. Germany still faces the need to liquidate the costs of unifying East and West Germany. Japan cannot remain unconcerned as the environment continues to build for rising long-term interest rates in Europe and the United States. In fact, it might be more accurate to say that Japan is now a direct participant in the move towards higher interest rates. Issuance of debt instruments in the form of government bonds to handle the expansion of public works projects, of debt instruments by regional autonomous government entities, and of government deficit bonds following the cut in income taxes have cast a dark cloud over the Japanese bond market. A continuation of these trends is likely to expose the Japanese financial structure to the problems that struck the United States during President Reagan's administration. In those days, U.S. bond markets reacted sharply to the U.S. national deficit picture on a day-to-day basis. The U.S. demand for Japan to employ such financial measures to stimulate domestic demand will cause higher Japanese interest rates and turmoil in bond markets. Essentially, the simplistic theory that financial measures should be deployed to expand domestic demand is no longer valid. A rapid rise in long-term interest rates will ruin the world economy. Even as they concern the U.S. economy alone, rising interest rates run the risk of a "triple fall" in the form of a weaker dollar, lower bond prices, and a drop in stock prices. Rising interest rates will also have a profound effect on developing nations and former communist bloc nations. There is the risk that high interest rates will preclude the availability of funds for those nations that need huge sums of capital to attain greater economic expansion or to move towards a market economy. Even if sufficient funds exist on a worldwide basis, high interest rates will preclude those funds from being shifted to areas where they are needed. There is the risk that a very illogical situation will arise, even from the standpoint of a balance between savings and investment. That failure to take action to counter current trends could result in the worldwide spread of problems is an awareness that should be gradually embraced by the G-7 member nations. Certainly, the fact that U.S. authorities expressed themselves selectively on previous occasions about a persistent trend in a high yen-cheap dollar situation may have been a reflection of awareness that there was a need to give priority to international financial cooperative measures. Even in Europe, there is a strong feeling of crisis about rising long-term interest rates amidst an economic slowdown. The upcoming G-7 conference should severely question just how much the various nations share in such awareness and just how much cooperation can be exercised in coping with such issues. The G-7 forum is not one in which specific policy decisions are made. The G-7 serves as a forum in which representatives of the member nations engage in a frank discussion about international finance. Policy decisions and their implementation are handled by the respective member nations, but discussions in the G-7 forum are supposed to be reflected in the financial policies of member nations. Under rapid deregulation of international financial markets, bond and currency exchange markets move sharply as if to reflect the intentions of various international leaders. The question is just how much can the member nations cooperate in the cause to prevent a worldwide rise in interest rates? One wonders if we are ready to face the consequences of violent market reactions, resulting from an abortive G-7 meeting in which everyone engages in a free-for-all exchange of unilateral positions and member nations are forced to resort to irresolute countermeasures.
