On 12 April, after listening to briefings given by leaders of Hengshui Prefectural party committee and the administrative office, they particularly touched on the issue of cotton production. The provincial leaders stressed: The State Council has approved our province to experiment with the method of directly linking cotton production with marketing this year. This is the State Council's important measure for supporting Hebei to work hard to bring about an upsurge in cotton production. They said: Directly linking the cotton production with marketing does not mean to decontrol the management. It is to link up the production and marketing under the situation of maintaining the role of the county supply and marketing cooperative as the main business channel and through making cotton textile enterprises sign contracts with the county cotton and flax companies, making the county cotton and flax companies sign contracts with township cotton stations (plants), and making the township cotton stations (plants) sign contracts with peasants. In this way, the cotton circulation links between the province and cities (prefectures) can be reduced, and the funds used for cotton circulation can be saved and returned to peasants. At the same time, based on the state stipulated price, cotton textile enterprises will give a certain amount of funds to peasants to support cotton production. Thus, the returns in growing cotton will be greatly enhanced. The relevant provincial departments are stepping up their efforts to make an estimate and to draft the "method on experimenting with the plan of directly linking cotton production with marketing," which will be issued for implementation after being studied and decided by the provincial party committee and the provincial government. It is necessary to quickly give the peasants this information and make them give up the idea that planting cotton will suffer losses.
