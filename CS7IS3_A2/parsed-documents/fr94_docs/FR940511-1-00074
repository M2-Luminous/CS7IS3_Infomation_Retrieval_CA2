Compliance Dates for Facilities I. Statutory and Regulatory Background These regulations are proposed under the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA). These statutes are commonly referred to as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and are codified at Volume 42 of the United States Code (U.S.C.), sections 6901 to 6992k (42 U.S.C. 6901&hyph;6992k). Section 3001(a) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921(a), requires EPA to promulgate criteria for identifying characteristics of hazardous wastes and for listing hazardous wastes. Section 3001(b) of RCRA requires EPA to promulgate regulations, based on these criteria, identifying and listing hazardous wastes which shall be subject to the requirements of the Act. Hazardous waste is defined at section 1004(5) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6903(5). There are two types of hazardous waste. First, hazardous wastes are those solid wastes which may cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality, serious irreversible illness, or incapacitating reversible illness. In addition, hazardous wastes are those solid wastes which may pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly managed. EPA's regulations establishing criteria for listing hazardous wastes are codified at volume 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) ยง261.11 (40 CFR 261.11). Section 261.11 states three criteria for identifying characteristics and for listing wastes as hazardous.
