That is why, in his opinion, TVP SA is not expected to be interested in investing TVP SA profits in TVPolonia as at present. He says the fact that TVPolonia was set up under Janusz Zaorski, the former head of the state radio and television, who was in conflict with the National Radio and Television Broadcasting Council [KRRiT], may affect this. Danuta Celinska, TVP SA head of programming, has given assurances that the board had no intention of closing down TVPolonia; on the contrary "it is at the heart of our deepest and greatest interests." Also, KRRiT Head Ryszard Bender said that the council was not interested in closing down TVPolonia.
