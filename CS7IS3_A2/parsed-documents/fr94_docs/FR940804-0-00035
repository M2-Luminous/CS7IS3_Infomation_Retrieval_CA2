FR940804-0-00035 FR940804-0-00013 40 CFR Parts 52 and 81 [WA&hyph;19&hyph;1&hyph;6140a; FRL&hyph;5007&hyph;2] Approval and Promulgation of Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Washington AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approves the redesignation of Tacoma, Washington, from unclassifiable to attainment for sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ). On September 22, 1993, the State of Washington, through the Washington State Department of Ecology, submitted a request to redesignate Tacoma from unclassifiable to attainment for sulfur (SO 2 ). The state has met the applicable requirements for redesignation contained in the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA). EFFECTIVE DATE: This action will be effective on October 3, 1994 unless adverse or critical comments are received by September 6, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: Montel Livingston, SIP Manager, Air & Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;082), EPA, Docket WA&hyph;19&hyph;1&hyph;6140, 1200 Sixth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98101. Documents which are incorporated by reference are available for public inspection at the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20460. Copies of material submitted to EPA may be examined during normal business hours at the following locations: EPA, Region 10, Air & Radiation Branch, 1200 Sixth Avenue (AT&hyph;082), Seattle, Washington 98101, and Washington State Department of Ecology, 300 Desmond Drive, Lacey, Washington 98504. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kelly McFadden, Air and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;082), EPA, Seattle, Washington 98101, (206) 553&hyph;1059. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Prior to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments the parabolic shaped area of Tacoma extending approximately 31/2 miles SSW from the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) Plant was designated nonattainment for sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) in relation to the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). 43 FR 9043 (March 3, 1978). The primary source of the pollutant in the Tacoma area was the ASARCO copper smelter, emitting an average of 100 tons of SO 2 per year. On August 6, 1979, based on a stipulated agreement between EPA and ASARCO which was entered in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 78&hyph;1929), EPA proposed redesignation of Tacoma from nonattainment to unclassifiable for SO 2 (44 FR 45970). EPA revoked the nonattainment designation on November 30, 1979 (44 FR 68834). The redesignation was intended to defer the requirement for a Part D (Plan Requirements for Nonattainment Areas) SIP revision. Part D of the CAA requires an applicable implementation plan within 18 months of the designation to nonattainment. The redesignation to unclassifiable allowed EPA to complete rulemaking action under Section 123 of the Act which would allow the use of meteorological curtailment programs to meet ambient air quality standards if the program was in place before 1970. The final rules interpreting Section 123 were published by EPA on April 2, 1986. Through that publication, EPA met the terms of the settlement agreement and was qualified to redesignate Tacoma under Section 107 of the Act. On September 22, 1993, the State of Washington, on behalf of the Governor, submitted to the EPA Regional Administrator a request to redesignate the Tacoma area from unclassifiable to attainment. The CAA does not set forth specific requirements for areas seeking redesignation from unclassifiable to attainment. However, the CAA provides that an attainment area is an area that meets the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for a specific pollutant and does not contribute to poor air quality in a nearby area that does not meet the NAAQS for that pollutant. Therefore, at a minimum, an area needs to meet the NAAQS in order to be redesignated from unclassifiable to attainment. Ambient air quality monitoring from 1980 through 1993 shows attainment of the SO 2 NAAQS in the Tacoma area. The National Air Monitor System (NAMS) and State/Local Air Monitor System (SLAM) monitoring locations changed throughout the 11 years. The NAMS locations include 54th Ave NE, Alexander Ave, 26th and Pearl, Mt Tacoma High School, and Benny's Nursery. Moreover, the state and local standards for air quality are more stringent than the NAAQS, and exceedances have not been recorded for either of these standards since the ASARCO copper smelter plant ceased operation as of March 1984. Therefore, EPA has determined that the SO 2 NAAQS in the Tacoma area has been attained. EPA is further assured that the area will remain in attainment because the ASARCO Copper Smelter, the primary source of SO 2 emissions, permanently ceased operations in March 1984. ASARCO's permanent closure is strengthened by the stack demolition that occurred on January 17, 1993. After the copper smelter ceased operation there was a considerable decrease in sulfur dioxide emissions, as indicated by the continuing emission monitoring of the Tacoma area. II. This Action EPA, in this action, is redesignating Tacoma from unclassifiable to attainment for sulfur dioxide. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial, the State has demonstrated that the area has attained the standard and that the primary source of SO 2 emissions has permanently ceased operation. Therefore, EPA anticipates no adverse comments on this action.
