On 29 March 1994, after receiving news that King Norodom Sihanouk and the queen would return to the motherland on 8 April, His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea, sent a message to his majesty the king. Here is the essence: I am very happy to learn that his majesty the king has been discharged from the hospital in good health and that the king and queen will return to meet with the children of our motherland on 8 April. The entire Cambodian nation and people very much rejoice over this great event. I will be in Phnom Penh on 8 April to join our nation and people in welcoming the king on this joyous occasion. As the king has a tight schedule and his health is not yet fully back to normal, I do not dare ask to see the king and the queen at this time. Please allow me to meet with you and the queen on a day you deem appropriate. 2. On 1 April, the king and queen answered H.E. Khieu Samphan's message through the king's Secretariat in Phnom Penh. The king said he would be pleased to receive H.E. Khieu Samphan and a delegation at the Royal Palace at 1000 on 13 April. 3. On 2 April, after learning that the king and the queen had agreed to receive H.E. Khieu Samphan and a delegation on 13 April, H.E. Khieu Samphan addressed another message to his majesty the king. Here is the essence: Please allow me to express my most profound gratitude to the king and queen for agreeing to receive me and a delegation at the Royal Palace at 1000 on 13 April. As I informed the king in my message dated 29 March, my colleagues and I want to express our respect, fond sentiments, and warmest welcome directly upon the arrival of his majesty the king and the queen at Pochentong Airport. My presence could cause some protocol difficulties, however, as well as security problems. For this reason, please allow me to send a delegation to Phnom Penh, with H.E. Chan Youran as my representative, to express directly my warmest welcome to the king and queen at Pochentong Airport and to contact the king's Secretariat to prepare for my 12 April trip to meet the king and queen at the Royal Palace on 13 April at 1000, as scheduled. 4. On 5 April, his majesty the king sent another message to H.E. Khieu Samphan through the king's Secretariat, informing H.E. Khieu Samphan that there are many problems concerning his planned trip to Phnom Penh. These problems result from the fact that the Cambodian state authorities -- whether the police or the force accompanying the visit -- do not have the goodwill to give any consideration to the arrival, escort, or return of H.E. Khieu Samphan. They also will not give any consideration whatsoever to H.E. Khieu Samphan's security in Phnom Penh. On top of this, there is no guarantee -- even 60 percent -- of H.E. Khieu Samphan's security, or for that of the Democratic Kampuchean delegation as it is traveling from Pochentong to Phnom Penh, during its stay in Phnom Penh, or in the Royal Palace. The king said: I cannot find any trusted person to accompany the Democratic Kampuchean delegation from Pochentong to Phnom Penh and back. With such a bad situation, it is better for you to meet me in Beijing in June.
