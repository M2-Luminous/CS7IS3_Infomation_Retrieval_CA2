This follows reports of an ANC plan to boycott a provincial legislature meeting in Ulundi. Mr. Tino Volker of the NP called for a special sitting of the provincial legislature to appoint an advisory committee on the site for a capital. Meanwhile, the ANC has confirmed it will boycott the next sitting of the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature which is scheduled to be held in Ulundi at the end of this month. The ANC said it was politically wrong to hold the meeting in the IFP stronghold.
