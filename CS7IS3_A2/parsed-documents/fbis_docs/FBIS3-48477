Bureaucrats were disappointed and felt uneasy about this incident on the eve of the compilation of the pump-priming package and the fiscal 1994 budget. With the Japan-U.S. summit in February near at hand, (a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] noted) "we do not know when and what kind of pump-priming package we can work out, and this will make the attitude of the United States unpredictable." While the Ministry of Finance [MOF] usually reacts coolly to developments in political circles, senior officials were busily engaged in information-gathering in the evening. "What the deuce is going on?" Earlier in the day, senior MOF officials hurriedly called on the prime minister's office, and it appeared they were perplexed with the information that the bills were likely to be killed at the upper house. Immediately after television reported the upper house decision, top MOF officials gathered at Vice Minister Jiro Saito's office. They reportedly agreed to "watch development of the situation since the political scene is so uncertain." The MOF then started analyzing possible directions of the political scene. MOFA and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] are concerned about possible delays in economic policies in preparation for the Japan-U.S. summit. MITI Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano said the incident is "no big deal," but he looked nervous. A senior MITI official said: "The prime minister cannot go to the United States if the government fails in hammering out the new pump-priming package. I am really worried about the direction of the tax system reform." The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo held an emergency meeting in the evening, probably to study possible influences on Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's Tokyo visit. An embassy official said "we thought the possibility (of defeat of the bills) was 50-50." As the coordinator of economic policies, the Economic Planning Agency is becoming tired of the "political agenda badly affecting our job" (as noted by a senior official). If the agency has to work out the pump-priming package before settling the tax reform issue, the package will inevitably be less effective. The Labor, Health and Welfare, and Transportation ministries are all concerned the uncertainty of the political situation may delay the compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget, and this would affect their employment, welfare, and railroad construction policies. A senior Labor Ministry official said: "Taking the worsened employment rate into account, we are now in big trouble."
