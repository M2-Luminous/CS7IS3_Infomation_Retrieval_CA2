After three years in office, Hugh Morgan, managing director of the Western Mining Corporation, left the chairmanship of the Chamber. His place was taken by John Ralph, one of the most prominent Australian captains of industry. He is managing director of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia and president of the influential Business Council of Australia. The meeting mainly discussed Australia's role as a springboard for Asia, as a location for branch offices of German enterprises, and as a partner in trilateral cooperation. "The Asia-Pacific Conference in Bangkok has provided positive signals that German industry and the German Government are at last devoting proper attention to this region of economic growth," explained Bernd Schlickum, chairman of the Chamber's board of management. "Australia is clearly recognized as a part of this region. Sixty percent of its exports have already gone to Asian countries." The presence of Senator Bob McMullan, Australian minister of trade, served to underline the importance that the Australian Labor Government attaches to Germany's involvement in Australia. "The relations between our countries have expanded considerably over the past few years," said the minister. "Today, one notes a shift in the balance of economic power. Despite our concentration on the Asia-Pacific region, we shall not turn our back on Europe," he promised. McMullan was particularly pleased by the fact that German enterprises are establishing regional offices on the fifth continent. With a level of investments exceeding 6.4 billion Australian dollars (7.6 billion German marks), Germany is in third position regarding the size of investments by EU [European Union] countries in Australia. Franz Keil, German ambassador in Canberra, said the difficulty lies in encouraging smaller German enterprises to embark on the long road to Asia. Keil said the German Embassy would do more to help establish contacts between German and Australian enterprises. Heinrich Zimmermann, managing director of the Chamber, made it clear that an intensification of the Chamber's economic functions is essential if only because of the fact that Germany has curtailed subsidies for foreign trade chambers. "In the future, the trade chambers must concentrate on profit-bearing activity, adapt their services to the new situation, and at the same time undertake harsh cost-saving measures," said Zimmermann. Continuing with his business report, Zimmermann said that German firms' search for representatives or importers in Australia has increased. "But many German companies still seem oblivious to the fact that such half-hearted attempts to establish contacts offer only limited prospects of success," he said. "Obviously they do not want to avail themselves of the expert services of the chamber of trade, such as market analyses and the finding of suitable partners, because these services cost money." In 1994, trade between Australia and Germany rose by 12 percent. In 1992-93, 5 to 7 percent of Australia's imports came from Germany, so that Germany occupies fourth place among Australia's most important supplier countries.
