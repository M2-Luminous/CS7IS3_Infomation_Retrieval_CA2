The ethylene plants of various petrochemical companies have a surplus over about 20 percent, but it is due to manufacturers one after the other suspending plant operations with the objective of production adjustment and there conversely becoming a sense of product shortage. Previously, other companies in the industry accommodated each other on shortages, but a big deficit on synthetic resins has affected various companies and recently they have begun to be reluctant to accommodate at cheap prices, spurring an increase in imports. Imports began to increase in April this year. According to trade statistics, the amount of imports for April was 11,500 tons (no record of imports for the same month of the previous year). It was double that of March, and nearly half of the amount of 1993 imports (24,834 tons) was achieved within the one month of April. The importer for the most part has been South Korea. All ethylene manufacturers such as Showa Denko, Mitsui Petrochemical, Maruzen Petrochemical, and Tonen Chemical, are buying. The price of South Korean ethylene is about 40 to 45 yen per kilo. While some say that the reason for imports is that "There is a temporary shortage of ethylene due to suspending operations for regularly scheduled plant repairs" (Maruzen Petrochemical), there also are manufacturers who point out that, "Imports can be bought cheaper than buying domestic" (Showa Denko).
