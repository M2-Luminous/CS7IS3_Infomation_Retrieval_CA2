FBIS TRENDS-6APR94-CHINA-LIBYA-UN Beijing Reiterates Stance Against Sanctions Beijing Reiterates Stance Against Sanctions In a move that could complicate international efforts to maintain pressure on Libya for its alleged involvement in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988 and a French airliner in 1989, Beijing has forcefully reiterated its opposition to sanctions against Libya and expressed greater support for Libya's position than in the past. Meeting with Libyan foreign minister 'Umar Mustafa al- Muntasir on the second day of his 28-30 March visit to Beijing, PRC Foreign Minister and Vice Premier Qian Qichen restated the position Beijing adopted against sanctions when it intensified its support of Libya prior to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) vote imposing sanctions in March 1992. According to a 29 March Xinhua account of the talks, Qian said that Beijing continues to "disapprove of imposing sanctions against Libya, let alone stepping up sanctions," and "favors settlement of the Lockerbie crisis through consultation and negotiation by the parties concerned." Reiterating China's "opposition to terrorism of any description," Qian said that the sanctions had "escalated tensions in the region" and should be settled "through peaceful means." Last November the PRC Ambassador to the United Nations Li Zhaoxing had similarly registered Beijing's authoritative opposition to new UNSC sanctions against Libya, declaring that "to intensify sanctions" against Libya may further "complicate" the problem (Xinhua, 12 November 1993). Although Qian's remarks did not revise China's official stance on sanctions, he seemed to express stronger public support for Libya's views than has appeared in previous PRC media coverage of the issue, treatment suggesting that Beijing wishes to further distance itself from the West on this question. Stating that "China fully understands and sympathizes with Libya's plight" and "does not want to see the situation worsen," Qian went on to express "appreciation" for Libya's "flexibility" in trying to settle the problem through "peaceful negotiations." Qian gave no indication of how China will vote on any future UNSC resolutions to toughen the sanctions. China abstained from voting on Resolution 748 authorizing sanctions in 1992 and again on the UNSC resolution approving new sanctions last November (Xinhua, 31 March 1992, 12 November 1993).
