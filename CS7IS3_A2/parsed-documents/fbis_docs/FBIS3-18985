EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said U.S. efforts to force open the Japanese market with numerical targets were inefficient, and violated commitments to free trade and multilateral dispute settlement. He also warned the United States to exhaust all dispute-settling procedures of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) before resorting to its newly-reactivated Super 301 regulation which allows trade reprisals. Brittan's statement was a low-key reaction to remarks in Washington on Wednesday by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who attacked the European Union for previous criticism of American trade policy towards Japan. "The European Union is as determined as the United States to see Japan enforcing bold measures that will help reduce the excessive trade surplus that exists both with the United States and the European Union," Brittan said. Last month the EU commissioner suggested a "trilateral approach" involving Brussels, Washington, and Tokyo to negotiate easier access to the Japanese market. Kantor said on Wednesday that the United States was ready for such an approach. Brittan replied: "I am ready to begin work immediately with the United States and Japan to resolve these difficulties." Japan had a trade surplus of more than 50 billion dollars with the United States in 1993, and about 26 billion dollars with the European Union. Fighting trade talk across the North Atlantic has flared up again less than five weeks ahead of the April 15 signing date for the Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations. Kantor accused the European Union on Wednesday of hypocrisy for sniping at Washington during its trade dispute with Japan, while at the same time taking advantage of the U.S. market-opening leverage. He also attacked EU trade barriers against foreign films and television programmes, telecommunications equipment, cars and trucks. Brittan replied: "The European Union also has a very long list of U.S. trade barriers, some of which have been in existence for decades and which cause distortions to international trade. ``What we must all do is to work to remove them constructively through negotiation, rather than resorting to finger-pointing,'' the EU trade commissioner said. An EU spokesman said U.S. trade barriers included discriminatory taxes on European cars and passenger vans, and the Buy America Act -- which effectively shut European firms out of airport, road, rail and underground rail projects.
