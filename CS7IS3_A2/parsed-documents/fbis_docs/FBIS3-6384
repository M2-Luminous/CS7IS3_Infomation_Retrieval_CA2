Yutaka Kume, head of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association [AMA], told reporters that Kantor's comment, made earlier in the week, would dampen Japanese carmakers' efforts to help put Japan's trade ties with the United States back on a normal footing. Referring to a remark by International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai calling on Japanese automakers to quickly make public their auto parts purchase plans, Kume said it is an individual corporate problem and not a government issue. Kume, who is also president of Nissan Motor Co., Japan's No. 2 automaker, said the government should not comment on carmakers' plans, as this tends to cause misunderstanding.
