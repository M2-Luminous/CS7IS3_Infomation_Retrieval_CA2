FR940513-2-00079 FR940513-2-00039 Domestic violence is an ongoing, debilitating experience with profound dehumanizing consequences: the battering of body and soul; the increased isolation from the outside world; the toll on personal freedom, and; the foreboding sense that countervailing resources are beyond one's grasp. Whenever a woman is placed in physical danger or controlled by threat or use of physical force, she has been abused. The risk is greatest when a woman is separated from supportive networks. Physical/sexual abuse is recurrent and escalates in frequency and severity. It is often accompanied by emotional and psychological abuse. Older women who experience domestic violence are in a unique situation, compared to younger women. They may have endured a violent relationship for years or the abuse may begin late in the life of a relationship, brought on by age-related changes in either or both partners, such as retirement or declining physical and mental health. In trying to leave a violent relationship, older women face obstacles that are different from those faced by younger battered women, obstacles linked to family relationships, health, employment, finances, and to the psychological costs of starting over late in life. Although older battered women can turn to the domestic violence/domestic abuse system, few do. With some notable exceptions, most local domestic violence programs do not address the needs or concerns of older women. Efforts focus on younger women and women with children. Staff are not familiar with the aging process. In addition, the majority of shelters have not been accessible to older women with physical disabilities, although the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1992 will undoubtedly provide an impetus for change. Applications are invited from public and non-profit organizations engaged in implementing either local domestic abuse programs or statewide domestic violence programs. Applications should include the following: (1) A plan for providing services designed to meet the physical, psychological, and economic needs of older women, including physically disabled women; (2) A plan that demonstrates a coordinated systems approach to gaining the cooperation of community agencies such as aging services providers, domestic violence shelters, religious institutions, health, emergency medical services, mental health, legal services, law enforcement, and criminal justice; (3) A plan that includes cross training between aging and domestic violence organizations; (4) An endorsement of the program by the Area Agency on Aging if the program is local, an endorsement by the State Agency on Aging if the program is statewide; and (5) A plan for measuring the amount of linkages being established between the aging and domestic violence organizations, the numbers of older women being reached through outreach programs, and the number of older women being effectively served. Among the key elements which should be considered for inclusion in a coordinated system to protect older women against domestic violence are (1) safe housing, advocacy, and support of women, (2) criminal justice system action, (3) effective civil protection, (4) counseling/education groups for the men who batter, (5) systems cooperation, and (6) coordination, participation by, and accountability to battered women. All public and nonprofit agencies and organizations are eligible to apply under this priority area. Applicants must demonstrate a strong knowledge base and an extensive experience of providing services to women who are victims of domestic violence. Preference will be given to applicants with demonstrated extensive experience in providing services to older women. As appropriate, applicants are encouraged to develop close linkages with State and Area Agencies on Aging in the development of the application and the implementation of the project. AoA expects to fund approximately 3&hyph;5 projects under this priority area with a federal share of approximately $125,000 per year and an estimated project period of two (2) years. The deadline date for submission of applications under this priority area is July 12, 1994. (3) Nutrition and Malnutrition Among the Elderly 3.1‚ê£National Resource and Policy Center on Nutrition and Aging Optimal nutritional status is essential to the well-being, health, independence, and quality of life for everyone, from well, healthy individuals to frail, vulnerable, functionally impaired individuals. Access to adequate food that provides essential nutrients is a daily issue for all Americans, but becomes a more significant issue if an individual is elderly.
