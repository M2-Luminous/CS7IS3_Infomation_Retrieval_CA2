FBIS3-59198 "drweu019__a94016" FBIS-WEU-94-019-A Document Type:Daily Report 28 January 1994 ANNEX Germany Steelmaking Division Causes Record Losses at Thyssen AU2801123694 Hamburg DPA in German 0904 GMT 27 Jan 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2801123694 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- Large losses in its steelmaking division pushed the entire Thyssen group deep into the red last year. Thyssen AG announced today when presenting its annual accounts for the financial year, which ended on 30th September 1993, that its losses of 994 million German marks [DM] represented a new record in the company's history. A year ago, the group, with its three divisions, steel, capital goods, and commerce, generated an annual surplus of DM348 million. Thyssen cut around 12,000 jobs in its domestic companies, and employed a worldwide workforce of 133,800 at the end of December. The steel and capital goods divisions were particularly affected by job losses. Staff cuts would continue in these sectors, Thyssen said. The board of management described the results as "wholly unsatisfactory." The company added that its worldwide turnover during the 1992/93 financial year fell 6 percent to DM33.5 billion. However, turnover during the first quarter of the 1993/94 financial year rose again by 1.2 percent to DM8.1 billion. Turnover shrank in the steel and capital goods divisions by 7 and 10 percent respectively. Economic results for the period October to December 1993 remained marked by high steel sector losses. The company is expecting largely negative results for the whole of this year, albeit with "continuous improvement each quarter."
