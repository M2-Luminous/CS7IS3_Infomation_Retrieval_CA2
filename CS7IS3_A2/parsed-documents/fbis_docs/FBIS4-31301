The celebrations were, however, not without blemishes. The greatest and most criticized fault was probably the failure to invite representatives of Russia. Is the importance of opening the second front overrated, at the expense of the role the USSR played in the war? [Klaus] Look, I do not want to comment on absolutely everything because, if I do, I am most often criticized from all sides. I am, therefore, speaking with some embarrassment. Nevertheless, I have been living for decades in a world where I thought--I am overstating this slightly--that it was only the Red Army that fought in World War II and that the war in the West was only a shadow war that was utterly irrelevant with regard to the final result of the war. Naturally, I knew that this was nonsense. If, however, the impression is now being made that the exact opposite was true, then I am, in principle, against this sort of interpretation of history that swings from one extreme to the other. It really seems to me to be substantially false. [passage omitted] [Weissova] On 6 June, the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] executive, among other things, dealt with the proposal for new parliamentary procedures. The ODS cabinet members have been authorized to try to ensure that there is no change in the relations between the government and parliament. According to you, some proposals for the new parliamentary procedure seem to go in this direction. Can you specify what they are? [Klaus] [passage omitted] What I am really concerned about is the fact that a specific interruption has occurred in the interaction between the government and parliament. We have grown accustomed to certain methods of interaction. They became a habit. We have--all of us--mastered these methods to some extent. It seems somewhat useless to pull them down. The interaction between the government and parliament is a process triggered by the government putting forward an idea and embodying it in a so-called proposal of principles for a particular law. This is not a fully worked out document. Really, it contains only rough ideas, concepts by which we tell ourselves and the parliament that this is probably the way and these are the basic outlines of the law. Parliament, parliamentary committees, discuss this material. The government then is given back the document, and the bill is then drafted on this basis. After this stage, the document will be submitted to parliament again. It seems to me that this ping-pong, this interaction, is successful. Moreover, we have grown accustomed to it, and I think that it is working error free. The stage of debating main ideas of a bill is now disappearing from the new procedures, and the government is being asked to submit a bill directly. This means that the dispute, the debate, the mutual enrichment while working on the bill will be missing. I consider this to be a specific weakening of the mutual relations between the government and parliament. [passage omitted]
