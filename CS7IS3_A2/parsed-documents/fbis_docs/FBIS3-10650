Yet, while on a honeymoon with the future, he nonetheless begins to show signals of decline. Although this advantage over his probable contenders remains unchanged (an advantage that will now begin to shrink), a recent poll shows that the rejection rate for Lula jumped from 54 percent in September to 80 percent at the beginning of February. This shows that his excursions through the interior of Brazil are being neutralized by the internal crisis in the PT [Workers Party] and by the backward and intransigent image of this opposition party. Voters have certainly noticed the incongruity of one who attacks Brazilian leaders just as they are recycling themselves in democracy and who suggests as an alternative for Brazil a model that did not work anywhere in the world. Surprisingly, Deputy Jose Genoino (PT-SP) [Sao Paulo] recently stated in an article that the decision by the party to abstain from the constitutional reform process -- which was imposed by the radical majority of the PT executive board -- is equivalent to partially curtailing the political mandate of PT congressmen. What is worse, this abstention has seriously damaged the PT's public image by disseminating the idea that it is a sectarian party. Genoino believes the decision resembles the centralist and authoritarian tradition of the decayed Communist parties, and that it will harm the candidacy of Lula just as a ferocious struggle over state reform and economic matters that affects the workers' lives is taking place. We must repeat: These opposition party members are not progressive; they are conservative, they do not evolve, they block congress sessions, and they torpedo initiatives. Their stubbornness in defending the intangibility of a Constitution they did not even sign is incongruous. The only explanation is that the PT does not believe a market economy cannot be refined, and it harbors the unconfessed wish to destroy it. The public is nonetheless receptive to test demonstrations. It is very well known that the privatization of the iron and steel mills has increased the productivity of that industry, lowered prices for its clients, and improved the lives of the workers and employees who bought their shares. In face of this highly obvious fact, what is the meaning of the position of a Trotskyist economist member of the PT executive board like Marcus Sokol, who intends to annul all the privatizations already done? How did these fundamentalists -- who are middle-class professors, lawyers, journalists, and sociologists -- kidnap the party from the hands of the Catholic and labor union leadership? It was very simple: The concentration of PT congressmen in Brasilia and Lula's indecisiveness in face of the dogmatic wing has made the congressmen prisoners of abstract principles and simplistic slogans. Although he has the power to exert a vote of wisdom -- as president of the PT -- in favor of participation in the constitutional reform process, Lula preferred to abstain from giving an order and opened the back door to the Shiites. That is the reason for the PT's disquieting polarization, ambivalence, and double talk. Touring the north and northeast with his entourage, Lula -- wearing a straw hat -- said the PT star "is the guide for the birth of Jesus" [as published]. In Rio Grande do Sul Lula promised farmers that he would reduce imports and increase subsidies. At the Fiesp [Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries] he made people believe his party's radical positions are not for real. The fact that Lula used the word "citizons" ["cidadoes," instead of "citizens"] is not serious, but to lead a party haunted by contradictory ghosts of reform and revolution, of competency and subsidies, and economic criteria and populist messianism, is serious. The serious fact is that Lula lacks administrative experience, he has never been mayor or governor, but now he intends to know Brazil through a hurried tour from the dry shrublands to the pampas. VEJA magazine's front page article this week is about Lula's visit to southern Brazil, and it states: "Just 48 hours after spending a few moments in southern Brazil, Lula had earned the right to say; `I know Brazil from Oiapoque to Chui.'" For Lula, hurriedness and perfection go together.
