In "the economic and budget outlook: Fiscal years 1996-1999", the office projected the federal budget deficit to fall from 223 billion U.S. dollars in the current year to below 170 billion dollars in fiscal 1996. "The deficit picture is significantly brighter than it appeared one year ago," the report said. "This distinctly rosier outlook is mostly a consequence of the substantial tax increases and spending cuts enacted last August," said the report. However, the office added, "the deficit is not on a permanent downward path", and will climb up to around 200 billion dollars in fiscal 1999. "Based on recent experience, some observers have doubted that deficits will actually decline as a result of the omnibus budget reconciliation act" which is president Clinton's budget reduction plan, the report said. The office predicted that the real GDP of the country will grow at an annual rate of nearly three percent through 1995, while the unemployment rate will decline from 6.4 percent last December to 6.0 percent at the end of 1995. The prediction by the bipartisan office for 1994 and 1995 is similar to the blue chip consensus of private forecasters, observers here said. Today's report is one of a series of reports on the state of the economy and the budget that the congressional budget office issues each year. In accordance with its mandate to provide "objective and impartial analysis", the 100-page report to the senate and house committees contains no recommendations.
