"Our position is that the final date for the troops' withdrawal should," he stressed, "remain 31 August 1994. There are 2,500 Russian troops in Estonia at present. This minimal number of troops could have been pulled out much sooner. But when Russia proposed a compromise option, giving 31 August as the date, we agreed with her, understanding as we do the difficulties." "Estonia," Luik continued, "welcomes the recent statement by the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin that Russia would not tie the problem of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic region to the withdrawal of its troops. That is the correct position. We also believe that Russia should first fulfill its international obligation and pull out its troops and then we can settle all the other matters." As for the rest, in the opinion of the minister relations between Russia and Estonia are developing normally. "If, for instance, you look at trade links, then they are not bad at all," said Luik. "There is a very active commercial transit and imports from Russia and exports out of Estonia are also active. Part of the humanitarian aid to Russia passes through Estonian ports. The two countries' business circles are developing their cooperation well. We have nothing to complain about on that score." When asked if there was any territorial dispute between Russia and Estonia, Luik replied: "The Estonian side believes that it is necessary to observe the 1920 peace treaty signed in Tartu. But we have always called for this question to be resolved peacefully, at negotiations. We also have proposed resorting to the International Court at the Hague on the matter in question or, which would be even better, to make use of the intermediary services of a third party. We do not intend to dramatize this issue. For us the main thing is the withdrawal of the troops. We can solve the remaining problems later."
