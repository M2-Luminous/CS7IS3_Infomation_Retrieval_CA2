He said that the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP) concluded similar deals "whose sources of financing are unknown." He stressed that the YSP has closed the airspace in the southern and eastern governorate to receive arms shipments from Russia and East European states, which include helicopters and various types of [military] equipment. Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih expressed his confusion between "external orders" and "internal demands" vis-a-vis the efforts being exerted to contain the crisis between the (northern) General People's Congress [GPC], which is led by him -- and the YSP, whose secretary general is Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, before the problem worsens and turns once again into an armed confrontation, especially after the failure of the military committee, which is led by Colonel 'Ali Muhammad Salah, deputy chief of staff, to disengage the forces in Abyan Governorate. This came in the president's meeting with a number of dialogue committee members the day before yesterday evening. The meeting was described by a spokesman for the GPC as "an effort by the dialogue committee to renew its legitimacy after the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document, in order to resume its work to implement the document." [passage omitted] Salih stressed his commitment to implementing the Pledge Document. He urged the need for the Council of ministers to convene in Sanaa or to authorize the committee dialogue to supervise the work of the government and the military committee. The Yemeni president said at the meeting that Yemen does not now have military forces -- an indication that it is "easy" to implement the security part of the Pledge and Accord Document, thus opening the door to the YSP's return. But some participants told him that these forces have been moved to the fringe areas to reinforce deployment on the partition border -- which further worsens the political crisis, instead of making a move to end it and eliminate its effects.
