In a press communique released on 8 June, the organizations asserted that their "leaders have voiced and endorsed the producers' understandable impatience," and warned that "farmers are running out of time in their quest for political solutions." The Argentine Agrarian Federation (FAA), the Argentine Rural Association (SRA), the Argentine Rural Confederations (CRA), and Coninagro [Agricultural-Livestock Intercooperative Confederation] signed a document urging "the rural population to keep alert on the latest developments in negotiations." Despite the fact that following the five-hour meeting with Cavallo the agricultural organizations' leaders seemed to be more satisfied with the official promise to undertake an in-depth study of the agricultural situation, as time went by and meetings with delegates followed one another, agricultural producers' representatives became convinced that those promises were insufficient. Thus, during the late hours of 7 June, Humberto Volando, Manuel Cabanellas, Eduardo de Zavalia, and Leonidas Gassoni [the presidents of FAA, CRA, SRA, and Coninagro respectively] were of one mind about the need to be alert to the unfolding of negotiations with the government. They moreover acknowledged that they had left the meeting at the Economy Ministry empty-handed. Despite this the communique stresses that "a lengthy analysis of the questions raised" was made at the meeting, and that "there was some significant agreement with regard to some issues, while strides were made concerning others. Yet no definite conclusions were reached. The minister committed himself to continue to work on the subject and offer concrete solutions."
