Head of the Fatherland parliamentary faction Tiit Sinissar told ETA that the prime minister considered it necessary to make some changes in the composition of the government to increase the stability and working ability of the government. One of the means was to change the defence minister with whom the Prime Minister has had most of disagreements with. Sinissaar said that the agreement on the decision was quite unanimous by the faction. "There is no question of splitting up of the faction, only some fractions might depart," Sinissaar stated. The board of the Fatherland party, however, decided at its emergency session on Wednesday to make a proposition to the government to resign, stating differences of opinion that have created tension in the government as the reason. Member of the board of the party Mart Nutt told ETA that the decision was not directed against any definite person in the government, but was to be considered as a step to solve tensions in the government. Nutt stressed that the decision of the board of the party was not binding to the government. The position of the parliamentary faction is what counts but the faction has not yet discussed the problem, Nutt said. The parliamentary faction of the Fatherland Party made a statement later on Wednesday, saying that the proposition made by the emergency meeting of the board of the Fatherland Party, to the government to resign, came as a "surprise for the faction." The faction states that such propositions are not a matter of any party or its board -- the nomination and withdrawal of a government is, according to the constitution, in the parliament's authority. "The position of the Fatherland Part parliamentary faction is that the government has to continue its activities," the statement says. The government is to hold an emergency meeting tonight.
