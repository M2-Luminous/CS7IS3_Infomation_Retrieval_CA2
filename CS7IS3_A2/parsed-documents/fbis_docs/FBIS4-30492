Chairman Kotorao Higuchi), which is an advisory body to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata responsible for studying a new framework for defense policies, held a meeting to discuss the issue of reviewing the organization of the Ground Self- Defense Forces [GSDF]. Members of the council shared the view that "a review of the current GSDF structure consisting of 13 divisions is unavoidable." From now on, the council will hold further concrete discussions on reducing the number of GSDF personnel through a scale down of some units and a review of their organization. Regarding a GSDF organization review, participants at the meeting agreed on the following points: 1) Modernization and effective management of equipment will be considered; 2) a personnel reshuffle review is necessary from the viewpoint of the potential for war; 3) based on new defense policies, unit arrangements will be reviewed; and 4) the expansion of SDF reserve officers will be studied. While some members proposed a GSDF personnel organization rehers called for a review of unit arran gements putting emphasis on defense of the metropolitan area and on disposition of units in regions which adjoin foreign nations.
