He warned that any attempt by the rightwing to disrupt the election process would lead to tragedy, "and (still) the process will continue". Addressing businessmen in Johannesburg during his one-day election tour of Pretoria and the East Rand, Mr de Klerk said the events which unfolded during the demise of the Bophuthatswana government should make the rightwing "stop in their tracks" and think. Referring to the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB] invasion of the homeland which led to the death of three rightwingers, Mr de Klerk said "the chaos caused by the AWB and (Freedom Front leader Constand) Viljoen's people, should make the Conservative Party's Dr (Ferdi) Hartzenberg stop and think". Mr de Klerk said a government of national unity under a new dispensation would supply a political framework which would create growth and encourage investment. He said South Africa had an important role to play on the African continent and the international community saw South Africa as the gateway to Africa.
