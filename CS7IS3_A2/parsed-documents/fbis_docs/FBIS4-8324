CTK was today given an open letter addressed to Zieleniec, together with a copy of the document issued by the Puebla Institute, a U.S.-based human rights organization which is aiming for the establishment of democracy in Vietnam. The organization says the list is not complete, and that in actual fact there are many more prisoners. In the open letter, the Renewal Party's Czech section expresses disappointment that recent articles in the Czech press about Czech leaders' visits to the Vietnamese Socialist Republic did not mention human rights breaches in Vietnam. In connection with Zieleniec's forthcoming visit to the country, Pham Viet Hung says that millions of people in Vietnam long for freedom and democracy, and asks Zieleniec to bear this fact in mind during his meetings with Vietnamese government representatives. The letter also says that the Czech Republic has an unusually good reputation in the area of human rights, and that for countries such as Vietnam, still ruled over by a communist regime, it provides an example on their non-violent path to democracy. Czech Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Vit Kurfurst said that the ministry was aware that problems existed with regard to the observance of human rights in Vietnam. He added that this was a problem which needed to be talked about with the Vietnamese government and which should be pointed out. In no event, however, should it hinder the mutual development of economic and trade relations, Kurfurst said.
