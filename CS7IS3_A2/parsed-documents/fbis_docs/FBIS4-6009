It telecast streets of Pyongyang in festive mood, Pyongyangites and people on Mansudae Hill. It said Pyongyang seemed to be in a obviously Pacific atmosphere with the 82nd birthday of President Kim Il-song being celebrated, not to be the capital of a country seeking a war. It also said any tenseness and alertness could not be seen in the faces of those who gathered on Mansudae Hill to lay bunches of flowers before the bronze statue of President Kim Il-song. It noted that faces of people on camera seemed to be easy and smiling and it was impossible to find out any sign proving that their country has been termed as the most dangerous ignition point in the world at least. Noting that utterances about a war were exaggerated, it said the door of dialogue for a solution to the nuclear crisis was still kept open.
