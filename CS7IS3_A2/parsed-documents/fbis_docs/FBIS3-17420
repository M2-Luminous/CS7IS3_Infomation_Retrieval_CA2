Yeltsin: "With Deep Respect and Gratitude"] [Text] To the participants in the International Scientific-Practical Conference dedicated to the 40th anniversary of the start of the opening up of virgin lands and fallow lands and to all participants in the virgin lands project I wholeheartedly congratulate you, dear friends, on this noteworthy date in the history of the peoples of Russia and all the CIS countries -- the 40th anniversary of the start of the opening up of the virgin and fallow lands. The rapid opening up and development of vast, bleak, previously unpopulated territories in Siberia, the Volga region, the Urals, Kazakhstan, and other parts of the country constituted a magnificent occurence in the life of our country and our people. In the difficult postwar conditions the country was embarking on the solution of the tremendous problem of ensuring reliable self-sufficiency in food, and first and foremost in grain. Around 2 million young people responded to the call to open up the virgin lands. Through their persistent work and with the whole country's help a new grain-producing region was created. The practical experience of opening up the virgin lands and the fallow lands provides convincing evidence that, if people pool their efforts, success is guaranteed even in the most difficult task. That experience is especially valuable in the present, complex time. The CIS countries can overcome the crisis and resolve their complex problems quickly only if they act together in close collaboration and cooperation in all spheres. I pay deep respect and gratitude to all who contributed to opening up the virgin and fallow lands, who devoted the best years of their lives to that cause, and who made great efforts to create prosperity for our people. I wish you, dear comrades, good health, happiness, and new successes. [signed] B. Yeltsin.
