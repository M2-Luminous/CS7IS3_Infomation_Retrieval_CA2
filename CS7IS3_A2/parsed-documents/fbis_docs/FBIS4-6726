These changes would affect the ministries of economy and finance, foreign affairs and international cooperation, and interior and national security. Another source has revealed that these changes will not affect the role of any current cabinet ministers. In other words, this reshuffle only involves moving officials from one ministry to another. In this process, an official, who is currently a minister, could be taken away from a ministry and made a deputy prime minister. A few weeks ago there were rumors that Sam Rangsi, currently minister of economy and finance, would be promoted while Chak Sarik, currently governor of Kandal Province, would replace Sam Rangsi. An official who requested anonymity has disclosed that the Ministry of Interior and National Security may be split into two, namely the Ministry of National Security and the Ministry of Interior. However, this plan is still under consideration. It has not been decided yet which officials from what party would be in charge of what ministry. Yu Hokkri [currently co-minister of interior and national security] could be transferred to another ministry and another official, also from FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], would be in charge of the Interior Ministry or the National Security Ministry and could also have the rank of deputy prime minister. These sources add that the planned reshuffle is not the result of conflict in the cabinet but is just a rearrangement of leading leaders to suit their respective expertise and competence.
