The most distinguished proof is Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's visit to the Saudi capital and the reception accorded to him at the highest level. But it seems that Kuwait -- through its officials -- continues to insist on swimming against the tide and working to obstruct any Arab rapprochement directly or indirectly in order to perpetuate the disputes and splits if possible. Two days ago the Interior Ministry revealed that it had found weapons and skulls inside the Palestinian embassy in Kuwait after fabricating illogical reasons for storming it, violating all known diplomatic conventions. We do not know how the Palestinian embassy has turned into an arsenal of weapons and a warehouse of skulls. Even if these skulls do really exist, what is strange about it, given that almost every house in Kuwait is armed to the teeth with machine guns, rockets, and heavy artillery, as announced by the Interior Ministry itself during its combing campaigns designed to seize arms after its continued appeal to urge citizens to hand them over failed. The presence of a firearm in an Arab embassy is not a strange or odd thing. It is a rule pursued in most countries, and no diplomatic bag lacks arms. The Kuwaiti Government knows there is a personal weapon with the ambassador of the state of Palestine in Kuwait and elsewhere. It also knows that other embassies have weapons, whether before or after the invasion. The question is about the use and purpose of these weapons, not about their presence. If these weapons had really been used against Kuwait's security and stability, thousands of Palestinians would not have been expelled in a humiliating way from Kuwait. Nor would Palestinian women have been raped by Kuwaitis in broad daylight and in front of their families. One of the main criticisms aimed against the PLO and its leaders in a recent Palestine National Council session was its failure to distribute arms to the Palestinians living in Kuwait to enable them to defend themselves against the storming operations conducted by government militias. Its reply was that if it had done so, Kuwait would have turned into a blood bath -- which it does not want to happen to anyone, neither to Kuwait nor to the Palestinians. It is regrettable for Kuwaiti Government officials to speak about the existence of skulls in Palestine's embassy and announce this serious discovery on the day the Palestinian president's visit to Riyadh was due to take place. We do not know how these skulls reached the embassy building. If these skulls really exist, they are definitely the skulls of innocent Palestinians who sought refuge in their country's embassy but were later killed by the bullets of the Kuwaitis who had pursued them at the height of their spite against anything Palestinian -- the spite which dominated Kuwait after the Iraqi forces were moved out of it. What is clear is that the Palestinians did not kill a single Kuwaiti. Actually they were often the victims. Amnesty International reports and television pictures taken by Western reporters are full of images of mass graves for the victims killed by Kuwaiti government militias. Some Kuwaiti officials are mistaken if they think that by these lies they can obstruct Arab reconciliation. They know that this reconciliation is not in their interests. They cannot obstruct history's movement, nor can they freeze it at a certain point. Second, such an approach -- if it continues -- will lead to further isolation for Kuwait at the Arab level, and perhaps at the Gulf level as well. Proof of this is that some Kuwaiti writers have urged that reconciliation should be achieved with some of the states which supported Iraq, naming Yemen and Tunisia, for example. Kuwait needs a voice of reason to ease the tension with the brothers and lead to new pages, which do not all have to be positive; it is sufficient for them not to be negative. This is because the continuation of hostility is not in the interests of Kuwait or its people, whether this hostility is toward the Palestinians or anyone else.
