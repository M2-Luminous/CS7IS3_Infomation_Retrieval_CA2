Indications that the Clinton administration was increasingly in favour of repealing the amendment on grounds that it no longer advances U.S. non- proliferation goals put a strain on Indo-U.S. relations. The more so in view of the puzzling shifts in U.S. postures that seem to alternately confirm and deny a definite pro-Pakistani tilt. Such an Indian feeling was reinforced by the vigorous diplomatic exercise launched by Pakistan to convince Washington of the need to exclude Islamabad from the Pressler law on grounds that it was one-sided and that it damages Pakistan's conventional military capability, or in other words, gives India a strategic edge. With many in the administration buying such an argument, Delhi had compelling reasons to see the move to have the Pressler amendment repealed as yet another anti-India stratagem of the Clinton administration. The latest decision to retain the amendment must surely have come as a severe jolt to Ms. Benazir Bhutto's government, though she must have received other placatory assurances from the U.S.. And while Delhi has reason to be pleased with the decision, it would be imprudent on its part to take the decision as final. The move, in any case, is not inspired by a new-found enlightenment in the Clinton administration about the merits of following a more even-handed approach towards the subcontinent. Rather, as admitted by the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Mr. Brian Atwood, the move is purely tactical, with a view not to rub Congressmen the wrong way. Besides, in the interim before the current legislation on foreign aid presented to the U.S. Congress becomes law, the Clinton administration is likely to continue its search for a two-way deal on the nuclear issue whereby in return for some nuclear concessions from Pakistan, the Congress can be goaded to lift an amendment the administration wants repealed. Above all, our relief over the retention of the amendment should be tempered with the fact that Pakistan already has a nuclear weapons programme in place. Nevertheless, the decision to retain the amendment signals that nuclear non-proliferation remains a major aim of U.S. policy, however, it is pursued. U.S. relations with Pakistan are complicated by what Washington wants to impose on India -- by making use of Pakistan as the lever of American pressure on this country.
