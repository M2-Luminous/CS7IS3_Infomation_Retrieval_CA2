President Yeltsin is shaken. Now he wants to slow down economic reforms. What now? [Fedorov] How can Yeltsin slow down something that has long come to a halt? The last reform efforts go back to November. The government has been passive for months. The only consolation: This way they cannot do anything wrong. [Rybak] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has signed the 1994 draft budget. The deficit is 62.4 trillion rubles (some 62 billion German marks). A catastrophe for Russia? [Fedorov] The draft is quite tough, but it is not realistic. Earnings have been greatly overestimated. Before I resigned, we were estimating earnings at 90 trillion rubles. Today, the government is talking of 120 trillion. This is just palliation. [Rybak] Deputy Prime Minister Zaveryukha has demanded thousands of billions of rubles for agriculture. The military-industrial complex demands public orders. How can Chernomyrdin cope with this pressure? [Fedorov] He has to try. We all know that once the deficit reaches the 100-trillion ruble mark, a collapse cannot be prevented. Hyperinflation will ruin the economy. [Rybak] You have been predicting this since your resignation last fall. But inflation is no higher today than it was then. Are you a malicious pessimist? [Fedorov] The promised funds still have not flown into the economy. I do not expect inflation to rise to 35 percent per month before July. [Rybak] What is going to happen then? [Fedorov] No one can turn their back on our reform process completely. No one wants to close down the 2,000 new banks, 180 stock exchanges, or 1,000 insurance companies. But we will lose a lot of time. [Rybak] Why is Yeltsin not applying the emergency brake immediately? [Fedorov] Because Yeltsin is not sure himself who has the best solutions. He wants to give the left-wing directors one last chance to try their way of state planning. Only when they fail with their centrally controlled economy will Yeltsin step in, saying: Now you see what you have done. [Rybak] The government now wants to increase the use of nonmonetary methods of economic control.... [Fedorov] What is that? I do not know such a thing. Perhaps such a discovery will get the government the Nobel Prize. But, seriously: The government should work out a uniform course and stick to it. [Rybak] Your policy of shock therapy is said to have brought misery to entire groups of the population. Is this blame justified? [Fedorov] Real average incomes increased by 10 percent in 1993. Per capita food consumption also went up. The ruble has become a normal currency again. I still get letters from all over the country. People say that for the first time they know what full shelves in shops are. [Rybak] Forty percent of the population live in poverty. You did not succeed in establishing a social network. [Fedorov] For inflation relations, public social expenditure has not gone down, but I admit, assistance often went to the wrong people. We will have to create a new distribution network, pay social benefits also in kind. [Rybak] You are warning against creating a ruble zone with Belarus. Why? [Fedorov] You cannot introduce our currency in a foreign country. [Rybak] Would economic integration not be beneficial to everyone? Two-thirds of the fall in production in Russia goes back to the collapse of relations with the former Soviet republics. [Fedorov] Real integration begins with a number of political decisions. If two countries prefer a different economic course, have different tax laws and a different monetary policy, introducing a common currency would simply be stupid. [Rybak] You are chairman of the parliamentary commission for central bank and credit policy. What do you want to achieve? [Fedorov] The Central Bank and its president, Victor Gerashchenko, are largely to blame for the bad economic situation. The Central Bank's credit policy has been catastrophic and keeps stimulating inflation. We have to put an end to it. Gerashchenko is not an economic expert nor is he a banker. He does not believe in money.
