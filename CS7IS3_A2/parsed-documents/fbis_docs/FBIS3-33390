During the conversation, which lasted several minutes, the two leaders discussed the situation of their respective countries and, particularly, the commercial blockade against Cuba. This information was published today by the Buenos Aires daily AMBITO FINANCIERO, which also said the contact had been made by a relative of Menem, of Syrian origin, who lives in Havana. According to the press report, Menem spoke to his relative and after the protocol greetings, she said, "I will put you on to a friend" and Castro's voice appeared on the other end of the line. Relations between Menem and Castro remain distant because the Argentine president criticizes his Cuban counterpart for not calling elections in the island so its inhabitants can elect their leaders.
