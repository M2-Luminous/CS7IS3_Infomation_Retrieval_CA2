The option was suggested by senior citizen Doctor Prawet Wasi, and backed by Senate President Michai Ruchuphan, a national-level expert on legal affairs, who confirmed that a constitution drafting council could be set up through the amendment to Article 211 of the Constitution. It is possible to set up a constitution drafting council and implement political reforms in Thailand if members of the parliament unanimously push for an amendment to Article 211 in order that a "constitution drafting council" be set up, comprised of not more than 100 members to be appointed by the king. Ten of them will represent the House of Representatives; five come from the Senate; and the rest will be picked up from the lists proposed to the House of Representatives and the Senate by the various groups and organizations. They will represent people from all walks of life. The government should not look at the protest by Chalat Worachat as an individual matter. By nature, it is part of the nation's problem which is caused by a flaw in the political structure -- the people are unhappy with certain existing rules, which block the development towards social justice. So long as we allow this to continue, there will always be a risk of more crises. The government of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, which controls the majority in the House of Representatives, should therefore listen to the people and push for political reforms. This will be tantamount to overhauling Thailand's political structure, making it more up-to- date and responsive to democratic development. We no longer consider the hunger strike by Chalat Worachat an individual matter since it has alarmingly created ideological rifts and divisions in the country. Some people already look at it as a national crisis. Political reforms, therefore, should be an option to save the country and also the life of Chalat Worachat. There are those who stick to the principle of legality to the point of overlooking the intention of legal principles; they stick too much to the letter. This group of people think that Chalat Worachat is alone in his struggle, and therefore they do not pay attention to whether Chalat will survive or die. Although we never approved Chalat's tactic of pressure from the past, we, at this point, think that political reforms are urgently needed. There is nothing wrong with overhauling political rules and regulations. The administration can perform its work under the present constitution until the new constitution is completed. This, however, will be made possible only when members of the parliament unanimously work for it. The Democrat Party, which controls the majority of the parliament and which serves as the core of the government coalition, especially should step out and take the role of leader in the campaign, instead of standing with its back to the wall, sticking to written principle, and looking at an impasse or a national crisis, which is not good at all. If the prime minister, who is leader of the Democrat Party, insists upon sticking to his principle, out of pride or any other reasons, we would like to call upon other members of the Democrat Party to freely use their good judgment and join other political parties in support of the campaign to achieve political reforms.
