FR940606-1-00003 FR940606-1-00002 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;43&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;200 and &hyph;300 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Model ATR42&hyph;200 and &hyph;300 series airplanes. This proposal would require a one-time dye penetrant inspection to detect cracking in certain hinge pins of the nose landing gear (NLG), and replacement of cracked pins with crack-free pins. This proposal is prompted by reports of cracking of certain hinge pins in the NLG. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent collapse of the NLG due to cracking of the hinge pins. DATES: Comments must be received by July 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;43&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Aerospatiale, 316 Route de Bayonne, 31060 Toulouse, Cedex 03, France. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sam Grober, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;1187; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;43&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;43&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;200 and -300 series airplanes. The DGAC advises that cracking has been found on the hinge pins during routine overhaul of the nose landing gear (NLG) on Model ATR42&hyph;200 and -300 series airplanes. The cause for this cracking has been attributed to improper heat treatment during manufacture of the hinge pins. The defective pins have been isolated to those manufactured by Nardi having part number D56867 and serial numbers beginning with the letter ``N.'' This condition, if not corrected, could result in collapse of the NLG due to cracking of the hinge pins. Avions de Transport Regional has issued Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;32&hyph;0064, dated January 17, 1994, that describes procedures for a one-time dye penetrant inspection to detect cracking in certain hinge pins of the NLG, and replacement of cracked pins with crack-free pins. The DGAC classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;005&hyph;055(B), dated January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of §21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time dye penetrant inspection to detect cracking in certain hinge pins in the NLG, and replacement of cracked pins with crack-free pins. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.
