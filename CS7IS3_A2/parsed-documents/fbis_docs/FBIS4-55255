FBIS4-55255 "dreeu092_i_94022" FBIS-EEU-94-092 Daily Report 12 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Muslims Planning `Ecologic Catastrophe' Muslims Planning `Ecologic Catastrophe' LD1205114494 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1128 GMT 12 May 94 LD1205114494 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN ["Pool" item] [Text] Belgrade, May 12 (TANJUG) -- If their offensive on the Serb town of Brcko fails, the Bosnian Muslims are planning to cause an ecologic catastrophe by blowing up the chemical facilities in Tuzla (northern Bosnia), Belgrade POLITIKA said on Thursday. The Tuzla chemical works are similar to that in the Indian town of Bopal which caused the death of 2,500 people and seriously injured 150,000. Tuzla is held by the Muslims who have over the past few days been massing major forces in the south and southwest of this city, also confirmed by the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman in Sarajevo on Wednesday. The Seventh Brigade of the Bosnian army, well-known for its fundamentalism and lightening-speed offensives, has been transferred to the Kladanj-Olovo region (south of Tuzla) in preparation of military actions in this region, REUTER said. The threat of an `ecologic strike' from Tuzla could be a desperate measure since poisons cannot tell the difference between one's own army and civilians and those of the enemy, the Belgrade paper said. Another possibility is that NATO would fulfill Muslim expectations and help them if they are unsuccessful, as in the case of Gorazde. The Muslims could blow up several tanks containing poison substances and, in keeping with the already proven scenario and with the support of the Western media, blame the Serbs and then ask for NATO's help, POLITIKA said. The threats by the Tuzla Muslims would cause the death of thousands of people and seriously hurt over hundreds of thousands. Before the outbreak of the civil war in Bosnia, Tuzla was a major center of the chemical industry which had stores amounting to about 1,300 tonnes of chlorine, 1,100 tonnes of ammonium, 60 tonnes of sulfuric acid and 3 tonnes of phosgene. The release of chlorine into the atmosphere would threaten life in an area ranging from 1.5km - 76 km, while the ammonium would affect an area from 1 km - 28 km depending on the weather, POLITIKA learned from Dusan Rajic, a contamination expert of the Yugoslav army's techinical institute in Belgrade. The use of phosgene would affect only the centre of the city or the cite from where it was released. Those who are threatening to cause an ecologic catastrophe could use this element since, by sacrificing their own people, they would achieve their aims -- to force international military aid, Rajic said. The Muslims have already applied this scenario of sacrificing their own people to turn the international public against the Serbs. Last year they caused the massacre in the Vase Miskina Street in Sarajevo, while this year they caused the death of innocent civilians at Sarajevo's Markale Market in the same way. Both times the aim was achieved -- the international community reacted with lightning speed and blamed the Serbs. Subsequent reports by UNPROFOR representatives about who was really to blame had no effect.
