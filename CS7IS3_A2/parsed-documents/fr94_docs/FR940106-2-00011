FR940106-2-00011 FR940106-2-00007 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;351&hyph;820] Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon From Brazil Agency: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kimberly Hardin, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;0371. FINAL DETERMINATION: We determine that ferrosilicon (FeSi) from Brazil is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that critical circumstances exist for Italmagnesio S.A. Industria e Comercio (Italmagnesio), but not for Companhia Ferroligas Minas Gerais (Minasligas) or Companhia Brasileira Carbureto de Calcio (CBCC). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Scope of Investigation The merchandise subject to this investigation is ferrosilicon, a ferroalloy generally containing, by weight, not less than four percent iron, more than eight percent but not more than 96 percent silicon, not more than 10 percent chromium, not more than 30 percent manganese, not more than three percent phosphorous, less than 2.75 percent magnesium, and not more than 10 percent calcium or any other element. FeSi is a ferroalloy produced by combining silicon and iron through smelting in a submerged-arc furnace. FeSi is used primarily as an alloying agent in the production of steel and cast iron. It is also used in the steel industry as a deoxidizer and a reducing agent, and by cast iron producers as an inoculant. FeSi is differentiated by size and by grade. The sizes express the maximum and minimum dimensions of the lumps of FeSi found in a given shipment. FeSi grades are defined by the percentages by weight of contained silicon and other minor elements. FeSi is most commonly sold to the iron and steel industries in standard grades of 75 percent and 50 percent FeSi. Calcium silicon, ferrocalcium silicon, and magnesium ferrosilicon are specifically excluded from the scope of this investigation. Calcium silicon is an alloy containing, by weight, not more than five percent iron, 60 to 65 percent silicon, and 28 to 32 percent calcium. Ferrocalcium silicon is a ferroalloy containing, by weight, not less than four percent iron, 60 to 65 percent silicon, and more than 10 percent calcium. Magnesium ferrosilicon is a ferroalloy containing, by weight, not less than four percent iron, not more than 55 percent silicon, and not less than 2.75 percent magnesium. FeSi is currently classifiable under the following subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS): 7202.21.1000, 7202.21.5000, 7202.21.7500, 7202.21.9000, 7202.29.0010, and 7202.29.0050. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. FeSi in the form of slag is included within the scope of this investigation if it meets, generally, the chemical content definition stated above and is capable of being used as FeSi. FeSi is used primarily as an alloying agent in the production of steel and cast iron. It is also used in the steel industry as a deoxidizer and a reducing agent, and by cast iron producers as an inoculant. Parties that believe their importations of slag do not meet these definitions should contact the Department and request a scope determination. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1992, through December 31, 1992. Case History Since the publication of the notice of preliminary determination on August 16, 1993 (58 FR 43323), the following events have occurred. On August 20, 1993, respondent Italmagnesio notified the Department that it had decided to withdraw from participation in this investigation and requested the return of all documents that it submitted during the course of the investigation. On August 25, 1993, we returned the proprietary versions of all documents submitted by Italmagnesio during the investigation. On August 23, 24, and 25, 1993, CBCC, petitioners, and Minasligas, respectively, requested a public hearing.
