Asked about the matter, Jorge Redmond, president of the Confederation of Venezuelan Chambers and Associations of Industrialists [Conindustria], said the reaction was "positive." He remarked, however, that the event was not truly the presentation of an economic program but rather a philosophical orientation on economy. He said that the unusual thing about the event was the use of a new method to solve the problem posed by the need to reduce the number of public employees. He added that the unusual method of using PDVSA and CVG shares to pay benefits offers two positive advantages: It helps reduce the payroll, inflation, and interest rates, and stimulates the economy. Redmond described as "resourceful and commendable" the government suggesting, at the presentation of its economic program, an adjustment in the social benefits system to restore the people's lost purchasing power. He also said that this is an indication of President Rafael Caldera's interest in changing the populist ideas presented during his campaign, such as keeping gasoline prices at the current level and continuing with the same social benefits program. According to Berend Roosen, president of the National Council for Commerce and Services [Consecomercio], what the government presented on Wednesday is only the backbone of an economic program and that, for this reason, many things were neither said nor explained. "Nevertheless, we were happy to hear talk about opening the oil industry and the CVG to outside capital and the transfer of shares of these enterprises to the workers. Evidently, we are speaking a very similar language." Roosen added that the government is beginning to understand that the state's labor obligations are very high. The government wants to relieve the pressure on the health and education sectors through decentralization. The formula presented yesterday will serve to transfer the services without obligations, as the governors had been demanding. As for the transfer of 10 percent of PDVSA and CVG shares, Roosen said it still remains to determine how this decision will be implemented because PDVSA as such cannot transfer its shares. Nevertheless, the enterprise could do it through its subsidiaries, which have been set up as corporations and can register their shares on the stock market.
