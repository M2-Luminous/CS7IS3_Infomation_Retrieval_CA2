They were engaged in antidrug operations in 10 of the nation's states, which enabled them to capture 21 presumed drug dealers, including a Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agent. During the activities, the federal agents under orders from Commander Adrian Carrera confiscated 13 automotive vehicles used to transport drugs, and five heavy caliber firearms. Concurrently, the PGR personnel destroyed a marijuana and poppy plantation located on an area of 50,000 square meters and containing about 450,000 plants. It was situated in the mountains of Guerrero State. This accumulation of drugs was intended for the narcotics markets in the states of California, Texas, and Arizona, and represented millions of doses. The department's local office in Baja California, headed by Jose Arturo Ochoa Palacios, reported that, in a simultaneous operation conducted with public safety personnel in Tijuana, the PJF seized one ton, 348 kg, and 600 grams of marijuana discovered on the streets of Guadalupe Victoria in that town's Colonia Guerrero. Arrested in the operation were Samuel Mendoza Valdez and Ubaldo Campa Mejia who, according to preliminary investigation 561-94, were waiting for other members of their criminal organization to arrive with a vehicle to smuggle the drugs into the United States. In that same state, in the vicinity of Tijuana, a shipment of cannabis indica weighing one ton and 74 kg was intercepted. It was being carried by Gonzalo Banuelos Montano on a fifth wheel type truck, hidden under hundreds of drums of gypsum from Tonala, Jalisco. [passage omitted] Another ton, 236 kg, and 900 grams of marijuana was seized by federal agents in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, where they arrested Miguel Angel Loa Rodriguez, Gabriel Melchor Ontiveros, and Griselda Garcia Nunez. They were carrying the drugs in the false bottom of a platform installed on a pickup truck. Confiscated with the drugs were two rifles, a 22 and a .410 caliber, as well as a 22 caliber revolver, concealed in the back of the vehicle's cab. Presumed to have been heading for San Antonio, Texas, the subjects were captured on a trail near the Rio Grande.
