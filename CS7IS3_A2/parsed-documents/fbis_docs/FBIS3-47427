According to the Korea Maritime and Port Administration and the related industry on 9 January, Choyang Shipping, representative company of the ROK consortium participating in the Inchon-Dalian ferry project, and (Dalian Deep Ocean Transportation Corporation), the PRC side's representative company, recently held a second-round working-level meeting in Seoul and agreed to open the route after deciding to establish the joint venture's head office, which was the biggest issue blocking the opening of the route, in the ROK while giving the PRC side the responsibility of financial manager. They also agreed to hold the third-round meeting within this month to make the final decisions on how to secure ships and when to begin the service. The opening of scheduled ferry services between the ROK and the PRC had been agreed in the ROK-PRC maritime meeting held last year but it was delayed because the two countries insisted that the head office of the 50-50 joint venture should be located in their respective countries.
