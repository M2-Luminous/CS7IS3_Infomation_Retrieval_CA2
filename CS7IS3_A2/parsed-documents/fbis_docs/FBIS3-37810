He pointed out that experts of both countries are currently working out such a mechanism. In Shokhin's words, the parties have actually reached an agreement to establish a 1:3 correlation between Russian rubles and the Belarusian currency. He explained the mechanism used for determining this exchange rate, namely by putting together the exchange rate and the rate based on the purchasing ability via the consumer basket. The fist one (the exchange rate) is 1:4 and the second is 1:2.5. Shokhin noted that there exists an intention to set different cash and non-cash rates, to make it softer for the population and tougher for enterprises. According to Shokhin, the issue of the time-frame for the agreement is still being debated. The Belarusian side, which wants to receive an access to Russian resources as soon as possible, advocates simultaneous implementation of agreements. Russia stands for a gradual one, in the course of half a year during which a state-by-stage reduction in customs tariffs will take place. The minister pointed out that Russia and Belarus had made a preliminary conclusion at the inter-state level stating that the reached agreements must be ratified by both states' parliaments. "It means that Russia should so thoroughly develop all aspects of the accords that everybody can understand that it does not loose but also gains from the unification of two monetary systems," emphasized Shokhin. In his words, advantages gained by Russia include solution of transit problems and direct access to Europe. This would help to solve the problem of Russian oil export not by means of inefficient rail way shipments but by means of an oil pipeline laid to Polotsk and Mozyr (Belarus) and then further to Europe. Shokhin said that 90 percent of Belarusian industry works for the Russian market which is why lowering prices for fuel and energy resources would help to lower prices for goods imported from Belarus.
