In the council's opinion, membership cannot be implemented on that basis. At this point, however, the MTK does not want to break off the negotiations, but it is taking a more critical view of them than before. The MTK's seven southernmost district organizations in Finland's so-called grain belt had submitted a statement at the executive council meeting, in which they expressed their annoyance with the fact that the MTK had in many ways played a cooperative role in the negotiations with the EU. In it they asked the council to consider the organization's withdrawal from the membership negotiations. They were not given a chance to vote on the proposal. MTK acting chairman Toivo T. Pohjala (Conservative) saved the organization from an embarrassing situation due to the prestige he enjoys among grain farmers. He took a position on the statement before it was discussed as an agenda item. Haavisto Has No Rival Candidate If the MTK had withdrawn from the EU membership negotiations, it would have been impossible for Heikki Haavisto (Center Party) to be the foreign minister, who heads the negotiations with the EU on agriculture, and MTK chairman at one and the same time. The MTK chairman elections are to be held today. By Thursday [2 December] it had already become clear that there was no candidate to run against Haavisto. It is said that Haavisto runs the MTK in such a sovereign manner that, according to some of the council members, a vacuum has been created about him. According to the plans that have been made, Pohjala is to take over from Haavisto as chairman of the MTK after the end of the year. Foreign Ministry trade councillor Esa Harmala (Center Party) explained the situation with the negotiations to the council. He maintained that the Commission's statement is in part so confusingly written that he did not understand every point on even his fifth reading of it. Only Annoyance With and Council Members for EU Negotiations According to Harmala, they will enter into discussions on points open to interpretation with the Commission on Friday. Harmala had interpreted the statement as meaning that producer prices will not have to be lowered to EU price levels immediately, but that farmers might be paid price supplements. On the other hand, as he sees it, it is perfectly clear that the Commission wants to lower consumer prices to EU levels immediately. Harmala said that the system will be costly for the Finnish Government. Farmer Harri Finnila of Pohjanmaa said that the EU negotiations have produced nothing but annoyance and new council members. Harmala stated that he, at least, would take a cut in salary when he becomes a council member following his duties as special advisor to the prime minister. Antti Franssila, who is leaving his duties as third MTK chairman, kicked up more of a row than usual for him and insisted that, instead of negotiations, Harmala dictate Finland's demands to the EU since the EU is already bound by the Rome Treaty to protect member countries' food production. Attention was focused at the meeting on the fact that rural communities' economy would collapse if Finland were to join the EU on the terms proposed by the Commission. Several council members deplored the fact that many of the nation's special-interest groups have taken up a position behind the Commission's statement and against the farmers. MTK leaders have been obliged to negotiate with the labor union movement, among other groups, so that we Finns would form a united front behind Finland's agriculture goals. According to an opinion poll presented at the meeting, fully 92 percent of all farmers oppose EU membership on the terms set forth in the Commission's statement.
