[passage omitted] From the very beginning of the proceedings until they ended last night, the Rwandan crisis was touched on more and more prominently with lengthy discussions resulting in the creation of a commission in charge of the Rwandan issue. [passage omitted] The last conclusion and the most astonishing of all was that none of Rwanda's neighboring countries so far had been involved in the massacres. Alright, this is true. But when they say that neither of the warring sides in Rwanda was involved in this crime against humanity, this is truly astonishing. It is difficult to believe that the OAU was unaware of the role played by the Rwandan Government clique in the genocide through its army rabble and its militiamen. But given that the proposal for creating courts to try those responsible has been approved, let us hope that this means the judiciary is aware that there are criminals somewhere.
