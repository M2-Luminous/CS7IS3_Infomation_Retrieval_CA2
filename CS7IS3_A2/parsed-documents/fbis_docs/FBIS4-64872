The People's Party spokesmen spared no adjectives on the telephone after 1215 GMT when [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez's news conference ended. Since the middle of the morning, [People's Party leader] Jose Maria Aznar had canceled his planned appearances in Pamplona and Valladolid yesterday and today so that he could closely follow the development of the political crisis. During the evening he gave his reaction and called a press conference for today. Aznar, and the People's Party's leaders who followed the conference closely, concluded that Gonzalez was deceiving popular opinion because he had not taken a single initiative to stop the political crisis or to attack its causes, the growing climate of corruption. Sources close to the People's Party leader said: "He limited himself to accepting the avalanche of resignations, plugging the gaps, and carrying on as if nothing will happen." The party's general secretary, Francisco Alvarez Cascos, then stated that Aznar's demand that Gonzalez resign two weeks ago and give up the prime ministership to another socialist capable of clearing up the situation "is now more even justified than then, because things have become worse, Roldan has escaped, Albero has resigned, Rubio and De la Concha are in jail, and two other ministers have had to give up their seats." He added: "Nobody knows to what new scandal we will be sitting down to tonight or waking up to tomorrow morning, while Gonzalez can only offer continuity and entrenchment in La Moncloa [the prime minister's residence). He is insisting on defending the Maginot line while the Germans have long been occupying Paris." For the People's Party leadership, the Catalan nationalists of the Convergence and Union party [CiU] have made themselves equally responsible by helping to keep Gonzalez in power. Alvarez Cascos stated: "They are not supporting stability but supporting maximum instability and ensuring the continued presence of the main obstacle to political stability in Spain -- keeping Gonzalez in power for personal reasons." The People's Party are moreover rejecting the dialogue proposed yesterday by the prime minister, which they consider a "an offering to the sun." According to Alvarez Cascos, Aznar will not fall into the trap when it has been clear that the last meetings, which led to the "democratic stimulus" conversations, "were frustrated by socialist intransigence" and by the attempt to impose conditions on the investigating committees that would have prevented them from unmasking the former director of the Guardia Civil, Luis Roldan.
