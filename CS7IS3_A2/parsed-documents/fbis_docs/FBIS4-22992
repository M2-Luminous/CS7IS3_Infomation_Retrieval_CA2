Postnikova, Crimean Medical Institute, Simferopol; UDC 615.471.03:61(043.8)] [Text] This paper is a survey of the present state of research on biological sensors. Enzymatic and immune biosensors are described. Problems associated with using microorganisms as biosensors are reported in detail. Use of luminescent bacteria and luciferase sensors is discussed. The principles of operation of fiber-optic and semiconductor biosensors are discussed. Key words: enzymatic and immune biosensors, microbial biosensors. New sensitive means of testing with biosensory measuring devices--biosensors--are enjoying increasingly wider use in clinical biochemistry, microbiology, bioengineering and other fields. Sensory systems based on enzymes, cellular organelles, cells and tissues of animals and plants, and microorganisms, and sensors in which the substance under analysis bonds with a target molecule--a receptor, with antibodies, and so on are employed extensively in creation of biosensors [18,40,55,56]. Physicochemical changes in sensory systems occurring on the working surface of biosensors are detected and amplified by transducers and registered by the corresponding physical methods--potentiometric, optical, acoustic [12,44,63]. The high resolution and specificity of biosensors and the speed with which measurements are taken with them make them essential in monitoring enzymatic processes and in laboratory diagnosis of infectious and somatic human diseases. This survey describes the current state of efforts to create and use biosensors in foreign laboratories and in our laboratories. Enzymatic Biosensors Sensors in which the sensitive layer contains specific enzymes are the most highly developed type of biosensors. The first enzymatic biosensor, developed by Clark [23], was intended to measure glucose by means of glucose oxidase and an O[.sub]2[/]-electrode. The simplicity, reliability and swiftness of glucose determination ensured rapid development of the new method. Glucose sensors enjoyed wide use in clinics. The range of measurements of blood glucose concentrations is approximately 2|b10[.sup]-2[/]-5|b10[.sup]-3[/] mg/ml, while the time of a single analysis is not more than 15 sec [40]. With the advent of implantable glucose sensors connected to an arterial or venous shunt, it became possible to measure sugar in the blood of a patient directly [13,41,67,75]. The importance of such rapid analysis is difficult to overstate in relation to diagnosis of sugar diabetes. Sensors for subcutaneous measurement of glucose have been created [22]. Glucose biosensors are acquiring special importance in the development of an artificial pancreas [37]. Glucose sensors are being used successfully to monitor fermentation processes [51] and in bioengineering [31]. Enzymatic sensors working with other carbohydrates (galactose, fructose, xylose, xylulose) make it possible to take measurements within a wide range of concentrations--from 50 �M to 2.0 mM[26,87]. Biosensors have been developed to determine a broad spectrum of organic acids: pyruvate [73,97], malate [45,101], oxalate [16], glutamate and aspartate [100,102], lactate [19,51,73] and ascorbic acid [52]. A free fatty acid sensor [75] determines the acid content in concentrations of approximately 0.4-2.0 mM in about 10 minutes. Enzymatic sensors are widely used to determine amino acids such as lysine, methionine, tyrosine [44,95] and aspartic acid [100]. Biosensors have been created to determine creatine and creatinine in blood plasma and bile [59,68,99]. Enzymatic sensors are widely employed in food industry to evaluate the quality and freshness of food products [52,84]. Thus, the freshness of fish is determined from the concentration of hypoxanthine while that of meat is determined from the presence of putrescine and cadaverine [80]. Biosensors are used to determine ascorbic acid in fruit juices [52]. A sensor for penicillin was obtained with the help of immobilized lactamase and penicillinase [21,94]. A biosensor for uric acid is sensitive to a substrate concentration of approximately 5 mg/ml [62]. Other enzymatic sensors have been developed as well: phenol [84], alcohol [94], ammonia [5], a sensor for determination of phosphoric acid [91] and others. Fast inactivation of the enzyme, especially when it comes in contact with blood and other physiological fluids, is the main shortcoming of enzymatic sensors. The life of most implantable biosensors is approximately 3-5 hours. The stability of the enzyme depends in many ways on its purity and the means of immobilization. Enzymes in biosensors are usually immobilized on nylon, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl chloride, cellulose acetate and other membranes [33,41,49,84]. However, direct attachment of an enzyme to an electrode is also possible, which reduces the sensor's response time. Stability of enzymatic biosensors is achieved in a number of cases by introducing additional enzymes into the sensory part of the sensor that break down reaction by-products [53]. Development of biosensors led to creation of biosensors with different types of electrodes--oxygen [53,75,80,94,97], CO[.sub]2[/]-electrode [95], pH-electrode [56,102] and others. Biosensors are being developed with immobilized cofactors [43], as are multisensors making it possible to measure several substances simultaneously [24,62]. New directions in designing enzymatic biosensors include use of field transistors [10,34] and Langmuir-Blodzhett [transliteration] films [86] in them, and creation of fiber-optic enzymatic biosensors employing photometric, fluorescent and bioluminescent recordings [27,29,87]. Sensors working under flow-injection conditions have been created for environmental monitoring and to monitor processes in microbiological industry and in other fields [51]. Immune Biosensors Immune biosensors are distinguished by high sensitivity and specificity. The sensory part of an immune biosensor is represented by antibodies or antigens immobilized on a membrane; physicochemical changes in antigen-antibody complex formation are registered by the corresponding electrodes. Immunosensors are subdivided in relation to the means of detection into electrochemical, amperometric, potentiometric and optical [15,74], and in relation to the type of immunological reactions used--into immunosensors with labeled reagents and without labeling. The first immunosensor without a labeling agent was created to detect anti-syphilitic antibodies [14], but because of the nonspecificity of the cardiolipid antigen the sensor was characterized by significant error. A potentiometric immunosensor making it possible to detect antibodies to syphilis at 800-time dilution of blood serum, and an electrochemical immune biosensor for blood group determination were developed later [15]. However, immunosensors without a labeling agent have many artifacts as a rule, and they require separation of the antigen-antibody complex from free substances, which makes their use in clinical practice difficult. The sensitivity of immunological methods is increased significantly by means of labeled immune reagents; free radicals, radioactive isotopes, fluorescent dyes, aromatic hydrocarbons and enzymes are used as labels. Immune biosensors in which enzymes such as catalase, glucose oxidase, _b_-galactosidase, peroxidase etc. have been developed to the greatest extent [15,77,78]. Both antibodies and antigens are labeled with enzymes [74]. Immune biosensors have been created for determination of albumin and immunoglobulins within a concentration range of 1-10 �g/ml [78]. An immunosensor for theophylline and gonadotropin can measure concentrations of these substances within 1.1|b10[.sup]-9[/]-2.5|b10[.sup]-8[/] M [77], while the detection limit of _a_-fetoprotein is 5|b10[.sup]-11[/] gm/ml [15]. Enzymatic immune biosensors with several labeled antibodies, which makes them polyfunctional, are being developed. The choice of enzyme for an immune biosensor depends on the type of transducer used in the given biosensor, a function that can be served both by semiconductors and by electrodes (ion, oxygen etc.) [46]. Peroxidase is usually used as the label in luminescent immune biosensors. Labeled antibodies are applied to a light guide, and change in the sample's luminescence as a result of a bonding reaction is registered by a photocell. The enzyme luciferase may also be used as a marker in such a system, which significantly widens the sensitivity range of the biosensor. Use of the electrochemical luminescence of pyrene for analysis of blood serum albumin is promising [14]. Optical immunosensors in which fluorochromes are used as labels have been created on the basis of immunofluorescent analysis; the sensitivity of determining proteins in such immune biosensors reaches around 1 nM at a measuring time of approximately 5 minutes [74]. Use of monoclonal antibodies, liposomes and other biological materials in fiber-optic immunosensors [1,8,36], and the prospects of mass production of immune biosensors for immune biosensory diagnosis [1] are discussed in a number of papers. Cellular Biosensors Biosensors in which the analytical system contains the cells of microorganisms, applied to a membrane or to some other backing, may be lumped together in the class of microbial biosensors. Use of intact cells as a sensor makes it possible to determine the substrates and products of any enzymatic reaction of a given test object without having to use the complex and expensive procedure of enzyme purification, and to detect change in cell metabolism in response to mutagens, toxins and antibiotics. As with enzymatic sensors, microbial biosensors may be classified in relation to type of electrode, means of signal registration, class of substances to be determined, and area of use. Microbial glucose sensors have enjoyed the widest application. An amperometric glucose sensor with Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria immobilized in agar produces a linear response to glucose in a concentration interval of 2.5|b10[.sup]-5[/]-1.5|b10[.sup]-4[/] M, which correlates with the enzymatic method of glucose determination [93]. The sensor is convenient to analysis of culture media and biological fluids. Ascorbic acid is measured by means of an O[.sub]2[/]-electrode to the surface of which a nitrocellulose filter bearing immobilized Enterobacter agglomerans cells is secured [92]. Microbial biosensors are used to measure small concentrations of amino acids. A sensor consisting of a CO[.sub]2[/]-electrode and membranes bearing immobilized Escherichia coli bacteria was used to determine glutamate. In response to glutamate decarboxylase, the bacteria release carbon dioxide, which is measured by an electrode. The sensor's selectivity stems from the absence of sensitivity to glucose, acetate ions and inorganic ions [39]. L-tryptophan is determined by means of a pO[.sub]2[/]-membrane sensor with immobilized P. fluorescens cells; in this case the response remains linear over an interval of substrate concentrations of 4|b10[.sup]-7[/]-7|b10[.sup]-5[/] M [93]. An O[.sub]2[/]-electrode bearing chemoautotrophic bacteria that consume carbon dioxide on its membrane is used to determine L-tyrosine. The sensor's response time is approximately 10 minutes, and the response is linear within a concentration range of approximately 10-50 �M [76]. Microbial biosensors are widely used to measure ethanol in fermentation processes using immobilized Trichosporon brassicae yeast cells coupled to an O[.sub]2[/]-electrode. The sensor reacts selectively to ethanol, not reacting to methanol and organic acids. The response is linear within a range of 2.0-45.0 mM, and the quantity of measurements without loss of activity is 1,200 analyses [42]. The same sensor is used to measure acetate. A sensor for ethanol was also developed on the basis of Gluconabacter acetate bacteria membrane-bound with an ion-selective field transistor [38]. A microbial biosensor with Methylomonas methylovora cells immobilized on a mesh electrode or in calcium alginate is also sensitive to ethanol [25]. Ammonia monitoring sensors are used in fermentation processes. They are based on an oxygen electrode and Nitrosomonas sp. cells oxidizing ammonia to nitrite ions, and Nitrobacter sp. cells oxidizing nitrites to nitrates. The limit of detection of ammonia is approximately 0.1 mg/liter [39]. An ammonium sensor with nitrifying bacteria immobilized on an O[.sub]2[/]-electrode is used to analyze sewage, in which the range of ammonium measurements at pH 10 is approximately 0.1-1.2 mM [47]. A microbial biosensor with immobilized Bacillus subtilis cells was proposed for determining ammonium ions [68,71]. The response time of the sensor is 5 sec, linearity of the response is ensured within a range of approximately 0.0-0.5 mM, the sensor is stable for 10-12 days, and presence of phosphates, sulfates and chlorides does not influence signal magnitude. A sensitive microbial biosensor for determining urea consists of a CO[.sub]2[/]-electrode connected to a nitrocellulose membrane covalently bound with Proteus mirabilis cells. The sensor is active for not less than 7 days, and the response is linear within a concentration range of 7|b10[.sup]-4[/]-3|b10[.sup]-2[/] M [35,76]. An amperometric biosensor consisting of an O[.sub]2[/]-electrode and Acetobacter pasteurianum cells immobilized on a nylon membrane filter is intended for determination of lactate in milk and in yogurt. The sensor's response is observed to be linear within approximately 1.0|b10[.sup]-4[/]-13|b10[.sup]-4[/] M, and activity persists for around 170 hours [50]. Microbial biosensors can be used in research on the physiology of the microorganisms themselves. Thus, an O[.sub]2[/]-electrode can be used to determine the concentration of the antibiotic gentamicin, which affects the duration of the first phase of oxygen absorption by immobilized E. coli cells [42]. The action of gentamicin can be evaluated and quick control of its activity can be achieved on the basis of change in the intensity of metabolism by B. pumilis cells (oxygen consumption, change in conductivity and dielectric permeability) [4]. Biochemical oxygen consumption is one of the criteria of pollution of rivers and water basins by industrial wastes and chemicals. Biochemical oxygen consumption can be monitored by means of a Clark oxygen sensor with microorganisms utilizing organic substrate in aerobic conditions immobilized on its membrane. The sensor can be used to estimate the concentration of organic matter in liquid wastes [69]. A microbial biosensor based on porous membranes bearing E. coli, Azotobacter vinelandii and the cells of other microorganisms secured to the surface of a CO[.sub]2[/]-electrode is used to determine toxicity in liquid wastes having a high concentration of organic compounds [33,68]. Sensors consisting of Hyphomicrobium sp. bacteria combined with a glass electrode are used to analyze contamination of industrial wastes by methylsulfates. Its range of measurement is 5|b10[.sup]-2[/]-6.3|b10[.sup]-1[/] M, the sensor's response time is approximately 5 minutes, and stability of work is guaranteed for a week [72]. An amperometric sensor bearing Synechococcus sp. cells, which begins to transmit a signal after the photosystem of the cells is disturbed, is used to detect chlortoluron, linuron and other herbicides [20,84], and it can be used to analyze the quality of drinking water. Sensors for mutagens and carcinogens were developed on the basis of E. coli, Salmonella sp. and B. subtilis microorganisms [34,39]. Hybrid biosensors with urease or creatine kinase in an ammonia biosensor are used for amperometric determination of urea and creatinine. The limits of analysis in this case are 5-50 mg/ml for urea and 5-500 mg/ml for creatinine [47]. A biosensor for L-tyrosine and maltose was developed on the basis of B. subtilis cells. Microbial biosensors based on thermophilic bacteria are a new type of sensor [39]. Luminescing bacteria and other bioluminescent organisms are unique sensory systems. Both native organisms and luciferase complexes isolated from them are used for analytical purposes [2,5,7,9]. Light luciferase sensors possess high sensitivity and low inertia [47]. Microbial bioluminescent sensors containing immobilized Beneckea harveyi bacteria can measure dissolved oxygen with a sensitivity of approximately 3.5 nM, and hydrogen peroxide with a sensitivity of approximately 0.4 �M [71]. Mycotoxins in food products at concentrations of approximately 0.9-20.0 �g/ml and trace quantities of narcotics and poisons are determined by means of lyophilized Photobacterium phosphoferum cells [7]. Photobacterium fischeri strains are sensitive sensors of various biologically active substances, including detergents, the detection threshold of which is approximately 0.2 mN [2,3]. Mutants of photobacteria capable of restoring bioluminescence level with the addition of nanogram quantities of different mutagens and carcinogens are widely used as indicator systems. Ph. fischeri and luminescing genetically engineered strains of E. coli (lum), the luciferase system of which is more sensitive to a large range of toxins, are being used successfully to monitor contamination of the environment by toxic substances [3]. Biosensors have been created on the basis of bacterial and fire-fly bioluminescence systems for analysis of synthetic and natural aldehydes [6,90], dehydrogenases [9], proteases and their inhibitors [7], phospholipase [89], ATP [29], hormones [47], ethanol [61] and toxins [84]. Microbial contamination may be determined by bioluminescent methods with an accuracy down to hundreds of cells, which significantly raises the level of control. Bacterial luciferase is also used as a label [79], being a promising substitute for the RIA [not further identified] and other methods [96]. Higher sensitivity to a number of reagents and stability under continuous measuring conditions are undisputed advantages of microbial biosensors, though they are often inferior in selectivity to enzymatic and immune biosensors. Fiber-Optic and Semiconductor Biosensors Development of biosensors using chemiluminescent systems combined with fiber light guides and quantometric methods of registering biologically active substances and reactions is a new, promising direction in the development of biosensors [48,54,70]. Fiber-optic biosensors are unique in the reversibility of their indicator systems and in the quickness of the response. Specificity is attained by selecting different optically active fluorescent or bioluminescent labels [82,83]. The principle of operation of a fiber-optic biosensor is as follows: Light from the source propagates along the optic fiber to the sensor, which is fitted on the end of a light guide, and after reflecting or scattering from the sample, it returns to the light receiver, which analyzes the responding signal. Reflected light may be spectrally altered as it passes through a sample under analysis containing an optically active reagent. An optical ``metabolic'' sensor has been proposed--a miniature sensitive glucose sensor, the principle of detection of which is based on competition between the metabolite to be determined and a ligand labeled with fluorescein for a receptor binding site [65]. The system uses filters that block scattered radiation. The response time in such an optrode is approximately 10 minutes, and measurement accuracy for glucose is approximately 0.13 mg/liter. A fiber-optic biosensor containing five sensors was used to investigate the pH gradient in cardiac muscle [64]. The measurement technique with this sensor is relatively simple and inexpensive, and registration and analysis are performed by means of a photomultiplier connected to a processor. A fiber-optic biosensor has been proposed for measurement of pCO[.sub]2[/] in which a Soverinkhauz [transliteration] electrode measures the pH of a bicarbonate solution in a container secured to the end of the light guide [66]. Another fiber-optic sensor was also developed for determination of O[.sub]2[/] using dye phosphorescence [19]. The structure of the sensor is similar to the one used to measure pH. A powdered dye applied to organic sorbents is placed in a porous polypropylene capsule at the end of a light guide. Illumination with blue light excites phosphorescence of the dye, which emits a green glow with an intensity that is inversely proportional to the oxygen pressure. Fluorescing reagents are also used to determine metal ions. The concentration of halogen ions and pH in the physiological range are determined on the basis of fluorescence extinction using indicator systems made from polymer adsorbents [19]. Optical gas-discharge sensors based on fluorescence extinction of pirenbutyric acid were proposed for determination of oxygen [57]. Information was also communicated on an ammonium sensor in which the sensor is precipitated onto an optical fiber [58]. Fiber-optic biosensors are ideal systems for determining gases in biological objects because their response time is short and their sensitivity is high (0.017 pH/sec, 0.6 pO[.sub]2[/]/sec). Fiber-optic biosensors can register not only fluorescence and chemiluminescence, but also change in the color of the sample in question. An optical enzymatic sensor containing alkaline phosphatase was used to determine p-nitrophenylphosphatase. Change in color of the substrate is registered by a photodiode. An enzymatic electrode with a peroxidase photoreceptor secured to a silicon surface (or a reaction chain of greater complexity) was proposed for quantitative determination of hydrogen peroxide, and for analysis of the activity of oxidases and products--glucose, cholesterol, uric acid, hypoxanthine etc. [60]. Polyenzymatic complexes bound to a permeable membrane at the end of an optical light fiber will obviously become the principal sensory elements of specific sensors in the future. Fiber-optic biosensors are a new resource for obtaining biological and chemical information. They are irreplaceable wherever it is difficult to obtain such information by other means, especially in medicine, where sensory components must tolerate sterilization, be biocompatible, and allow precise calibration. Semiconductor field transistors are one of the most promising transducing components for biosensors. Semiconductor sensors are divided into three basic classes in accordance with one function or another: gas, ionic and biochemical. The last may be considered to be semiconductor biosensors because they use biological components as sensors--enzymes, antibodies, bacteria, tissue cells, various organoids. Beginning with the work of Bergveld [17], who was the first to propose using a field transistor to make semiconductor biosensors, different variants of such semiconductor structures were discussed in the literature [54]. The significant amount of attention devoted to such semiconductor biosensors is associated with use of integrated technology, which makes it possible to reduce the dimensions of sensors and to form different electric circuit components on the same chip out of which the biosensor is made. The possibility of creating so-called multibiosensors and polyfunctional semiconductor biosensors, and organization of their mass production are also important. An example of such a biosensor would be a multibiosensor based on four field transistors, each of which is covered by a membrane bearing the corresponding enzyme [48]. It should be noted however that the output characteristics of many multibiosensors are nonlinear. Advantages of semiconductor biosensors include a high degree of integration, and the possibility for creating polyfunctional sensors and using them for continuous monitoring. It is expected that biosensors will be used extensively not only in medicine and bioengineering [27,28,85] but also in analytical instrument making and microelectronics [30,32], as well as in the creation of biorobots and biocomputers [88,98]. We can expect that biosensors operating on new principles and providing for the highest degree of perfection and the highest information level in the development of methods for investigating systems will soon make their appearance. The prospects of development in this direction are obvious. Bibliography 1. Arenkov, P. Ya. and Lavrentyeva, M.
