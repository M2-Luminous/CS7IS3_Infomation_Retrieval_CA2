Grochowski; place and date not given: "I Believe That There Will Be an Agreement"] [Text] [Grochowski] Is the latest dispute between the president and parliament merely about the Constitution? [Falandysz] It is difficult to say for sure, because every political dispute has consequences that go beyond its initial subject. But this dispute concerns the method of drafting the Constitution. I think the president is right to say that one should give it exceptional legislative treatment. [Grochowski] The slogan "Take matters into your own hands" is very controversial. It could be interpreted as an attempt to deprive parliament of the legitimacy that was accorded to it by fully free and democratic elections. [Falandysz] Nobody has ever questioned this legitimacy. It was not the president who began to amend the law on preparing and adopting a new Constitution to make it necessary for the Constitution to be approved by the population in a general referendum. What happened was that certain people suddenly began to think about an initial constitutional referendum. We think that this is a bad idea. Needless to say, the president did not object to this idea, but he did suggest a different solution whereby any organized group of citizens may submit its own draft Constitution to the National Assembly Constitutional Commission. The idea of dissolving parliament should parliament's own draft Constitution be rejected in a referendum has nothing to do with undermining parliament's legitimacy, either. Parliament itself has decided on direct democracy, and all we wanted to do was expand this democracy. However, it turns out that the deputies cannot even be bothered to consider the president's's draft Constitution. [Grochowski] Various explanations are being given for the present situation. The most frequent explanation is that the president has already started his election campaign. [Falandysz] This conflict would never have come about if the Sejm had displayed at least a tiny bit of courtesy and conveyed the draft Constitutions to the Commission. How can one suspect the president of starting his election campaign if it is not his fault that the dispute started in the first place? [Grochowski] There is talk of another "war at the top" designed to break up the present government coalition. [Falandysz] In politics, one ought to avoid mistakes, and once a mistake has been made, one ought to admit it. The Sejm cannot reject an initiative from the head of state without any more ado. It can criticize such an initiative, as it has already done, but it should also accord it proper treatment and let standing committees hold discussions on it. Yet in the meantime, the doors of parliament have been slammed in the president's face. But there is no war at the top. After all, President Walesa is not under parliament's authority. [Grochowski] Then why is the Belvedere mainly attacking the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], even though a part of the Polish Peasant Party and Union of Labor also voted against the president's draft Constitution? [Falandysz] Prominent SLD politicians have also defended parliament's decision to throw out Walesa's draft Constitution. The Peasant Party kept silent. All this can be taken to mean that the SLD is at war with the president. [Grochowski] The president has the right to withdraw any legislative initiative of his, including his draft Constitution. Anyone who submits a legislative initiative has a similar right. But I am not sure if the president's representative can cease taking part in the work of the Constitutional Commission. [Falandysz] One can apply various interpretations, including one whereby without a presidential representative, the Constitutional Commission cannot perform its work. One might also say that the president has a duty to send a representative to this Commission. But nowhere is it written who this representative should be, and the law certainly does not say it has to be me. However, former prime ministers Suchocka and Mazowiecki are correct in saying that the Constitution can only be formed with the president's participation, and everything must be done to make him participate. [Grochowski] Do you see any solution to this problem? [Falandysz] Yes. I think one should seek a compromise. One such compromise is the inclusion of a group of people from outside parliament in the work of the Constitutional Commission. One could go even further. The Sejm could restrict itself to current affairs and let the new Constitution be prepared by a separate constitutional body consisting of representatives of all parties. Each party would be represented therein in a proportion that corresponds to the votes that it received in the parliamentary elections. There are various possible solutions, and one has to pick the best one. After all, the Constitution is supposed to be apolitical, and must be addressed to the whole population, including those who lost the elections. And yet the parliamentary majority is inclined to adhere stubbornly to its convictions, an attitude that could isolate the authors of the new Constitution. In such a case, a referendum would turn even a perfectly worded Constitution into a political text that serves the interests of the present parliamentary majority. [Grochowski] Is anyone in Poland seriously concerned about the new Constitution? All the proposals that have been presented are merely delaying work on it. [Falandysz] Unlike the SLD and Union of Labor, the president has never insisted that work on the new Constitution be speeded up so that it can be adopted as quickly as possible. We cannot have a sloppy Constitution. Those postcommunist countries that rushed to produce e new Constitution are now regretting their haste. In the army, various scenarios have to be tried out on exercise grounds before they are put into practice. In politics, such a training ground is the Small Constitution. However, instead of trying ideas out, our politicians are attempting to impose on the population whatever they think fit. And yet the Constitution cannot be merely the outcome of decisions by politicians. It must be the end result of a political process. [Grochowski] You mean, it must be the culmination of a certain stage of political change? [Falandysz] Yes, otherwise it is very difficult to define Poland's future. [Grochowski] We know there is an urgent need to define powers concerning Poland's defense. The president wants to form a National Security Council. Will the present conflict not block this idea? [Falandysz] Presidential ideas about national defense have always been in danger of being rejected by a parliamentary majority. One can understand parliament's reluctance to increase the president's powers, but as the president is constitutionally responsible for Polish security, his powers in this sphere have to be wider. This topic will be very difficult to discuss, but I still think that an agreement on it will be reached. I think the views of the military community should determine the outcome of this debate, because for understandable reasons, the army is subject to different rules. [Grochowski] The president has said he sees no possibility of cooperating with a parliament that is dominated by the left wing. Does this inability to cooperate with parliament only concern constitutional issues? [Falandysz] The president has made it clear that he sees no possibility of discussing his constitutional initiative with parliament. But he has also said that he will cooperate with the Sejm speaker on every other issue. That should dissolve all the speculation.
