The most acute problem facing your branch is the order issued by President of the Crimean Autonomy [as heard] Meshkov regarding the military service of Crimean residents on Crimean territory. What are your impressions and assessments of this development? [Bizhan] Your question is right. Really, it is very important that such a question has been raised. This is why the [defense] minister resolved so forcefully and quickly to send a group to the Crimea headed by the deputy defense minister to immediately, so to say, examine the situation on the spot. My impressions are the following. I am very glad that our military structures -- including the Crimea's military commissar, the military commissar of Sevastopol, the command of our Navy and Air Force, and the 32d Corps Command -- understand it in such a way as they should understand: This order is unlawful, has no underlaying legal basis, and is not subject to being obeyed. They will not obey it. That is to say, it is not necessary today to conduct work with this commanding structure to elucidate the position of the defense minister. Therefore, after my return, I was glad to report to the defense minister that we have conscious and aware people there -- they are Ukrainian citizens, real and true, and they will comply to Ukraine's laws and the instructions of our supreme commander of the Armed Forces and the defense minister.
