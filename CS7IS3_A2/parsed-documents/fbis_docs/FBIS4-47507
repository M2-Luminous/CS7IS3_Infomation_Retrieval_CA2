Specifically, the void reactivity coefficient (_a_[.sub]_P_[/]) was reduced by placing additional absorbers into the reactor core's fuel channels and switching the reactor over to fuel that was 2.4 percent enriched in uranium 235 (instead of 2.0 percent). Between 1986 and the present, the number of additional absorbers in the reactor cores of the first, second, and third units at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant was increased to 80, 85, and 93 units, respectively, and between 51 and 63 percent of the fuel assemblies contained fuel that was 2.4 percent enriched in uranium 235. The safety of these measures was regularly checked by measuring the reactors' key physical parameters. The void reactivity coefficient and fast power reactivity coefficient of the reactors were checked at least every 200 effective operating days, and each time a unit was shut down for repairs, the reactors' subcriticality was estimated experimentally. The essence of the method used to measure the void reactivity coefficient lay in determining the weighted response of the reactor control system's automatic regulator when the feedwater flow rate was varied and the content of steam in in the core was altered. Preliminary analysis of the results indicated that the main factors affecting _a_[.sub]_P_[/] are the number of additional absorbers in the reactor and the number of fuel assemblies that are 2.4 percent enriched with uranium 235. A simplified model was then developed for use in estimating the effectiveness of safety measures taken on reactors. The analysis performed on the basis of the model indicated that installing 10 additional absorbers in a reactor reduces the void reactivity coefficient by 0.25_b_[.sub]ef[/] and switching the reactor to fuel that is 2.4 percent enriched in uranium 235 reduces _a_[.sub]_P_[/] with an effectiveness of 0.35_b_[.sub]ef[/] per 1,000 fuel assemblies that are 2.4 percent enriched in uranium 235. These results are consistent with published data from experiments performed at all nuclear power plants with RBMK reactors. Next, the effect of dewatering the coolant loop of the reactor protection system was estimated. No significant dependence of the magnitude of the effect on the number of additional absorbers or the number of fuel assemblies that are 2.4 percent enriched in uranium 235 was discovered.
