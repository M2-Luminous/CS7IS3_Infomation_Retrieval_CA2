Wastewaters The Agency is today promulgating concentration-based treatment standards for the TC organic constituents in wastewaters, that are identical to the levels promulgated as UTS in a separate part of today's rule. These standards were based on existing treatment data that were used to establish UTS for these same constituents in the broad array of listed wastes. Today's standards are based on data representing a variety of wastewater treatment units and are presented at the end of this section. These wastewater treatment standards apply to newly identified TC wastewaters that are managed in systems other than those regulated under the CWA, those regulated under the SDWA that inject TC wastewaters into Class I injection wells, and those zero discharge facilities that engage in CWA-equivalent treatment prior to land disposal. The treatment standards promulgated today for newly identified TC organic (D018&hyph;D043) wastewaters require treatment to meet the UTS for the TC constituent and for the underlying hazardous constituents in the TC waste as generated.
