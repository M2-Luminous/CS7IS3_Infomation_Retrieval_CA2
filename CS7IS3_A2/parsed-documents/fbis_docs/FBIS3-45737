Our side had proposed to the U.S. to try to achieve the objectives through bilateral negotiations on tariff cuts related to the ROC's bid to rejoin GATT as soon as possible, but the U.S. still prefers to assess the situation after the current talks have been completed. Please listen to a report by Huang Mei-ping. [Begin recording] [Huang] According to information received by the Economic Affairs Ministry from our delegation, representatives from both sides to the Sino-U.S. talks had fully exchanged their views on tariff reductions in the first day. U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Cassidy said: Tariff reductions are extremely important to the ROC's accession to GATT. At the same time, the ROC has not attained the targets set under the four-year tariff reduction plan. This time it has proposed taking measures for possible tariff cuts on only 40-odd industrial products, but this is still a far cry from U.S. demands. Huang Yen-chao, director general of the Board of Foreign Trade, stressed to the U.S.: Our side was psychologically prepared for tariff concessions; however, variable tariff reductions should conform with legal procedures. There are only 40-50 items that our side can offer for tariff cuts, and it is hoped that the other items would be incorporated into ROC-U.S. tariff reduction talks relating to the ROC's entry to GATT as soon as possible, and that tariff reductions should be effected by amending relevant tax regulations through legislation so as to be in line with the interests and demands of both sides. The U.S. has not specifically responded in this regard, apart from saying that it would assess the outcome of the present talks to determine whether it would formally enter into GATT talks with the ROC. An Economic Affairs Ministry official said that judging from the talks on the first day, although nothing specific was concluded, representatives from both sides are still working hard for an accord. Meanwhile, our delegation is aware of the possible formation of the World Trade Organization at an earlier date; however, authorities in Taipei have not given any instructions to the delegates to negotiate with the U.S. in light of this development. This has been a report by China Broadcasting Corporation reporter Huang Mei-ping from the Economic Affairs Ministry. [end recording]
