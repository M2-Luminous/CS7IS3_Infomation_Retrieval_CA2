Such is no longer the case. Regra Recycling GmbH in Pirmasens-Gersbach recently introduced the first facility throughout the FRG for chemical recycling of the production waste materials from PUR shoe soles. In the view of Prof. Dr. Gunter Bauer of Aalen College, it can rightfully claim to be a strictly defined recycling principle. In the words of Heinz Bader, Regra's managing director, the nearly DM1.7 million investment in the new PUR recycling system should be amortized in fewer than five years. He sees the reasons for this in the rising costs for disposal and the somewhat more favorable prices for the recycled material ``Recypol,'' compared to new material. But what makes the system quickly profitable is primarily the fact that up to 20 percent of the PUR shoe sole output can be reincorporated into the new material. Nor do existing facilities have to be overhauled. Only a metered product feed system has to be integrated for delivery of the recycled material, as Bader explained when introducing the PUR recycling system in Pirmasens in the middle of December. The batch-processing facility has a capacity of 1000 tons per year. Superficially considered, therefore, it would be over-sized for processing the approximately 70 t per year that result from the chlorofluorocarbon [CFC]-free shoe sole output of Regra Kunststofftechnik GmbH. But the company is offering the excess capacity to other firms that use similar PUR systems for recycling on a paid basis. Additionally, Bader figures that the investment risk is limited. The nearly 70 tons of PUR waste materials from his own group to be processed, have a materials value of nearly DM400,000. As the Regra managing director puts it: ``Valuable replacement materials that are too good to dispose of, not to mention the high fees for doing so.'' By comparison, the system was built by Kloeckner Ferromatik Desma, Achim, to the specifications of the recycling firm and costs approximately DM500,000, excluding R&D outlays. Prof. Dr. Gunter Bauer of Aalen College holds the patent for the process. He was entrusted with its development under a Regra research commission. The recycling company, however, has secured for itself exclusive market licensing. Elastogram GmbH, Lemfoerde, a member of the BASF group, contributed applied engineering support as a raw materials supplier of PUR systems. Development and creation of the system were sponsored by the Rhineland-Palatinate environmental and economic ministries. Bader applauded the support as nothing to be taken for granted. According to Prof. Bauer, the goal in developing the process was not to include any new materials (polyol and isocyanate components) in the process. ``That means radically modifying the process so that the only materials used for it are those already used in the manufacture of shoe soles.'' In this context, polyol is combined in a reactor with the waste material and converted into a dispersion at a maximum of 200 degrees C, using a catalyst. The Aalen professor optimistically explained: ``That is why this recycling process can rightfully claim to be a strictly defined recycling principle.'' One qualification has to be made, however. The process has to be respectively adjusted for the specific PUR recipe. Recycling experts, therefore, cannot convert one recipe one day and another the next day into a singly recycled polyol or even deliver blended PUR waste materials to the process. Still, managing director Baden is optimistic about finding customers for the system and/or recycling orders on a paid basis in the shoe sole recycling sector initially because of the similar recipes. As Prof. Bauer states: ``Other PUR processors are confronting the same problems as we are.'' For example, five million tons of PUR systems are used around the world (1991). Up to eight percent of that results from product waste materials. In this context, advances in PUR recycling technology are making a noticeable contribution to the saving of resources. Progress has also been reported in the field of processing blended PUR waste materials using glycolysis. Bernard Naber, a degreed chemist and recycling expert with BASF Schwarzheide GmbH, reported this in the course of Regra's introduction of a project of the Development Corporation for the Recycling of Plastics [EWvK] in Wiesbaden, in which recycling was tried out on 1.6 tons of PUR low-density foamed material from used car seats. As concluded by PUR experts, each automobile accounts for nearly 10 kg of foamed material of various sorts (block, cold-formed, heat-formed foamed material). In the words of Naber, the non-uniform chemical composition made it impossible to sort out the waste materials. Still, according to the Schwarzheide PUR recycling expert, despite such unfavorable preconditions, glycolysis is ``exceptionally well'' suited to be a recycling process. The reason is that in the quest for new fields of application, it turned out that the PUR recycled product can be used especially for the production of solid foamed material as well as coating systems. PUR specialists reintroduced up to 81 percent of the recycled product into the polyol components for a solid foam and up to 90 percent for a coating system. Naber is convinced: ``The recycled products display a properties profile that is comparable to that of conventionally manufactured PUR products.'' As early as the spring of 1994, therefore, an initial facility operating according to such specifications, is supposed to start processing the product residue of a large FRG automobile supplier.
