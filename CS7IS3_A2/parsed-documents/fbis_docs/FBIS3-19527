[Giraud] Following wide consultations with the social partners, the prime minister has agreed to refine the initial proposal. The additional decree to be published at the end of the month will amend to two points which are being questioned by the public. On the one hand, the content of the vocational training will be specified. On the other, young graduates with a "bac plus two" degree [two years of higher education] or with an equivalent diploma may not receive less than the minimum wage. The government will not budge any further. [Girard] The CNPF [National Council of French Employers] believes that changes to the 1937 decree on working hours will have dramatic consequences for industry. Are you going to take this into account? [Giraud] At the moment, everybody is trying to retain their own benefits. But we are not closing the door to discussions. The government has decided to extend by one month, or longer, consultations with the social partners on the new decree. Of course, the final text must be compatible with existing labor organization in industry. But any conclusion is premature for the time being. [Girard] What lessons do you draw from the Detroit summit on employment? [Giraud] Even if there were no negotiations -- that was not the purpose of the meeting -- this summit did, for the first time, allow the world's seven most industrialized countries to exchange ideas on employment. It is now established that social and economic aspects are closely linked and that it is no longer possible to deal with economic problems without also tackling the social questions. [Girard] Did the G-7 serve to establish points of convergence between the countries regarding the fight against unemployment? [Giraud] Discussions showed that the governments share common convictions. First, certain solutions were rejected. Together, we have condemned a return to protectionism, a general and compulsory reduction in working hours, and a reduced rate of productivity. The countries agreed that growth is essential to create jobs and that we must pursue macroeconomic policies favoring a return to growth. But there was a consensus that growth alone will not be enough. We did not draw up a single model to be applied to everybody. Each country has its own culture, its own customs, and its own methods of management and employment. We must not try to draw up a global plan to combat unemployment. [Girard] But beyond this, you agreed on the avenues to be pursued? [Giraud] We have identified four principal ways forward which are likely to promote jobs. The improvement of human resources through training is essential to job growth. Training which should not be aimed exclusively at the young but also at people throughout their working life. The cost of low-skilled labor is excessive, and this requires a reduction in the charges on low wages. Some countries take the view that the solution to the recession is to pay some people very low wages, below the normal wages; that is not France's position. We must remember that the "minimum wage" in the United States is 4.25 dollars an hour, or 4,300 francs gross for 169 hours. The third point is a more flexible labor organization through part-time work and working hours determined on an annual instead of weekly basis. Finally, countries are calling for a more dynamic approach to the way we handle the problem of unemployment, by requiring companies or public authorities, whichever the case may be, to support a return to work. You will be aware that these points of convergence are also to be found in Jacques Delors' White Paper as adopted by the European Council. They are also to be found in the [French] five-year law on labor, employment, and vocational training. [Girard] Has progress been made on the idea of including a social clause in trade agreements? [Giraud] Two members of the French delegation intervened in defense of the social clause, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery and myself. We were followed by the Italians, the Canadians, as well as the Greeks, who were present in their capacity as current holders of the European Union presidency. The other delegations did not intervene, but I have the feeling that the United States is not opposed to the idea. The next step now is Marrakesh. [Foreign Trade and Industry Minister] Gerard Longuet will be the French Government's representative at the Marrakesh meeting, which will lead to the establishment of the new World Trade Organization (WTO). The social clause question will again be raised. I intend, as I did last year, to argue for this once again before the WTO general assembly in June. I believe that after having sought, in various circles, the backing of other countries on the principle of such a clause, it is now up to the WTO -- as a tripartite structure -- to precisely define the content and the procedures which will ensure the widest possible ratification and respect for such a clause. I see five areas which constitute the hard core of human labor rights: free trade unions; prohibition of forced labor, that is slavery; child labor; working conditions for women; and prison labor.
