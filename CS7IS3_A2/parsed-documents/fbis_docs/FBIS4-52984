Addressing the meeting, vice chairman of Chongnyon O Hyong-chin said that the recent outrage is part of the anti-DPRK campaign of the U.S., Japanese and South Korean reactionaries over the fictitious "nuclear suspicion" against the North and an attempt to destroy the patriotic activities of Chongnyon. "It cannot be overlooked that the Japanese reactionaries, far from repenting of their past Asian aggression, are trying to turn Japan back to the road of militarism and purposefully inciting among the Japanese people national chauvinism and ill feelings against the Koreans in Japan," he said. He strongly demanded that the Japanese police immediately stop unreasonable political suppression of Chongnyon and apologize for it. At the meeting Japanese guests made speeches of solidarity and participants delivered indignation speeches. A letter of protest was adopted and a protest group was formed to hand it to the Osaka prefectural police headquarters and the Higashi police station. After the meeting the participants staged a powerful street demonstration.
