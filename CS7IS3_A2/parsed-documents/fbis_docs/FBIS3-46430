Anthony Lake said today that further improvement and development of U.S.-Chinese relations is of great strategic significance. Lake made the statement during his meeting at the White House with visiting Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, who arrived here Tuesday [25 January] at the invitation of the State Department for political consultations. The Sino-U.S. informal summit meeting in Seattle last November was important to both sides and it is very encouraging that the channels for dialogue are open and contacts are increasing, Lake said. Both sides have done their part to improve their relations, and Washington in no way "belittles" the positive steps taken by the Chinese side, Lake said. He expressed the belief that with such continuous joint efforts, it is certain that U.S.-China relations will constantly improve and develop. In reply, the Chinese vice minister said the Seattle summit marked a new beginning for improving Sino-U.S. relations and both sides should seize upon the favorable opportunity to push their ties back onto the normal track. There exist broad and common interests between China and the United States, Liu said, adding that the two sides should start from the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries and the overall situation in developing mutually beneficial cooperation. Changes in the world situation have not altered the importance of Sino-U.S. relations, Liu said, adding that their differences should be properly settled through candid dialogues. As for the differences which cannot be settled for the moment, the two sides should seek common grounds while preserving the differences and should not let the differences block the development of their relations. Liu stressed that both sides should face reality, respect each other's actual situation, take an attitude of seeking truth from facts and appropriately solve their existing differences through joint earnest efforts and on the basis of mutual respect and equality, thus enabling their relations to advance in a healthy and stable way. Besides meeting Lake, Liu also held separate meetings today with Assistant to the U.S. President for Economic Policy Robert Rubin and his deputy W. Bowman Cutter. The American hosts expressed their admiration for the achievements China has made since its reforms and opening up to the outside world and they are optimistic about the prospects of China's development in the coming years. In view of the changes that have taken place in China in the past 15 years, Rubin noted, there are reasons to believe that China will become one of the world's strongest economies in the first half of the next century. He said Washington is fully aware of the good opportunity that China's development has provided for the U.S. economy and hopes that the difficulties in bilateral relations will be solved as soon as possible so that multi-cooperation of great potentials would be further strengthened and expanded. Meanwhile, Cutter said that China is of strategic significance to the United States and nobody can deny this. Despite their differences, opportunities for further cooperation outstrip the existing problems, Cutter said. It really conforms with the interests of both countries for the United States to handle its relations with China from a long-term point of view, he said. Cutter said both sides are experienced in settling their differences through mature and wise ways and the U.S. is willing to continue to work with China in overcoming the differences and strengthening their cooperation.
