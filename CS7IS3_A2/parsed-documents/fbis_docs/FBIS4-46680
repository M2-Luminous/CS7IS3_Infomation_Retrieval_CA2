Sidorenko: "International Forum of Airports"] [Text] It was held in Moscow for the third time and was devoted to the problem of reconstruction and technical supply. Organizers of the airport conference, which took place in the Sheremetyevo hotel Novotel from 13 through 15 April, were the Aeroport Association, the European branch of the Council of the ASI [expansion not indicated]-Europe, the Ministry of Transportation of the Russian Federation, the Government of Moscow, and the international airport Sheremetyevo. The conference was opened by the president of the Aeroport Association, L. Shcheglov. Those who were gathered there were welcomed by Minister of Transportation of Russia V. Yefimov, general director of ASI-Europe F. Khamon, and the chairman of the Interstate Aviation Committee T. Anodina. Speeches and reports were presented by the department chief of the Department of Air Transportation of Russia Yu. Baranov, first deputy director of the Aeoroporty Ukrainy Association A. Trotsenko, chief of the Aeroproyekt Institute V. Ivanov, executive director of the American company Leman Brazers R. Brown, chief of the commercial division of the Italian firm Kodest P. Gella, chief of the department of foreign relations of the Aeroport de Paris H. Rouaud, chairman of the Rosaeronavigatsiya Agency and Deputy Minister of Transportation of Russia V. Shelkovnikov, vice president of the Association of Air Transportation Operators Ye. Chibirev, and others. The discussions that developed touched upon questions of world practice of construction and reconstruction of airports, the prospects for the development of airports of Russia, the CIS, and the Baltic countries, and also problems of their technical supply. One of the days of the conference was entirely devoted to the work of the exhibition of technology and equipment. Many European firms that had made a good name for themselves on our market participated in it. Among them were the Swiss Rolba and Boshung, the German ABB and Kelner, the Finnish Idman, the French Thomson, the Czech Elektrosignal, and a number of others. In addition to producers of ground technology and equipment, construction firms also participated in the exhibition. A special time was set apart for presentations from firms and business negotiations. The exhibition was viewed by members of ASI-Europe. And then a meeting of this representative of this European agency was held in Moscow for the first time. We are presenting some of the reports and speeches heard at the conference in abridged form for the readers' attention. They are published on pages 2-3. State Support for Renovation of Airports of Russia Yu. Baranov, department chief of the Department of Air Transportation. State support for airports has a special purpose and is aimed primarily at providing for the development of their infrastructure and introducing advanced systems and technologies. Mechanisms for state support are based on the following principles: --the object of support is not the enterprise itself but the specific transportation services, facilities, or systems; --for objects of state support there will be monitoring of costs and results and also mechanisms providing for unconditional utilization of funds only for their direct purpose will be applied; --airports will receive state support, as a rule, on a contractual basis and according to principles of competition. The investment policy is aimed at priority support for key projects and programs and provides for reduction of direct budget financing through the development of new forms of investment activity. The network of airports of the Russian Federation, which in practice was formed during the preceding period, at the present time includes about 1,000 airports of various classes. The basis of the network is made up of 67 of the largest airports, which are considered to be federally significant. These airports handled 78 percent of the overall volume of dispatches in Russia as a whole. Right up until 1990 the growth rates of the transportation volumes were increasing considerably but the volume of capital investments in the construction of airports lagged behind significantly. At the present time a number of enterprises require expansion, reconstruction, and technical retooling. Some of them, because of ecological and production factors, must be moved outside the built-up urban area. The average level of provision of production capacities for buildings and structures at the present time does not exceed 69 percent. The network of international airports is actually poorly developed. They do not have the necessary conditions, corresponding to the world level, for servicing airline passengers and handling freight. The ground production base of the airports does not meet advanced and current requirements for economy in supporting the transportation process. In the future there must be a slowing up of the rates of reduction of volumes of transportation work that is observed at the present time with further stabilization of shipments and subsequent growth of their volumes (by the year 2000--by 28 percent, and by the year 2005--by 85 percent of the 1995 level for passenger transportation). Because of this, the need for intensive development of the production base of airports continues to be crucial. Changes in the geopolitical situation and the development of direct international communications among certain airports require improvement of the structure of their network and also support for international transportation with a level of service that corresponds to the world level. Taking the above into account, the most important need at the present time is for improvement of the system of state regulation of the development of airports. One of the instruments for this regulation is the Program for Development of Airports of Russia. It was developed taking previous plans and program documents into account and is a constituent part of the State Program for Development of Air Transportation in Russia up to the Year 2000. The implementation of the program, which is based on the actual condition of the production base of airports and the scale of the measures and also the considerable volume of necessary budget allocations, is envisioned in three stages. The first stage is stabilization of the economic situation (1993-1995) and the implementation in airports of program measures for providing for stable functioning of air transportation. The second stage is active implementation of the state structural policy (1996-2000). The implementation in priority airports of comprehensive and balanced development of fixed production capital and the growth of production capacities of buildings and structures in keeping with the future structure of the fleet of aircraft and taking into account the volumes of air transportation work, bringing the average level of support of the facilities up to the normative level. This will be carried out through large-scale construction and reconstruction of production facilities, providing for the operation of future mainline aircraft like the Il-96 and Tu-204 and expansion of the geography of flights of aircraft like the Il-86, Tu-154M, and Yak-42; bringing the airfields up to the requirements of the Norms for Summer Suitability and development of categorized airfields; development and expansion of the network of international airports (including reserve) with the construction of facilities that meet the world level for serving international airline passengers and freight; implementation of an extensive complex of environmental protection measures. The third stage is economic growth (2001-2005), the implementation of a complex of program measures envisioned for the second stage in airports that are not included in the priority group. Simultaneously during the time period earmarked for the program, individual airports that do not meet ecological requirements will be moved outside city limits: Omsk-2 (completion of construction), Syktyvkar-2 (completion of construction), Rostov-on-Don, Bykovo (moved), and Saratov, Perm, and Irkutsk. Investments in the program are expected to be made from the republic budget, investment credit, municipal (regional) budgets, bank credit, the internal funds of the enterprises, foreign investments, the creation of joint-stock companies, and issuance of other kinds of securities. The basic directions for the development of the ground material and technical base during 1995-2000 include the following projects: --construction and reconstruction of 19 artificial takeoff and landing strips, including in the airports of Sheremetyevo, Khavarovsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Anadyr, Kaliningrad, and others; --startup of airline terminals and airline terminal complexes both for domestic lines and for international ones and also for international sectors with an overall handling capacity of 36,000 passengers per hour (Sochi, Vnukovo, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Mineralnyye Vody, Yekaterinburg, Arkhangelsk, Tyumen, Yakutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and others, and also the Mosaviatsentr complex in Moscow); --the introduction of 740,000 square meters of production space in hangar facilities for technical servicing of aircraft (Yekaterinburg, Vnukovo, Pulkovo, Magadan, Blagoveshchensk, Mineralnyye Vody, Novosibirsk, Tyumen, Yakutsk, Magadan, and others). In order to develop mainline airports of federal significance, taking into account their role in the development of the economy of the Russian Federation, and to include the airfields of these airports in federal property, there is to be state support with a tendency toward reduction as a result of the utilization of funds of the enterprises themselves as well as other sources. This is confirmed by foreign practice in investment in the development of airports. Beginning in 1993 the Ministry of Transportation of Russia introduced a contract system for state support of investment projects in order to increase the effectiveness of these processes in transportation and also to bring the mechanisms of state support for transportation enterprises, regardless of their forms of ownership, into compliance with conditions for radical economic reform. The contract system envisions granting funds for state support, as a rule, as an additional source of financing projects, keeping in mind the specific obligations of the enterprises to mobilize their own funds for these purposes and also the enlistment of additional nonbudget sources of financing; guarantees of the utilization of the financial sources that are granted strictly for their intended purpose and fines for violation of the requirements of the contract; conditions for repayment of funds granted for investment projects; conditions for granting in exceptional cases funds for state support on a nonreturnable basis. The investment projects are aimed at the development (modernization) of airports and their construction with shared participation of the state. Within the framework of investment contracts, the following mechanisms are envisioned for repayment of funds from state support: granting of special-purpose credit with the mediation of commercial banks, including preferential credit; granting investments in exchange for shares and other securities; granting means of transportation and other equipment through leasing, including preferential. In order to collect payments and interest on credit and conduct operations with securities issued by recipients of state support and to conduct leasing operations, banks, investment institutions, and leasing companies are enlisted on a contractual basis. The priority areas and the maximum amount of state support offered on a contractual basis to airline enterprises shall be established for the corresponding period by a directive of the Ministry of Transportation. The authority to conclude and monitor the fulfillment of investment contracts for granting state support shall be assigned to the Department of Air Transportation. Contracts will be concluded on the basis of consideration by a commission of applications from airline enterprises which contain their proposals for carrying out investment projects requiring state support, taking into account the recommendations (findings) of regional air transport administration. Investment contracts, including innovational ones, may be concluded on a competitive basis. In 1993, 135.5 billion rubles [R] were spent on the development of air transportation from all sources of financing, including R52.3 billion (38.6 percent) from the federal budget. An important aspect was the reimbursable basis of state allocations allotted for the construction of air transportation projects. The limited state allocations were used only for the construction of the most important objects. This provision led to a situation where the aviation enterprises spent R82 billion of their own funds or 60 percent of all the sources of financing to pay for equipment and the development of the ground base for airports. State support was provided for the construction of the most important facilities, including: three complexes of airports--in Omsk, Syktyvkar, and Vorkuta, six takeoff and landing strips, five airline terminal buildings, three production facilities for plants, five aviation-technical bases, and other air transport facilities. The largest of them were: the takeoff and landing strips in St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Volgograd, the airline terminal buildings in Khabarovsk and Sochi, the international sectors of airline terminals in Chita and Samara, production facilities in Krasnoyarsk and Khabarovsk, hangars in Krasnoyarsk, Arkhangelsk, Irkutsk, and Vnukovo, and a fuel and lubricant warehouse in Magadan. International sections of airline terminal buildings were introduced in Chita and Samara. In Khabarovsk they introduced an international section and the largest airline terminal in the Far East that will handle 1,500 passengers per hour, airfield paving in Kaliningrad, a fuel and lubricant warehouse in Magadan, and other facilities. An important part of the development of airports of Russia is the enlistment of foreign investments. In spite of the absence of clearcut legislation providing guarantees for foreign investments in the Russian aviation market, the number of facilities in which foreign investors participate is increasing. At the present time the joint Russian-German enterprise Aeroport Moskva is reconstructing the Sheremetyevo-1 Airport. In conjunction with Japanese firms they have built the building for the international section for passengers in Khabarovsk. The joint enterprise of the airline company Air Russia, created by the Domodedovo Production Association and the airline company British Airways is completing preparatory work on the construction of an international airline terminal with handling capacity of 1,000 passengers per hour in the Domodedovo airport. Agreement has been reached between the aviation enterprise and corporations of the United States concerning the intention to build an international airline terminal in Pulkovo (St. Petersburg) in 1994. Reconstruction of the international terminal in the Chita airport has been completed by the firm Union Engineering (Republic of Serbia) and work is being done on reconstruction of the takeoff and landing strip, the taxi strips, and parking places for aircraft. In keeping with the agreement between the Ministry of Transportation of Russia and the U.S. corporation Leman Brazers, technical and economic justification is being drawn up for the development of the Moscow aviation center. Planning work has been completed for the creation of a multifunctional state complex called Mosaviatsentr with the participation of the Main Agency of Air Communications and the Aerosital and Aerodroma joint ventures (Italy). The first part of the Center is to be started as early as 1994. Work is being done to prepare technical and economic justification for the development of the international airport in Murmansk. The improvement of state regulation and support for airports of Russia will continue in 1994. Unfortunately, the practice of utilizing revenues from various taxes and fees exclusively for the needs of civil aviation adopted in other European countries is not yet in effect. The aforementioned factor is a significant source of state support for the development of airports. In conclusion it should be noted that only a comprehensive approach and the creation of a favorable investment climate, acceleration of the transformation of state aviation enterprises into joint-stock companies taking into account their separation into airline companies and airports, and the accompaniment of effective legal and administrative measures can provide for proper renovation of airports of Russia. Problems of Ground Service: The Operators' View Ye. Chibirev, vice president of the Association of Air Transportation Operators. We are living through a time of large-scale reformation of civil aviation. There is the formation of market relations, the creation of a competitive environment, the transformation of forms of ownership and methods of management, the separation of airline detachments into airline companies and airports, and the generation of new management principles. Unfortunately, these processes are taking place in an unfavorable economic, political, and social situation. Moreover, they are impacted negatively both by objective factors related to difficulties with the establishment and development of the new and by subjective ones caused by shortcomings in the activity of administrative organs, managers, and collectives. There are many problems. The majority of them do not have simple solutions. Some of them cause conflicts of positions, aggravate contradictions, and lead to a struggle of interests. Interrelations among airline companies and airports are no exception here. I wish to share my views on a number of issues which, in our opinion, are crucial. Separation into airline companies and airports The need to separate airport complexes from the combined aviation detachments as independent enterprises is not disputed by anyone today. This is a necessary measure dictated by the logic of the transition to market relations. It provides for elimination of the technological monopoly of the combined detachment or production association, encourages the formation of a market for airline transportation and the development of competition, and also creates preconditions for manifestation of businesslike activity and enterprisingness. But the separation of the airports should not lead to the other extreme--the appearance of structures that have the ability to dictate arbitrarily to the airline companies. Today's practice shows the active manifestation of precisely this tendency, which frequently not only blocks the entry of airline companies into the market but also places them on the verge of destruction. The AEVT [Association of Air Transportation Operators] takes the following position here: The processes of separation of airports and their acquisition of independence should not be artificially retarded but should not develop spontaneously either. Civil aviation airports, taking their natural monopolies into account, should remain in the sphere of state control and regulation. Recognizing the transition to free rates as a progressive step, we nonetheless think that under the conditions of the absence or restriction of competition, the corresponding counterbalances must exist and function. State management organs in conjunction with the AEVT and the Aeroport Association could develop proposals, taking world experience into account, for state regulation of airport fee rates and structures of expenditures when forming them. The question of interrelations between airports and base airline companies has not been completely regulated yet. In addition to the contradictions that are manifested among them when dividing up property and the desire to encroach on the property interests of the airline companies, complications of a production-technological nature sometimes arise. The AEVT is in favor of granting the airports the right to economic management both of the areas of land they actually occupy and of the areas of land in the zone of their future development. But we are against allowing the airports to take advantage of this right to impose exorbitant conditions on the base airline companies for allotment of land for their aircraft. In general, in keeping with international practice, certain airports grant certain privileges to the base airline companies. Possibly we should adopt this practice. The question of the prices of airline fuel remains critical. Perhaps the world has never known such price "disparities" in the various regions, such price hikes, such unregulated price setting. The situation of the airline carriers in this chaos requires no comment. We are assuming that prices of airline fuel should be regulated by the state and the value added tax on it should be abolished. The creation of Rosaeronavigatsiya and the formation of IVP [expansion not indicated] and UVD [air traffic control] enterprises The AEVT does not support the aspiration of Rosaeronavigatsiya to take over all the means of radio technical support and communications. We think that this would cause serious harm to civil aviation. Air traffic control services, radio technical support for flights, and communications in the airfield zone (takeoff, landing, circuit) should remain with the airports. This will make it possible to provide for renovation and modernization of airport means of air traffic control and also maintain unity of the technological process. Discriminatory practice of airports with respect to domestic airline companies We most decisively object to this. The cost of airport fees on aircraft of Russian airline companies in the Russian Federation exceeds severalfold the cost of fees on aircraft of foreign airline companies or domestic aircraft and helicopters leased by them. The cost of one hour of parking of an aircraft of a Russian airline company in an airport amounts to 25 percent of the cost of takeoff and landing. At the same time the cost of parking an aircraft carrying a foreign flag for 24 hours is only 10 percent of the cost of takeoff and landing. For example, in the Vnukovo airport 10 hours of parking an An-12 of a Russian airline company costs R1 million and for 24 hours parking of an An-12 under a foreign flag--only $77 (R89,000)--less than half as much for parking more than twice as long! Nonstate airline companies groan under this burden and are forced to pay for a foreign flag in order to avoid such fees. We think that the policy for forming prices for airport fees and services should correspond to the principles of the various possibilities indicated in Article 15 of the Chicago Convention. Interrelations between airline companies and airports Now they do not have a clear-cut normative-legal base and, consequently, clearly designated obligations and responsibilities of the parties. This has a negative effect on the art of service to the passengers, the safety of flights, and the economic effect. Unfortunately we cannot say that separating previously consolidated airline detachments into airline companies and airports has already produced positive results with respect to these extremely important criteria. The airline company and the airport are closely connected technologically and efforts, say, to improve the art of service of passengers on board could be nullified by the lack of the same on the ground. Apparently it is time to resolutely change to a contractual basis for interrelations. The airport is obliged to guarantee and provide for a certain list of conditions and services for airline companies just as the airline company has obligations to take certain actions when continuing a trip in an emergency situation, when an aircraft is malfunctioning, when there is no aircraft fuel, etc. And agreements between the aviation base and the airline company making flights through the airport, naturally, must vary. The AEVT is prepared to become involved in the work for preparing drafts of standard agreements. Information support So far we do not have a necessary and sufficient field of information for successful operation of airline companies. Airport fees, the prices of aircraft fuel, the conditions for service, the list of services rendered, etc., with constantly changing values, are making the adoption of decisions to make air shipments by airline companies a task with many unknowns. It is no accident that attempts to make these decisions end up in losses. It cannot be ruled out that the airports are also losing a great deal here. Possibly we should jointly think about a system and mechanism for information support for airline companies and airports taking their needs and interests into account. Structural rearrangement We think that in the stage of separation of consolidated aviation detachments it would be inexpedient to separate them into more than two independent enterprises (airport and airline company). Separating the ATB [aircraft maintenance base] into an independent enterprise would be inexpedient in this case. The exception might be cases where centers (regional) for technical service and repair of aircraft are created. As for subdivisions of shops for operational technical service, ideally they should be attached to the airport. If they belong to the airline companies and there is no such service in the airport, it places them in a monopolistic position. But in this stage, in our opinion, the task is hard to carry out. Therefore the base airline company must be an object of special antimonopoly control and regulation. Regarding these and many other questions the AEVT could cooperate productively with the Aeroport Association. The basis for our interaction has been laid. It is now a matter of developing it. Paths to the Development of Airport Complex of Ukraine A. Trotsenko, first deputy director of the Airports of Ukraine Association The Ministry of Transportation of Ukraine has approved a plan for administration of civil aviation enterprises. In order to provide the conditions necessary for its establishment and development, the effective use of aviation equipment, the development of a ground base, and improvement of its ability to compete, on the basis of enterprises of the former Ukrainian civil aviation association the following have been formed: the Ukrainian civil aviation association Airports of Ukraine; the Ukrainian state airline company Airlines of Ukraine; the airline company International Airlines of Ukraine; the airline company Cargo Airlines of Ukraine; and the airline company Application of Aviation in the National Economy. In November 1993 the concept was approved for dividing the OAO [expansion not indicated] into independent state enterprises--airports and regional branches of airline companies. The concept envisions the division of the functions between airports and airline companies and the corresponding division of services and property of the OAO as well as division of funds and facilities for social purposes. This method has already been used to single out 12 airports, and this process is continuing. Leaders of five OAO's (Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa, Lvov, Donetsk, and Lugansk) did not agree to the division in the first stage. With the ministry's consent they are creating the consortium Ukrtransavia made of these OAO's with subsequent division and separation of independent airports. This way they will prolong the process of separation by two or three years. The Airports of Ukraine association, which includes 12 airports, has been instructed by the Ministry of Transportation to handle questions of capital construction, reconstruction, and retooling for all civil aviation facilities of Ukraine. It must be noted that civil aviation in Ukraine, as in other CIS states, is experiencing great difficulties. This was brought about by the breakdown of economic ties, and the large increase in the cost of energy resources, above all aircraft fuel. Therefore the volume of air shipments within Ukraine during the past three years has decreased 10-fold, which has caused them to operate at a loss. At the same time the amount of air freight is increasing on international lines. There is also a larger number of airports with access to international airlines. At the present time we are working out a concept for the development of civil aviation of Ukraine which envisions: reconstruction and retooling of the ground base for airports in Borispol, Odessa, Lvov, and Kharkov; reconstruction and retooling for international flights at airports of Donetsk, Kharkov, Uzhgorod, and Dnepropetrovsk; the construction of new airline terminals in Kiev (Zhulyany), Sumy, Khmelnitskiy, Lvov, Kharkov, Odessa, and Borispol; the construction of takeoff and landing strips in Kirovograd and Borispol. Until 1992 there were four airports in Ukraine with the status of international: Borispol, Simferopol, Odessa, and Lvov. As of today 14 of the 36 airports of Ukraine are conducting regular or chartered international flights to countries of Europe, Asia, and America. A government decree and the Ministry of Transportation of Ukraine have earmarked reconstruction and building of airline terminals for international airline travel in 30 large population points of Ukraine, and it will be necessary to do a considerable amount of construction and installation work in the airports of Zaporozhye, Kirovograd, Poltava, Sumy, Ternopol, Zhitomir, Lutsk, Berdyansk, Izmail, Kerch, Severodonetsk, and others. The concept for the development of civil aviation of Ukraine envisions the reconstruction of the Borispol airport, which will be done in two sections. First it is planned to complete reconstruction of the existing airline terminal, takeoff and landing strip No. 1, and the construction of the new airline terminal. A second section includes the reconstruction of takeoff and landing strip No. 2 and the construction of the cargo terminal and the hangar facilities. An international auction was announced for reconstruction of the first section in which the following participated: the American firm Hughes, the German Hoftiech, the French Spi Batilol [name as transliterated] and Bung, the British Costain, and a number of others. One of the main requirements under the conditions of the auction was the organization by the firm of the acquisition of credit in Western banks for the Borispol airport. The bidding commission, appointed by the Government of Ukraine, awarded first place to the French firm Bung. The results of the auction were announced in March 1992. For six months the Bung firm, which won the bidding, was not able to document the acquisition of credit for the Borispol airport and a new decision was made: to complete the reconstruction of the first section facility by facility. Credit for reconstruction of the terminal was granted by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Eximbank. An auction in conjunction with the EBRD was also declared for the delivery of equipment for the airline terminal. About 30 foreign firms participated in the auction with concrete proposals for the delivery of technological equipment for the airline terminal complex. According to the conditions of the auction the firms have to deliver, install, adjust, and release their equipment turnkey. In the near future bidding will be announced for participation in investment in the reconstruction of Borispol takeoff and landing strip-1 and the delivery of equipment for this facility. According to the contract, the reconstruction of the existing airline terminal should be completed in 1994, and in 1995-1996 it is intended to complete the reconstruction of takeoff and landing strip No. 1, which will be lengthened to 4 kilometers and equipped with a system for aircraft landing that will make it possible for the Borispol airport to receive all the large modern aircraft of both domestic and foreign airline companies. Improvement of the ground base for the airports is an inseparable part of raising the level of effectiveness of the work of air transportation. It is important to the passenger not only to fly from one geographical point to another, but also to do this with maximum convenience. The size of the aircraft fleet in and of itself cannot guarantee the flourishing of air transportation and its prestige. It is not a matter of aircraft but of the effectiveness of their use and the quality of service. It is very important to proceed from the idea that reconstruction and retooling of airports with the introduction of principally new technologies provide for the greatest results from the operation of air transportation; reconstruction of VPP's and equipping them with the latest means of landing and air traffic control will increase the safety and regularity of the flights; the compliance of systems of lighting equipment and electrical supply circuits with the requirements of the world level is one of the constituent parts of the guarantee of regularity and safety of flights; supplying the airports with new technology, equipment, means of mechanization and automation for serving passengers and maintaining airline terminals increases the comfort and the art of service for the passengers. As we know, in the financial activity of foreign airports aviation fees make up 60-70 percent. The remainder--30-40 percent--the airports obtain from extensive non-aviation activity. Reconstruction and retooling of existing production capacities of airports offer many possibilities for creating sources of income for the airport. They include: the hotel business, ground transportation, leasing of space, buildings, and GSM capacities, commercial stores and kiosks, leasing points, motor vehicle parking places, and other kinds of services.
