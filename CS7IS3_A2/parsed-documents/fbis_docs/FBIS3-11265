Alarcon, an expert on Cuban-U.S. relations, said that the beginning of congressional committee discussion of the blockade from the point of view of those who wish to eliminate it is an important step. In statements to the news agency PRENSA LATINA, Alarcon said, with reference to the third Pastors for the Peace caravan that is currently in Cuba, that the convoy is a very important example of how solidarity with Cuba is growing, even within the United States.
