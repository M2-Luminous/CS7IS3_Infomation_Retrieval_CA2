"If you choose war, you will not be able to count on us for support," Kozyrev warned Karadzic who arrived here Monday to receive a literary award from the conservative Writers' Union. The foreign minister said he supported granting Bosnian Serbs 49.1 percent of the territory in line with the proposed peace plan but that 70 percent was "much too much". He told Karadzic that if Bosnian Serbs accept the plan, "you can count on Russia's firm support," adding that it would lead to the lifting of sanctions against former Yugoslavia and fresh economic aid. Karadzic stated that Bosnian Serbs were "tired" of the four-year conflict and that they wanted peace. He thanked the Russian leadership for its support, adding: "We know that Russia is our friend." Kozyrev reiterated his call for a second ministerial meeting to pursue the efforts launched at the first conference held in Geneva in May. "This conference lead to the recognition of equal rights for all peoples of Bosnia," Kozyrev said.
