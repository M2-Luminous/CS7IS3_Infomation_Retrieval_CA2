Some 49 percent of the share ownership of the 3.1-billion-yuan Jinan-Qingdao Expressway -- one of the top-class expressways in China -- will be sold to investors from both at home and abroad, sources at the ongoing `94 Qingdao Trade Fair said today. Meanwhile, a host of transportation development projects, including construction of an expressway, four highways and a river navigation lane, as well as a harbor, costing some 15 billion yuan, are also on offer for investment at the fair. Officials of the provincial communications department noted that the winning bidders will enjoy a series of preferential policies granted by the government. For instance, they will be given priority in developing real estate and other related sectors. Zhu Zhenchang, head of the department, told a press conference that besides that batch of projects, a succession of other transportation projects will be opened to outside investors in the future.
