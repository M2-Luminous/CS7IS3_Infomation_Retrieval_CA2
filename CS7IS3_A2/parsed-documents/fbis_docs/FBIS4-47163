How much stronger has Ukraine grown as an independent state in this time? [Kravchuk] In connection with the presidential election, I have recently been spending more time in the collectives, meeting with people locally, in Kiev and Kiev Oblast, in Mykolayiv, Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Zhytomyr oblasts. And I can tell you without exaggeration that I have seen that the things that are happening on the surface and that are represented in official and unofficial interpretations and in information presented by various mass media, parties, and movements simply do not reflect the mood of the people, nor what has already been accomplished even in the most difficult sphere of all for us -- the economy. Kharkiv Oblast is a large, comprehensively developed region, with over three million inhabitants: it has a machinebuilding complex, an agrarian complex, a gas complex, and many other fields. You know, I remember when they spent more than seven years designing the T-150 tractor in Kharkiv and in the end never did finish the project, even though we are told there was financing then, and accounts were settled, and there were no problems with money. The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine held two hearings on this matter and the Secretariat held three, and still the tractor never got built. Whereas now I saw more than seven models of new tractors, all built in one year and all significantly superior to the T-150 in terms of their technical and economic indicators. This is an example of what people can do when they do not have to report to the politburo and to the secretariat, when no one stands over them telling them what to do, what paint to use, when to sow, and when to reap. But for there to be really major qualitative changes, you need time. I am convinced that despite all the difficulties, despite the decline in production, despite the reorganization and the constructive changes that will inevitably be made, the national economy and reforms are moving forward. Our political affairs are moving ahead, gradually, with difficulty, in jumps and starts, with reverses, accompanied by the reflections of various forces; the political construction of our society is under way -- in other words, we are moving ahead. Laboriously, taking into account our particular internal and external circumstances, but nonetheless moving forward. [Bazelyuk] There is no question that the peace we have in our country is a great achievement. Both our own people and the world community recognize that the president of Ukraine deserves a great deal of credit for this. Now, however, certain political circles are leaning in favor of Ukraine becoming a full-fledged, so to speak, member of the economic union, rather than just an associate member, by signing all the agreements involved in this union. As we know, these agreements provide for joint defense of the so-called borders of the CIS, including those where wars are being fought. Is it not conceivable that the new politicians might imprudently sign CIS agreements that are fatal to Ukraine, and, just as during the Afghan war, we will once again be receiving coffins holding the bodies of Ukrainian youths killed on distant and foreign borders? [Kravchuk] On the whole, it is very difficult to predict and be so certain about what will or will not happen in politics. But I can say this. Returning our society and our people to the past, knowing what serious consequences this may have, is out of the question. Although some of our present-day politicians -- if you can call them that in this respect -- do make such statements. But these statements are more in the spirit of populism than reflective of a belief that this can actually be done. For instance, I cannot understand nor take seriously a person in the leadership of a political movement who today gets up and says that it is possible to return to the Soviet Union. These are illusions. This will never happen again. Or, for example, without knowing the historical, ethnic, political, spiritual, and other roots of the issue, there are those who say that it is possible to create a so-called Slavic union. There is such an idea. But when you are dealing with an ignoramus, you can see that in describing this category as an aim, he has no idea who is behind this and what it implies. To begin with, strictly speaking, this is not a matter of a Slavic union, but of an East Slavic union. Secondly, any entity created on the national principle -- and history attests to this -- inevitably gives rise to nationalism in the worst sense of the word, because you cannot talk about nationalism or national phenomena using only a minus sign. Every current carries in it both good and bad. This is inevitably so. Thirdly, this kind of Slavic union cannot be realized in practice. When they speak of three states -- Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus (although Russia is not purely Slavic) -- [they need to keep in mind] that 35 million Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians today live outside the borders of these states. Just imagine, we create a Slavic union, then an Asian union, and then some other unions, and what are those Ukrainians, Russians, and Belarusians who find themselves living in an Asian union to do? Join the Slavic union? Are we prepared to settle the territorial issues that this would involve? The notion of this kind of union reveals a basic lack of sense. I might understand this proposal coming from an emotional person, a poet, for example, without any insult intended to anyone. But when this is being proposed by a person who considers himself a politician, he obviously fails to understand and does not know what he is saying. And if he does not know, he should remain silent. There is a golden rule: talk when you know, and if you don't, say nothing. [Bazelyuk] Leonid Makarovych, as long as Ukraine remains a member of the CIS, we in Galicia, Volhynia, and other regions will feel no peace about the fate of our state. There are various ways of dragging Ukraine into interethnic conflicts, none of which, incidentally, erupted without Moscow playing a role, and this can ultimately result in the loss of our state. We are anxious to know: when will we finally leave the CIS? [Kravchuk] If only all of Ukraine were Galicia or Volhynia... As you know, I have to deal with a Ukraine in which people in Galicia, Slobozhanshchyna, the Luhansk region, and the Crimea all think differently. To prevent quarrels and divisions, we have to ensure that we are understood everywhere, and haste is not always appropriate. You may recall that there was this notion a few years ago that Galicia could reeducate the East; all it would take would be a few columns of buses with slogans sent to the East and tomorrow we would have the same level of national consciousness there as in Galicia. But this did not happen. On the contrary, it made the situation even worse. Today, the CIS poses no threat in terms of dragging us into something; it is generally incapable of dragging anyone into anything. Take my word for it. There is no mechanism for this. The European Union has a mechanism; it has a common parliament, common legislation that regulates the economic sphere, and a council of ministers. The CIS has nothing; there are only declaratory statements and signed documents that have never been implemented in the past and are not being implemented now, because to implement them would require concerted action. If we were to sign a document today about a common economic space and tomorrow about free trade, and yet Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine continue to pursue policies inside their own countries dictated by the domestic situation in each and with no regard for the signed documents, these documents will never come into force. I tell you this as someone who signed the documents: the CIS today serves more of a psychological than a practical purpose -- it assuages the fears of that portion of the population that thinks, and is correct in doing so, that we cannot and must not (I say this to you, Galicians, whom I know well) make it our goal to split away or turn our backs on the East. If someone gets the idea that something will come from Moscow tomorrow and we immediately turn our backs on the East, we will be doomed. Because we can live in peace with such a large neighbor only if we build an intelligent and flexible policy. We do not have the strength to oppose Russia. We have to preserve our gains. We must not lose. We have to take advantage of this opportunity. And this requires flexibility, partnership, independence, concessions, becoming strong, and then we can say... But we cannot do it right away, even though I might want to... You know, if it is possible to compare all of Galicia, with all due respect for it, with just my own small wish, then you can believe me when I tell you that in the last four years so much has passed through my heart and my nervous system for Ukraine that there was nothing more in my life than the greatest wish --that tomorrow Ukraine be truly strong, truly democratic, truly prosperous and that I could say so loudly to my people. I think about this constantly, but I know that I cannot do this, and so I have to be patient. I have to keep moving forward, without falling to my knees, without bending, while driving our servile mentality out of myself and all those around me, so as not to lose this opportunity. Meanwhile, they keep telling me: "Faster, faster!" But, [as the saying goes], if you make haste, you'll make people laugh. Only this will be laughter through tears. We do not have the right to do this. And the Galicians must understand this. These are not simple matters. If, God forbid, we lose this time, I do not know what will happen. [Bazelyuk] Ukraine is a central European state and a lot is being done to build her relations with other countries, and not only with Russia. What are Ukraine's prospects in the nearest future for strengthening her contacts with the world community? [Kravchuk] On 14 June, I am going to Brussels, where Ukraine will be the first of the CIS countries to sign an agreement with the European Union on the principles of partnership. This opens up before us a real partnership with European countries, with the European market, with European culture, with everything we need to have real ties with Europe. We are being accused that Ukraine pursues a policy of self-isolation. Well, someone says so in the street, and another hears it and repeats it on television. Such people have their problems, and that determines my attitude to them. We must have normal partnership relations in the East, and in the West, and in the North, and in the South, and good-neighborly relations with our neighbors. That is the only way to live without forever having to worry about our borders, about whether there is someone standing behind our backs and what their intentions are. Otherwise, we will have to focus all our efforts on defending ourselves, and we will have to surround ourselves with a great force. This is not realistically possible in our present situation. That is why we have chosen to develop relations in Europe, in the West, the East, the South, and the North. The signing of the partnership agreement with the European Union will be the first, very important step for Ukraine. [Bazelyuk] Leonid Makarovych, your opponents quite often accuse you of backing down at times when it is necessary to stand up for the national interests of Ukraine. [Kravchuk] Give me an example. [Bazelyuk] For example, on the issue of the Black Sea fleet. Another issue that is very painful to us all is Crimea. You know, the voters will also base their decision regarding whom to vote for in the presidential election in large measure on each candidate's approach to the Crimean question. Thus when one of them recently announced that he will do with Crimea what the residents of that peninsula vote for, clearly sensible people will not vote for him. [Kravchuk] He simply does not understand certain fundamental things. The question of Crimea is not something that concerns only the population of Crimea; this concerns Ukraine as a whole. Even if we were to consider the possibility of deciding Crimea's status by referendum, this would have to be an all-Ukrainian referendum. We have to remember that for forty years, I, my parents, and yours have worked to develop Crimea. It was Ukraine that did this -- I say this without exaggeration --the roads, the water, the resorts -- everything that was possible to do. Today, all of a sudden, they tell me that it is solely up to the population that lives in the Crimea to decide the Crimean question. What if this population decides it on the basis of the national idea, for example, or some other idea? Am I to agree to this? Under no circumstances. I firmly maintain the position that the Crimea was and will remain part of Ukraine. The constitutional recognition of this postulate is the starting point and ultimate goal of building relations with the Crimea. No other option is possible. If the Crimea chooses another course, we will respond appropriately. You see, I made concessions up to the point that territorial integrity became the issue. Then I said: "You have crossed the red line." That was the end. Whatever the Crimea passes, we revoke. I have stated officially at all levels: "Ukraine -- yes, in accordance with the constitutional regime -- yes. We will defend our integrity and inviolability, and everyone must understand this." Otherwise, the world will never respect us. A state, president, or government that does not defend territorial integrity, sovereignty, and inviolability of borders cannot be regarded as a state, a president, or a government. My sole concern is to avoid a clash, to avoid a confrontation. So far, we have been successful. I can see the situation in the Crimea changing before our eyes. The people have also realized that the moment of what might be called general romanticism has passed, that the limit has been reached and from now on we will work in accordance with the constitution. And no declarations, no threats that they will do something in the Crimea without us -- these are merely intentions, whereas the proof will be in actions, and I am convinced that these actions will be in favor of Ukraine. [Bazelyuk] Moscow politicians are now promoting a new idea: they say, why does Ukraine not establish relations with the Crimea along the same lines as Russia's relations with Tatarstan? What firm step can be taken to put an end to the chauvinist bacchanal in the Crimea, where normal people are anxiously awaiting just such a step? [Kravchuk] Let me tell you about Tatarstan. The people who recommend this solution have not read the agreement signed by Yeltsin and Sheymiyev. I have read it. It contains federal powers, Tatarstan's powers, and shared powers. The armed forces, the organs of the ministry of internal affairs, and the security organs are all under the jurisdiction of the federal government, and Tatarstan has no say in these matters. Other key spheres are also shared. In the Crimea, they even wanted to have their own army and all the power structures; they wanted Ukraine to get out completely. The Crimean leadership's position is that the peninsula is an independent state and that its connection with Ukraine is allegedly only a formality. The suggestion that we should look to Tatarstan as a model is an insidious attempt at deceiving people. I say, fine, let's read this agreement and you will see that our law on the division of powers gives just as many powers to the Crimean side. We can review them and add to them. But on one condition only: that the Crimea is an autonomous republic that is part of Ukraine, and we strike from the agenda all territorial issues, all issues pertaining to a review of borders, all talk of the Crimea wanting to leave someplace and or go someplace, to unite with someone, because 1954 was supposedly a mistake. None of these issues should even be raised. [Bazelyuk] Allow me to return once again to the question of your yieldingness with respect to the Black Sea Fleet. On 5 April 1992, you signed a decree subordinating the Black Sea Fleet and the strategic armed forces to Ukraine. Subsequently, you put a moratorium on your own decree. Then, in the process of settling the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, we made significant concessions to Russia. Even now, when the question of where the Naval Forces of Ukraine are to be based is under discussion, our forces are being offered Balaklava, where neither our large surface ships, nor our large submarines will be able to enter the bay, and Danuzlav, where ships can only move in one direction. [Kravchuk] Is that what members of the military say? [Bazelyuk] Yes, members of the military say so. All the same, why has your decree of 5 April 1992 not been implemented in full -- why are the strategic forces subordinated to Ukraine and the Black Sea Fleet is not? [Kravchuk] If you recall, the day after I issued my decree, Yeltsin issued a decree of his own, subordinating the Black Sea Fleet to Russia. And so there were two decrees -- mine and Yeltsin's. The situation grew tense and could have become explosive. If all the officers and sailors serving in the Black Sea Fleet thought the way I wrote in my decree, if Sevastopol were Lviv and the population had taken an appropriate stand, the situation would have been different. It was necessary to relieve the tension. Then Yeltsin said that he would suspend the relevant article of his decree if I suspended mine until the problem of the Black Sea Fleet was resolved. So much for the record. Now let us examine the practical aspects. Let us pose the question bluntly: will Russia leave Sevastopol today or not? [Bazelyuk] She will if she is removed by force. [Kravchuk] Exactly. You are correct in saying that the only way to achieve this is to use force. But we will not remove Russia from Sevastopol by force. Everyone understands this. Force means fighting. Neither I, nor you wants this. That means that the only option we have is to negotiate. Russia and her president have declared officially that they cannot leave Sevastopol at this time and that they will not do so. This declaration has been made. I do not like it. I believe that those who think in normal terms, in terms of international categories and international legal norms, could make a series of arguments to show that this statement is incompatible with international standards. But the situation is what it is, and this declaration has been made by a state that has power today. This state issues a declaration not regarding Kiev directly; it makes it with respect to Sevastopol. The Russian parliament declares Sevastopol to be a Russian city, and this declaration on the city's status has not been revoked to this day. That is the first point. Secondly, although he does not say so publicly, the Russian president, as well as other governing structures [in Russia], believes that Crimea, 1954, were a mistake, that this was Khrushchev's gift, and they consider the Crimea to be their territory, even though they cannot say so publicly in the broad nternational arena. This is why they say that they will not leave Sevastopol. What do I do? I say: "No, you will leave." What other steps are there? People say to me, let us appeal to international organizations, to the UN. We will declare the Russian troops to be foreign troops on our soil and then discuss this issue for years. But tell me, what world organization can order Russia to leave Sevastopol? Is there such an organization? There is not. This means that whether I like or not, my yieldingness on this issue is not a matter of my seeing a realistic solution and failing to implement it, but a matter of my understanding that the solution that is being proposed is unrealistic and impossible to carry out. People tell me to use force. Were there times in history when force was used to decide certain issues? There were. But I have to know in advance that my force will win, and I am not convinced of this. I once put this question to the former minister of defense. We were sitting together in an airplane. Talking just as you and I are talking right now. And I asked him: "What is the current correlation of Ukrainian and Russian forces in the Crimea?" One to six in Russia's favor. That was then. With Kerch and Novorosiysk nearby. Should we create a Karabakh there, start a fight that will remain part of history forever? A war between two Slavic peoples. Two nations that lived together for 340 years -- with bitterness, on bad terms, with better and worse pages in their history, but nevertheless living together, and then suddenly they should embark on a war that will end in tragedy. Or we'll create another Yugoslavia. That is what all this can lead to. I take into account not only my own wishes, but also realistic possibilities, the correlation of forces, the support of the world. Even if the world supports us, this support will be purely declarative. Believe me, there will be no direct intervention, because this involves Russia. [Bazelyuk] We now have a Supreme Council, in which not only have the Communists and Socialists taken over the top governing posts, but they also head most of the commissions. Moreover, they make declarations from the tribune about communist ideals and talk of the upcoming anniversary of the Great October Revolution. This may frighten off and turn away the world from Ukraine as a communist preserve. What is your view of this problem, Leonid Makarovych? After winning the presidential election, will you include only leftists in your team, or will you also recruit rightists, especially in light of the fact that deputies from the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists have now won seats in parliament? [Kravchuk] I know one thing: as long as I live and if I am elected, I will never allow Ukraine to return to communist times and will do everything in my power to prevent this. Anything else means tragedy. Not only because the world may or may not recognize us. This is important, but this is not a tragedy. Ultimately, they will recognize us. The tragedy lies in the fact that this would mean the complete end of Ukraine. If someone in the Supreme Council thinks that it is possible to change direction and that this will benefit the people, that we can return to a time when everything will be cheap and everyone will immediately have security, this is no more than a contemptible and overt attempt to deceive the people. It is my duty to tell people this frankly in order to prevent this from happening. Why are they fighting so hard against President Kravchuk just now? Do you think there are other reasons for this? No. Only because I stand in their way. And not because I have a negative attitude to some specific member of the party. This was never the case. I am opposed to changing course and to any attempt to represent these intentions as being good for Ukraine. They are bad for Ukraine. People tell me that things are bad today in any event. I don't deny this, but we are moving ahead and we will emerge onto a civilized path -- we definitely will. Every nation has lived through this plight. But if there is an attempt to change course, we will not solve our problems. We will end up in an even worse situation, and, moreover, one that will end in tragedy. I know Galicia, and not only Galicia, but also the center, and Kiev, and Kharkiv. Do you think that the director of a plant wants someone to stand over him again, to summon him, stifle him, trample him, force him to acknowledge that he is a good-for-nothing if he wants to keep his job, otherwise get sacked? He used to stand there and give his word while they poured filth over him and let him keep his job. Do you think that he wants more of this today? Most have long since had enough. But there are still some left. Therefore, what the people feel and what happens on the surface -- party passions, fights, and all the rest -- are totally different. They say: the people gave us their support. But that's because they lied. Unfortunately, it is still possible to deceive our people. [Bazelyuk] Does this mean that you see your main support as coming from society, from the people, and not from parties? [Kravchuk] From the people! Absolutely not from parties, which are still too weak. Let us talk frankly about the Communist Party, which I know better than anyone else. The Communist Party had 3.5 million members in Ukraine. According to the data I have, today this party numbers 250,000-300,000 members. Who has remained in its ranks? The best people that once belonged to the party have already found themselves: one works in the economy, another in the cultural sphere, another still in politics. They have gradually changed their attitudes and found themselves as people with an intellect, a certain amount of training, and a certain orientation. And those who have not found themselves and never will -- what do they want? To take power. But such people will not be able to cope with power. What do I have in common with these people today? Take national-patriotism, for example. There is a segment among these eople about whom you speak with whom it is possible to have dealings, but there is also another segment, which knows only one thing -- to fight. Pressure, war. Look at them. Those are leftists and those are leftists. Those say -- take away, and those say -- divide; those say -- hang them, and those say -- cut their heads off. Absolutely identical slogans, identical aims. And I am to deal with them? To whom should I look for support? The times are so very difficult. The people bore a bouquet, and it is made up of both flowers and thistles. I do not want to divide them into categories at this time and offend them. Consequently, I said I would not ally myself with any group. We have a constitution. Let them live in accordance with the law and work -- that's democracy. But in the work of defending the state, of moving the state forward -- to democracy, to reform, the only support I can rely on today is that of the people. [Bazelyuk] With all your concerns, do you have time to visit Rivne Oblast, your native region? [Kravchuk] Unfortunately, I do not. Perhaps during this campaign. You see, I am at a disadvantage. I have to perform the duties of president and cannot delegate these duties to anyone. There is no office of vice-president, and I cannot say: "Well, boys and girls, you stay here, while I go out to fight for the presidential chair." I cannot do this. I don't have enough time to even think about the places where I was born [as published]. [Bazelyuk] But these are the places that have probably left the most vivid impressions in your mind, are they not? [Kravchuk] Only from my childhood. I have retained the memory of our picturesque Polissya landscapes. Sometimes, during my travels, I see something and think -- this looks like home, there is an orchard like that in our village. In these comparisons, one's own native region always wins out, because, consciously or not, one always thinks one's own is the best. Perhaps I will manage to get to Rivne Oblast. I would like to, but it's possible I won't be able to manage. But I will definitely come to Lviv on 12 June. [Bazelyuk] We are waiting for you. Thank you for this interview, and I sincerely wish you victory in the presidential election.
