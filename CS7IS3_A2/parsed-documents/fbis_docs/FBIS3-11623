Mr. President, we hear you. [De Leon] With great consternation, I wish to voice, on behalf of the people and Government of Guatemala, that the tragic death of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] of Mexico, has filled me with consternation, because of the loss of an outstanding and important statesman for the democratic development of a sister country and also because I had friendship ties with him that were strengthened when he visited us as senator and president of the Permanent Conference of Latin American Political Parties. I wish to tell you that on that occasion, when I had the privilege of talking to him, we identified with our respective projects, he as political leader, and I as human rights ombudsman. Recently, he sent me a political envoy to advise me that in his program he would include the strengthening of relations between our countries, because he believed that geographical neighborhoods should be the object of broad and constructive cooperation. I think that the Mexican people are astonished, from what I have seen on television, at a crime that is condemnable from every standpoint, but the Mexican people, I think, have solid and firm institutions that are capable of overcoming unreasonable acts of violence that have been occurring everywhere in the world. In this case, they have been happening in Mexico since 1 January to the detriment of the Mexican people. The answer to provocations is within the framework of a legal regime, and, I think, it is based on the permanent inclination to ensure that justice is served, as has always been the case in the Mexican nation. The political message of Colosio gains greater strength and I think that it has become more legitimate and pure, and stands as an example for all world democratic sectors. I sent my personal message to President Salinas de Gortari, with whom I met recently during a state visit, an official visit in Mexico. I expressed my solidarity with him in this time of mourning. I told him that Guatemalans view him as a serene leader, and thus, we trust that despite the pain of this drama, he will, as well as the Mexicans, be able to overcome such as regrettable and condemnable incident, such as the one that transpired on the evening of 23 March. I also addressed, via our diplomatic mission in Mexico, the esteemed family of the illustrious missing one to voice my sorrow and the sorrow of my family, government, and Guatemalan people. I urged them to be strong in view of this regrettable incident and to have faith in God to win comfort. I said that the notable social and political accomplishments should be the best homage to his memory. As for the PRI and the other legal and democratic political forces of Mexico, I take advantage of this opportunity to voice our trust that as neighbors and brothers we will preserve peace with democracy and justice. We hope that the death of a just person will move us to reflection to pay homage to him by making his wishes come true. I thank you for the opportunity you have given me to express the deep sorrow that overtakes me this evening, because of the loss of a Mexican patriot, and because, in one way or another, this event constitutes a shakeup and commotion among a people, who in contrast to ours, is not used to this kind of violent act. I regret this profoundly, from a human standpoint, because the most precious thing to a human being is his live, and in this case it was taken away from Colosio. In my role as president of Guatemala, however, I lament this and express my sorrow to the Mexican people, who in the end are suffering consequences and it is unfair for them to suffer. We regret the events that have occurred since 1 January and events on the evening of 23 March, because we, the Guatemalan people, have suffered for so many years these kinds of violent acts, which lead nowhere. As I said earlier, I expressed my sorrow to his family, to President Salinas de Gortari, but I especially extend my condolences to the Mexican people, whom I urge to be as strong and firm as possible to preserve democracy with justice, and above all, to ensure trust in its democratic institutions that for so many years have been an example for Latin America. [Zabludovsky] Thank you very much, Mr. President. [De Leon] Thank you very much. I reiterate my condolences to all the people of Mexico.
