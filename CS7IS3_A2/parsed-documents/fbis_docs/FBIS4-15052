Deputy Viktor Sheinis, who returned from a visit to the former Yugoslavia, said his faction considered UN sanctions as "unfair and one-sided". "The Serbs are not the only side responsible for the tragic situation in the former Yugoslavia," Sheinis said, adding that sanctions on imports of energy and raw materials should be the first to be lifted. Sheinis however stressed that "it was in Russia's strategic and national interests to avoid transforming the Yugoslav crisis into a pretext for a break in relations between Russia and the West." He said that any decision concerning lifting sanctions should be taken in conjunction with the United Nations Security Council. Sheinis was joined on his visit to the former Yugoslavia by reformist deputy Mark Feygin, a member of Russia's Choice, who said that his faction had yet to decide on the issue of lifting sanctions. Earlier, four hardline deputies denounced UN sanctions as "genocide of the Serbian people" in the Balkans and said in a separate news conference that they would vote in favor of lifting the sanctions during an upcoming debate at the State Duma (lower house of parliament). The hardliners who recently visited the Serb enclave of Krajina, in Croatia, and Serbia called for a military alliance with the Serbs and said Moscow should set up a naval base off the Adriatic coast. "We must recognise on a diplomatic level the republic of Serb Krajina and establish a military and political union with that state," said Deputy Speaker Vladimir Vengerovskiy, a member of the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party. "Russia's traditional interests in the region lie with the Serbs and we must join them in a political and military union," said communist deputy Vitaly Sevastionov at a news conference. The call for a closer alliance with the Serbs came as Russian diplomats were attempting to broker a peace agreement between Croatian officials and Serbs in Krajina. The delegation said that Serb leaders in Krajina and Belgrade were prepared to offer land on the Adriatic coast to Russia for a naval base and said that up to 200,000 Russians would be welcome to live there. "They could be refugees from ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union or military leaders who lost their posts because of the pull-outs", Sevastionov said. The deputies said the Serb leaders would make an official proposal on establishing a naval base in the near future.
