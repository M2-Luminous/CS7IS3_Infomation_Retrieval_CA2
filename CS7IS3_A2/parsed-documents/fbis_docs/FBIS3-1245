Its major component is the Workers' Organisation for Socialist Action, which gained notoriety for bringing the biggest banner at other people's marches. Other components include the Cape Action League, Action Youth, Forward Youth and Mayibuye. The party has its strongest base in the Western Cape, followed by the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]. It has branches in the Eastern Transvaal, Northern Cape and Southern Cape. Support for the party has also come from individual trade unionist within both the Congress of Trade Unions and the National Council of Trade Unions. The party has fielded only 100 candidates nationally, with the first 30 comprising at least 12 shop floor workers. The party says in its manifesto that it does not hope to be government but intends to promote the formation of a Mass Workers, Party. Firmly rooted in socialist programmes, the WLP says other parties have compromised with capitalism. These are excerpts from the election manifesto: The right to work We stand for the right to work for every worker including the unemployed. We demand an immediate end to unemployment and work for all on a living unemployment benefit. We stand for a massive public works programme of electrification, building houses, schools, creches, parks, halls and roads primarily in townships. This programme must be under workers' control. The unemployed must be drawn in at a living wage. There must a state run training scheme for youth. Health, education, housing and social services We stand for state provision of free and compulsory education for all up to and including matric. State provision of adequate housing for all, as well as state provision of free health, legal, recreation and other community services that will ensure the highest possible quality of life. We stand for paid education leave of 30 days for each worker per year and longer periods of training to be negotiated with worker organisations. Economy "We believe in working class control over the means of production and distribution. We believe in socialism from below. We stand for nationalisation under worker control of the monopoly companies, banks, mines and land without compensation. All areas that have been privatised or about to be privatised like railways, electricity and steel should be renationalised under workers control." Trade unions "We stand for strong, united and democratic trade unions and community organisations. We believe in a living wage, 35-hour week with no loss of pay, an end to retrenchment and a full right to picket." Land The land shall be redistributed among all those who live and work on the land in accordance with acceptable principles of agricultural economics and democratic consultation. The land of absentee landlords and the defence force must be confiscated and used for productive purposes. Equality "The party will fight against oppression of women. Sexism at home, at the workplace, in the township and on the farms must be exposed and fought against. The disabled must receive proper rehabilitation. Children's rights should be entrenched in the constitution. The state must ensure that every child has three nutritious meals a day and be given adequate shelter and care." Apartheid crimes No general amnesty and we will bring to trial those who defended the apartheid capitalist regime. We must have our own Nuremberg trials in SA. We also stand for the bringing to book of all those involved in state corruption. Foreign debt and IMF loans Will campaign against the repayment of loans made by the apartheid state from international capital including the IMF/World Bank. Tribalism We reject these divisions and we are against federalism based on ethnic principles.
