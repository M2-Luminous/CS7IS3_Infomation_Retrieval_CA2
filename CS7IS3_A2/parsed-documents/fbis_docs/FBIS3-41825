The EP requests the Commission to draft a report at the earliest opportunity on any experiments in this field that may be underway in the Community and to immediately submit a proposal with a view to prohibiting such experimentation on Community territory. It also calls on the Community to take the initiative internationally to convene negotiations for a general prohibition of the cloning of humans. Presented by the Greens, this resolution was given the unanimous support of all the political groups. As the first parliament in the world to adopt a resolution on this subject, the European Parliament has taken an extremely important initiative in the combat for human dignity, pointed out Mr. Paul Lannoye (Greens, Belgian). Expressing indignation over what he called "the worst news of the week", Mr. Otto Habsburg (Christian Democrat, German) regretted that humanity has reached the stage at which reality, in which we can now "truly create Frankensteins", is more terrifying than fiction. "Nothing stops inventiveness," noted Professor Leon Schwartzenberg (Socialist, French), regretting that "duplicates" have been successfully created. Justifications exist, but they are all unacceptable, he added, before raising the following question: "When will women be replaced by incubators?" Human beings cannot be reduced to biological material, he went on to note. The MEP [Members of European Parliament] concluded by calling for legal provisions serving as "genuine commandments for humanity" so that Rabelais' famous comment will not come true: "Science without conscience is the ruination of the soul." On behalf of the European Commission, Sir Leon Brittan recalled that the goal of the American experiment was to help couples who cannot have children and that researchers have themselves declared that they do not intend to go further. The Commission is not aware of any experiments of this type being conducted in the Community. In any event, such experiments could not receive Community funding. He added that several Member States, including the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom, already have legal provisions banning this type of research. Even if no Community legislation exists, there is consensus on this question throughout the Community, concluded Sir Leon Brittan.
