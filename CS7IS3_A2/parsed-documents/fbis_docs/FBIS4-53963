The sources said the results of the agreement, clinched after four days of negotiations, will be announced Tuesday morning. The sources said the two sides agreed to spell out the goal of each of the four priority areas covered by the framework accord concluded in July last year. Monday's agreement should allow the two countries to reopen the framework talks, which have been ruptured since February. The sources said the broad accord would not include any reference to numerical targets or similar language that could be misunderstood as such. Details of the agreement are expected to be finalized at a meeting to be held Monday night, the sources said. Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill Clinton have said they are eager to find a common basis for resuming the framework talks before they meet at the Group of Seven summit in Naples in early July. Senior Japanese and U.S. officials, who began their latest round of negotiations Thursday, met again Monday for four hours at the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) before breaking up for further consultations among themselves. "The Japanese responded to our...(proposals) in a very positive way," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Monday morning. As the two sides broke up for consultations in the late afternoon, key members of Clinton's economic team were seen heading into the USTR building. Among them were Robert Rubin, director of the National Economic Council, Laura Tyson, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Joan Spero. U.S. officials said a news conference on the framework talks is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday. One major sticking point in the framework talks -- and the primary cause for the three-month deadlock in the negotiations -- is the idea of setting "objective criteria" to measure the progress in market access to Japan. Japan has rejected U.S. demands for quantifiable "objective criteria," saying that they may turn into "numerical targets" for U.S. exports to Japan, which would be tantamount to managed trade. Clinton has denied that is the U.S. intention, a point Kantor reiterated Monday. "We have never asked for numerical targets. We have never asked for market share," Kantor said. "That is not part of the discussion." Among the industry sectors covered under the framework accord are Japanese Government procurements of medical and telecommunications equipment.
