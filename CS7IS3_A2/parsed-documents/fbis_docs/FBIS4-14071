FBIS4-14071 "drnes080dd_94001" FBIS-NES-94-080 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Leaders Deny Secret Contacts With Israel Hamas Leaders Deny Secret Contacts With Israel PM2504134794 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Arabic 23 Apr 94 p 1 PM2504134794 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Arabic BFN [Report by 'Ali al-Salih: "Hamas Denies Secret Negotiation With Israel"] [Text] London -- A senior official in the Palestinian Hamas movement has denied the existence of any secret contacts between his movement and Israel. He also denied that the initiative launched by Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the movement's Political Bureau, indicates the existence of such contacts or any change in the movement's policy and strategy. Abu-Hamdan, Hamas representative in Tehran, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that this information is untrue and designed to distort the movement's position. Abu-Hamdan added that "the attempt to leak this false information is aimed at trying to provoke the negotiating Palestinian side into offering further concessions, especially as Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres stated after his recent meeting with Yasir 'Arafat that the agreement could be somewhat delayed." As is known, contacts have been made in the past between Israel and Hamas officials held in Israeli jails, including Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the movement's spiritual leader. On this question the Hamas representative in Tehran said that "past contacts had their own circumstances and were made with the detained brothers." He added that "Israel asked some detained brothers to convey messages to the movement's leadership abroad. Their reply was clear, namely that there could be no negotiations or contacts between jailer and prisoner. Hamas explained its position on these contacts at the time." Asked whether the truce initiative to which Dr. Abu-Marzuq stressed his commitment means Hamas' recognition of Israel and a willingness to accept the principle of negotiating with the Hebrew state, especially as the initiative was announced in the wake of operations carried out by the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam battalions inside the green strip in 'Afula and Hadera and Israel's moves to tighten the noose around the movement in both Jordan and other Arab and foreign states, Abu-Hamdan said that "the truce that Dr. Abu-Marzuq announced does not mean recognition of Israel's right to occupy or remain in any part of the Palestinian territories." He went on: "Dr. Abu-Marzuq's proposal is very clear: It means accepting a truce in order to hold free elections and, if Hamas wins those elections, it means accepting its program, which rejects Israel's existence." Abu-Hamdan added that "Hamas did not request the truce. What Dr. Abu-Marzuq said was that, if Israel wants to extricate itself from its dilemma and if it requests a truce, we will agree." Asked whether Hamas should extricate its enemy from his dilemma -- if Israel is in fact suffering one -- Abu-Hamdan said that "we are not interested in extricating Israel from its dilemma. Israel tried to extricate itself from the dilemma following its failure to protect its security after our operations, which hurt it, by trying to turn the conflict with it into an inter-Arab conflict, but it failed." Asked whether the new initiative is not an attempt by Hamas to escape pressures which face it in Jordan and those which it might face in other Arab and foreign countries, Abu-Hamdan said that "there is understanding in Hamas of Jordan's and Syria's circumstances, because any harm inflicted on their stability weakens the Palestinian cause. Thus we are interested in this question, and the statements made by the head of the Political Bureau indicate that." Asked why he is not interested in the PLO's stability in the way that he is interested in the stability of these two states, which are also participating in the peace process, Abu-Hamdan said that "the PLO is abandoning the Palestinian people's cause as a whole and granting legitimacy to that abandonment by considering itself their representative. What I am interested in is for my issue not to be abandoned. The problem with the PLO is not personal; it revolves around the nature of the settlement and the abandonment of rights." He added that "Hamas' position is against the settlement and only accepts negotiation if that negotiation is going to lead to the restoration of the Palestinian people's rights to their territory from the river to the sea. But it is unacceptable to negotiate over something unknown that might or might not be achieved. This is what the PLO is doing. In this context it is offering one concession after another." On the possibility of a meeting between 'Arafat and the Hamas leadership, as reported recently, Abu-Hamdan said that "our position on a meeting with 'Arafat has been very clear since the signing of the Oslo agreement, namely that we will not meet with him unless he backtracks on the agreement and returns to a struggle program around which all Palestinian forces can rally for the sake of liberating the land and recovering all Palestinian rights." On the agreement signed between Hamas and Fatah in the occupied territories yesterday, he said that "this agreement is a field agreement prompted by conditions. It is aimed at solving problems between the two sides and averting Palestinian infighting. That is the essence of the movement's strategy, which prohibits infighting."
