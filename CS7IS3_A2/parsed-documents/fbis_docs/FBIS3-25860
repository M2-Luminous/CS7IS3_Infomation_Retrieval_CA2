However, raising short-term interest rates to keep inflation on the ropes is something that may happen eventually, observers here said. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, at today's hearing of the congressional joint economic committee, pointed to "latent instabilities" on prices and suggested lowing interest rates to contain them. In response, President Bill Clinton said the only thing he agreed to was "there is no evidence that inflation is coming back", and "there is no need" to raise interest rates, especially the long-term ones. It is not difficult to understand why the White House is so concerned about the mere mentioning of interest rates. Last year, the interest rates dipped to historic lows, propelling the economic boom. The revival was partly driven by interest-sensitive sectors, like house construction, consumer spending on big-ticket items and business investment, which climbed by 15 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993. Home sales, stimulated by mortgage rates, the lowest in more than 25 years, bolstered purchases of furniture and appliances, while firms increased outlays on equipment and commercial real estate recovered from depression. Consumer prices index, meanwhile, edged down to a paltry 2.7 percent last year, the smallest reading since the early 1970s. The recovery is hailed as a model expansion with no inflationary growth. However, as Chairman Greenspan saw it, these are not good indicators for "emerging troubles". "Higher price inflation tends to surface rather late in the business cycle," he said. "They are rarely visible until relatively far advanced." "The challenge of monetary policy is to detect such latent instabilities in time to contain them," the chairman stressed, pointing to the weak labor market and the scant signs of improvement in exports. Since 1987, Greenspan has been the chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve systems, which contains 12 regional banks and has some controls over short-term interest rates. The President, with no right to influence the independent decisions of FED, has power to name one of FED's governors but cannot remove any of them. Short-term interest rate is represented by the federal fund rate, which is the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans. The rate has been staying at three percent for more than a year. Credit tightening will also has impact on long-term interest rates, such as the 10-year and 30-year treasury bonds and conventional mortgage rates, which have been around six to seven percent. With the recession in 1990-91, the Federal Reserve has cut short- term interest rates to record lows to spur bank lending since 1989. The FED refused to raise interest rates which might choke off growth. With the economy growing at a robust 5.9 percent in the last quarter of 1993, many observers have already noted that the central bank might act soon to raise interest rates and hold inflationary pressure in check. The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet later this week and will submit its crucial report on interest rates late next month. Greenspan's speech today served to set the stage for future actions. "We want the economy to grow in a very stable, solid way, and obviously, low interest rates are critical to that. We've got to keep interest rates down so that people can afford to borrow money," said President Clinton.
