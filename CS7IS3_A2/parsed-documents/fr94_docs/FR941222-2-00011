FR941222-2-00011 FR941222-2-00008 [A&hyph;570&hyph;828] Notice of Antidumping Duty Order: Silicomanganese From the People's Republic of China (PRC) AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michelle Frederick or John Brinkmann, Office of Antidumping Duty Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;0186 or (202) 482&hyph;5288, respectively. Scope of Order The merchandise covered by this order is silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing much smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally contains by weight not less than four percent iron, more than 30 percent manganese, more than eight percent silicon and not more than three percent phosphorous. All compositions, forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope of this investigation, including silicomanganese slag, fines and briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel production as a source of both silicon and manganese. This investigation covers all silicomanganese, regardless of its tariff classification. Most silicomanganese is currently classifiable under subheading 7202-30-0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Some silicomananese may also currently be classifiable under HTSUS subheading 7202.99.5040. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope is dispositive. Antidumping Duty Order On December 14, 1994, in accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department that an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of such imports. The ITC did not determine, pursuant to section 735(b)(4)(B)of the Act that, but for the suspension of liquidation of entries of silicomanganese from the PRC, the domestic industry would have been materially injured. When the ITC fins threat of material injury, and makes a negative ``but for'' finding, the ``Special Rule'' provision of section 736(b)(2) applies. Therefore, all unliquidated entries or warehouse withdrawals, for consumption of silicomanganese from the PRC made on or after December 14, 1994, the date on which the ITC issued its final determination of threat of material injury, will be liable for the assessment of antidumping duties. The Department will direct U.S. Customs officers to terminate the suspension of liquidation for entries entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before December 14, 1994, and to release any bond or other security, and refund any cash deposit, posted to secure the payment of estimated antidumping duties with respect to these entries. The Department will direct U.S. Customs officers to assess, upon further advice by the administering authority pursuant to section 736(a)(1) of the Act, antidumping duties equal to the amount by which the foreign market value of the merchandise exceeds the United States price for all entries of silicomanganese from the PRC. These antidumping duties will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of silicomanganese from the PRC entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date on which the ITC issued its final affirmative determination of threat of material injury. U.S. Customs officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties on this merchandise, a cash deposit of 150.00 percent ad valorem on all entries of silicomanganese from the PRC. Date Adjustment of Suspension of Liquidation Based on the information available to the Department for the preliminary determination (59 FR 31199, June 17, 1994), the Department determined that critical circumstances existed for imports of silicomanganese from the PRC, However, the ITC determined, as required by section 735(b)(4)(A) of the Act, that retroactive imposition of antidumping duties of the merchandise is not necessary to prevent recurrence of material injury that was caused by massive imports of the merchandise over a relatively short period of time. Therefore, in accordance with the ITC finding and pursuant to section 735(c)(3) of the Act, the Department will direct the Customs Service to terminate the retroactive suspension of liquidation and to release any bond or security, and refund any cash deposit required under section 733(d)(2) of the Act with respect to entries of silicomanganese, the liquidation of which was suspended retroactively under section 733(e)(2) of the Act. This notice constitutes the antidumping duty order with respect to silicomanganese from the PRC, pursuant to section 736(a) of the Act. Interested parties may contact the Central Records Unit, Room B&hyph;099 of the Main Commerce Building, for copies of an updated list of antidumping duty orders currently in effect. This order is published in accordance with section 736(a) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.21. Dated: December 19, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
