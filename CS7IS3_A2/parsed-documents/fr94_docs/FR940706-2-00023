FR940706-2-00023 FR940706-2-00015 A commenter observed that §388.1 should be revised, and the regulations changed throughout, to emphasize human resource development in place of training. Peer reviewers should be oriented to human resource development prior to their service as reviewers. The Secretary agrees that the term human resource development is descriptive of many appropriate activities under this program. However, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, uses the term ``in-service training,'' so that term is used in the regulations. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. Regarding §388.22, which sets the Secretary's priorities, a commenter asked if an application that addresses issues or activities other than the three priorities listed can be eligible for quality funds. The Secretary responds that only applications that respond to the priorities already identified by the Secretary in the regulations for this program or priorities established through future rulemaking will be considered when allocating the quality funds. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. Applicants should prepare their applications based on the proposed regulations, as modified by the expected changes contained in this notice. If additional changes are made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review, applicants will be given the opportunity to revise or resubmit their applications.
