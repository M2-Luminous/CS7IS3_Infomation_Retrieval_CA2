(4) Each owner or operator of a batch vapor or in-line solvent cleaning machine complying with the idling emission limit standards of §63.463(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(ii), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(2)(ii) shall maintain records of the initial performance test, including the idling emission rate and values of the monitoring parameters measured during the test. (5) Records of the halogenated HAP solvent content for each solvent used in a solvent cleaning machine subject to the provisions of this subpart. (b) Each owner or operator of a batch vapor or in-line solvent cleaning machine complying with §63.463 shall maintain records specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section either in electronic or written form for a period of 5 years. (1) The results of control device monitoring required under §63.466. (2) Information on the actions taken to comply with §63.463(e) and (f). This information shall include records of written or verbal orders for replacement parts, a description of the repairs made, and additional monitoring conducted to demonstrate that monitored parameters have returned to accepted levels. (3) Estimates of annual solvent consumption for each solvent cleaning machine. (4) If a carbon adsorber is used to comply with these standards, records of the date and results of the weekly measurement of the halogenated HAP solvent concentration in the carbon adsorber exhaust required in §63.466(e). (c) Each owner or operator of a batch vapor or in-line solvent cleaning machine complying with the provisions of §63.464 shall maintain records specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section either in electronic or written form for a period of 5 years. (1) The dates and amounts of solvent that are added to the solvent cleaning machine. (2) The solvent composition of wastes removed from cleaning machines as determined using the procedure described in §63.465(c)(2). (3) Calculation sheets showing how monthly emissions and the rolling 3-month average emissions from the solvent cleaning machine were determined, and the results of all calculations. (d) Each owner or operator of a solvent cleaning machine without a solvent/air interface complying with the provisions of §63.464 shall maintain records on the method used to determine the cleaning capacity of the cleaning machine.
