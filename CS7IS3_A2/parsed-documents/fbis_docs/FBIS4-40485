It was flogged with birch rods, "indiscriminately, at whatever part came to hand." People say that it would be much better to flog a live American. He would be screaming and shouting, twisting and rolling, and doing many amusing things. Cruel? Possibly. But one can well understand these people, driven to despair and sick with the "good life U.S.-style" being foisted on them by TV.
