List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 51 Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Intergovernmental relations, Lead, Nitrogen dioxide, Ozone, Particulate matter, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sulfur oxides, and Volatile organic compounds. Dated: July 14, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator. EPA proposes to amend title 40, chapter I, part 51 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: PART 51_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 51 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2), 7475(e), 7502 (a) and (b), 7503, 7601(a)(1) and 7620. Appendix M_Recommended Test Methods for State Implementation Plans 2. Appendix M to part 51 is amended by adding Method 205 to read as follows: Method 205_Verification of Gas Dilution Systems for Field Instrument Calibrations 1. Introduction 1.1 Applicability. A gas dilution system can provide known values of calibration gases through controlled dilution of high-level calibration gases with an appropriate dilution gas. The instrumental test methods in 40 CFR Part 60_e.g., Methods 3A, 6C, 7E, 10, 15, 16, 20, 25A and 25B_require on-site, multi-point calibration using gases of known concentrations. A gas dilution system that produces known low-level calibration gases from high-level calibration gases, with a degree of confidence similar to that for Protocol1 gases, may be used for compliance tests in lieu of multiple calibration gases when the gas dilution system is demonstrated to meet the requirements of this method. The Administrator may also use a gas dilution system in order to produce a wide range of Cylinder Gas Audit concentrations when conducting performance specifications according to Appendix F, 40 CFR Part 60. 1.2 Principle. The gas dilution system shall be evaluated on one analyzer once during each field test. A precalibrated analyzer is chosen, at the discretion of the source owner or operator, to demonstrate that the gas dilution system produces predictable gas concentrations spanning the range of concentrations expected during the field test. After meeting the requirements of this protocol, the remaining analyzers may be calibrated with the dilution system in accordance to the requirements of the applicable method for the duration of the field test. In Methods 15 and 16, 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A, reactive compounds may be lost in the gas dilution system. Also, in Methods 25A and 25B, 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A, calibration with target compounds other than propane is allowed. In these cases, a laboratory evaluation is required once per year in order to assure the Administrator that the system will dilute these reactive gases without significant loss. Note: The laboratory evaluation is required only if the source owner or operator plans to utilize the dilution system to prepare gases mentioned above as being reactive. 2. Specifications 2.1 Gas Dilution System. The gas dilution system shall produce calibration gases whose measured values are within # 2 percent of the predicted values. The predicted values are calculated based on the certified concentration of the supply gas (Protocol gases, when available, are recommended for their accuracy) and the gas flow rates (or dilution ratios) through the gas dilution system.
