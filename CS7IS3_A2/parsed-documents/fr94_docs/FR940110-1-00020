FR940110-1-00020 FR940110-1-00002 All persons who desire to send written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies of them to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, by the 10th day after publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The comment period is limited to 10 days so that the suspension, if found appropriate, can be implemented quickly and thereby minimize financial hardship and disruptive marketing conditions. The comments that are sent will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during normal business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)). Statement of Consideration This proposed suspension would allow a distributing plant at Kingsport, Tennessee, that is located within the Tennessee Valley marketing area and that meets all of the pooling standards of the Tennessee Valley order to be regulated under that order rather than the Carolina order, as now, despite the plant having greater sales in the Carolina marketing area. It would also allow a distributing plant located at Somerset, Kentucky, that has been regulated under the Tennessee Valley order to remain regulated there even if it should develop greater sales in the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville (Order 46) marketing area. In addition, the proposed suspension would allow a supply plant at Springfield, Kentucky, that has been supplying the Somerset plant to remain pooled under the Tennessee Valley order without having to make uneconomic shipments of milk that it contends would be necessary if the Southern Belle plant shifted to Order 46. 1. The problem of Land-O-Sun Dairies, Inc. In recent months, the blend price to producers at Kingsport, Tennessee, under the Tennessee Valley order has been significantly higher than the blend price at that location under the Carolina order. For example, during the months of July through October 1993, the Tennessee Valley blend price at Kingsport was 32 cents, 29 cents, 20 cents, and 20 cents, respectively, higher than the Carolina blend price at Kingsport. Although the Class I price at Kingsport is identical under both of these orders, the Tennessee Valley order's higher Class I utilization has resulted in a higher blend price at Kingsport during nearly every month for the past two years. The difference in blend prices at Kingsport requires Land-O-Sun Dairies, as a Carolina order handler, to pay significant over-order prices to retain its milk supply in competition with nearby handlers regulated under the Tennessee Valley order. Land-O-Sun has indicated that it cannot continue to pay these over-order prices without jeopardizing the existence of its business. It therefore proposed a suspension of certain provisions of Orders 5 and 11 that would allow it to become regulated under Order 11. As noted in the earlier proposed suspension, the paragraph that is proposed to be suspended from the Georgia order is merely a conforming change to preserve the status quo between the Carolina and Georgia orders. This change is necessary to continue the regulation of a Greenville, South Carolina, plant under the Georgia order. Without the suspension, the plant would become regulated under the Carolina order. 2. The problem of Southern Belle Dairy Company. Southern Belle Dairy at Somerset, Kentucky, has been regulated under Order 11 for the past four years. However, recently it has acquired accounts that could cause it to shift to Order 46. In recent months, the blend price at Somerset under Order 11 has been significantly higher than the blend price at that location under Order 46. For example, during the months of July through October 1993, the blend price under Order 11 at Somerset was 67 cents, 62 cents, 49 cents, and 25 cents, respectively, higher than the Order 46 price at that location. Of these amounts, 19 cents is attributable to a 19-cent higher Class I price at that location under Order 11. Southern Belle contends that if it should shift to Order 46 it would have to pay substantial over-order prices to its producers to retain its milk supply. Moreover, slight changes in sales could cause it to shift back and forth between the two orders, causing market instability and uncertainty under the base-excess programs applicable to both orders. 3. The problem of Armour Food Ingredients Company. Armour Food operates a supply plant and a nonpool manufacturing plant at Springfield, Kentucky. The supply plant has been regulated under Order 11 since August 1992. If the Southern Belle plant shifts to Order 46, Armour's supply plant would also become subject to the regulations of Order 46 because the plant is supplying milk to the Southern Belle plant. Armour contends that the plant would not qualify as a pool plant based on its present milk handling practices because, under the net shipment provision of Order 46, all of the shipments sent to its manufacturing facility from pool distributing plants for surplus disposal would be subtracted from its shipments to pool distributing plants. Armour states that to keep the milk of its producers pooled under Order 46 it would have to incur substantial increases in transportation and assembly costs. To avoid these costs, Armour proposed suspending language in the net shipment provision of Order 46. 4. Industry responses to the earlier proposed suspensions (DA&hyph;93&hyph;29 and DA&hyph;93&hyph;26). On the basis of the Land-O-Sun request, a notice of proposed suspension of provisions in Orders 5, 7, and 11 was issued on October 22, 1993 (DA&hyph;93&hyph;29)(58 FR 57970). Four comments were submitted in support of the action, and two comments were filed in opposition to it. Milkco, Inc., a handler regulated under the Carolina order with a plant in Asheville, North Carolina, stated that it supported the proposed suspension. Southern Belle Dairy also submitted a letter in support of the suspension. A letter supporting the suspension also was received from Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., on behalf of Southern Milk Sales, Inc., a dairy cooperative with producer milk pooled on the Tennessee Valley, Georgia, and Carolina orders. The cooperative notes in its letter that ``paying higher over-order values to maintain its supply of milk would jeopardize the existence of the affected distributing plant.''
