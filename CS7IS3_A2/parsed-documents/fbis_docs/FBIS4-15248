He stressed that it is impossible to stabilise the situation in the country without it, he said. Zyuganov noted that, during his latest meetings with high-ranking representatives of the administration, he had got an impression that the U.S. leadership realised Russia's problems and a new policy toward Russia was needed. At the same time, the administration underestimates the processes underway in Russia, he said. According to Zyuganov, "the situation in Russia is going from bad to worse as before". The state has become a "communicating court" and does not fulfil its functions. The crime rate has reached the scale of the post-civil-war period. The power is concentrated in the hands of one man, the Russian president, whose powers are four times as much as the U.S. President has. It lets those who have no powers and play a role of "collective baron" "conduct the Russian civil strife". The situation in many important spheres in the country is critical. Even missile systems do not undergo some necessary operations in time, he said. According to the Russian communist leader, any democracy is out of the question if there is no bread, water and heating. The stabilisation of the situation is the main task requiring coordinated efforts, of the international community in particular. The further confrontation in Russia will lead to a national tragedy. Zyuganov noted that a rather big central-leftist bloc had formed in the State Duma which can propose its own programme to overcome the crisis in the country.
