A high-level government source on 13 February revealed: "China and North Korea are supposedly discussing President Kim Il-song's visit to China," and added that "the timing is likely to be April, right after President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China." It was learned that China's invitation to President Kim Il-song was made in the course of China informing the North Korean side of President Kim Yong-sam's itinerary. President Kim Il-song will reportedly hold a summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin to discuss its nuclear issue and ways to enhance bilateral cooperation to help North Korea spur Chinese-style opening, said the government source. The source said: "China is worried about being caught in a diplomatic dilemma in case the United Nations decides to impose sanctions against North Korea," adding, "Accordingly, China is expected to invite President Kim Il-song and will stress its stance of supporting denuclearization on the Korean peninsula and will induce North Korea to adopt the policy of Chinese-style opening to stabilize the North Korean system."
