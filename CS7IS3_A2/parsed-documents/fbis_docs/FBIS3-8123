FBIS3-8123 "dreeu043__a94011" FBIS-EEU-94-043-A Document Type:Daily Report 4 March 1994 ANNEX Caech Republic Government Devalues Koruna After Slovak Move AU0303124894 Prague CTK in English 1214 GMT 3 Mar 94 AU0303124894 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, March 3 (CTK) -- In reaction to the Slovak-introduced import surcharge the Czech Republic will this afternoon devalue the Czech crown by three percent within the clearing ECU [European Currency Unit] which is used in payments between the two countries, Premier Vaclav Klaus has announced. Speaking after an emergency meeting of economic ministers, Klaus said the Czech Republic expected the 10 percent surcharge introduced as from Thursday to be in force only until July 1. Klaus said that with the devaluation of the Czech crown by three percent within the clearing ECU, the Czech crown would return to the level existing before February 8, 1993, when new payment relations with Slovakia were introduced. He said the Czech side was disappointed that it had not been sufficiently informed of the Slovak measure beforehand, at least on the level of premiers or finance ministers, adding that he had only verbal information about the Slovak step. On the information available so far, the Czech side believes the Slovak import surcharge is to last only until July 1, Klaus said. Cabinet ministers believe that the newly introduced import surcharge is identical to that existing in the latest stage in the former Czechoslovakia. "The 10-percent import surcharge is applicable primarily to goods designated for final consumption," Klaus said. The Czech cabinet believes that the introduction of the import surcharge de facto means "half-devaluation" of the Slovak crown. "Devaluation concerns imports but not Slovak exports," Klaus said. He said the Czech side considered the Slovak step to be fully legitimate and as an economic measure more acceptable than the recent administrative measure by the Slovak Government which complicated exports of Czech foodstuffs to Slovakia. He said the Czech cabinet did not expect any general or significant negative impact on the Czech economy due to the Slovak measure. "It will rather have an impact on individual regions, economic sectors and especially on individual firms," Klaus said, adding that for some Czech exporters it might mean a temporary halt in exports or decrease in profits. In view of the import surcharge, the Czech side intends to ask Slovak authorities to abolish different administrative measures which, Klaus said, have started to penetrate the Czech-Slovak trade. He mentioned the measures recently introduced by the Slovak customs which hampered exports of Czech foodstuffs to Slovakia. Klaus said the Czech Government would announce its readiness to discuss the abolition of the old bloc of the clearing account which is used for payments between the two countries for deals carried out before February 8, 1993. He said the finance minister will submit a material proposing the abolition of this account to the government. The Slovak Government has approved a similar material some time ago.
