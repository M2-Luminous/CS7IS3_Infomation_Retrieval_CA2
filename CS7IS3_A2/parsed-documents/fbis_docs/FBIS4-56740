He has said: "We are accustomed to obeying," and he added this decision will have many benefits, because it conciliates the Honduran family. He has also said this is what the people have wanted. The government and Congress have approved it unanimously; therefore, the military organization expresses solidarity with this new arrangement. Andino has said the reduction in the number of military personnel is the responsibility of Congress, which has the power to do so, but he added the military institution could recommend a specific number, "because we are supposed to know the Army's needs." As for the Armed Forces' future, Andino has said the future will be brighter, because if the voluntary draft is good for Honduras, it is also good for them. Andino has said approval of the voluntary draft shows once more that "political power has always been above military power."
