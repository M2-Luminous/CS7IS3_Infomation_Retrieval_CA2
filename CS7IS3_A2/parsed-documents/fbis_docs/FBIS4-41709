"The Kurils are our Russian islands", Rybkin said on Tuesday after visiting the picturesque Iturup Island. He quoted local residents as telling him that "such beauty should not be lost". Rybkin stressed that it is necessary to pay more attention to the development of the islands "especially in the current crisis conditions in economy". He proposed to adopt a law on the Kurils and Sakhalin which will "grant special rights to the region mostly in economic issues". This would be for the benefit of Russia in general, according to him. The speaker also urged to pay more attention to the military serving on the islands. He said the unit which he visited on Iturup has only 21 per cent of the necessary personnel and faces constant financial problems. "It is necessary to decide once and for all that the units deployed on the islands should be manned first and have priority in getting all the necessary supplies", Rybkin said. He welcomed the recent anti-poaching operation held near the Kuril Islands as it ended the ambiguity to who the islands belong. "This was not just a training for coast guards, but protection of our economic interests", he said and added that "a certain ambiguity regarding the Kuril Islands gives rise to a desire of some countries to go and make a profit at the expense of others (by fishing) actually in our internal waters". Rybkin stressed that such actions are completely inadmissible in other countries.
