FBIS4-51660 "dreas085__a94010" FBIS-EAS-94-085-A Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan ADB Trading in Yen Interest Rate Futures ADB Trading in Yen Interest Rate Futures 942A0156A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 Apr 94 p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0156A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has begun trading on the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange (TIFFE). The objective of the bank is to avoid the risk of losses associated with changes in interest rates by utilizing futures to better manage an increase in yen-denominated assets held. The move represents recognition of yen interest futures by an international agency and may support an expansion in the utilization of the yen in international markets. Other international agencies are also in the process of studying entry into the TIFFE. Total investments of the ADB as of the end of fiscal year 1993 were roughly $6.7 billion, $1.4 billion of which were yen-denominated. Those investments include not only short-term yen assets, but involve redemption of long-term yen bonds which expose the bank to risks associated with fluctuations in short-term interest rates of the yen. The portion of yen-denominated investments has continued to increase from the latter half of the 1980s and the need had risen to take risk avoidance measures. Accordingly, the ADB signed a contract with the Bank of Tokyo to engage in Euroyen interest futures transactions and has begun trading in futures via the Bank of Tokyo. During the past several days, transactions have been limited to less than 100 transactions, with one contract covering 100 million yen, but ADB plans to increase its transactions on a phased basis while keeping an eye on the markets. Since it foresees a future rise in short-term yen interest rates, it will sell interest futures for the time being. Since profits will be realized on the futures when the interest rates actually rise, such profits will be used to cover losses in the value of assets held. Yen interest futures began trading on the TIFFE in 1989. Volume of Euroyen interest futures which is a principal product traded on the exchange reached 23.38 million contracts in 1993, ranking fourth on a worldwide basis for a single product behind that for U.S. Treasury bond futures. ADB decided on full-scale participation in the markets, assuming that it can engage in stable transactions relative to yen interest futures on the TIFFE. Emphasis is placed on worldwide avoidance of risks in price fluctuations, but it has been pointed out that international transactions have not increased because inadequate avoidance measures existed for the yen. The commencement of trading in yen interest futures by an international agency of high credibility is substantiation that the Tokyo markets have acquired avoidance means to minimize risks associated with market fluctuations. As a result, there is the possibility of increased use of the yen by international financial agencies and businesses as well as increased internationalization of the yen.
