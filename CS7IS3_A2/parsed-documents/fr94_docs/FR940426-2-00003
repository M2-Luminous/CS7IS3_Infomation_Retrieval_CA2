FR940426-2-00003 FR940426-2-00001 (b) Federal statutes governing the activities of USAID require that the proceeds of USAID-guaranteed loans be used to provide affordable shelter and related infrastructure and services to below median-income families. In the extraordinary event that the Borrower materially breaches its obligation to comply with this requirement, USAID reserves the right, among its other rights and remedies, to accelerate the loan. (6) Fees: Offers should specify the placement fees and other expenses, including USAID fees, and Paying and Transfer Agent fees. Lenders are requested to include all legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses in their placement fee. Such fees and expenses shall be payable at closing from the proceeds of the loan. (7) Closing Date: As early as practicable, but not to exceed 60 days from date of selection of lender. Selection of investment bankers and/or lenders and the terms of the loan are initially subject to the individual discretion of the Borrower and thereafter subject to approval by USAID. Disbursements under the loan will be subject to certain conditions required of the Borrower by USAID as set forth in agreements between the USAID and the Borrower. The full repayment of the loans will be guaranteed by USAID. The USAID guaranty will be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America and will be issued pursuant to authority in Section 222 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the ``Act''). Lenders eligible to receive the USAID guaranty are those specified in section 238(c) of the Act. They are: (1) U.S. citizens; (2) domestic U.S. corporations, partnerships, or associations substantially beneficially owned by U.S. citizens; (3) foreign corporations whose share capital is at least 95 percent owned by U.S. citizens; and, (4) foreign partnerships or associations wholly owned by U.S. citizens. To be eligible for the USAID guaranty, the loans must be repayable in full no later than the thirtieth anniversary of the disbursement of the principal amount thereof and the interest rates may be no higher than the maximum rate established from time to time by USAID. Information as to the eligibility of investors and other aspects of the USAID housing guaranty program can be obtained from: Mr. Peter Kimm, Director, Office of Housing and Urban Programs, Agency for International Development, room 401, SA&hyph;2, Washington, DC 20523&hyph;0214, Telephone: 202/663&hyph;2530.
