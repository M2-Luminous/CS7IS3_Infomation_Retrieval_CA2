This marked the beginning of the first Czech-French exercises, agreed on by the [defense] ministers of the two countries, Francois Leotard and Antonin Baudys, agreed in Paris in April. The joint exercises are unique for both countries because they are taking place in both countries concurrently with each country using its own weapons. More than 1,000 French soldiers arrived in the Czech Republic last weekend. The exercises themselves, called Livradois, will begin on 7 June. The joint exercises are, above all, to prepare the Czech soldiers for the eventual participation in NATO missions.
