FBIS4-31948 "dreeu117_m_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-117 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA Serbian Bank Not Paying Out Deposits Serbian Bank Not Paying Out Deposits AU1606152894 Skopje MIC in English 15 Jun 94 AU1606152894 Skopje MIC English BFN [Unattributed report: "The Clients' Money Is Not at Karic Bank"] [Text] The delay in the payment of the savings deposits at Karic Banka has been lasting for 10 months now. In this period, the payment of the denar savings was carried out in limited amounts and with deferred payment. The citizens were able to withdraw 1,000 denars ($22.2) only as monthly interest, while they could not get the rest of the principal and interest. Firstly, the clients were offered to extend their agreement for fixed term deposits to another three months and then withdraw their principal and interest, but even after this period of time, they did not get anything. There are often quite unpleasant scenes between the clients and the bank clerks at the bank, sometimes the sums of the minimal paid interests are written in Serbian language, and in dinars, instead of denars. Karic Banka does not have a guarantor in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. The National Bank of Macedonia only guarantees for those banks which are registered according the new law, that is , which received working licenses. Karic Banka is a branch bank of a foreign bank and has the same treatment as the business units of other banks which have head offices outside the state and which are guaranteed for by that foreign state. This means that the clients are only left to settle the agreement signed at this branch office in the court in Belgrade, which gives little hope when it is known that also in Serbia, the citizens were cheated out their money by the Serbian banks "Jugoskandik Banka" and "Dafiment Banka". In September last year, Karic Banka had a debt to 8,000 clients of up to three million German marks and then it was said that this debt would be taken over the bank AKA, which opened a representation in Skopje and which is the first foreign branch bank registered in Macedonia. However, AKA Bank is disassociating itself from any connections with Karic Banka. It works with the economy, that is, crediting companies, but not the population. Although the public knows about the connection between AKA and Karic Banka for some time, AKA Bank denied this, these days.
