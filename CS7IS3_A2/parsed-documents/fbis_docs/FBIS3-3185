To the point where, during the annual exercise in democratic window-dressing known as the meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC), such a committee worker might mumble to a foreign journalist he saw taking notes at a meeting of provincial delegates: "I'd like to talk to you. I could tell you about all sorts of things you don't understand." For more than 20 years, a man we shall call Wang has worked on the staff of one section of the NPC's education, science, culture and public health committee. Working in a dingy Soviet-style building only a stone's throw from the real centre of power--the party's national headquarters at Zhongnanhai--Wang has pushed paper on everything from religious organisations to teachers' salaries. Paid a monthly salary of 210 renminbi (HK$185), Wang is one of those responsible for ensuring that members of the NPC's Standing Committee, which does most of the real legislative rubber-stamping, receive background information on certain categories of laws handed down from the State Council, to be passed without delay. Wang harbours no illusions about his country's political system. "There is a small group of leaders who basically have no need to listen to the people," he said. "We still have not overcome the power of emperors." Meeting with foreign journalists, for Wang, is not easy. Sequestered in a distant hotel with delegates from three provinces, he must make up an excuse late one night in order to be excused from the mass movie outing organised to keep the docile delegates entertained. But in the safety of a hotel where no delegations are staying, Wang gives vent to many years of frustration. "As long as I've been here, they've been talking about raising the influence of the NPC. But nothing has happened," he said. "During this meeting, for example, the delegates should be amending the work reports in many different ways but, in fact, they're just here to study documents. All they do is study the documents." Asked about the views of the committee chairman, Zhao Dongwan, a former minister of personnel, Wang seems bemused: "It doesn't matter. He would never dare to say anything which goes against unanimity. Nothing ever goes against the critical need for unanimity with the party. The NPC has never disagreed with the party. Do you understand?" But despite the congress's long tradition of obedience, the party often does not even bother to obtain its concurrence, he said. Like many closet democrats in China, Wang has written a book about democracy. Published in 1988, his book went through a first printing by a semi-private publisher before the company was shut down in 1989 for publishing books that had not been approved. "I don't even think about it anymore. Now, I'm more interested in other topics like the place of religion in China," he said. "That's an area which still has some hope."
