Based on initial statistics, the gross national product [GNP] of the year totalled 180.45 billion yuan, showing an increase of 13.9 percent over the previous year if calculated in terms of comparable prices. Of this, the GNP of the primary industry reached 22.3 billion yuan, up 9.1 percent; the secondary industry, 109.22 billion yuan, up 16.5 percent; and the tertiary industry, 18.93 billion yuan, up 11.7 percent. The momentum for economic development was strengthened, new changes took place in the economic pattern, the people's living continued to improved, and gratifying results were made in all undertakings. 1. Agriculture and Rural Economy All localities across the province conscientiously implemented the party's various economic policies in the rural areas, unceasingly deepened rural reform, further readjusted the rural industrial structure, accelerated the development of the "high- yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient farming" and township enterprises, and achieved breakthrough progress in agriculture and the rural economy. The total product of the rural society amounted to 182.95 billion yuan during the year, up 55.6 percent over the previous year, and its proportion in the whole province's total product of society rose from 36.6 percent to 39.2 percent. Agriculture continued to comprehensively develop. The annual agricultural output value totalled 39 billion yuan, up 9.4 percent over the previous year if calculated in terms of comparable prices. Of this, the output value of crop cultivation totalled 20.81 billion yuan, up 15.1 percent. Grain production continued to set an all-time record on the basis of reaping bumper harvests three years in a row. The annual grain output totalled 16.96 million tonnes, an increase of 1.276 million tonnes; and the output of major economic crops, such as oil-bearing crops, beets, and vegetables, except cotton which suffered a decline in production, all increased by varying degrees. A bumper fruit harvest was reaped. Of this, the output of apples broke the record of 1 million tonnes for the first time and reached 1.196 million tonnes. The output of major farm products was as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1993 |Percentage increase over | | | |1992 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Grain |16.95 tonnes |8.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |of which: paddy |3.896 million tonnes |-6.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |corn |9.891 million tonnes |14.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |wheat |665,000 tonnes |1.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |soybean |522,000 tonnes |61.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cotton |19,000 tonnes |-32.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Oil-bearing crops |218,000 tonnes |23.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Beet |538,000 tonnes |2.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cured tobacco |32,000 tonnes |the same | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Silk Cocoon |36,000 tonnes |38.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vegetables |11.627 million tonnes |15.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fruits |1.888 million tonnes |23.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- New progress was made in forestry and afforestation. The annual forestry output value reached 870 million yuan, up 10 percent over the previous year; the new afforested areas reached 162,000 hectare (2.43 million mu), up 8 percent; the average tree survival rate was 84.4 percent; and 160 million trees were planted and 12,000 hectare (177,000 mu) of saplings were cultivated on a voluntary basis. New progress was made in the five major protection forest systems and the four major afforestation projects, and the management of forestry resources was further strengthened. Animal husbandry production grew steadily. The annual animal husbandry output value totaled 11.16 billion yuan, up 11 percent from the preceding year. Meat output totaled 1.404 million tonnes, up 19.1 percent; of which pork output was 1.022 million tonnes, up 11.8 percent, and beef and mutton output was 132,000 tonnes, up 59 percent.

Fishery continued to development. The annual output of aquatic products totaled 1.517 million tonnes, up 14.7 percent from the preceding year. Of the total, seawater products came to 1.397 million tonnes, up 13.9 percent; and freshwater products 120,000 tonnes, up 25 percent. Investment in agriculture increased and conditions for production improved continuously. The annual local financial allocation for the expenses on agricultural production totaled 1.34 billion yuan, up 25.3 percent from the preceding year; and the year-end remaining sum of the agricultural loans of agricultural banks and credit cooperatives was 10.08 billion yuan, up 9.8 percent from the year- end sum of the preceding year. Technology on scientific farming was disseminated continuously. More than 95 percent of Liaoning's total cultivated land was sown to fine-strain crops; standardized cultivation of corn and rice was applied to 1.225 million hectares (18.37 million mu) of farmland, an increase of 158,000 hectares (2.37 million mu) over the preceding year; and rational application of fertilizer, plastic sheet mulching, interplanting of mixed crops, and other applicable technology were applied. Water conservation construction was intensified, and farm mechanization was upgraded continuously. In the whole year, 410 million cubic meters of earth and stone work were completed, 2,100 km of river dikes were improved, water and soil conservation areas increased by 177,000 hectares (2.65 million mu), and effective irrigated land increased by 52,000 hectares (780,000 mu).

Major problems in agriculture and rural economy were the rapid growth in the prices of the means of agricultural production and the rather low profits from farm products. 2. Industry and Construction In industry, guided by the market, enterprises deepened their reform, accelerated the transformation of the operating mechanism and structural adjustment, and notably accelerated their production rate thanks to the growth in investment and consumption. The total industrial output value of the enterprises at and above the township level came to 267.6 billion yuan, up 14.8 percent from the preceding year in terms of comparable prices; and that of all the enterprises, including those at and below the village level, was 349.98 billion yuan, up 25.9 percent, the largest annual growth rate since reform and opening up started. Industrial enterprises of different ownerships comprehensively increased in number, particularly the nonstate industrial enterprises. The annual output value of the nonstate industrial sector amounted to 166.08 billion yuan, up 50.6 percent over the previous year, and its proportion in the province's total industrial output value rose from 43.2 percent to 47.5 percent.

The output value of large- and medium-sized industrial enterprises during the year totalled 184.49 billion yuan, up 6.5 percent over the previous year. Motivated by investment demands, the heavy industrial sector maintained a rapid growth in production. The annual industrial output value totalled 277.17 billion yuan, up 28.1 percent over the previous year; the production of light industry began to pick up steadily, and the annual light industrial output value totalled 72.81 billion yuan, up 20 percent. The product mix was further readjusted and the product quality improved. Industrial enterprises organized production in line with market demands, increased the output of products that can find a ready market, and strengthened the development of new products. During the year, 5,733 varieties of new products were developed, of which, 4,211 varieties were put into production; the output value rate of new products rose from 8.2 percent from the previous year to 8.5 percent; and the product quality steadily improved.

Due to the big increases in the prices of such intermediate products as raw materials and energy resources, the blocked sales of some products, and the poor management of some enterprises, the number of money-losing enterprises and the amounts of deficits still remained high. A total of 4,399 or 19.6 percent of industrial enterprises suffered losses and the deficits reached 5.33 billion yuan. State enterprises made new headway in reform.
