Stressing that she will always make use of President Demirel's years of experience, Ciller stated that she and the president are in full accord and that nobody should be concerned about this issue. Ciller said: There are no disputes at the top of the state, and I will not permit any. Demirel received Ciller at Cankaya Mansion and conferred with her for approximately one and a half hours. Ciller answered reporters' questions on various issues after her meeting with Demirel. [Begin recording] [Ciller] I am not offended by Demirel. The president is a person for whom I have great respect. Our honorable president is at the top of the state, and there is no place for dispute. A very beneficial dialogue took place during the meeting. We assessed all the issues facing the country. We will continue to hold such meetings. We discussed various issues, from internal politics to foreign affairs and the economy. I have a very positive dialogue with the president. [Unidentified correspondent] How do you interpret Demirel's news conference this morning and his criticism of you? [Ciller] He has not informed me of any such criticism. He presented me with a summary of his news conference. I read it. I did not find any criticism there. I cannot comment on this issue, because I do not know the contents of the news conference. I repeat: There are no disputes at the top of the state. [Correspondent] Did the president advise you on any issues? [Ciller] He had various ideas and advice. There were issues to which I listened carefully. I would like to point out that this kind of dialogue has always existed between the president and myself. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Do you still hold the view that the former government's mistakes play a role in the present economic crisis? [Ciller] There are a series of problems which have existed since 1986. We cannot ignore those issues. I am determined in this view. My job is to find solutions, and that is what I am doing. Let there be no doubt that this country will emerge from this situation healthier than ever. We are going to reestablish the balance and, within a short time, everybody will notice the changes. I fully believe that the future of our country is bright. It has only been a month since we started to implement the measures. If it were possible to solve all these issues in one month, they would have been resolved in 1987. What the other governments could not do while they were the only ones in power, we are determined to achieve with a coalition government. The worst is over. We are going to start witnessing favorable developments. I must point out that once we emerge from this situation, the country will have achieved a balance that will enable us to compete with the most developed countries in the world. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] What do you think of the president's view that the life span of coalition governments is not long? [Ciller] The coalition emerges from the Assembly. In the 1991 elections, the people voted for a coalition. We are going to solve this issue in the Assembly. The regime will function. There will be important developments regarding the regime and democracy. Let nobody have arguments regarding the regime. Our democracy will also develop. We will continue with the coalition.
