The world has entered the post-Cold War period, an age of new great changes, also bringing international competition to a new stage. In this age of transition to a new century, the international test of overall national might based on S&T is growing increasingly sharper, with all countries engaged in this competition going all out to keep from being left behind. As this race is essentially an economic one, economics is increasingly becoming the fundamental factor in international competition. This is precisely why the economic relations among countries is acquiring an ever more prominent status in international relations, with a country's foreign affairs evolving increasingly into economic diplomacy. Matters such as social stability, national might, foreign relations, international standing, national self-esteem, and cultural endurance are all closely tied to economic development. In this age of internationalization and growing economic importance that is so full of challenges and opportunities, we need even more so to evaluate China's development in the context of the overall order of world development, as well as evaluating China's administrative reform in the context of the overall order of China's social development, which is the only way to see clearly certain matters of fundamental importance. In our over a decade of reform and opening since the late 1970s, Chinese society has undergone enormous changes. Whether in economics, politics, and culture or in systems, mechanisms, and concepts, we have experienced a process of profound change. Chinese society is now in a period of full-scale conversion. This social transformation can be seen in the following: 1. The conversion from a planned to a market economy. We are converting the decisionmaking on our disposition of resources from planning to markets. In a planned economy, as production factors such as capital, technology, and labor are planned and set by governments at all levels based on subordinate relations, forcing and making it possible only for enterprises to carry out their production activities in accordance with the orders of the government departments responsible for them, a planned economy is actually a command economy. But in a market economy, as factors such as capital, technology, and labor are organized in an optimum fashion by markets, with enterprises carrying out production activities according to market signals, there is a more efficient disposition of resources. This is a great conversion of our economic system and its operating forces. 2. The transformation from an agricultural to an industrial society. This transformation is symbolized by the steady drop in the percentage of our GNP made up by agriculture, accompanied by a rapid upswing in the percentage accounted for by industrial output value, with the sudden coming to the fore as a new force of township enterprises sharply accelerating this transformation. As our agricultural productivity grows, our rural areas are experiencing a large amount of surplus labor. As urbanization accelerates, our rural and urban populations are in a state of one declining while the other grows. 3. The conversion from a closed to an open society. China's closed society used to be reflected in two areas. 1. We were closed to the outside world, unilaterally emphasizing independence and self-sufficiency free from international competition, resulting in a steadily widening gap with advanced international levels. 2. We were closed internally, with industries, systems, and regions closed off from each other, responsible only to superiors in various subordinate relationships, and taking orders from superiors instead of conducting lateral economic intercourse, which violated the laws of general socialized production, and created a huge waste of resources. But through over a decade of reform, Chinese society today is in a state of openness in all directions, both internally and to the outside world. 4. The transformation from an ethical to a legal society. In an ethical society, social behavior is largely standardized by family bloodlines and marriage and family relations; but in a legal society, social behavior is more equally standardized by mostly laws. So the transformation from the former to the latter is one from favoritism through dealing with different people in different ways to universalism through equal treatment without discrimination, and from a society dominated by status to one dominated by contract. In such a process of profound social transformation, the new and old systems, orders, standards, and forces will coexist and overlap for quite a sustained period of time, producing various frictions, conflicts, and clashes that may grow particularly sharp for a time. This puts high demands on the government's role, administration, and management. From a macroperspective, the conflicts and clashes of the conversion period can be seen mainly in four areas. 1. The conflict between higher living standards and increased accumulation and investment. Any country that wants to develop its economy needs large-scale investment, meaning large amounts of funding. While some funding can be acquired from abroad, most capital formation must occur domestically, causing a conflict between steadily growing consumer aspirations and increased fund accumulation and investment. In a consumption-driven climate, the large amount of social resources urgently needed for economic development can slip away. In addition, in an initial period of economic growth, income-distribution inequality can increase, being further sharpened by a developed country's "demonstration effect," confronting the government with new pressures. 2. The contradiction between political participation and change, and stability. Basic political stability is a condition needed for economic growth. Policy formulation and enforcement can be effective only in a relatively stable political environment. In the course of a social transformation, public participation is bound to grow, even to the point of a so-called "participation explosion." So how to maintain basic political stability along with sustained change, and to preserve the necessary political order while public political participation is growing, are key matters that governments must resolve during periods of social transformation. 3. The conflict between economic system-conversion and balanced control. Economic system-conversion and the transformation of economic operating forces are the economic features of a period of social transformation. But a good start for economic activities also requires a good economic climate and order, meaning certain regulation and control mechanisms. M. J. Levy notes that after the modernization process begins, regardless whether development is as smooth or effective as imagined, it still requires a completely different type of more concentrated management, control, and coordination, which is needed for the modernization process per se. So while proceeding steadily with system conversion, it is necessary to establish a certain balanced control, to give the government diversified means of regulating and controlling economic activities. Otherwise, economic activities might no longer have rules and order, to land in a state of chaos and disorder. 4. The contradiction between cultural traditions and replacements. During periods of social transformation, the clash of outside cultures and values is often like surging waves, causing a contradiction between cultural traditions and replacements. Any society's development proceeds on its own unique historical and cultural terms, so that in the course of social transformation, while a society must change and renew, it absolutely must not wholly abandon its own cultural traditions. In fact, no society can first create a vacuum and then proceed to develop. So how to balance tradition with change is also a crucial matter. And in real life, the conflicts brought by social transformation might be far greater than even these, with their manifestations also possibly being far more complex. Such intricate contradictions put enormous pressure on government, with how to effectively cope and deal with them being a formidable government mission. Studies in modernization theory show that modernization in backward countries has two general features. 1. Political change often becomes the forerunner of economic and social change, with marked political change bringing striking economic and social change. 2. When modernization begins, as the outside world already has a far more developed society, modernization in backward countries becomes a sort of "catch-up" modernization. Japanese sociologist Fuyong Jianyi [1381 3057 0256 0001] has pointed out that social development in backward countries has the following five features: 1. Social development proceeds step by step based on particular development stages, with it being impossible to leap over intermediate stages; 2. In order for modernization and industrialization to take social roots in backward countries, government-led and conscientious modernization and industrialization policies "from top to bottom" are indispensable; 3. It is necessary to overcome clashes among domestic groups holding varying views on modernization; 4. In order to internalize as one's country's own things elements of industrial civilization, mostly S&T, that are received through cultural transmission, it is necessary for someone to undertake this internalization; 5. It is necessary to shake off the yoke of adverse international economic relations. Obviously, these five features are all very important to the course of modernization in backward countries. Historically, governments have played varying roles in different countries. In Britain, the first country to achieve modernization, the role played by government in economic development was more secondary. The only matters that Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations required government to handle were maintaining law and order and coping with foreign invasions. Decisionmaking on resource utilization and income distribution was left to markets, with government acting only as referee. But as time passed, government influence on economic development gradually expanded to the point where, without active government support, there was no successful economic development. In the second group of countries to develop, on the western part of the European continent (such as France and Germany), the system of government played a more important role in economic and social modernization. And in the countries that later modernized successfully (such as the Soviet Union and Japan), the political impact was often dominant. In other words, from the perspective of the course of worldwide economic development from modern times to contemporary to current, the economic development process has undergone a basic change from being market-determined to a state in which the role played by government is growing steadily. Meanwhile, in backward countries, the various issues necessary to be resolved for modernization, such as eliminating poverty, converting systems, expanding participation, raising literacy rates, preventing excessive income-distribution inequality, and accumulating the necessary economic development capital as quickly as possible, have steadily appeared one after another in a very short period of time. This means that the governments of backward countries must play a dynamic positive role in economic and social development, acting as powerful organizers and drivers of economic development. In the course of a country's economic growth, once the economy begins to get into a good cycle, there is often a stage of rapid growth. This stage is usually also one of powerful government dominance, such as from 1955 to 1973 in Japan, fom 1961 to 1979 in South Korea, and throughout the 1960s in Taiwan, all of which stages were ones of rapid economic growth with obvious government direction, guidance, and drive. As to China, this stage has begun, and can be predicted to continue through the end of this century and the beginning of the next. During rapid growth, the government has many ways and means of driving rapid economic growth, such as taking many protectionist steps for the country's young industries (protectionist policy), giving priority to propping up key strategic industries that the country needs urgently (industrial policy), controlling the labor movement (labor policy), and gradually increasing the international competitiveness of manufactured goods, while actively cultivating a modern market system. Taking industrial policy for instance, the crux of industrial policy is to concentrate the use of the country's limited resources in industries most advantageous to national development, by strengthening the country's industrial structure, in order to raise its international market competitiveness. Industrial policy and its expressed structural adjustment are strong leaders, not waiting for spontaneous market adjustment, but rather taking the initiative to powerfully guide structural adjustment and upgrading. And this leading role carries a certain flavor of opposition to markets. This is because the structural orientation of industrial policy does not adhere rigidly to the market dogma of "comparative advantage," often requiring rather that comparatively inferior industries be propped up to become ones with comparative advantage, thus steadily achieving industrial structural adjustment and industrial upgrading, to catch up to and even surpass advanced international standards. In order for government to successfully play a dominant role in periods of rapid growth, it needs certain qualifications, the crux of which is an efficient system of government administration. This can be seen mainly in the two areas: the need for government to have enough capability to formulate and implement policy and the need for government policymaking to be scientific and optimized. 1. Government must have an adequate and strong enough capability for it to be able to play a positive and dynamic role in economic and social development, as a government without such capability would be bound to be incapable of accomplishing anything. Government capabilities include: 1. The ability to maintain order. Any reform and development can proceed smoothly only if there is a climate of basic stability. So it can be said that a certain amount of order and stability is a prerequisite for development. Creating this prerequisite for national development is an essential governrment responsibility. 2. The capacity to mobilize the public. Catch-up and concentrated development often requires government to have great mobilization capacity and appeal, so that it can mobilize all public resources and focus all social forces to work collectively toward certain designated national targets. 3. The capability to create new policy. As the domestic and external environment for a country's economic and social development is constantly changing, the government needs to create new policies in a timely way, by making prompt responses to changes in this environment, in order to control the development-initiative authority. 4. The ability to carry out policies. Contemporary political science studies show that a crisis often faced by developing countries is an implementation crisis, in that they cannot conscientiously carry out policies, so are unable to achieve strict enforcement of orders and prohibitions. In such a state of affairs, government policies are ineffective no matter how timely or correct, so that it is only with adequate implementation capability that government will can be converted into practical action. 2. Policymaking must be scientific. As governments in backward, catch-up economies need to play a dominant role, scientific government policymaking is decisive. While the duties and responsibilities of the central government and local governments at all levels differ, optimizing government policymaking is an urgent joint responsibility. In government-dominated economic development, directed regulation, control, and guidance of policy is crucial. While the positive role of correct policy goes without saying, the negative impact of wrong policy must also not be downplayed. It is only scientific and optimized policymaking that produces correct strategies, timely policies, and effective measures, to ensure successful government dominance. In light of this, our administrative reform targets are clear at a glance. As our system of government administration occupies such an important position in the catch-up modernization process, administrative reform targeted at speeding up and promoting an effective system of government administration also becomes a very pressing matter. As change is a constant subject of administration for all countries throughout the world, whether developed or developing, emphasizing and conscientiously conducting administrative-reform studies and practice has become a universal global phenomenon. In developed countries, as political and economic pluralism is more extensive, administrative reform generally focuses on cutting administrative spending and raising administrative efficiency to get more output (good policy) from less input (human and material resources). But in developing countries, in addition to cutting spending and raising efficiency, administrative reform is focused even more so on promoting economic development. Catch-up modernization means that backward countries have to complete in a shorter period of time the industrialization process that took developed countries a longer period of time to accomplish. Today's China is in this stage, which will continue into the next century. So at the turn of the century, with sharp international competition confronting China with a stiff challenge, how to meet this challenge successfully is a large matter that will determine China's fate. The most crucial things will be upgrading our economy and increasing our economic might. From the 1990s to the early 21st century, as long as the domestic and external climate does not undergo a significant critical change, and our domestic political and social stability is not undermined, there is hope that China's economy will maintain a state of sustained rapid growth. Until this stage is over, government dominance will be exceptionally intense. The basic mission of China's administrative reform will be to steadily reform and optimize our administrative system, by establishing a corps of officials who are of high quality, efficient, and good at dealing with contingencies flexibly, and while speeding up the establishment of a socialist market economy, will be capable of strengthening government guidance and speeding up economic growth. So our corresponding administrative reform strategies should be: To raise government efficiency, with the primary option being to strengthen government capability; To make sustained and rapid economic growth our strategic orientation; To take a rational disposition of public resources as our major means; To make system optimization and organizational creativity our key ways. During this age of sharp international competition, in the great international race toward the 21st century, the key to keeping China invincible will be economic development. To adapt to the needs of the times and our need for economic development, an effective and high-quality system of government administration will ensure and accelerate our economic and social development, which is the crux of administrative reform. Grasping this will mean getting a firm hold on China's administrative reform direction.
