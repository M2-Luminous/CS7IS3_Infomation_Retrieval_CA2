In a statement released yesterday, National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Director General Cielito Habito reported that President Ramos who also heads the NEDA Board has given the go signal for the implementation of six infrastructure development projects located in the countryside. The largest budgetary outlay of P6.1 billion was earmarked for the Arterial Road Links Development Project. Under the project, a total of 327.8 kilometers of arterial or secondary roads in different parts of the country will be cemented. Once completed, 96 percent of the country's arterial road network will have been paved, Mr. Habito said. Other projects in the approved package are: -- The P399.8 million Angat Afterbay Regulator Dam which involves the rehabilitation of the main diversion structure of the Angat-Maasim River Irrigation System that serves about 28,316 hectares of agricultural lands; -- The P578.1 million Optimum Water Utilization and Rural Development Project, which includes the construction of the Aganan River Irrigation System to improve farm productivity and promote efficient water and land resource utilization through the improvement of irrigation facilities, construction of post-harvest facilities, and procurement of necessary equipment; -- The P451.1 million Catubig Valley Rural Development Project, which will construct and provide agriculture and rural infrastructure as well as agricultural support services, flood protection and schistosomiasis control; -- The P688.6 million 18th RP [Republic of the Philippines]- Japan Increased Food Production Program, under which the Japanese Government will provide commodity assistance in the form of fertilizers, pesticides, machinery and equipment; and -- The P450 million U.S. Public Law 480 Title I for 1994 for the importation of soybean meal for sale to poultry and hog raisers and feedmillers in the country. The approval of the projects dovetails with the economic thrust of the Ramos administration for agri-based industrial development in the different regions and growth areas. At present, more than half of the industrial output of the country comes from Metro Manila and its neighboring provinces. It is the medium-term design of government to disperse the industrial activities to the countryside. Among the major growth areas being eyed by the Ramos Administration are the former U.S. military bases in Subic and San Fernando, the Northwestern Luzon growth quadrangle, the Cagayan de Oro-Iligan Corridor and the South Cotabato-Sarangani-General Santos area.
