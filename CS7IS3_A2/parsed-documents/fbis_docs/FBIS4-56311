Our future and that of the coming generations depend on these elections. Our campaign is based in reality, not false illusions. Our promises are based on experience, on our team's ability, and on what we know we can do. False promises with the selfish objective of winning votes are not part of my personality, nor those of vice presidential candidates Guillermo Quijano or Tomas Herrera. It is simply dishonest to make false promises. We live in a world of realities with real problems that demand solutions which our young associates can provide. Our reality is clear. Panama must overcome the present to guarantee the future. Panama cannot be prosperous so long as we have children going to school hungry. We cannot tolerate that. Our young people must have opportunities and effective educations so our country can develop. Our country needs young people who are strong both physically and spiritually. Those characteristics require an education that instills a guiding light in the souls of our youths. Panama is a country with potential, and we will turn that potential into realities to be enjoyed by all Panamanians. To achieve this, we need a capable government that will make the necessary decisions; a government that will make decisions honestly; a government that knows what it is doing; a government that will energetically make decisions and implement them efficiently. That is why the government that we will establish following the 8 May elections will be made up of men and women who have the know-how ability, honesty, and experience to make and implement those decisions. You are familiar with these people because they are not unknowns, nor have we kept them hidden. You see them around me all the time because they have attended all kinds of political events. It is a disgrace that in Panama, a country with the potential to be wealthy, a majority of the population is still poor, and too great a percentage of the population currently lives with so many scarcities. More than 90 years ago, Panama optimistically entered the community of free, sovereign nations. When it achieved that freedom and sovereignty, it hopefully announced that it had finally reached victory through unity. That is why we are now astonished to hear some people doubt that we are going to find the path that will lead us to the fatherland about which [Panamanian poet and writer] Ricardo Miro wrote. President Lincoln, the same person who spoke about government of the people, by the people, and for the people, also said that when the people are kept well informed, the nation is safe. That is why when the people exercise their right to elect government leaders, they also have every right to have access to all the information they need, without exception, to make an intelligent vote, in full knowledge of what they are doing and obeying only the dictates of their conscience and an analysis of the records of those whom they choose to support. Today, in the last phase of the activities promoted by ILDEA [Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies] in the electoral process, I must point out that these activities were unable to promote an analysis of the problems and the solutions proposed by the candidates. The analysis was made on the basis of questions that led to ambiguous answers which did not permit a differentiation between the truth and falsehoods. Panamanians have not had a real opportunity to evaluate the proposals, plans, and programs of the candidates through an in-depth analysis. The vice presidents on my ticket asked for debates with the other vice presidential candidates. Debates were not held at that level. Nevertheless, the people are wise despite all the limitations, and on 8 May they will elect their future leaders. It is their opportunity to find the lost path. The decision is up to the people and only the people. I know my fellow citizens will not make a mistake, because their hopes for a better future now depend on their decision, no one else's. We of the Change '94 alliance offer a real, innovative, and valuable change to once and for all achieve real victory for all Panamanians. For this purpose, fellow citizens, give us your vote. We are the best ticket, individually and collectively. Back us with your vote, which is what the country needs.
