People with weaker nerves may have even perceived this as an exchange of fire. The live ammunition was supplied by both sides, which have been exploiting the insufficient solution of this undeniably controversial problem for political manipulation in their own favor. This is the main reason why, in both Hungary and Slovakia, executive as well as legislative bodies deliberately do not bring the whole matter to the required end. Naturally, this then creates scope for artificial escalation of tension, the whipping up of emotions, and fishing in muddy waters, the result of which is the almost absolute absence of trust on both sides, but also between the state and the minorities living on its territory. As far as Budapest is concerned, the present Hungarian Democratic Forum-led government coalition can scarcely be expected to change its course less than four months before the elections. The overt support that it provides to the political representatives of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, while at the same time vehemently rejecting even the slightest hint that the positions of the two sides are being coordinated, testifies to the opposite. There would be nothing wrong with this if the positions of the two largest parties representing the Hungarian minority were clear and transparent. Their eternal shifts, the hardening and then again softening of their positions, depending evidently on the response they are getting from abroad, make it impossible for their negotiating partners to assume an unequivocal stand. It must be said, however, for the sake of objectivity, that this negotiating partner [the Slovak Government] has at present no intention of holding talks because this allows him to arouse in society fears of a potential external threat to the integrity of the state and to declare himself the sole guarantor that the state will be saved--not to mention the fact that this attitude allows him to use the argument, also vis-a-vis the world, that it is because of this threat that Slovakia cannot meet all the commitments it has adopted or the deadline for their fulfillment. Both sides use the minority issue as a hostage of their policies or politicking. They assume the posture of someone who has been wronged, a posture, however, that is meant only for a part of the gullible domestic audience. The world somehow does not swallow this bait. At the same time, it is evident that both Bratislava and Budapest are in for the same measure of criticism. Only we are trying to persuade ourselves that we are being wronged by everyone. If this actually happens, it is only because we are shooting ourselves in the foot. It can be assumed that the two sides will hold on to their present policies at least until May, or until the formation of a new Hungarian government. Although such tests of the other side's nerves are not uncommon in politics, they do have their risks, which are not exactly small. A small incident, even a staged one, may be enough to set off a widespread conflagration. Fortunately, nothing of the sort has happened yet. Ordinary people apparently have more common sense than their governments. I only hope that talks will not start only after the first electric transmission lines are blown up or after state symbols are attacked in some other way, as was the case, for example, in South Tyrol in the 1960's. The time factor, too, must be taken into consideration. Italy's nonobservance of the Paris Treaty demonstrated that delaying a solution may be a useless display of stubbornness. Ultimately, internal and external pressures led to dialogue and to the search for solutions acceptable to all interested parties, after all. At the same time, the case of South Tyrol cannot be considered a model that lends itself to automatic adoption. No such model exists. What one can do, however, is learn a lesson about what not to do and what to do and how. Using the good services offered by the South Tyroleans would do no harm, either, to prevent teasing from being followed by wake [pun based on the similarity between the words "prekaracky" (teasing) and "karacky" (wake held for a dead person)] and, on top of that, exchanges of fire or acts of terrorism.
