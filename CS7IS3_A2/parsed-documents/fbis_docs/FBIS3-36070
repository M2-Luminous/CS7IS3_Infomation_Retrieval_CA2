The Russian Army Is Preparing To Evacuate Missile Troop Officers"] [Text] The joint Russian-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement of 14 January on the terms for the abolition of the "Ukrainian" nuclear weapons, signed in Moscow by the three presidents, has apparently not proved more long-lasting than previous such accords. A week after the ink had dried on the Moscow declaration, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry began, without any coordination with Moscow, an operation of actually seizing the strategic nuclear weapons. On 21 January Army General Lieutenant Vladimir Mikhtyuk, commander of the 43d Missile Army, and also the commanders of the 46th (Pervomayskaya) and 19th (Khmelnitskaya) missile divisions were summoned to Kiev to a session of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry Collegium "on matters of military discipline and training." The army commander reported this to Moscow, to the Main Command of the Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF), because under an order that has been in effect for 33 years, the SRF army or division commander may not leave his unit without permission from the SRF commander in chief. In Kiev, however, the generals were suddenly ordered to swear the Ukrainian oath of allegiance. Gen. Mikhtyuk and Nikolay Filatov, commander of the 46th Division, under what one of the participants in the conference described as tough pressure, swore the Ukrainian oath. Rustam Karimov, commander of the 19th division, refused. After that, the 43d Missile Army was actually placed outside the SRF Main Command's operational control. General Karimov has been removed from the post of division commander and is to fly to Moscow within the next few days. Today or tomorrow a new, "Ukrainian" commander will arrive at the 19th Missile Division who will be appointed by the Ukrainian defense minister without any coordination with Moscow. The SRF Command stated that they do not even know the new commander's name. Prior to that, during the last two years, all cadre reshuffles in the missile troops in Ukraine were made only by a joint order after they were coordinated in Moscow and Kiev. On 22 January the Ukrainian defense minister signed Order 001 (classified as top secret) whereby the troops of the 43d Army must be prepared as of 1 February to begin removing the nuclear ammunition from the depots of the 19th and 46th divisions (all in all, 490 units) to "S" installations, from where Russian specialists were withdrawn last year and where the Ukrainian Defense Ministry has deployed its own nuclear units, manned partly by officers of the 12th Main Directorate of the Russian Defense Ministry who stayed in Ukraine and partly by reserve officers. Colonel General Igor Smirnov, SRF commander in chief, sent a coded telegram to the Ukrainian defense minister expressing in a polite form his professional concern over the situation, but has not received any answer yet. The SRF Main Command is currently making preparations for an urgent evacuation to Russia of all missile officers who refuse to swear the Ukrainian oath. According to SRF Main Command estimates, between 40 and 50 percent of the officers will leave. The divisions will become combat-incapable, the combat duty system will be disrupted, and political confrontation in missile unit crews between "pro-Ukrainian" and "pro-Russian" officers is possible. Up until now Russia has been rendering the 43d Army technical assistance in maintaining its entire extremely complex strategic missile systems while officers have been undergoing regular retraining within the SRF framework. Now supplies and technical assistance for the army have been stopped. The Russian military is no longer in control of the situation. It believes that it has done everything possible within its jurisdiction and that now the problem of the Ukrainian nuclear weapons will again have to be decided by politicians in Moscow, Kiev, and Washington.
