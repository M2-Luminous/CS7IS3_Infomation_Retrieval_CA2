FR940606-0-00037 FR940606-0-00016 50 CFR Part 625 [Docket No. 940262&hyph;4963; I.D. 052494C] Summer Flounder Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notification of commercial quota transfer. SUMMARY: NMFS announces that the States of Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, and the Commonwealth of Virginia are transferring various amounts of commercial summer flounder quota to the State of Delaware. The public is advised that the quota adjustments have been made, and is informed of the revised commercial quota for each state involved. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Hannah Goodale, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9101. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations implementing Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery are found at 50 CFR part 625. The regulations require annual specification of a commercial quota that is apportioned among the coastal states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the annual commercial quota and the percent allocated to each state are described in §625.20. The commercial quota for summer flounder for the 1994 calendar year set equal to 16,005,560 lb (7.3 million kg) and the allocations to each state were published March 7, 1994 (59 FR 10586). NMFS issued a notification that the commercial quota available to the State of Delaware for 1994 had been harvested, effective March 30, 1994 (59 FR 15863, April 5, 1994). The 1994 quotas for several states were adjusted for overages occurring in 1993, as required under §625.20(d)(2), on May 25, 1994. The quotas after adjustments for overages in 1993 for the states affected by this action were: Delaware, ^1,359 lb (^616 kg); Maryland, 324,117 lb (147,018 kg); North Carolina, 4,369,775 lb (1,982,117 kg); and Virginia, 3,242,354 lb (1,470,722 kg). Since Connecticut's quota was not exceeded in 1993, its 1994 quota of 361,258 lb (163,866 kg) did not need adjustment for overages prior to this action. The final rule implementing Amendment 5 to the FMP was published December 17, 1993 (58 FR 65936), and allows two or more states, under mutual agreement and with the concurrence of the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), to transfer or combine summer flounder commercial quota. The Regional Director is required to consider the criteria set forth in §625.20(f)(1) in the evaluation of requests for quota transfers or combinations. Section 625.20(3) further states that a state may not submit a request to transfer or combine quota if a request to which it is party is pending before the Regional Director. While Delaware is the recipient of the four transfers, each request to transfer quota was presented separately by each state, and therefore considered individually by the Regional Director. Publication as one notification is efficient and convenient for reference. Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia have agreed to transfer 96 lb (44 kg), 1,000 lb (454 kg), 2,782 lb (1,262 kg), and 2,162 lb (981 kg), respectively, of their commercial quotas to Delaware. The Regional Director has determined that the criteria set forth in §625.20(f) have been met, and publishes this notification of quota transfers. The revised quotas for the calendar year 1994 are: Connecticut, 361,162 lb (163,822 kg); Delaware, 4,681 lb (2,123 kg); Maryland, 323,117 lb (146,565 kg); North Carolina, 4,366,993 lb (1,980,855 kg) and Virginia, 3,240,192 lb (1,469,742 kg). Because current landings estimates indicate that the Delaware inshore fishery has harvested the quota made available through these transfers, no quota is currently available for landings in that State. Federally permitted vessels may not land summer flounder in the State of Delaware. This action does not alter any of the conclusions reached in the Environmental Impact Statement prepared for Amendment 2 to the FMP regarding the effects of summer flounder fishing activity on the human environment. Amendment 2 established procedures for setting an annual coastwide commercial quota for summer flounder and a formula for determining commercial quotas for each state. The quota transfer provision was established by Amendment 5 to the FMP and the environmental assessment prepared for Amendment 5 found that the action had no significant impact on the environment. Under §6.02b.3(b)(i)(aa) of NOAA Administrative Order 216&hyph;6, this action is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare additional environmental analyses. This is a routine administrative action that reallocates commercial quotas within the scope of previously published environmental analyses. Classification This action is required by 50 CFR part 625 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: May 31, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;13657 Filed 6&hyph;1&hyph;94; 2:24 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
