FR940607-0-00087 FR940607-0-00018 Comment: One commenter objected to the single family property disposition homeless initiative program in general, arguing that it is incompatible with local municipal housing patterns, and that leasing PD properties to homeless providers causes declining property values. HUD's response: There is no evidence that leasing PD properties to homeless providers has caused values to decline. However, in most housing markets, HUD properties will now be offered first to the general public before being made available for lease to homeless providers. This should enhance homeownership opportunities, as well as provide greater stability in residential neighborhoods. Comment: Three commenters supported the proposal that HUD limit the number of properties held off market for any applicant at any one time based upon the applicant's financial capacity and past performance. HUD's response: HUD believes that the number of properties held off the market for an applicant should relate to that applicant's prior housing experience and demonstrated capacity to administer the program. Field offices currently have the discretion to determine the appropriate number of properties for any applicant. Comment: Two commenters recommended that HUD grant the field offices more discretion in the program's administration. HUD's response: On November 2, 1993 (58 FR 58560), the FHA Commissioner redelegated to field offices the authority to waive handbooks, notices, directives and other issuances for Housing programs unless a regulatory or statutory provision is involved. As a result of this redelegation of authority, field offices now have more flexibility in program administration of the single family property disposition homeless initiative program. Comment: Two commenters recommended that HUD change the way it administers the ten percent cap on leasing property to homeless providers. These commenters believe that leased properties are counted toward the annual ten percent cap each time their annual lease is renewed. HUD's response: Properties leased to homeless providers are counted only once against the ten percent of annual inventory cap. Renewal of a lease does not mean that an individual property is counted twice in one year towards the limitation on the number of properties which may be leased for this purpose. Moreover, in the past, the Department as a whole has never leased ten percent of the nationwide inventory to homeless providers, so that individual field offices exceeding their own ten percent threshold may request reallocation of authority to lease from other areas. V. Other Matters A. Executive Order 12866 This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review. Any changes made in this rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file, which is available for public inspection in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC. B. Environmental Impact A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for the proposed rule published on August 11, 1993. The Department has determined that the Finding is not affected by the changes in this final rule. The Finding is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC. C. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel has also determined, as the Designated Official for HUD under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism , that the policies contained in this rule do not have federalism implications and, thus, are not subject to review under that Order. D. Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the designated official under Executive Order 12606, The Family , has determined that the Single Family Property Disposition Homeless Initiative, generally, has a positive and beneficial impact on the formation, maintenance, and general well-being of homeless families, and the amendments made by this rule will not significantly change the overall impact of the rule on families. Therefore, the rule is not subject to review under that Order. E. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Specifically, the rule modifies the procedures under which HUD makes properties available for lease to governmental entities and private nonprofit organizations for use by homeless persons. F. Paperwork The amendments made to 24 CFR part 291 by this final rule will not add any additional information collection burden to that already approved by the Office of Management and Burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act and assigned OMB approval numbers 2502&hyph;0412 and 2502&hyph;0306. G. Regulatory Agenda This rule was listed as Sequence No. 1606 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published at 59 FR 20424, 20452 on April 25, 1994, under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
