Bastos: Let us begin with something more basic. Let us discuss the prospects for nuclear energy. When organizing the field, the state reserved for itself the role of supervising private activities and determining policies. For most countries where this activity is being developed with the private sector, nuclear energy is considered one of the future options to satisfy energy demand. In Argentina we developed our own nuclear industry, with our own technicians, heavy water fuel, and companies. It would be a grave mistake to waste all this wealth. The Energy Secretariat, as the agency responsible for determining policies, is deeply interested in seeing nuclear energy as one of the future energy options in Argentina. CLARIN: There is a study conducted by the Mediterranean Foundation headed by Juan Novara saying that the CNEA is not competitive and that nuclear energy is expensive, dirty, and is being abandoned throughout the world. Is this not contrary to what you just said? Bastos: Fortunately, we have had differences of opinion at the Mediterranean Foundation and each one can freely voice one's opinion. Yes, it is a little bit contradictory. I do not fully share Novara's views. CLARIN: But the International Atomic Energy Agency contends that 100 nuclear power plants are under construction at present. Bastos: I am not an expert in that field, but to talk about 100 nuclear power plants is a bit too much. I do not believe that such a number of power plants is under construction ... CLARIN: The report specifically states that there are 72 power stations under construction and another 54, the construction of which already has been approved ... Bastos: I could not give you precise data. What I do know, however, is that all industrial countries are trying to devise ways to lower the cost of future nuclear projects by trying to build a series of nuclear power plants having a standard design and improving security. In this regard, I disagree with Novara's assertion that atomic energy is expensive. Well, it is indeed expensive now because a barrel of oil costs $14. If the price rises to $20, things would change completely. CLARIN: And how will nuclear activities move ahead? Bastos: That is the key issue. The industry's organization is based on the participation of the private sector in risk ventures. It does not pertain to the state engaging in risk undertakings. The state is interested in developing nuclear activities but without participating as an entrepreneur. The CNEA cannot continue functioning as it is now; it must be restructured. At present it combines control with business activities and receives money from the Treasury for investments. It has been decided that the CNEA will be restructured so as to separate regulatory from business activities. This will have been concluded by December. CLARIN: Will they be privatized then? Bastos: That is totally reasonable. With our way of [answer incomplete as published] CLARIN: Incorporating private capital or selling the shares of the private stock company? Bastos: In the privatization of companies in the field, like Segba [Greater Buenos Aires Electrical Services] for example, we made what is known as a strategic sale of shares. We sold a percentage of the shares and the companies' control was transferred to the buyers of those shares. We took that line of action because it was impossible to reorganize those public companies within the framework of the state. Is the CNEA now in a similar situation to that of Segba? The answer is no because nuclear power plants are in an excellent situation. They have plenty of financial resources at their disposal, which shows that there are top-quality operation and maintenance groups. So what do we stand to gain by transferring the management of these nuclear power plants? Very little. Our first attempt to transfer the CNEA to the private sector will be made along the same lines as YPF [Government Oil Deposits]. CLARIN: How much do you estimate CNEA Inc. would be worth? Bastos: The CNEA has a positive flow of funds amounting to slightly over $200 million annually. CLARIN: Once Atucha-II is operational its value will increase considerably. Bastos: That is precisely the point. It is very difficult to make an estimate because it depends on the investments that will be made to complete Atucha-II. Nevertheless, let us suppose that of the $200 million, the net cash flow totals $90 million. With a rate of return for seven years, it would add up to $600 million, which in turn is what we estimated is missing to complete Atucha-II. CLARIN: That is a very low estimate. The CNEA contributed $8.5 billion compared with the $600 million that could be obtained from the selling of all the shares. Bastos: We go back to the starting point, when we said atomic energy is expensive. I said it was because a barrel of crude today costs $14 and these estimates are based on this oil price. If the prices climbs to $20 or $30, things will change. Even so I would not venture to say that it is a total loss. CLARIN: But $600 million compared with $8.5 billion ... Bastos: Yes, it is true. We are not taking into account how much the Atucha-I and Embalse Rio Tercero power plants produced, whether a very low price was paid, and whether the benefits were transferred to consumers. State Water and Power Enterprise and Segba had debts to the CNEA that were not totally repaid ... CLARIN: The CNEA argues that they owe it $500 million ... Bastos: In all likelihood the federal government was the one that remained as a debtor, but at the same time the CNEA also granted some type of credit to the government [as published]. Therefore, the best thing to do is start everything fresh. CLARIN: I insist, do you not think that $600 million is a very low price for two nuclear power plants that are already operational, Atucha-II -- 70 percent of which is already completed, and other industrial plants? Bastos: I do not think so. It depends on many things. We will never have a 100 percent return on investment for Atucha-II because it is a capital-intensive sector. When there are construction delays, the costs are terrible and one has to forego obtaining a 100 percent return on investment. Is the CNEA to blame for the cost of Atucha-II? It is not entirely to blame for it. The power plant's construction involves the handling of 40 or more contracts. During the times of hyperinflation, most of them were paralyzed. CLARIN: Do you approve of Manuel Mondino as a likely executive manager of CNEA Inc.? Bastos: I am going to give you the opinion of a teammate. From the technical standpoint, I think that all the CNEA staff is excellent. The only criticism I might have is that they need more knowledge about business administration, but they can be quickly trained in this field.
