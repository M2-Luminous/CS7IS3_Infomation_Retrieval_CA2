Voropayev video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] [Text] Although agreement on the demarcation of the eastern sector of the Russian-Chinese border was reached three years ago, the fate of the border islands near Khabarovsk still remains unclear. The Chinese side is claiming the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarovskiy Islands, and if their reasoning on defining the line of the border is accepted the international boundary will be practically in the center of Khabarovsk. The issue of demarcation of this sector has been temporarily set aside and this uncertainty must worry those who live here. [Video shows unidentified correspondent interviewing Colonel General A.I. Nikolayev, commander in chief of the Russian Border Troops] [Begin Nikolayev recording] Today's visit to Khabarovsk, to the Far East Border District, is a fundamental part of the measures Russia is taking to protect its interests in the Far East. There are quite a number of issues directly connected with Khabarovsk Kray, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, and the Amur Oblast arising from problems which the border troops must solve. The border with China is changing and conditions on the state border must be such as to conform with the relations between our two states. All this is being done in the context of the discussion process currently in progress between the Russian Federation and the PRC. It is very important for me to find out how the approach developed by the Foreign Ministry and the Federal Border Service will be perceived in connection with the forthcoming signing of the Russian-Chinese border agreement. [end recording] However, the inhabitants of the border territories are ignorant of this approach at present. According to newspaper reports, diplomatic representatives of both countries meeting in Beijing have not made any progress in resolving the problem of the islands. The only reassuring thing is that Russia is rejecting the PRC's territorial claims. Meanwhile, the Japanese magazine Sentaku, issue No. 12 of last year, reported that the question has been resolved and mutual agreement reached on handing over the disputed islands near Khabarovsk to the PRC. True, the Japanese magazine does not quote the source of the information. At the same time, Chinese maps of Heilongjiang Province for some time now have shown the islands near Khabarovsk, which the neighboring country is claiming, in the same colors as the Chinese territory. Understandably, all this is simply political fantasy. However, the inhabitants of Khabarovsk must be worried by the mass of reservations and vague wording of the sparse and contradictory information about the islands.
