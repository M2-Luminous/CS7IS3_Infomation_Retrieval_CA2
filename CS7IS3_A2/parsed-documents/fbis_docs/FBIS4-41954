He stated this at the press conference held at the Foreign Ministry press center at the Zubovskaya square. He especially mentioned the initialling of the agreement on the western section of the Chinese-Russian border. According to the Chinese foreign minister, in the past few years bilateral relations and especially business links have developed considerably, "they far exceeded former Chinese-Soviet ties." Answering an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question on China's policy towards the Central Asian countries, former USSR republics, Qian Qichen said that since these countries achieved their independence their contacts with China, previously of indirect nature, have now become direct. Especially good relations are being established in the sphere of trade. "We would like to continue to strengthen our relations with these countries, at the same time hoping that their ties within the CIS framework and with the Russian Federation will also continue to develop," said the Chinese minister. Speaking of Russia's accession to the Partnership for Peace treaty, Qian Qichen noted that the Russian Federation, which is a major European state, maintains extensive links with its neighbors in Europe, especially after the ending of confrontation between the two military blocs. "We regard with understanding the fact that Russia maintains relations of partnership with the countries of Europe. We hope that such relations will promote the strengthening of peace and stability in the region and also throughout the world. We believe that these relations will not in any way harm the development of links between Russia and China." Qian Qichen said that he had not discussed questions of selling Russian weapons to China today. This subject, he said, will not be raised during Jiang Zemin's forthcoming visit to Moscow, either. Speaking about the situation around the Spratly (Nanwei) islands, which are claimed by several southeast Asian countries as well as by China, Qian Qichen expressed the opinion that at the present stage discussions should be halted an a start should be made to the joint exploitation of this region. Speaking of nuclear problems, the minister stressed that China is a party to the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and is strictly guided by its provisions. The PRC, he stressed, is in favor of advancing the talks on concluding a convention on the total banning of nuclear weapons and intends to promote the signing of this treaty before 1996. As far as nuclear tests are concerned, China is in favor of the total elimination and complete banning of nuclear weapons tests.
