In Karabakh leader's opinion, one of the obstacles hindering the settlement of the conflict is the existence of two parallel initiatives - CSCE's and Russia's - which gives the sides an opportunity to maneuver. Kocharyan also noted that before December 1993 there had been contacts with Azerbaijan on the highest level. However, after the beginning of the latest Azerbaijani offensive, the official Baku broke up those contacts. During that two-month large-scale offensive the mediators, in Kocharyan's words, made no efforts to influence the attacking side. Instead, they patiently waited for the results of military actions. Touching upon Turkey's and England's position, the Karabakh leader noted, "The attitude of those countries towards Karabakh was obvious since the very first days of the conflict. As to the oil agreements with Azerbaijan, they will only prolong confrontation". When asked what kind of future he sees for Karabakh, Kocharyan answered, "Autonomy with the widest range of rights within a united Armenian state".
