Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The PSE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange is proposing to amend its Rule 6.24 in several respects. First, the Exchange is proposing to add a new Commentary .04 to Rule 6.24 in order to incorporate a new exercise cut-off procedure for expiring equity options. Second, the Exchange is proposing to add new commentary .05 to Rule 6.24 to address the responsibility for the submission of final exercise decisions to the Exchange and to provide that member firms may establish internal processing cut-off times prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time (as defined herein). 6 Third, the Exchange is proposing to add a new Commentary .06 to Rule 6.24 in order to address situations in which a member submits or prepares an exercise instruction after the 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (``E.S.T.'') exercise cut-off time (``Exercise Cut-Off Time'') in an expiring equity option on the basis of material information that is released after the Exercise Cut-Off Time. 7 Finally, the Exchange proposes to modify subsection (b) of Rule 6.24 to clarify that the provisions of Rule 6.24 only apply to non-cash settled equity option contracts. 6 See Amendment No. 2, supra note 3. 7 Id. More specifically, proposed Commentary .04 would provide that clearing members must follow the procedures of The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') when exercising expiring non-cash settled equity option contracts. It also provides that members must follow certain procedures with respect to the exercising of non-cash settled equity option contracts which would otherwise not be exercised, or the non-exercising of option contracts which otherwise would be exercised, by operation of OCC Rule 805. 8 8 OCC Rule 805 provides for automatic exercise of in-the-money options at expiration without the submission of an exercise notice to the OCC if the price of the security underlying the option is at or above a certain price (for calls) or at or below a certain price (for puts); and the non-exercise of an option at expiration if the price of the security underlying the option does not satisfy such price levels. See OCC Rule 805.
