U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry on Thursday said that the U.S. Government did not single out anyone as responsible for the setback in the Bosnian peace talks. Washington has, on all earlier occasions, laid the blame for the Bosnian civil war on the Serbs, increasingly often referring to them as the aggressors. It is probably premature to interpret McCurry's statement as an about-face in Washington's policy towards the Bosnian conflict and it the way it can be resolved. However, Washington has come up with new signals and a change of tone. This can also be concluded from Wednesday's statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton, who said that the United States would not unilaterally exempt the Bosnian Moslems from the U.N. arms sales embargo, imposed in 1991 on all of the former Yugoslavia. This came as a cold shower for Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic, who, in an interview to the WASHINGTON POST, has said that the Moslems would beat the Serbs, if not by knocking them out, then by scoring points. This the more so since Izetbegovic made the statement on the eve of the opening of the Talloires peace talks on Bosnia. McCurry's statement also implied the State Department's turn about, as he resolutely dismissed speculations that the U.S. would support the Moslem-Croat federation's demand to be given 58 per cent of Bosnian territory. McCurry argued that Izetbegovic was familiar with the U.S. position on the territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina based on the European Union [EU] plan, which envisages 49 per cent of the territory for the Bosnian Serbs and 51 for the Moslem-Croat federation. Washington has thus stressed its commitment to the E.U. peace plan in seeking a political solution to the Bosnian crisis. What is the most important is that the U.S. has turned towards Europe's realistic orientation, which should imply that a peaceful settlement will be sought in negotiations rather in NATO military actions. Washington's volte face could also imply that the belligerence of the Bosnian Moslems might subside. However, it is a different matter altogether if Washington's new frame of mind would be enough for peace to prevail.
