FR941025-2-00029 FR941025-2-00023 Arbitration Panel Decision Under the Randolph-Sheppard Act AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Notice of Arbitration Panel Decision Under the Randolph-Sheppard Act. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that on April 13, 1992, an arbitration panel rendered a decision in the matter of Malcolm Graham v. Texas Commission for the Blind (Docket No. R&hyph;S/90&hyph;2). This panel was convened by the U.S. Department of Education pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 107d&hyph;1(a) upon receipt of the original complaint filed by petitioner Malcolm Graham on January 8, 1990. The Randolph-Sheppard Act (the Act) creates a priority for blind individuals to operate vending facilities on Federal property and also governs the operation of blind-operated vending facilities on State or other property. Under section 107d&hyph;1(a), a blind licensee dissatisfied with the State's operation or administration of the vending facility program authorized under the Act may request a full evidentiary hearing from the State licensing agency (SLA). If the licensee is dissatisfied with the State agency's decision, the licensee may complain to the Secretary, who is then required to convene an arbitration panel to resolve the dispute. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: A copy of the full text of the arbitration panel decision may be obtained from George F. Arsnow, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Avenue, S.W., Room 3230 Switzer Building, Washington, DC. 20202&hyph;2738. Telephone: (202) 205&hyph;9317. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the TDD number at (202) 205&hyph;8298. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act (20 U.S.C. 107d&hyph;2(c)), the Secretary publishes a synopsis of arbitration panel decisions affecting the administration of vending facilities on Federal property. Background The complainant, Malcolm Graham, is a blind vendor licensed by the Texas Commission for the Blind, the SLA under the provisions of the Act. He entered the Texas Business Enterprise Program (BEP) in April 1985 and received academic and on-the-job training in all phases of management of a vending facility. Subsequently, Mr. Graham operated a vending facility at the La Costa Office Park and then in 1986 moved to the Texas Supreme Court Building. During the early part of 1989, Mr. Graham became delinquent in payment of his quarterly sales taxes and did not respond to payment requests from the Texas Comptroller's office. On June 15, 1989, Mr. Graham, recuperating from an accident, went to his vending facility and encountered two agents from the Comptroller's office attempting to seize complainant's cash register because of non-payment of sales taxes. The complainant allegedly verbally and physically assaulted one of the agents from the Comptroller's office, who summoned police.
