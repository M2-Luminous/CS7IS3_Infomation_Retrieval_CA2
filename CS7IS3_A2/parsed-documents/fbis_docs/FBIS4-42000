The letter stated that, in accordance with the constitutions of Russia and Tatarstan, the republic should be called precisely Tatarstan, and not Tataria. In the republic Supreme Council chairman's opinion, Tataria is associated with the traditions of the past decades of Soviet Tataria, when official ideology and toponymy took no account of the national peculiarities of the peoples living on Russia's territory. Boris Mironov's letter in reply to this states: This question has no bearing on the problems of sovereignization or respect for national dignity. In this instance it is a question only of the conformity with linguistic laws of old names which are an organic part of the Russian language and to which the population is accustomed. The reply goes on to state that official materials published in the press must use the names adopted at state level by each republic or state taken separately -- which also applies in full to the Republic of Tatarstan. The Russian Committee for the Press intends, for its part, to promote precisely this approach in press practice.
