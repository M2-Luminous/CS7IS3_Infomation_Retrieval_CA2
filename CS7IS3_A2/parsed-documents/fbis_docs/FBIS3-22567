Between November and December, the number of cases in Rio de Janeiro rose 9.3 percent, increasing from 218 to 238 newly reported. As a result, in December Rio surpassed Sao Paulo, which had 179 cases reported. The coordinator of the Health Ministry's AIDS Program, Lair Guerra, announced yesterday that, at the end of this month, during a World Health Organization (WHO) meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, Brazil will make arrangements to conduct tests of a prototype vaccine against AIDS among Brazilian volunteers. According to Lair Guerra, the vaccine will be tested as early as this year in Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. In Rio, there has been an increase in the number of cases reported, in comparison with the rest of the country. Lair Guerra explained: "The product of the American laboratory, United Biomedical Incorporation (UBI), was selected, because it produces antibodies against the AIDS virus, and shows a low toxicity index." She added that there is no effective vaccine in the world against the disease yet. Also to be discussed at the Geneva meeting is the method for recruiting the 24 Brazilian volunteers: persons not infected with the virus, whose names will be kept confidential. UBI will allocate $100 million for the tests, which will be carried out by the School of Medicine of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, and the Osvaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Rio. Lair Guerra reported that one of the advantages of the vaccine, which has already been tested in the United States, and is in the implementation phase in Thailand, China, and Australia, is that it includes the types of virus currently circulating in Brazil. On 28 March, UBI representatives will be in Brasilia to discuss the budgeting and implementation of the program. Brazil was one of the countries selected for the test because it is the fourth-ranking nation in numbers of AIDS cases. According to the Health Ministry, 45,859 cases of the disease were reported between 1980 and 1993. The Southeast region recorded 66.2 percent of the total AIDS cases in December; Rio de Janeiro had a sharp increase from 20.1 to 29.4 percent of the total; and Sao Paulo showed a decline from 48.5 to 22.1 percent.
