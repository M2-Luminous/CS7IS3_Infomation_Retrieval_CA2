FBIS4-30004 "dreas121__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-121-A Daily Report 23 June 1994 ANNEX Japan SDPJ, Shinseito on Political Realignment SDPJ, Shinseito on Political Realignment OW2306021394 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2306021394 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo ASAHI Newstar Television Network in Japanese at 1111 GMT on 19 June, in its regular "Sunday Project" program, carries a 45-minute discussion on the recent domestic political situation by Wataru Kubo, Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] secretary-general, and Kozo Watanabe, acting Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general, moderated by commentator Soichiro Tahara at the Asahi studio in Tokyo. The discussion begins with Kubo explaining why his party decided to summon former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to testify before the Diet regarding his money deals with the Sagawa Kyunbin Company. Tahara then asks Kubo about the present political situation and the SDPJ's stand on political realignment. Kubo says: "The Hata cabinet must resign en masse to clean up the root cause for the SDPJ leaving the coalition. If that condition is accepted, we will discuss ways to form a new administration." When asked if there could be any other way to form a new administration other than the cabinet's resignation, Kubo says the SDPJ will not rule out the possibility of holding negotiations with the ruling parties to seek alternatives. Tahara asks if the SDPJ will ask Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa to assume responsibility for causing the SDPJ's withdrawal. Kubo says his party will not do that. At 1124 GMT, Tahara asks Kubo about the possibility of his party submitting a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet. Kubo replies the SDPJ will not submit such a motion now, while in the process of conducting negotiations with the ruling parties on forming a new cabinet. Asked if there is a possibility of the SDPJ submitting a no-confidence motion in cooperation with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in the future, Kubo says: "It depends on future negotiations [with the ruling parties] on a new administration." When Tahara asks whether the SDPJ is willing to form even a new coalition with the LDP, Kubo says: "Yes." But he adds since the SDPJ cannot ally with the LDP in its present form, it wants to find a solution in the negotiations with the ruling parties. At 1131 GMT, Shinseito's Watanabe arrives at the studio and joins the discussion. Watanabe also emphasizes the importance of the negotiations between the SDPJ and the coalition parties. Asked to give his opinion on the SDPJ's demand for the cabinet's resignation, Watanabe says it might resign if it can assure the establishment of a stable and efficient administration. While noting the resignation is a decision only Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata can make, Watanabe says Hata will make a choice that can help improve Japanese politics. Discussing the SDPJ's position on a no-confidence motion in the cabinet, Tahara notes the SDPJ wants the cabinet to voluntarily resign before such a motion is adopted. Kubo confirms his comment by saying: "That is right." At 1137 GMT, Tahara asks Watanabe to explain the key points in negotiations with the SDPJ. Watanabe notes that the two sides need to agree on major policy issues and on the formation of a consultative panel. He adds it is possible for his party to advise Prime Minister Hata to have the cabinet resign if it feels sure it can contribute to establishing "new improved Japanese politics." When Watanabe says a no-confidence motion should not be submitted without considering current political difficulties, Kubo reiterates it is unthinkable for the SDPJ to submit the motion while the negotiations are underway. While admitting the ruling parties' responsibility for causing the SDPJ's withdrawal, Watanabe says: "We will take Mr. Kubo's call into consideration with as much modesty as possible to work out conditions for forming the next coalition administration." He adds this includes the Kata cabinet's resignation. At 1145 GMT, Kubo leaves the studio and Tahara continues the discussion with Watanabe. Tahara points out differences in opinions within Shinseito over the future political realignment, citing Ozawa's plan to ally with the Watanabe and Yasuo Nakasone by forming a "conservatives' alliance with conservatives." Watanabe denies this: "I do not think Mr. Ozawa has such idea." He adds Ozawa is only trying to ally with LDP members who are determined to achieve political reform. Watanabe emphatically says the coalition administration's existing framework should be respected. Tahara notes the cabinet's resignation is the only way to have the SDPJ return to the coalition. Watanabe says he will advise Ozawa and Hata that the resignation should be possible if it will assure unity within a coalition government.
