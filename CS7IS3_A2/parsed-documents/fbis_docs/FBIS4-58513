This fact increases the importance of the agreement and raises the stakes on it. When the implementation of this agreement starts today, the Middle East crisis is expected to enter a new and important turning point, which will in the end lead to the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace and the Palestinian people's regaining their legitimate national rights, including their right to full independence and the building of their state on the soil of their homeland, Palestine. The achievement of that aspired-for goal hinges on two basic conditions. First, Israel must remain committed to it pledges. It must also remain sincere in its peace intentions, especially when moving to the next phase in the self-rule plan. Second, the Palestinian national authority must know how to use this opportunity to prove that the Palestinians are worthy of their right to freedom and independence. At any rate, and regardless of the importance of the step that is expected to start today -- and it is an important step indeed -- the desired peace in this part of the world will remain incomplete and under threat unless it is completed on the other fronts of the conflict and unless a parallel progress is made on all the Arab-Israeli tracks, that is, until the achievement of the objectives on the basis of which the Madrid agreement was convened 30 months ago. We hope the agreement to implement self rule is the start of a new phase in the march of the Palestinian people toward the achievement of their legitimate goals and a step that will be followed by other steps on the path of achieving an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories . We also urge the peace process cosponsors to take advantage of the momentum generated by this agreement to work on achieving parallel progress on all tracks of negotiations and a just and comprehensive peace that can be accepted and protected by future generations.
