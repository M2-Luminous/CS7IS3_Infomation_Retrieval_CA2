Azemi; place and date not given] [Text] [Azemi] The old structure of the assembly of Kosova is in exile. In the meantime, there have been multiparty elections for the assembly and president of the republic of Kosova. The new assembly has not been formed yet. How do you explain this situation? [Ramajli] As you said, multiparty elections in the republic of Kosova were held on 24 May 1992. In those elections, in which there was a massive turnout of citizens of the republic of Kosova, the president of the republic of Kosova and the deputies of the new multiparty parliament were voted for and elected. On the basis of constitutional provisions, the president of the republic of Kosova took office, in a legitimate manner, five days after the elections, while the formation of the new parliament was supposed to take place on 24 June of the same year. For well-known reasons, the formation of the parliament did not take place on that date and it has not taken place yet. During this time many preparations have been made for the formation of the new parliament but conditions and circumstances have not been created for doing this or for radically changing the situation in Kosova, that is, so that it will not lead to open conflict in Kosova. On the basis of information available to me, many of our friends from abroad have suggested that the holding of the constitutive assembly for the parliament should be postponed so that the situation in Kosova can be kept under control and so that conditions can be created for starting the discussions. In my opinion, it is not good that we have not formed a new parliament. However, we should have no doubt that we have assured the continuity of action of the organs of power in the republic of Kosova through the institution of the president of the republic, who is legitimately carrying out his function on the basis of constitutional provisions, through the activity of the government and other organs of authority in Kosova which are operating in many fields, wherever present conditions and circumstances permit. From the formal constitutional and legal viewpoint, this structure of the assembly, which I head, covers the time up to the formation of the new assembly. However, the new composition of deputies of the parliament of Kosova has exclusive legitimacy to meet on and to decide any issue which is in the sphere of the assembly's activity. I understand the concern of many people that the failure to form a parliament might cause us some damage! I believe that the many comments that various individuals have made in regard to this matter are well-intentioned; however, during their political appearances, each person must be careful about what they say, since any doubts about the legitimacy and legality of the multiparty elections in Kosova, even if these criticisms are unintentional, could pave the way for manipulations which our adversary could use to attack the legitimacy of the representatives whom the people of Kosova elected, with the aim of diminishing their position in any future discussions on the resolution of the issue of Kosova and its status. [Azemi] It is almost four years since the proclamation of the Constitution of Kacanik. This high-level legal act had a profound influence on the political processes in Kosova since, on the basis of this, a parallel system of education, health, and social insurance was set up. It is possible that this system will be extended ever further and that we will develop other forms of institutional activity. [Ramajli] After the proclamation of the republic of Kosova and the promulgation of the Constitution of Kacanik on September 1990, the state organs of the republic of Kosova were restructured and their activity was adapted to constitutional provisions. The organization of these organs, from the government of the republic down to the communal organs, was adapted to the conditions and circumstances which exist in Kosova. The field of education has been better organized, with broader dimensions. In addition to carrying out its basic function, education has been one of the most prominent forms of resistance to the Serbian occupational authorities, and it is also highly regarded by the outside world. In addition, the fields of health, finance, culture, sports, social, assistance, and other areas have been organized to a certain extent. I think that the results achieved in these areas are not satisfactory and that we have not done all that we could in all spheres of life in Kosova, in light of the fact that the citizens of Kosova and the organs of the republic of Kosova live and operate in conditions of total occupation and in the presence of the application of unprecedented police and military violence by the Serbian authorities. I think that this work should be continued in those areas which we have not organized well so far. We must take action in the judiciary so that a judicial system, as conditions and circumstances allow, will be put in place. In my opinion, a vital, priority issues is the preservation and expansion of institutional activity in Kosova so that we can show that we are able to organize life in Kosova, despite the situation of occupation which we have there. On the other hand, I am deeply convinced that will win more respect from the outside world if we develop forms of institutional activity. [Azemi] Sensitivities are being raised in regard to the internationalization of the issue of Kosova. This matter has also been discussed in some important documents. On the other hand, the situation in Kosova remains the same. Has the fact that they are talking about Kosova in the world made any impression on the Serbian aggressor? [Ramajli] It is true that the issue of Kosova, expecially recently, is discussed at every meeting of the international community and, one might say, it is present in every public appearance of every statesman. This is understandable in light of the fact that it is clear to all that, without the resolution of the issue of Kosova, there is no solution to the problem of the former Yugoslavia and there is no peace in the Balkans. The international community is currently concerned with the Kosova issue for the purpose of making it impossible for the conflict to spread from the territory of Croatia and Bosnia to the south. It is clear to all now that the conflict in Kosova cannot be kept under control within a certain territory, as is the case with the conflict in Bosnia and Croatia. This conflict would immediately involve many other states bordering on Kosova and the conflict would be expanded in the Balkans and perhaps even further. Since the European Union and the international community are not interested is seeing the conflict expand, these groups have recently been bringing up the Kosova issue as a problem which demands an immediate solution so that it will not get any worse. Much pressure is being exerted on Serbia to begin to resolve the Kosova issue by means of discussions with the Albanians, and it appears that this pressure has begun to produce its first effects. This is evident in the fact that there are signs which indicate that the current Serbian government wants to begin the talks, under conditions and at a time when they will receive the best response. The activity of the government organs in Kosova, which rely exclusively on military police violence, gives the impression, as you say, that the international pressure in regard to Kosova is not making any impression on Serbia. In my opinion, this is not true; this attitude and the nervousness of this government give the impression that Serbia is not in a strong position in regard to Kosova and it believes that it will not be easy to keep Kosova under occupation for a long time. There are other indications that the Serbs are calculating that they might be losing Kosova in the near future. This is seen, best of all, in the schemes that are being devised in regard to Serbian Krajina in Croatia and the insistence that there is a parallel between that area and Kosova. Now we also have the public appearances of many Serbian intellectuals, which were not characteristic earlier, who now are talking, without hesitation, about Kosova as a lost territory for Serbia and about the fact that it is better that this be understood now instead of becoming true by means of a conflict which certainly would be more fierce and more bloody than the one in Croatia and Bosnia. [Azemi] Recently there has been talk about some kind of global plan for the solution of the problem of the former Yugoslavia. Some people quickly called this plan very hopeful while others expressed some skepticism about the resolution of the issue of Kosova. [Ramajli] Yes, it is true that there is talk about some kind of global plan for the solution of the problem of the former Yugoslavia. But I think that, despite the many preparations which are being made by the international community for such a plan, conditions have not yet been created for this plan to be put on the table for discussion. In my opinion, a precondition for beginning discussions of this plan would be the achievement of a cease-fire in Bosnia which would end the armed conflicts. If this is not achieved, it would be difficult to have discussions on this plan. I think that the position of Kosova regarding this plan has its good and bad aspects. It would be a positive development if Kosova were included in this plan by taking our position into consideration; Kosova, according to the 1974 Constitution, has been a constituent part of the former Yugoslavia. In my opinion, a negative element would be the fact that there is no doubt that this plan would try to draw a parallel between Kosova and the Serbian Krajina in Croatia, something which, basically, is not suitable for us. The drawing of this parallel must be opposed to the very end. In any case, although we have opted for the solution of the problem of Kosova by means of discussions in the presence of an international factor, which would guarantee the agreements reached with the other side, the inclusion of Kosova in the global plan for the solution of the problem of the former Yugoslavia would satisfy, to some extent, our requirements in regard to the size of the presence of the international factor and the solution of the problem of Kosova; it would also rule out the possibility that the Albanians would meet only with the Serbs, which would mean that the issue of Kosova would not be internationalized and would be regarded as an internal problem of Serbia. [Azemi] There is much talk in the media about a possible Albanian-Serbian dialogue. Some diplomats who visited Kosova recently talked about this possibility. On the other hand, president Rugova denied that a group had been formed to discuss the issues. Indeed, when would this dialogue be possible and under what conditions? [Ramajli] In response to an earlier question, I stressed that there are signals that the Serbs would like to begin discussions with the Albanians about the solution of the problem of Kosova. They are doing this because of pressure from the international community and because of the situation which currently exists within Serbia. These signals, as you have said, have been given recently through various diplomatic channels and on the occasion of visits of foreign diplomats to Kosova. The clearest signal was given on the occasion of the visit of British Secretary Hogg to Prishtina. Other signals were given through the media from Belgrade. I consider the talk about the formation of a group for discussions in Serbia with the Albanians, which president Rugova denied, as preparing the terrain for discussions and preparing opinion within Serbia for something which must happen soon. As president Rugova said, there has been no official announcement from the Serbian government about the beginning of the discussions or the formation of groups by one or the other side. The Albanian side has already proclaimed the conditions in which the discussions will begin and they have been the same and unchangeable from the very beginning. I think that the Serbian side is not yet prepared for this dialogue and that the dialogue will begin when the Serbian side believes that the conditions and the time are most appropriate for this. However, it appears that the dialogue on Kosova will more likely be imposed by international factors and by the situation in the region than by Serbia's readiness for talks. [Azemi] After the democratization of Albania, a new quality of relations among Albanians found expression. The appearance of Albania in the democratic plane is redefining the attitude of international factors toward Kosova. [Ramajli] I agree with your statement. After the democratization of life in Albania, especially after the victory of the democratic forces in the recent elections, there was a qualitative difference in the involvement of Albania in the problem of Kosova and of Albanians on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Despite Albania's many domestic and foreign problems, the country has been greatly involved in sensitizing efforts to place the issue of Kosova on the international agenda as a problem which demands a rapid solution, so that it will not get any worse. Along with the involvement of the republic of Kosova, Albanian diplomacy could be said to be the motivating force in sensitizing the international community and raising the issue of Kosova in all international mechanisms. The clear position of the president of the Government of Albania that Albania cannot stand aside in case of a conflict in Kosova obliged the international community to consider the issue of Kosova as a serious problem which requires an urgent solution. In my opinion, Albania is doing exactly what it can do, in accordance with its possibilities, so that the problem of Kosova will be resolved in accordance with the interests of the Albanians of Kosova. At this time and in the circumstances in the international community and in the territories of the former Yugoslavia, the support which Albania is giving to Kosova is irreplaceable. [Azemi] Kosova is bounded by neighbors which once were members of the Yugoslav Federation. One of them is Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Can you characterize the Macedonia-Kosova relationship in the current circumstances? [Ramajli] Currently, Macedonia, as an independent and sovereign state which was part of the former Yugoslavia, despite its international acceptance, is confronted by domestic problems of the transitional phase and by foreign problems which determine its position in regard to Kosova. The situation in Kosova and the course of events in regard to Kosova could involve Macedonia and other states in this part of the Balkans, no matter how they might develop. In my opinion, Macedonia's problem with Greece and the failure to accept Macedonia as an independent and sovereign state by the so-called third Yugoslavia are forcing Macedonia to maintain a neutral official attitude on the issue of Kosova. The recent interview by Macedonian President Gligorov with a foreign newspaper, in which he stressed the need for the installation of peacekeeping forces in Kosova so as to eliminate the possibility of an outbreak of a conflict in the south, satisfies the demands of the representatives of Kosova for such a thing. [Azemi] In your opinion, what is the future of Kosova? Concretely, can you state briefly the goals of the organs of government in Kosova and other institutions? [Ramajli] The goals of the organs of Kosova, beginning with President Rugova, the assembly, the government, and other organs, are stated in the documents which this assembly approved and which have been put into force by the referendum which was held in Kosova in which the citizens of Kosova defined the status of Kosova as a sovereign and independent state. Therefore, during the present time and in the future, all representatives of Kosova and of its organs will be committed to the realization of this goal. There has been no wavering from this goal on the part of any political party in Kosova or any individual who has a relevant influence on public opinion in Kosova. I am aware that the road to the achievement of this goal is difficult and long but the results will depend on the manner of organization and our commitment, first of all, and on the support of the international factor. For the achievement of this goal, we have chosen the peaceful option and the solution of problems by means of discussions which must be carried on, on our part, by the legitimate representatives of the citizens of the republic of Kosova who were identified by the multiparty elections of 24 May 1992.
