Talking to PRENSA LATINA at the conclusion of the first day of his official visit to Colombia, which followed his stay in Brazil and Venezuela, Lage said the general balance of his visits is positive. Relations are at a high point in these three countries, and we have found great receptivity in those governments, great interest in joint ventures, and many opportunities for cooperation and economic development, Lage affirmed. Lage said he felt that the most important aspect of his long afternoon meeting with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria was the frankness of the in-depth analysis of bilateral relations and problems between Colombia and Cuba. He indicated that Cuba's ties with Colombia have made important and significant advances since Presidents Gaviria and Fidel Castro met last August in Cartagena. Lage disclosed that he and his host discussed prospects for strengthening relations, Cuba's opening to foreign capital, and possibilities for having Colombian businessmen participate in that process. He also brought up the subject of furthering commercial relations through an increase of Cuba's direct purchases of Colombian oil and exports of Cuban medicines to Colombia. The Cuban leader felt that as the exchange increases, his country may find solutions to resolving its debts with Colombia, which will in turn pave the way for increasing commercial relations. Lage indicated that he analyzed specific cooperation in each sector with the ministers of foreign commerce and agriculture and livestock and with the planning chief. He will continue such discussions with the public health, mines and energy, and economic development ministers and with the management of Banco de la Republic and the Colombian Petroleum Enterprise. The Cuban official begins today's schedule with a meeting with the top leaders of Colombia's major business groups. He will conclude his visit in the afternoon.
