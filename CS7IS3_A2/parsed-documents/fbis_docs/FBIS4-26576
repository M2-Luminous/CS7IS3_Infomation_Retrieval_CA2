The visit to Taiwan by non-cultural and non-educational figures will be allowed only after responsible government agencies have enacted relevant regulations governing the approval of their applications. At the present stage, the action described above will be interpreted as a measure in disguise to tighten control. In the past, administrative agencies took a more liberal attitude in examining reasons for the mainlanders' visits to Taiwan to engage in cultural and educational activities and in determining their status. This has enabled mainlanders in official positions who have worked in economic, trade, industrial, and business circles to visit Taiwan. However, after 1 July, the Ministry of Education will only accept the applications of mainland personnel in cultural and educational circles to engage in educational, sports, cultural, arts, and science and technology activities that are sponsored by schools, research institutions, and academic societies. Personnel in other specialized fields can apply for visits to Taiwan only after government agencies have enacted measures for approving their applications. In our administrative talks with the mainland, the question of visits by mainland economic and trade personnel to Taiwan has consistently been used as a bargaining chip, and this has delayed approval of the measures drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs governing visits by people from the mainland's economic and trade circles. The MAC meeting's approval of the Ministry of Education's proposal at this time will block for the time being the route used by mainland economic and trade personnel in official positions to visit Taiwan. Whether this has anything to do with the aftermath of the Chientao Lake [Qiandaohu] case on cross-strait relations is worth pondering. After the MAC meeting, MAC Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien said that the government has been too relaxed in its control, adding that the government has never specifically allowed non-cultural and non- educational personnel to visit Taiwan for cultural and educational activities. According to statistics, only one third of the mainlanders who were approved by the Ministry of Education to visit Taiwan were directly involved in academic activities in the strict sense of the word; the rest have nothing to do with cultural and educational activities at all. We have sponsored many cross-strait symposiums -- including those on steel production, communications, and tourism -- based on the measures governing the approval of applications for people from the mainland to visit Taiwan to engage in cultural and educational activities. Personnel in charge of the mainland's state-run enterprises, including those from the Shoutu [Shoudu] Iron and Steel Corporation, airline companies, and Youth Tourist Service, have visited Taiwan. Kao Kung-lien pointed out: Last June, the government promulgated measures governing the approval of applications for people on the mainland to visit Taiwan. Since then, with the exception of those who came to visit their relatives and attend their funerals, all others have come based on measures governing approval of applications for cultural and educational exchanges. It is easy to handle applications for educational, cultural, sports, and arts exchange, because they are easy to identify. The Ministry of Education, however, has a hard time examining non-academic activities involving finance, banking, and economics. The ministry last year asked other government agencies to enact measures for the approval of applications for mainland personnel in different categories to visit Taiwan, but the agencies have not come up with the measures yet. It was pointed out that the following measures on visits by mainlanders in specialized fields have been drafted on the basis of regulations governing relations between people on two sides of the Taiwan Strait and are in the process of being examined and approved: measures on visits by economic and trade personnel (Ministry of Economic Affairs), by agricultural personnel (Council of Agriculture), and by communications personnel (Ministry of Communications). Measures concerning visits by physicians and by financial, construction, and environmental protection personnel are also being considered.
