Even molded parts with complicated geometries can easily be inspected. Cavities down to a minimum diameter of 3 mm directly below the surface and larger faults deeper down can be detected, even when there are local differences in foam hardness. The system's capacity for detecting faults in glued joints between one metal and another, metal and plastic, plastic and wood, other combinations of materials, and honeycomb structures has also been put to the test. The system can be used, for example, for monitoring the start of a new series, optimizing foaming or bonding processes, strength testing, random sampling during manufacturing, and 100 percent monitoring of critical sectors. The range of potential applications is thus wide: The motor vehicle and associated industries, the aircraft industry, the wood and plastics converting industries, shipbuilding, and many other areas can benefit from the new inspection system. It holds out another advantage as well: It needs no specialized personnel to operate it, nor does it require the products to be pretreated in any particular way prior to inspection. There is no need to use coupling [Koppel-] fluids and pastes. The basic device incorporates the power supply, the excitation and evaluation electronics, and the acoustic fault indicator. An optical fault indicator is integrated into the test head along with the electromechanical excitation system and the sensor. The signal is given on-line when a fault is detected.
