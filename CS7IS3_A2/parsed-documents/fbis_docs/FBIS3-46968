Gen. Yi Su-ik as director of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) effective Saturday in connection with its investigation of a scandal involving false purchases of artillery ammunition. The Ministry immediately named Maj. Gen. Yim Sam, Chief of Staff of the ROK Army Logistic Command, to replace Yi. The joint military and civilian prosecution team investigating the fraud announced Friday that it was perpetrated by French arms dealer Jean-Rene Fuan and a Korean intermediary, Chu Kwang-yong. Fuan, 53, and Chu, 52, who fled the country shortly before the start of the investigation, defrauded the Defense Ministry of 5.3 billion won using forged documents, the prosecution team said. In a related development, the Ministry said that it will form a committee for reform of the defense system between Jan. 10 and Feb. 28. The committee, to be chaired by Superintendent of the Korea Military Academy Chang Song, will be divided into two subcommittees with one investigating the Yulgok military buildup project and the other probing military supplies.
