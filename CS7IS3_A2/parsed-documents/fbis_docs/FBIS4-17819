The question of his country's denuclearization was discussed as was the dispute over the Black Sea Fleet. Following an idea by Defense Minister General Vitaliy Radetsky, he sounded out the Americans on the proposal of "bringing a third party into the discussions to encourage the conclusion" of the negotiations. But, on Saturday [23 April], according to the Russian press agency INTERFAX, President Kravchuk, in agreement with Moscow, stated on Ukrainian radio that the question of the fleet should be solved without the intervention of a "third party." [Rosten] How do you explain the fact that your president took that position? [Lopata] I think our president's stance is that this is a bilateral problem. He probably thinks we should use all diplomatic means and adopt the most rational approaches for the division of the fleet. And it is only when all the possible solutions have been rejected that we should resort to the mediation of a third party. (The Netherlands has been approached -- LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note). [Rosten] What kind of relations can Ukraine still maintain with President Meshkov, who is openly expressing his opposition to the presence of the Ukrainian fleet in Crimean ports? [Lopata] The positions here are clear. Crimean President Meshkov is pursuing a policy which is not that of Ukraine but that of Russia. He is violating Ukrainian laws. The presence of the Ukrainian Army and the creation of a Ukrainian fleet in Crimea have no justification in Mr. Meshkov's mind. I think that his opinions do not reflect our approach to ensuring the state's defense. [Rosten] Several agreements have already been reached at the highest level on the division of the Black Sea Fleet. None has been respected. Why? [Lopata] Russia does not see any problem in dividing the Black Sea Fleet. Over the past two years, it has stressed that it was prepared to divide this fleet and even to ensure that Ukraine could form its own fleet but provided the whole infrastructure -- and hence the bases -- remains Russia's property. That approach to settling the question cannot satisfy Ukraine. As a state, it has its viewpoint both on the division of the fleet and on that of the naval forces in the existing bases. Ukraine would like the agreements on the division of the fleet and the leasing of part of the infrastructure to the Russian Federation to be decided in a civilized way, respecting its interests and specifying the timing of the leasing of bases by the Russian fleet. What is now being proposed to Ukraine is unacceptable. A compromise is necessary and I think it will be found. [Rosten] But the Russians also want to safeguard their interests... [Lopata] If there was an amiable settlement, Ukraine would benefit from good prospects for the creation of its own naval forces on the basis of the division of the whole Soviet fleet, in whose creation it actively participated. Compared with the whole of this fleet, it is obvious that the Black Sea Fleet is merely an insignificant part. Ukraine could therefore have claims on the whole fleet of the former USSR but because it understands Russia's strategic problems in the region of the Black Sea basin and the Mediterranean basin, it has accepted the principle of a division of all the Black Sea vessels. With regard to its share, in other words around 200 ships, Ukraine has the opportunity to decide which ships should form part of its own naval force... It might suggest that Russia should buy those it does not need. As for the form of cooperation, it could take different on forms: Instead of handing over ships, it could involve handing over weapons or other equipment vital to the Ukrainian fleet. We have agreed with Russia on this approach. It is the division of the infrastruture which is causing a great problem in our relations. Russia wants to remain in these bases forever. [Rosten] You are on your way home from the United States where you discussed the problem of the denuclearization of Ukraine. Will the new Parliament be more successful in settling this than the previous one? [Lopata] Ukraine is meticulously implementing the agreements on the transfer of nuclear warheads to Russia. So far, it has transferred three convoys of weapons of this type in exchange for which it has received a convoy of nuclear fuel. [Rosten] The Russian press has launched a campaign against Ukraine, accusing it of storing chemical and biological weapons. What is your answer to these accusations? [Lopata] I can only say this: There are no such weapons on Ukrainian territory. All the weapons which belonged to the chemical or biological sector were transported out of Ukrainian territory before the creation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. [Rosten] Is the general dispute between Kiev and Moscow not likely to degenerate in the military sphere? [Lopata] The problem of relations between Ukraine and Russia -- two states with equal rights -- must obviously be solved at the level of diplomatic relations. If, in these relations, the armed forces of one or other state make their voice heard, we must pay attention to it. But that voice must have limits that prohibit the use of arms. What happened in Odessa is pure provocation, but Kiev and Moscow have managed to control that incident, which they do not want to see repeated.
