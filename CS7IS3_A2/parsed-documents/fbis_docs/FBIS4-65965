FBIS4-65965 "drweu102_o_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-102 Daily Report 25 May 1994 CYPRUS Boucher Denies Changes Boucher Denies Changes NC2505191094 Nicosia CYPRUS NEWS AGENCY in English 1550 GMT 25 May 94 NC2505191094 Nicosia CYPRUS NEWS AGENCY English BFN [Text] Nicosia, May 25 (CNA)--U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Richard Boucher denied here Wednesday [24 May] reports in the Turkish Cypriot press claiming that the U.S. had made promises to the Turkish Cypriots in a bid to achieve agreement on a UN package of confidence building measures. The reports alleged that U.S. State Department Special Coordinator on Cyprus Robert Lamb had made several promises to the Turkish Cypriot side in Vienna last week to gain their acceptance of the UN measures. The reports said Lamb's promises met many Turkish Cypriot demands concerning the reopening of Nicosia International Airport and access to part of the Turkish-occupied town of Varosha, which will come under UN administration under the UN-proposed measures. Boucher's denial was echoed by Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, who said at his daily press briefing the Government had no official confirmation of the Turkish Cypriot reports. Asked to say whether Lamb had made the promises, as these appeared in the Turkish Cypriot press, Boucher replied "the reports that have appeared in the press were not true, the specifics of the reports are not well reported." However he acknowledged the importance of issues concerning travelling of Turkish Cypriots and access to Varosha, issues on which an answer is still awaited from the Turkish side. He said the Vienna talks focussed on explaining to the Turkish Cypriot side some points to which it objected, included in the UN package of measures. Boucher reaffirmed that the March 21 document prepared by the UN remained "the document that is the basis for reaching agreement." Kasoulidhis told the press that there was no official confirmation from the American side of the Turkish Cypriot reports. The spokesman said the U.S. assessment of the situation coincided with that of the UN and stressed that the government had had no official confirmation from anybody of the press reports. UN Secretary-General's resident representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel denied categorically the truthfulness of the reports. The issues of separate customs offices at Nicosia Airport, the use of so-called Turkish Cypriot passports, the presence of Turkish Cypriot police officers in civilian clothes on the access road to Varosha and the use of the logo of the Turkish Cypriot illegal regime on their aircraft are points which the reports claimed were promised to the Turkish Cypriot side. "It has been clarified to us that no such promises were given on these issues," Kasoulidhis said. "The Greek Cypriot side does not accept the presence of Turkish troops in the area to be unmanned, south of Varosha, leading to the town," Kasoulidhis added. He noted that efforts were still being made on the issue of access to Varosha and the area of the town that is to be returned to UN administration, in accordance to the UN measures.
