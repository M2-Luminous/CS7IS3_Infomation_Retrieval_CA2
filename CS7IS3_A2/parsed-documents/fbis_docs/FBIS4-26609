According to Wang Xiyi, head of the Shenzhen branch of the People's Bank of China, by the end of May, the balance of savings of various kinds in the city reached 73.205 billion yuan, an increase of 9.483 billion yuan over the corresponding figure in January, while the sum remaining after extending loans stood at 54.195 billion yuan, up 5.611 billion yuan on January's corresponding figure. Wang said it was encouraging that more and more bank savings in the city came from fixed deposits, which meant that the sum for long-term use is growing. To guarantee enough funds for major enterprises and construction of key basic facilities in Shenzhen, the loans issued by various banks in the city in June are estimated at 1.6 billion yuan. The branch head said that though Shenzhen, as a pilot city for China's policy of reform and opening to the world, has a freer financial environment, there still remained a need for effective measures to control inflation there, to strengthen the withdrawal of currency from circulation and to prevent the use of working capital as investment capital in the form of fixed assets.
