The source said that Nabil Sha'th and Amnon Shahaq will cochair the Palestinian-Israeli talks, which will focus on Israel's reply to Palestinian demands that the Palestinians believe should be met ahead of the resumption of the peace talks. According to the source, the Palestinian requests are: 1. Protecting the settlements should be the responsibility of the Israeli Government, not of individual settlers. 2. Israel should pledge to seek a solution to the tensions associated with the settlements. 3. Palestinian-Israeli talks should be held to discuss the form of transitional international presence in the occupied territories. 4. A joint Palestinian-Israeli committee should be formed to discuss the future of the settlements. The Palestinian source said that the Israelis had given a negative reply to these requests but that the intercession of Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the Middle East peace process, the two meetings he held with the Israeli delegation in Tunisia yesterday, and his meeting with President Yasir 'Arafat, brought the positions of the two sides closer. The source said that Ross has put pressure on the Israelis, making them show a great deal of flexibility. The source stated that if the Israelis come with a positive and acceptable reply, an important meeting may be held on Thursday in Cairo between 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, and an official statement declaring the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations could be issued. The source added that everything depends on the outcome of the Palestinian-Israeli meeting in Cairo tomorrow.
