FR940912-0-00057 FR940912-0-00010 24.16(f)(2)(v)_Payment of commute compensation Comment: The commute compensation provisions include a section that a Customs Officer will not be paid for commute time if the overtime assignment begins 16 hours or more after the last regularly scheduled assignment. This section makes it extremely difficult for those inspectors that work Monday through Friday to serve the public on Saturdays and Sundays. Customs Response: This eligibility condition for commute compensation is statutory. See, 19 U.S.C. 267(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I). Thus, Customs cannot deviate from the statutory requirements, but does note that the additional compensation_a flat 3 hours at the basic pay rate_is in addition to callback pay. Accordingly, no change to §24.16(f)(2)(v) is made. 24.16(h)_Excluding workers compensation benefits from list of payment categories subject to pay cap limitations Comment: The NTEU requests the exclusion of workers compensation benefits and back pay awards and settlements from the listing of categories not subject to any applicable pay cap calculations. Customs Response: Regarding the exclusion of workers compensation benefits from the list of payment categories subject to pay cap limitations, for the reasons given above at §24.16(e)(2)(ii), no change to §24.16(h) is made. Regarding the exclusion of back pay awards and settlements, the current regulatory language provides that ``awards made in accordance with back pay settlements'' shall not be applied to any applicable pay cap calculations. This correctly conveys the fact that such awards are exempt. Accordingly, no change to §24.16(h) is made concerning this point. Additional Changes to the Regulations In addition to the changes discussed above in connection with the analysis of comments, the regulatory texts as set forth below incorporate certain editorial or other non-substantive changes to the interim regulations to add clarity and improve the readability of the final regulations. The sections of the interim regulations affected by these changes are indicated below. 24.16(b)_Definitions As the definitions of ``commute compensation'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(5)), ``overtime pay'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(13)), and ``premium pay differential'' (19 CFR 24.16(b)(15))_now denominated §24.16(b)(14), see next paragraph below for explanation on redenomination_encompass similar elements pertaining to compensation, the wording of these three sections is recast to employ a parallel construction for ease of readability and to add clarity to their exclusive meanings.
