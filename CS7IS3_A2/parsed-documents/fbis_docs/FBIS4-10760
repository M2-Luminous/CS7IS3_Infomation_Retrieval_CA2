FBIS4-10760 "drlat074_l_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-074 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 Bolivia Likely U.S. Extradition Request Spreads Fear Likely U.S. Extradition Request Spreads Fear PY1504182094 Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 1 Apr 94 National Section p 2 PY1504182094 Santa Cruz EL MUNDO Spanish BFN [Text] La Paz -- As the "narco-links" case [involving alleged links between former President Jaime Paz Zamora and his party, the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, MIR, with drug trafficking] gains impetus, fear grows within government and political circles that the U.S. Court may issue a "massive request for extradition of Bolivian citizens who perpetrated attacks and/or crimes within U.S. territory, according to official sources. [no closing quotation marks as published] According to Interior Under Secretary Hugo San Martin, "there is an extradition procedure that has probably been considered for the `Rico Toro case' and will probably be used for other people." Some legislators fear that as a result of the developments following the charges and statements by drug trafficker Carmelo Dominguez Vaca and the report on the FELCN [Special Antinarcotics Force] operations, the United States may request the extradition of "many Bolivian citizens involved in drug trafficking such as General Felipe Carvajal Badani, retired, the former National Police chief." Referring to the former police chief, the FELCN report states: "In October 1989 (Jaime) Paz Zamora swore in Felipe Carvajal as the National Police commander. Carvajal, a MIR activist well known for being corrupt, has a strong relationship with Capobianco. Carvajal resigned on 12 March 1991 charging that the U.S. Embassy was pressuring him." When Hugo San Martin was asked on Thursday, 31 March, if he knew of an alleged U.S. request to the Bolivian Foreign Ministry for the extradition of Gen. Felipe Carvajal he answered: "We have nothing official." Diplomatic sources explained that despite the lack of an extradition treaty between Bolivia and the United States that explicitly refers to trafficking, the latter "has every right to seek the extradition of any Bolivian citizens it believes are involved in trafficking in U.S. territory." As an example they mentioned that in the past few years the number of U.S. requests for extradition for this reason amounted to about two dozen. Of these requests, however, the Supreme Court only approved the "case of Chunty Roca Suarez," who was sentenced by the civil court to 15 years imprisonment. On 23 March the U.S. Embassy officially asked the Bolivian Foreign Ministry to extradite former Army Colonel Faustino Rico Toro for violating the Miami federal antinarcotics law. The Foreign Ministry submitted the request for extradition to the Supreme Court of Justice which, in turn, submitted it to the Attorney General's office. Attorney General Angel Baldivieso has ordered Rico Toro's preventive imprisonment while legal procedures are completed. Meanwhile, Government Minister German Quiroga Gomez disclosed that Faustino Rico Toro, who is believed to have shipped cocaine from Bolivia to the United States, will continue incommunicado in the FELCN prison in La Paz.
