In the view of our society, the prospects for halting it are hopeless. There is only one glimmer of hope -- the implementation of a severe financial and credit policy. We spoke about this vitally important problem to Nodar Javakhishvili, president of the Republic of Georgia National Bank. [passage omitted] [Javakhishvili] How can we overcome hyperinflation? We have to start without delay to live within our means for at least two to three months; that is to say, the Georgian population and economy should use only what is produced. This concerns gas, electric power, food products, and, in general, everything. There is no perfect [system of] social justice. It is not possible to save our country in the situation it is in under the aegis of a perfect [system of] social justice. Far more injustice will be committed under the aegis of social justice. For example, the population is practically not being made to pay taxes and if it is paying something, this is not to the advantage of the state. The sole payer for the gas being consumed is the republican budget whose source is the credit emission from the National Bank; that is to say, with the money used to pay for the gas being consumed, we are increasing the amount of the money supply in circulation that has not been secured and, in this way, money belonging to all citizens of Georgia, including those who do not use gas, is being devalued. Tbilisi, Rustavi, and Kutaisi are being supplied with gas; that is to say, the price of gas consumed by me as an inhabitant of Tbilisi is also being paid for by a peasant from Kiziqi through the imposition of an inflationary tax; all the more so because, in the environs of Tbilisi, many families use gas for heating, hot water, and most importantly, for their hothouses. This means that we have to change our psychology -- proceed not from what we want or need, but according to our means; we should aim to extend those means and use them efficiently, that is to say, in reality, we should not have a budget deficit. A budget deficit means more is being spent than earned; it is another matter that we increase budgetary incomes (we are also obliged to do so) at the expense of levying taxes. We should refrain from issuing credits; this will bring instant stability to the money market, although it will also not be our final salvation; this will signify only a reduction of the temperature. However, if we reduce this temperature, international society and, in particular, the IMF, World Bank, and the European Bank [for Reconstruction and Development] are ready today to render us real and extensive assistance -- financial assistance -- that should revive production and gradually secure a saturation of goods on the consumer market. At the same time, we should reduce the temperature with our forces; this is their one firm condition, that is to say, either we should continue to consume within today's parameters -- if we consume just gas to the value of $300 million annually and produce only one-tenth of this, we will alienate international financial institutions that are keen to help us -- or we should limit consumption for a few months in accordance with the country's real potential. Reducing the rate of inflation means that there should be an improvement in the exchange rate of the coupon to the dollar and a fall in the value of the dollar against the coupon. For example, today, a salary of 500,000 coupons is equivalent to half a dollar; if we reduce the inflation rate by 50 percent, one dollar will be equivalent to 250,000 coupons. Correspondingly, the population's savings will become more solid and gradually increase in value in reality. We should not concern ourselves with increasing wages, but with making them more solid and strengthening the coupon. Regarding the loans issued by the National Bank, retrieving them has been entrusted to the law enforcement bodies and a large part has already been recovered; however, there are still many things that have to be done regarding those persons who have left the republic. The law enforcement bodies are actively working on this. However, the problem is that the basic loans that have been issued have been covered at face value, which we cannot call being covered in reality as 100 million rubles lent in February of last year is covered by 100 million coupons this year; this represents practically no cover. It is necessary that profit obtained as a result of the rate of inflation as hidden income should be retrieved to the benefit of the state budget by the corresponding law enforcement bodies, better still by the Tax Inspectorate; this will be the most serious blow against inflation and it is my firm belief that it will reduce the budget deficit as this amounts to approximately $300 million. As for the coupon, from the very first day it was introduced, this was a temporary transitional unit of payment; as can been seen from its name, the coupon cannot be called money. It is a part of securities that are given to its owner to enable him to receive the dividend belonging to him. However, I believe that we should achieve stability on the basis of this same coupon so that we can protect real Georgian money. We are thinking of introducing the lari [name of future new Georgian currency] during the initial period of stability, but this will only happen when we are conceptually absolutely ready for monetary reform and, what is no less important, when we will have financial guarantees that it will not suffer the same fate as the coupon. The IMF is virtually giving us such guarantees provided we fulfill their demands. My attitude to the ruble zone is a negative one as I cannot realistically envisage the creation of a ruble zone and our having any prospects within it. Nobody should think that Russia will accept such a country into the ruble zone and provide it with funds and notes whose level of inflation is 10 times higher, which in itself means that Russia will automatically and without compensation assume responsibility for nine-tenths of the country's general expenses. They will certainly demand from us that we do not allow there to be a budget deficit and that we bring credit emission and the inflation level into line with one another. In the event of our implementing such measures, our money will be on a par with the Russian ruble and the ruble zone will have no significance at all for us; it will have already by then resulted in the loss of the country's most important attribute of sovereignty. Today, very many people are speculating about the European Union [EU] and the ECU although no one should think that the ECU is a real monetary unit in Europe. In spite of trying for decades and taking into account that the level of development of [Western] European countries is very similar in each case, they have been unable to achieve this aim in Europe; we can only think about this when the former Soviet republics will have similar economic levels, which, as in the case of the European Union, will take decades. Managing the country's economy, particularly bringing it out of the very deep crisis, cannot be done by a monetary and credit policy alone; it is necessary for all levels of power and the whole of society to work in one direction; we are currently at war, that is to say we are struggling to save the country's statehood. I view my minimum program as obtaining real assistance from the international financial institutions and my maximum program as building a truly independent state by means of a highly developed banking system. Probably the reason why I can never inwardly agree to the National Bank issuing loans today is that we are dealing here with credit emission or money that does not exist, which, in every case, leads to an acceleration in the rate of inflation and is a mechanism for levying taxes upon the population. In today's conditions, there are very many things that we need to do. We have already begun the training of specialists for the banking system in Georgia, which is being undertaken by the German Banking Academy under the aegis and with the financial support of the European Union. There should be 280 trained specialists within one and a half years.
