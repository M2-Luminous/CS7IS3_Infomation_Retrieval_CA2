Laser implantation employs a laser to diffuse substances on the surface of a material into its interior. Calcium is one component of bone, and because it is highly compatible with the human body, this achievement brings us one step closer to the development of a material that can be used as artificial bone. Human bone is mainly composed of a substance called hydroxyapatite, which contains calcium and phosphorous. By using laser implantation to diffuse calcium, one of the major components of bone, throughout the substrate, the group has created a material that will not be rejected by the body. It is expected that laser implantation will be a simpler method of modifying materials than ion implantation. In laser implantation, a substance is deposited onto the surface of a substrate by vapor deposition. It is then irradiated by a laser from above, which causes it to diffuse into the substrate. Professor Kubo's group applied this technique with calcium. They placed a vessel containing a substrate of alumina, an oxide ceramic, in a vacuum and deposited calcium onto its surface by vapor deposition. Then they irradiated the surface from above with a high-energy excimer laser, which caused the calcium and alumina to melt and flow together. When they analyzed the substrate, they found that the calcium and alumina had formed a mixed layer within the substrate, thus confirming successful surface modification. At this point no experiments have been performed to determine the effects on the body of ceramics formed by this method. However, both calcium and alumina have highly biocompatible properties, so it is expected that there will be no problem in using this ceramic material as artificial bone to replace damaged areas, as teeth, etc. Professor Kubo's group believes that surface modification using hydroxyapatite is also possible, which would form a material even more compatible with the body. However, it will be difficult to get phosphorous to diffuse using the present technique, so in the future this group will search for a phosphate compound that can be used in this procedure and try to form hydroxyapatite.
