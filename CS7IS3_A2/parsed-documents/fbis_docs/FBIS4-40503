First of all, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all those people's deputies of Ukraine who supported me and voted to elect me to this honorable and very responsible post of prime minister of Ukraine. I would also like to thank those who did not vote for me today, and I hope we can cooperate together. I regard your considerable degree of support and trust as a pleasant sign of a certain solidarity in the deputy corps, as a sincere desire of the new Supreme Council deputies to unite in their intentions, efforts and practical actions toward joint work on solutions to acute economic problems facing our new independent state. I am convinced that each of us sitting in this chamber today is well aware that we are living and working in a time difficult for our homeland, and that the top legislative body and the government of the country are facing a huge responsibility to strengthen its statehood, sovereignty, to overcome the crisis in the economy, raise the living standards and improve the people's well- being. It would not be an overstatement to say that we are living in a historic time, a time of choice and resolute action in the name of the Ukrainian people, in the name of the young independent Ukrainian state. I would like to assure you, esteemed people's deputies, in all frankness, that I am fully aware of the complexity of the economic and political situation in our country, and that I have a deep understanding of what a tangible moral burden, what a huge responsibility I am undertaking once I am elected prime minister of Ukraine. [sentence as heard] I hope I will have enough strength and experience to live up to your trust and the people's understandable expectations and high hopes that we can stop the country from sliding into an abyss and bring an improvement in the lives of our people. Of course, the success of the government that you have trusted me to head will considerably depend on the individuals who agree to work there, their level of competence and sense of responsibility. I would like it to be a government of like-minded professionals who will pursue modern economic views, stand firmly on a market platform, and who will be guided in their practical work by Ukraine's national interests, rather than their own, and will be beyond politics. In my understanding, economics is the highest form of politics for a government official of any level. At the same time, I fully understand that the political factor, the atmosphere around the government and society on the whole, must play an extremely important role in creating proper conditions for the revival of national economy and for its progress. In the past few years, we have seen for ourselves, in our experience and that of others, that deep economic reforms are impossible if there is no national concord, civic unity, and an atmosphere of understanding and full support for the government's economic policy in the society. On this premise, I would like to propose that all political forces, millions working in various sectors of the national economy and all citizens of Ukraine refrain for a while from any destructive actions, by which I mean first of all strikes and other forms of stoppages in the production. It is particularly dangerous now in the coal industry and in the entire fuel and energy complex. Of course, we are not going to live in some conflict-free, totally peaceful society. But I am convinced that even in today's extreme situation all misunderstandings and contentious issues that may emerge can be solved in the course of work, by studying all the circumstances and negotiating, without resorting to extreme measures. Our life and work will not be easy, because the crisis has not passed but continues to deepen, and its worst consequences are probably yet to come. We may be yet in store for an explosion, but the government must do everything in its power to minimize its socially negative consequences and prevent further economic destabilization in the country. Moreover, the Cabinet of Ministers, together with the parliament will take effective steps toward gradual improvement of the people's living standards, pay, pensions and social benefits. But all this will be done together with the livening up of production and an increase in the national income. Although the government will give unconditional priority to the social sphere, I believe that a change for the best in our life and stabilization of the economy will not begin until a year or a year and a half from now. I don't think we should make promises we cannot keep. I have already said this, and I want to say again that we must create a government with full powers, with a genuine responsibility for the state of the economy. I proceed here from the fact that the competence and efficiency of any management structure primarily depends on how well the powers and responsibilities vested in it accord with its practical activities. There should be a clear and direct correlation. On this basis, I support the provisions of the draft law on amendments to the Constitution, which stipulates that the prime minister of the country must be head of executive power, personally accountable to the Supreme Council and the people for the implementation of the laws, resolutions and economic programs adopted and their social consequences. We should say bluntly that today, with the existing split and duality in the executive power, our government does not have this status, and it cannot help but affect its efficiency. We must draw a clear and rational line between the functions and responsibilities of representative and executive bodies, of the center and the regions, giving local authorities powers to resolve all issues concerning local life, provided that they unconditionally support the overall state interests and preserve Ukraine's territorial integrity. We are in great need of a flexible and effective vertical power structure, without which a state cannot exist. We have certain intentions to that effect, and I hope that our parliament will come to an agreement on this important issue and will pass relevant laws. Using its right to initiate legislation, the government will be active in creating a reliable legal basis and preparing laws necessary to accelerate economic and political reforms. We must make relevant changes in some of the acting laws and as soon as possible renounce outdated legal acts which are slowing down the recovery of our economy and society on the whole. Undoubtedly, I am counting on joint constructive work with the parliament, its commissions and people's deputies. Of course, in the current situation, neither the government nor myself can count on any chance of quiet work in comfortable offices. I am not even thinking of that, but I do hope that the new Cabinet of Ministers will be given a chance to work fruitfully, fulfill its potential and do all in its power to improve our economic situation. During this work, I will always be ready to consider any anticrisis proposal from people's deputies, one which would be well-grounded, backed up by relevant economic calculations and offering positive consequences of its implementation. To that end, the doors of the Cabinet of Ministers will be open to anyone. But, on the contrary, I believe there is no need today to queue to the prime minister's office to beg or snatch something from the state treasury. Give us a chance to work, and if there is any emergency, we will see you. There is almost nothing left to hand out at the government level, and, moreover, in the market conditions that we are adopting the functions and powers of the government will be totally different. In conclusion, esteemed people's deputies, allow me to express again my sincere and deep gratitude to all of you for the great deal of trust you have placed in me. Thank you for your attention.
