(IDO) will open 159 new relay stations for telephone service on the formula of Motorola Inc. of the United States within a year and a half starting in April. -- IDO will transfer 1.5 megahertz of its 8-megahertz radio frequency on the formula of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) to the Motorola formula for allocation of 6.5 megahertz to both formulas. -- The Japanese and U.S. Governments will hold regular meetings to assess implementation of the agreement. -- The radio frequency change will be made with IDO transferring 1.5 megahertz of its 8-megahertz frequency allocated to it for the NTT formula to the Motorola formula. The agreement was reached as a result of a meeting held Saturday night between Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale, ministry officials said. Both governments agreed to hold consultations to assess implementation of the agreement every three months or on request by either government, the officials said. On the basis of a 1989 Japan-U.S. trade accord meant to boost imports of U.S. cellular phones, IDO began service under the Motorola formula, in addition to the NTT formula, but the Motorola-formula service has not spread much. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor accused Japan last month of breaching the accord and set March 17 as the deadline for an announcement of sanctions over trade disputes with Japan. In negotiations with Motorola, IDO proposed in late January to open 124 new stations for the Motorola-formula service by March 1997. Motorola demanded that IDO open 159 new stations for the Motorola-formula service by February 1995 and allocate 3 megahertz of IDO's 8-megahertz frequency for the NTT-formula service to the Motorola formula. IDO made concessions to Motorola's demands to reach the basic agreement.
