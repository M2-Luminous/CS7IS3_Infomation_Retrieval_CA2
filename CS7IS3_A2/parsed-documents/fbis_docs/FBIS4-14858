On Friday Gaydar announced the creation of a pro-Yeltsin party -- the "Russia's Choice", while Zhirinovskiy was confirmed as a presidential candidate by the congress of his Liberal Democratic Party held on Saturday under the motto "LDPR to Power". Gaydar is representing the democratic-reformist movement, while Zhirinovskiy -- the "neoimperial" one. The space between them is occupied by all other politicians -- moderate reformer Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, supporter of Russian regions Sergey Shakhray, former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and communist Gennadiy Zyuganov. However, Boris Yeltsin may himself join the race if he sees no worthy successor. He said that in an interview to the Spanish "EL PAIS" newspaper. The outcome of the two-year long presidential race depends mostly on the results of economic policy of the president and the government. Gaydar clearly understands that and lists three priorities of the economic programme -- tax reform, investments into economy and legal guarantees of private property. Zhirinovskiy's main ideas is to protect Russians in the CIS and Slavs in the world at any cost, to restore Russian borders of 1975 and create a one-party government. He complained that Yeltsin is now dealing only with the Russia's Choice and ignores the Liberal Democratic Party which came first in December parliamentary elections. It is not a secret that the president prefers the "Russia's Choice" and this puts additional responsibility on the party. It has to learn lessons from the last election campaign when it lost to Zhirinovskiy despite all predictions of a landslide victory. Democrats then only limited themselves to general discussions on TV, but failed to create grass-root organisations across the country and offer concrete economic measures to improve life. It seems that Gaydar is well aware of the mistakes and realises that hard everyday work is necessary to ensure success in 1996.
