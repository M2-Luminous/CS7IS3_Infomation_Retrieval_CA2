The defendants are interrogated in the presence of Bisharah Abu-Sa'd, a lawyer who is a partner and the brother-in-law of Deputy Najah Wakim. AL-SHIRA' previously reported that the Abu-Nidal group undertakes the personal protection of Deputy Wakim by providing him with a permanent escort of armed men. Hence, Wakim adheres to the FRC line and adopts it in his political positions.
