Russian envoy on Karabakh settlement Vladimir Kazimirov told TASS on Thursday that in contrast to the last cease-fire, which was unilaterally declared by Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan, the latest one is a commitment of three parties, a compromise brokered by mediators among Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. "Multiple violations of previous agreements put the trust to political will of the leaders of the sides under a serious test," Kazimirov admitted. He said that the agreement was signed by defence ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The Russian Foreign Ministry welcomes the cease-fire and insists on its unconditional fulfilment by all parties, he added. "It is necessary to ensure a radical breakthrough in the situation, a firm turn towards peace, to consolidate armistice by reliable and legally-binding agreements on the final end of the armed conflict," the envoy stressed. So far there have been no reports about violations of the cease-fire. Later in the day Kazimirov, Chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group for Karabakh Jan Elison and his deputy Mathias Mosberg are leaving for the conflict area to meet leaders of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh.
