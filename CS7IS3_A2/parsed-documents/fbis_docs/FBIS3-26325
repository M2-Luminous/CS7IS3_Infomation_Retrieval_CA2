Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) on the mainland, and Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman and secretary general of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), signed the release today after five days of discussions. The five understandings listed by the news release were: First, both sides agreed that sensitive political issues should be avoided in a pragmatic manner in discussing routine matters. They discussed three routine issues, including the repatriation of personnel who cross the Taiwan Straits in violation of relevant regulations and related issues, and have reached deep common understanding on them, the news release said. However, they will step up efforts to solve some remaining differences so as to reach a written agreement as soon as possible, the release said. They have agreed to hold their fourth talks on routine matters in late March in Beijing and sign an agreement in Taipei, if an agreement is reached. During the fourth talks, they will discuss jointly fighting against maritime smuggling, piracy and other criminal activities, the protection of intellectual property rights on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, contacts and mutual aid between courts on both sides of the straits, and some economic, scientific and technological issues included in an agreement between ARATS President Wang Daohan and SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu last year. Second, the two organisations agreed on methods to facilitate entrance and exit of personnel across the Taiwan Straits, which will be enforced in the form of an exchange of letters. Third, both sides agreed to increase the variety of duplicates of legal deeds to be sent to the other side of the Taiwan Straits. Details will be discussed later. Fourth, both sides agreed to provide mutual help to resolve issues concerning inheritance. Fifth, the two organisations agreed to promote mutual visits between news media officials, journalists, youth, and scientific and technological personnel. They also said that they would thoroughly carry out various agreements reached during the Wang-Koo talks last year, keep in contact with each other and keep a smooth channel of talks to create favorable conditions for the second Wang-Koo meeting. The news release was drafted by two vice-secretary generals appointed by ARATS and SEF last night. Tang Shubei and Chiao Jen-ho signed it after a discussion this morning.
