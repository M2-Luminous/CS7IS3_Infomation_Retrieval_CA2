In the days following the Spring Festival each year, in particular, wave upon wave of peasants come flooding in, overburdening the rail system across the nation and filling bus and train stations in large and mid-sized cities to capacity, forming a "rural migrant upsurge" that cannot be held back. The "upsurge" in rural migrants started in the late 1980's and grew explosively after 1990. There is no sign at all it will diminish. At present about 50 to 60 millon rural migrants are on the move each year, with 24 million of them from the six provinces of Sichuan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui alone. I One of the direct causes of the "rural migrant upsurge" is China's huge rural population, which creates a massive oversupply of rural labor in absolute terms. Since the switch from agriculture to other sectors of the economy without leaving one's village cannot absorb all the many redundant workers, the outward migration of some peasants in search of jobs is inevitable. Secondly, the small scale of farming, the widening price scissors between industrial and agricultural products, the overburden on peasants, and other factors have depressed the profitability of agriculture, particularly farming. Unable to get rich by working the land, some peasants have hit the road in search of money-making opportunities. The "rural migrant upsurge" is also caused by a more deep-seated reason, namely that in China urbanization lags behind industrialization severely. Typically, as a nation becomes more and more industrialized (as demonstrated by the growth of the secondary and tertiary sectors as a share of the national economy), the level of urbanization too rises steadily (the main indicator being the percentage of the nation's total population that is urban). This is the outcome of changes in the employment structure, which, in turn, are caused by changes in the industrial structure. It is also a result of the operations of the market mechanism in the process of resource allocation. All developed nations in the world without exception achieved industrialization at the same time as they underwent urbanization. Today those countries are about 80 percent urbanized, above 90 percent in Britain and the United States. In developing nations, the figure is 40 percent or so. In China the extent of urbanization is only 28 percent. (Footnote 1) The ratio between industrial output value and agricultural output value is now 7.5:2.5, in contrast to the 3:7 recorded in the early days of the PRC. At the same time, however, the balance between the urban population and rural population remains stuck at 2:8, a unique phenomenon in the world. Apart from a soaring birth rate, this state of affairs was mainly caused by the fact that for many years in the past, industrialization in China took place independently of urbanization in an environment of mutual urban/rural isolation. Through the exchange of unequal values between industry and agriculture, between the city and the countryside, agriculture provided urban industrial development with a steady flow of accumulated funds. Meanwhile, the permanent residence registration system, food supply system, employment system, education, health care, and insurance system worked to keep large numbers of workers in the countryside, further skewing the existing dual social structure. China has now put together a full line-up of industries, but the failure of urbanization to catch up with industrialization has saddled the nation with a heavy social burden. Modernization in China is comparable to a hobbling pony with a big cart hitched up to it. Already the "rural migrant upsurge" reflects the social crisis brought on by the lag in urbanization. II. The "rural migrant upsurge" has disrupted and impacted China's economy in ways profound and varied. On the positive side: 1) It has spurred the economic development of cities and developed areas. By leaving their villages and taking jobs or engaging in business elsewhere, redundant rural workers have made good the labor shortages in migrant-importing areas, thereby aiding their economic construction with low-cost labor. Nowadays a host of peasant workers are heavily involved in a range of fields, including urban construction, the textile industry, transportation, commerce, the catering industry, and domestic services, making themselves indispensable to the effective operations of the cities. Most peasant workers are employed in jobs that involve hard tiring work in filthy conditions. They satisfy the labor demand in those lines of work and fill the gaps in the lineup of industries of the host locations, at the same time making the lives of local residents easier. A leading comrade on the agricultural commission of Guangdong Province once commented that the contributions made by male and female workers from other provinces to the economy of Guangdong should be written into history. 2) Rural migrants bring back to their villages funds, technology, information, and managerial experience, injecting new doses of energy into the rural economy. Studies show that peasant migrants from the six provinces of Sichuan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui alone generated 25 billion yuan in incomes for their villages in 1992. Even more significant, peasant migrants become more conscious of the market economy and have a chance to broaden their outlook, overhaul their thinking, and improve their quality. 3) Migrant workers have relieved the competition for jobs in migrant-exporting areas and created the conditions for the introduction of scale management in agriculture. In China, a populous nation with little land, land has been operated on a small scale with limited efficiency, which has become the principal impediment to the modernization of agriculture. The only way to modernize Chinese agriculture is to channel the surplus labor into the secondary and tertiary industries and introduce scale management. After taking up jobs or going into business elsewhere for many years, some peasants are eager to contract out their land, creating a rare opportunity for the circulation and concentration of land and the application of scale management to land. If only we take effective measures and provide proper guidance, the scale management of land will be accelerated. Undeniably, the current interregional migration of rural workers has also inevitably caused a string of social problems. For starters, it has intensified the pressure on the transportation system and heightened the demand for urban infrastructural facilities and services essential to daily life. According to statistics compiled by the Ministry of Railways, railroads across the nation carried an average of 3.2 million passengers daily between late January and early February this year, an increase of 300,000 over the daily average for the 15-day period before the Spring Festival. Of the total number of passengers, 74 percent were rural migrants. The excessive increase in passenger traffic meant reduced freight transport capacity. Secondly, rural migrants have put social law and order under enormous strains. Many criminals have found their way into the army of rural workers on the move and disrupt law and order. Thirdly, the lack of effective ways to manage the floating population also means a loss of control over this segment of the population as far as family planning is concerned. III. The effective operation of the socialist market economy requires the free circulation of elements of production, including labor, between different industries and different localities. In this sense, the inter-regional movement of rural workers and the resultant rural migrant upsurge have their raison d'etre and inevitability. For this reason, we cannot hope to solve the inter-regional movement of rural workers, particularly the rural migrant upsurge, simply by blocking it; it is not to be blocked. A few years ago many cities had these migrants surrounded, tried chasing them away, or kept them out; however, the migration of rural workers has never been totally banned. As a special form of the movement of rural manpower, the rural migrant upsurge will remain part of the overall industrialization and urbanization of the Chinese countryside. We should be fully prepared ideologically for this and respond with the right policy. Making the most of the situation, we should lower the costs to the individual and society of the interregional movement of labor and the risks associated with it, thus minimizing the negative impacts of the rural migrant upsurge. In dealing with the "rural migrant upsurge," we must adhere to the principle of "tackling both the underlying cause of a disease as well as its symptoms" and choose the appropriate strategy based on what the main problem is at a given time in a given place. In the near term, our principal strategy should be to eliminate the haphazardness and spontaneity of interregional labor movement and make such movement more orderly and better organized by nurturing a labor market and creating a new mechanism for the circulation of labor. Specifically: 1) The government should step up the macroguidance and coordination of the interregional movement of rural labor. The central government should set up an authoritative body devoted exclusively to the macromanagement of the interregional movement of labor or put an existing agency in charge of such management. The duties and functions of the new body should include: Gathering, analyzing, and disseminating data on the labor markets in the migrant-importing and migrant-exporting areas; balancing labor supply with labor demand on a regional basis; and drawing up policies, laws, and regulations to promote and protect labor movement. Level 1 provinces, particularly the principal labor-importing and labor-exporting areas, should set up inter-regional labor coordination centers and begin active cooperation in labor matters. By entering into inter-provincial labor cooperation with eight provinces and regions including Sichuan, for instance, Guangdong has moderated the flood of rural workers pouring into it from the eight provinces and regions. This it accomplished by providing information on the job market in Guangdong and intensifying market guidance. 2) A mighty effort should be made to develop a variety of intermediate labor service organizations, gradually forming a socialized service system that includes information dissemination, consulting, job referral, and training. Such a system is critical to broadening the scope of market regulation and lowering the costs and risks of the de-agriculturalization of rural manpower. Intermediate organizations, particularly job-referral centers, should allow and even encourage private groups and individuals to go into business on their own. China has a vast pool of surplus labor; the government alone cannot be relied upon to solve the whole problem by itself. But government departments can play a leading role in providing information and consulting services. Nobody makes money providing these services, yet they do a lot of social good. Most private organizations have neither the capability nor the will to provide those services. By making full use of existing organized resources and information tools, government agencies, in contrast, are in a position to collect and transmit authoritative information on the supply and demand of labor. 3) Regional labor supply-demand exchanges should be set up at major transportation hubs and in the leading cities of areas in demand of labor. A labor supply-demand exchange, on the one hand, will bring together the two parties at either end of the labor supply-demand equation as well as intermediate organizations. Its operations may also help identify wage levels and obtain and transmit information. 4) Law- and regulation-making should be accelerated as appropriate and the management of the labor market must be improved, including the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of the workers, hiring enterprises, and intermediate organizations, as well as the regulation of their conduct; the preservation of fair market competition; and the effective management of the floating population through the introduction of a registration system for workers entering or leaving a jurisdiction, for instance. In the long haul, solving the problem of rural worker migration at its root entails, for one thing, the inclusion of the issue of rural employment into the scope of national economic and social development planning and the elevation of the realization of full employment in the countryside to a major policy goal for governments at all levels. Secondly, it involves searching for a path to rural industrialization and a rural labor de-agriculturalization model suited to China's national conditions. To do so is to stem the rural migrant upsurge at its source. Rural industrialization is an inescapable stage in China's modernization. Taking a lesson from successful industrialization in countries around the world, particularly industrialized nations, and bearing in mind what we have learned from the course of industrialization in China itself since the founding of the PRC, rural industrialization in this nation should include the following basic elements and requirements: 1) Township and town enterprises were and remain the principal vehicle for rural industrialization in China as well as the main conduit through which the rural work force leaves agriculture for other sectors of the economy. Already by late 1992 township and town enterprises had absorbed 108 million workers. In more recent years, though, with technological advances accelerating in township and town enterprises, the trend of capital replacing labor has become increasingly more notable and labor absorption has slowed. How can township and town enterprises continue to absorb large numbers of redundant workers while maintaining fast growth? The key is to find the right technological mix and create the right industrial structure based on the resource situation and economic conditions. As far as technological mix is concerned, because China has an ample labor supply but little funds, township and town enterprises should remain predominantly labor-intensive for many years to come. This is the fund-accumulating business start-up stage when enterprises should substitute capital with labor to the greatest extent possible and increase employment opportunities. Such a development no doubt will have positive practical implications for most areas in China, particularly those in south and central China. We are not ruling out the possibility of developed areas and some enterprises taking the lead in upgrading the industrial structure or technological mix ahead of others. As for the industrial structure, special emphasis should be put on the development of the agricultural byproducts processing industry and the tertiary industry so as to reverse the trend of growing structural convergence between township and town enterprises and urban industry, and optimize industrial distribution. At present the agricultural byproducts processing industry accounts for less than 20 percent of the gross agricultural output value, while the corresponding figures in developed nations usually double or triple that. Rising living standards among urban and rural households in the future will translate into bright and growing prospects for the agricultural byproducts processing industry. The size of the tertiary sector as a share of the national economy reflects the degree of modernization of a nation. In a developed country, the tertiary sector makes up 60 to 70 percent of domestic output; in a developing nation, between 35 and 40 percent on the average; and in China, 27 percent, including a mere 14 percent in the countryside. Any substantial expansion of the tertiary sector will greatly increase job opportunities. 2) Industrialization in China should take the road of appropriate concentration so that rural industrialization and rural urbanization will proceed in tandem with each other. Concentrated distribution economizes on land resources and investments in the infrastructure. With concentrated distribution, we can also make the most of regions, create a "critical mass" effect, and build up urban centers from which funds and technology can flow to the surrounding areas. Even more important, concentrated distribution helps spur the formation and development of cities, stimulate the growth of the tertiary sector, and close the gap between the city and the countryside characteristic of a dual social structure. The majority of China's township and town enterprises are widely scattered among the countless villages and hamlets and are closely interwoven into the fabric of their rural communities. The result is a pattern of distribution in which "every little village has its own enterprise." This fragmented pattern of distribution is the product of a specific set of social and economic conditions, primarily the support in the form of cheap land and low-cost labor an enterprise could derive from its community and other people connected to it by blood or local ties. This kind of support is often of critical importance to a fledgling enterprise. Needless to say, the drawbacks of fragmented distribution are obvious. For one thing, it is immensely wasteful of land resources. Secondly, these enterprises have little access to information and are not located on major transportation routes. The web of relationships and ties within rural society and communal administrative interference combine to push up business costs to an excessive level. Thirdly, the fragmented distribution of township and town enterprises does nothing to bring about a modernized industrialized society or create an industrial civilization while retarding urbanization. A communal rural society lacks the environment and conditions conductive to the formation of a modern enterprise system. For this reason, once they have grown and matured, enterprises do their best to congregate in townships, freeing themselves from the restraints of communal interests and achieving external economies. Given the conditions in China, concentrated distribution and fragmented distribution will continue to coexist in the future. In the vast interior, especially south and central China, the development of township and town enterprises is still inseparable from communal support. In the long run, however, concentrated distribution will replace fragmented distribution to become the dominant model for rural industrialization and the de-agriculturalization of rural labor in China. Governments at all levels should create conditions for the relative concentration of township and town enterprises to make sure that rural industrialization and urbanization proceed at the same pace. Henceforth township and town enterprises may develop revolving around cities. In view of the fact that large cities in China are already severely overcrowded, most township and town enterprises should be concentrated in small and medium-sized cities, county towns, and their surrounding core market towns. Urbanization being a gradual process, we must be careful not to over-build with no regard to the circumstances. A workable method is to take the county as the unit and single out for special assistance a number of selected townships or market towns that have a geographical, economic, or human-resource edge. Scientific planning should also be practiced. 3) Gradually reform the dual permanent residence registration system that separates the city from the countryside, thereby creating the conditions for the free movement of labor between industries, between the city and the countryside, and between regions, and for the formation of a unified nation-wide labor market. A permanent residence registration system that divides the city from the countryside does not satisfy the requirements of the development of a modern market economy. Under that system, being a peasant or a city resident becomes hereditary, something passed from one generation to the next. The possibility of a peasant becoming a city resident is almost non-existent, fundamentally blocking the road leading to the urbanization of the rural population and impeding the free movement of labor between the city and the countryside and from one region to another. For this reason, the existing irrational permanent residence registration system must be reformed and ultimately abolished. Considering China's national conditions and the countless contradictions accumulated through the years, we must reform the permanent residence registration system in stages in order of priority. In the short haul, we must first deregulate residence registration in the seats of county towns and rural townships. Peasants should be allowed to raise funds among themselves to build a township where they should be free to settle down. Moreover, permanent residence registration management should be significantly relaxed in small and medium-sized cities. Since a majority of small and medium-sized cities in China have not reached an appropriate scale, the absorption of some peasants will help them boost their economies of scale tremendously. Thirdly, deregulate in a small way some industries in large cities so as to make good the labor shortages in those trades that involve hard and tough work amid filthy conditions and accelerate the rationalization of the urban economic structure. Fourthly, apply a flexible residence registration system to the floating population in order to solve some of its problems, such as having more children than allowed and order-and-order problems. Regarding rural workers who have signed contracts lasting over a year with hiring units elsewhere, we must allow their residence registration to move with them and go where they go. They should register as temporary residents of the jurisdiction where their jobs are located and submit to the management of the local authorities and receive social welfare in accordance with the law.
