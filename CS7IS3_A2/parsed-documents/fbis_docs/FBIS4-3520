Then most villagers did not support cooperative companies because they feared that the establishment of these companies meant returning to egalitarianism, known in China as "sharing porridge out of the same big pot." However, the mill, called Yingnan Paper Mill, turned out to be a complete success, as it has scored an annual increase of 400 percent in terms of output value and profits. To date, the first eight partners have assets worth 250,000 yuan each. The mill has introduced a standard managerial system under which its funds are raised by villagers, and shareholders are responsible for its operation, draw dividends on schedule and cover its risks. As a result, the joint stock cooperative system has been mushrooming in Caozhuang village and has become the biggest source of income for villagers. A village head said that Caozhuang now has 51 cooperative businesses, with shares totalling 40 million yuan. In 1993 the net income of each villager was 1,500 yuan, 70 percent of which came from dividends, he added. An Anhui Provincial Government official said that Anhui currently has 23,000 such businesses, 6,000 of which were set up in 1993. Lu Rongjing, secretary of the provincial committee of the Chinese Communist Party, has asked local party and government officials to speed up the spread of such system, in a move to invigorate the rural economy and increase farmers' incomes. The official said that Fuyang Prefecture, which used to be the least developed area in Anhui, is both a pioneer and a pacesetter in instituting the system. Prefectural authorities have chosen a number of township-run factories to try out the system by standardizing their operation and clearly defining their property rights. The prefecture currently has 14,000 cooperative enterprises owned by 100,000 shareholders, the official said. These enterprises manufactured 1.5 billion yuan worth of goods in 1993. Hu Yingchen, a farmer in Mengcheng county, administered by Fuyang Prefecture, turned his private building materials factory on the verge of bankruptcy into a cooperative company owned by 230 shareholders. The company has become a "superstar" enterprise with an annual output exceeding 10 million yuan. The official said that farmers can now also contribute their skills, land and raw materials as shares in rural enterprises, which have also attracted investors from urban areas. Anhui provincial authorities are helping most township-run businesses introduce the cooperative system to meet the needs of a market economy, he said, adding that most newly-founded enterprises are joint stock cooperative companies. Various government departments are taking measures to help introduce and standardize the system, he said.
