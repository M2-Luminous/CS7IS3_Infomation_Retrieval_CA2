FR940719-1-00074 FR940719-1-00015 Paragraph (b) of the proposal specifies the means by which the representative of miners would have input to the review process. Under the proposal, the representative of miners may submit comments on the proposed plan or revision to the district manager for consideration. Recognizing that in some instances a decision relative to the approval or denial of a revision must be made in a short timeframe, the proposal would require that comments be made in a timely manner. The Agency does not define ``timely manner'' but would construe it to be a period of time that would not delay the approval process. Recognizing the importance of miners' input, the district manager will continue to be available to discuss with the representative of miners all aspects of the plan as they affect miners' health and safety following approval or denial of a proposed plan or revision. MSHA solicits comments on this approach. Paragraph (c)(1) of the proposed standard would continue the requirement of the existing regulation that the district manager notify the operator in writing of the approval or denial of a proposed plan or proposed revision. Additionally, it is proposed in paragraph (c)(1) that a copy of this notification be sent by the district manager to the representative of miners. This approach is being proposed to assure that the representative of miners is kept informed of the progress of the plan approval from submission to final action. In order to assure that the miners themselves, as well as the representative of miners, are aware of the provisions of the ventilation plan once it is approved, the proposal under paragraph (f)(1) would require that the operator provide the representative of miners with a copy of the plan or revision following notification of approval. Also, the proposal would continue in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) the existing requirements that the approved plan or revision be made available for inspection by the representative of miners and be posted on the mine bulletin board. Under a new requirement in proposed paragraph (f)(3), an approved plan or revision would be required to be posted within 1 working day of notification of the approval and would remain posted for the entire period that the plan is in effect. Section 75.371␣Mine Ventilation Plan; Contents The Agency proposes to revise paragraphs (b), (s), (z) and (bb) and to repropose paragraph (r) of this standard. The proposal would revise existing paragraph (b) to add language that reflects the proposed changes in paragraphs (c) and (d) of §75.312 allowing alternative testing methods for main mine fan automatic closing doors and fan signals. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of §75.312 would require that an operator wishing to use an alternative method to stopping the main mine fan have the alternative method approved in the ventilation plan. MSHA proposes to revise paragraph (s) to conform to proposed §75.362(d)(1)(iii). The proposal would delete the portion of existing §75.362(d)(2) requiring, in the approved ventilation plan, the location of tests which are to be made closer to the working face than the last permanent roof supports using extendable probes or other acceptable means. Proposed (d)(1)(iii) would require that the ventilation plan specify the frequency of the methane tests if required more often than 20 minutes by §75.362(d)(1)(iii). It would also require that the ventilation plan specify the location of these tests; e.g., ``in the working places on section MMU No. 123,'' or in ``the working places off first right off of east mains.'' MSHA proposes to revise paragraph (z) to conform to proposed §75.364(a). Paragraph (a) of the proposed §75.364 would modify the requirements addressing the measurements to be made to evaluate the effectiveness of bleeder systems and the ventilation of worked-out areas during the weekly examination. The measurement of air quantity, as well as the other measurements required by the existing standard, are essential to the proper evaluation of the ventilation of the worked-out area and the effectiveness of bleeder systems. It is proposed that the locations where these measurements will be made or alternative methods of providing these evaluations be included in the ventilation plan.
