The matters concerning the ways of Azeri and, in prospect, Kazakhstani oil to Europe has yet to be considered. Russia suggests that oil should be shipped to the Black Sea's port of Novorossiysk and then by tankers to Europe. However, Turkey disagrees saying that this variant is oecologically dangerous. "We can not put at stake ten-million Stambul city", said the Ambassador Karamanoglu. Turkey as well as a number of the countries suggest that Azeri oil should be shipped to the port of Iskenderun (Mediterranean Sea) through the oil pipe-line and then by tankers to Europe. Azerbaijan insists on laying the pipe-line through Iran, Nakhichevan and Turkey.
