In all, it has 50 impoverished counties with a population of 8.5453 million, which occupies 45.5 percent of the province's 110 agricultural counties. Scattered throughout such areas as Taihang, Taiyue, Hengshan, and Zhongtiao, it constitutes 29.3 percent of Shanxi's total population of 29,418,600. For many years, the Shanxi Provincial Committee and the provincial government have adopted a series of major and important measures intended to develop the economies of the impoverished counties, but the average income in 1991 was still less than 300 yuan, which was 47.2 percent lower than the provincial average. In addition, 20 percent of the peasants still have been unable to resolve the problem of getting enough to eat or warm clothing to wear. Looking into the reasons, we see that in addition to the restrictions of climate, water resources, traffic, and production type, backwardness of family planning work is an important factor. While this backwardness is due to a very large degree to insufficient comprehensive handling by relevant departments and various other sectors of society. [passage omitted] Major Characteristics of Family Planning Work in the Impoverished Areas 1. A higher birth rate, with a more rapid population increase. The fourth census showed that the birth rate in Shanxi's 50 impoverished counties was up to 25.18 per 1000, which was 12.9 percent higher than the provincial average for the same period. The highest birth rate was in Baode county, which reached as high as 31.23 per 1000. In 1992, based on a population survey by the provincial Bureau of Statistics, the birth rate in the 50 impoverished counties was 21.23 per 1000, which was still 8.4 percent higher than the average level for Shanxi. In addition, the natural population rate of increase in the impoverished areas was very high: it was 18.23 per 1000 in the fourth census and 14.29 per 1000 in 1992, which was, respectively, 2.17 and 1.64 per 1000 higher than the provincial average for the same period. 2. The high gross female fertility rate. In 1989, the gross female fertility rate in the 50 impoverished counties was 3.27, which was 0.81 higher than the provincial average. Among these, there were 31 counties in which the gross female fertility rate was more than three with Ji County having the highest rate, 4.398. In Daning and Fengxi Counties, it was up to 4.259 and 4.123, respectively. Based on our recent investigation, 1992's gross female fertility rate in the 50 impoverished counties was still steady at three, with no decrease. 3. The rate of family planning and a high rate of multiple births. According to figures from the fourth census, the multiple birth rate in the 50 impoverished counties was up to 34.8 percent, with the highest being 50.3 percent in Pu County; it was close to 50 percent in Fengxi, Zhongyang, and Baode Counties. Although these counties were listed as key control counties by the provincial committee and government, the recent investigation showed that its multiple birth rate was still holding at 20 percent, and in some towns and villages was still higher than 30 percent. Countering this is the fact that the family planning rate in the impoverished areas tends to be low; in 1990, the family planning rate in the 50 counties was 40.4 percent, and in 1992, it was 43.9 percent. Both of these figures were obviously lower than that for all rural areas in Shanxi. 4. A low rate of late marriages and late births, and a high rate of early marriages and births. [passage omitted] Based on close monitoring by relevant departments, only about 20 percent of young men and women persist in late marriage and births voluntarily, and only about 15 percent of newly married couples practice later births. Under the domination of traditional custom, the phenomenon of early marriage, early childbearing, and illegal marriages were quite popular. It was shown that, in ten concentrated impoverished counties in Xinzhou, nine counties on Lulian Mountain and six counties on Xi Mountain in Lingfeng, the early marriage rate for women has risen to 21.8 percent from 17.6 percent at the time of the fourth census. The early childbearing rate for women has also risen to 19.7 percent from 15.3 percent at the time of the fourth census, and in a few individual places, the early marriage and early childbearing rate even went over 30 percent. [passage omitted] The Current Situation Regarding Comprehensive Handling of Family Planning Work in the Impoverished Areas What we refer to as comprehensive handling of family planning work is, under the united leadership of Party committees at various levels and governments, to inspire, organize, and coordinate various powers throughout the whole of society, confirming the division of labor into each relevant department's position and responsibility. Its objective is to control the increase in population, improve the quality of the population, exploit every advantage, take responsibility for each position, control each link, jointly manage, to create a population situation with is favorable for building the economy and developing society. We can examine the current situation of comprehensive handling of family planning in Shanxi's impoverished areas from two aspects: 1. Basic methods A. The leadership, organization, and coordination functions are carried out well by the various organs of committee and government. Ten years ago, some prefectures, counties, towns, villages (residents' committees) all established leading groups for population and family planning work, which consisted of departments of organization, personnel, popularization, education, culture, labor, civil affairs, health, disciplinary examination, supervision, as well as departments and groups for workers, youth and women, etc. These were actually the local leadership organs for comprehensive handling of family planning work, implementing their authority in leadership, organization, and coordination. In many localities, the leadership group also established rules and systems for comprehensive handling of family planning, confirming and regulating the division of labor among each relevant department's position and responsibility, and these were published in formal documents for operations. We must applaud the issuance of these documents and rules, and the positive role they played in promoting local family planning work at that time. Meanwhile, family planning leadership organizations at various levels resolved many difficult problems in family planning work by means of major leaders being personally on the scene, holding coordination meetings, brief meetings, and associated meetings, etc. B. The new framework for devoting the whole society to a unified control has been formed initially. Popularization and media departments, which include propagation, education, culture, radio, television, film, and the Party school have all played definite roles in propagating family planning, basic national policy, educating masses of peasants, and changing people's opinions regarding marriage and fertility. Disciplinary and law enforcement departments, including organization, personnel, labor, discipline examination, supervision, public security, law enforcement, procuratorial work and courts, have assumed certain responsibilities in strictly controlling cadres. This includes their promotion, initiating Party members, employment, discovering and handling excessive births and excessive pregnancies among Party cadres and employees. They also attack people and matters which damage family planning work and forcibly enforcing the policy with "nail families" and "nut families" who have had excessive births; major administrative departments, including industrial and commercial, civil affairs, urban construction, insurance, revenue and expenditures, auditing, etc. have all performed certain functions in supporting family planning work; functional departments including planning, statistics, health, family planning, etc., have all made massive contributions to enforcing the population plan, supervising implementation policies, supply services, adopting birth control measures, etc. So we can say, the framework for handling family plan work in impoverished areas has been initially formed. C. The single-vote denial system for family planning has been implemented to a certain degree. In order to implement the basic national policy for family planning, some Party and administrative departments in the impoverished areas have implemented the single-vote denial system to a certain degree and scope. For example, in Liuling County, of only 40-some cadres promoted in the past year, 15 had their eligibility cancelled because of excessive births; when the education department was involved in converting compensated volunteer teachers to regular State employees, 18 of these people were turned down for family planning reasons; the land department denied approval to 57 excessive birth counters' land applications for housing construction; the operations management department took back grain rationed land and contracted land from 265 families with excessive births. In addition, some localities combined the single-vote denial system with such matters as small valley management, orchard contracting, extension of credit, competition in submitting tenders, etc. There is no doubt that these steps played a positive role in family planning work in the impoverished areas. D. Some counties and towns have issued a series of social and economic policies favorable to family planning work. In recent years, in accordance with the Central Party and government's spirit of family planning "decisions", many impoverished areas have put developing the economy and controlling the population in the same position of importance, linked them with the actual situation of the localities, and issued some social and economic policies which were favorable to family planning work. Some examples: in Shelou County, when the small valley management policy was published, the ability to practice family planning was factored in, which resulted in favorable treatment for over 2,000 families; Lang County took as its overall concept "possessing land, this life resource, blocking the big mouth of excessive births", to favor family planning families in contracting for reserve land, uncultivated land, etc., through the means of providing subsidies, while implementing advance penalties for families with excessive births, before they were allowed to cultivate the land. This program has been obviously successful. Liuling County has linked poverty assistance closely with family planning: when they fixed policy and rules for arranging poverty assistance capital, verified with poverty assistance counters, and taking family planning into consideration, implemented the "six favorites" rule for family planning families; Long County started from "two favorites" angle, to implement a project to provide health care for women and children and compensation for lost service, which was welcomed by the masses; of six towns in Xin County, Yangjipo, Xiaojiawa, and Donghui, favored family planning families in contracting for orchards, making them models for how to get rich quickly by having fewer children. All of these were beneficial to family planning work in the improvished areas. 2.Major problems While approving accomplishments and accumulating experiences, we must realize that in the process of comprehensive handling of family planning in impoverished areas, there are still many problems, which can be summarized chiefly as: A. Some grass-roots Party and government major leaders have a tendency to "pay attention to the economy and ignore family planning work". Some counties and towns' major Party and government leaders are usually busy with projects, applying for capital, conducting negotiations, and operating enterprises, while putting little energy into family planning work. The time they can personally devote to coordinating conflicts between family planning and other departments is even less. In some localities there are individual leaders who don't concern themselves with family planning work at all, which causes family planning work to always be in a backward status. This tendency to "pay attention to the economy and ignore family planning work" is extremely detrimental to population control in the impoverished areas, and deserves immediate attention. C. The work which related departments do in support of family planning work is stuck in the negative situation of "moving only when pushed". Our investigation disclosed that although there were no obvious "collisions" occurring in family planning work when related departments fixed policies and rules in impoverished areas, there was always a problem of one kind or another in implementing policies. For example, on the issue of promoting cadres, admitting them to Party membership, the family planning situation is not taken into consideration before observation and examination of excessive birth counts; it is only after everything is set that they let the family planning department express any opinions on the matter, which forces the family planning to prepare for it in a rush. When implementing measures designed to encourage the single child family, some departments and work units have often failed to cash in by making the excuse that fund were short. When punishing excessive birth counters, some units deferred dealing with the situation until receiving a communication from the family planning department,and some units don't even apply the penalties then. When doing work in support of family planning work, some units have partial achievements along with partial failures. For example, it is common for health departments to undertake a considerable number of the "four kinds of operations", but there have also been a great many complications and fake operations. They judged the sex of the embryo by means of B supersonic (wave) which causes a massive amount of psychological confusion, more of a hindrance than a help. The illogical distribution system regionally also is a problem. Since the implementation of the production responsibility system, with the cultivated land divided into two parts--the grain ration land and the responsible contracted land--the former is allocated according to number of family members, and the latter according to number of people in the labor force, but some places allocated lands totally according to number of family members. When allocating disaster relief materials or money, the civil affairs department bases their allocations on number of family members. In this distribution system, more family members means more cultivated land, which strengthens the peasants' desire for early births, multiple births, and having boys. In addition, most departments only worked on the framework of family planning work. When dealing with circulating population, the public security and the industrial and commercial departments completed their work after checking certification regardless of whether it was true or false that the applicants would have multiple births later on. Law enforcement officers often fall back on excuses such as: there are too many procedures, the measures are too complicated, or they lack proof to not strictly enforce the law on "nail families" and "nut families" of excessive births. They cannot deal effectively with cases of abuse or beatings of family planning cadres; they have let the perpetrators go scot-free, with extremely bad effects. When issuing marriage certifications, the civil affair departments have not strictly enforced age limitations, plus there has always been the possibility of "relationship certification" and "friendship certification". They have shown a lack of enthusiasm and energy in encouraging marriages and births at a later age, abandoning "two later" education among young men and women. There have been some departments doing more verbal and written work in family planning, but little of an operational nature. When dealing with Party members and cadres who violate discipline, some disciplinary examination and supervision departments have only discussed the matter but not done anything. Personnel and labor departments did not practice what they announced they would do in employing, accepting new cadres, and in raising wages and promoting employees. Cultural, broadcasting, motion picture, and television departments have very few programs which propagate family planning ideas. C. The system of encouragements, rewards, and penalties in family planning is an "unhealthy situation". In the impoverished areas, family planning's measures of rewards and penalties hardly work. On the one hand, in most places, there are no rewards at all, the so-called preferential treatment of having only one child with even a five yuan health care fee for an only child is something that cannot be cashed. However, they would rather spend money on encouraging sterilization for excessive birth parents. On the other hand, it was only symbolic in their collection of social care fees from excessive birth parents. In impoverished areas, it is common to find the phenomena of no penalties, penalty replacement, penalty reduction, penalties which are difficult to collect or not collected at all. Some village cadres adopt the method of using fines instead of ligature in order to operate their sterilization work which actually creates a penalty free situation. Some excessive birth families cannot afford the penalty fee due to family poverty, so village cadres have to let them repair roads, plant trees, and cultivate uncultivated land, and call it penalty replacement. Many villages charge only five or six yuan for a second birth; even for multiple excessive births, they only charge something over 100 yuan, and call it a minor penalty; some excessive birth parents roam about or cause trouble, beyond the reach of village cadres' power; also the latter dare not take forceful measures, and this is called a difficult penalty. Some family planning cadres did not concern themselves with family planning work for long periods of time, which led to a great many excessive births, and formed a protective circle for excessive birth parents: If they punished one of them, it would anger a group of them, so in the end they didn't charge penalties at all. All of these basically had no economically restricting function. D. There are some "blank points" in family planning work about which no one seems concerned. Early marriages, early births, unmarried couples, the rate of these are quite high in impoverished areas, and is tending to expand. This has a very great effect on family planning work, but there is no department dealing with this--that is one point. The geographical region from which the marriage partners come is extremely small, they do not have a premarital health examination, and there is no guarantee of a woman's "three items" of health care. There are still some individual places where intermarriage of close relatives exists, and there are very serious instances of marriage among retarded people or people with hereditary diseases. These are detrimental to improving population quality--this is the second point. We call these: "blank points". E. There is a tendency for less and less in the social restriction system which is favorable to family planning. In the new situation of the socialist market economy, some new situations and problems are appearing in the family planning social system. One is that since opening up the grain price, the original urban residence card has lost its original meaning, and the restriction system of a grain residence card which was exploited by family planning departments doesn't exist. Another is that when contracting enterprises, stores, orchards, lands, uncultivated lands, etc., competition depends on how much you can put on the bid without any consideration of the family planning factor. A third is that strengthening the role of the family has increased the peasants' freedom, so that they think more about their family and individual profits, and less about national and collective profits. This is especially prominent in birth matters. [passage omitted]
