What has been notable in the political reform debates that have continued to go astray and remain disorderly for over five years is the turmoil in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. The underlying cause of this turmoil can be attributed to the irresponsible manner in which the two parties handled matters ever since the issue of political reform surfaced. In the case of the LDP, the party has shown a lack of consistency as it first started off with a plan to introduce an electoral system combining single-seat constituencies with proportional representation, called the "heiritsu" system, switching over to a plan to introduce a system with only single-seat constituencies during the administration of former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, only to revert to the original plan during the current Diet session. Probably, the real intentions of many LDP members are that "regarding political reform, the party is merely posing to appeal to public opinion and it really wants to maintain the current medium-size constituency system and continue receiving corporate donations." They also cannot help but admit that they have put together electoral reform and prevention of political graft as a single package to camouflage such intentions. Such is their insincerity that complicated the issue to such an extent. The LDP and SDPJ Have Failed To Serve Their Purpose The SDPJ has also been irresponsible regarding unifying differing opinions within itself. At the time when Makoto Tanabe served as SDPJ chairman, the party decided for the first time to adopt as its own plan the "heiyo" formula, an electoral system similar to that adopted in Germany which combines proportional representation with single-seat constituencies. However, the party failed to hold sufficient intraparty debate on the issue. Later, under the leadership of Sadao Yamahana, who succeeded Tanabe as SDPJ chairman, the party decided to change from the heiyo to the "renyo" formula [another electoral system proposed by a private council on political reform that combines single-seat constituencies with proportional representation], only to switch to the heiritsu system. In this way, the party has continued to act incoherently. Such lack of principle has forced the party to repeatedly make last-minute concessions. For example, it has had to agree to increase the number of single-seat constituencies from its originally proposed 250 to 274, then to 280, and finally to 300. The party has joined the coalition alliance on the condition that it would accept the heiritsu formula. This has resulted in adding fuel to intraparty conflicts. Nevertheless, the price the party has to pay for the lack of sufficient intraparty debate has shown up as mass dissension in the upper house. Honestly speaking, we must say that from the turmoil seen in both the LDP and the SDPJ during the current Diet session, the two parties are no longer serving their purpose as political parties. Even at the plenary sessions of both house of the Diet on the last day of the current session, dissatisfied members of both parties acted against their parties' decisions. Dissident upper house SDPJ members have set up a "Dietmen's group to hold informal talks on preventing political corruption," which strongly indicates the formation of a separate party within the party. We feel that if LDP and SDPJ members pretend to stay under their respective roofs, at least in form, they are trying to deceive the voters. The LDP was shocked when it was reported during the current Diet session that Michio Watanabe, one of the LDP strongmen, planned to leave the party. For that matter, we suggest the LDP take this opportunity to split into three groups: the Watanabe faction, pro-electoral-reformists, and those advocating taking a cautious stance on electoral reform. The SDPJ, too, should refreshen itself by splitting into two groups. The Broken Walls Between Political Parties The SDPJ is the largest among the coalition parties. Should the SDPJ split up, it would be a threat to the Hosokawa administration. However, even SDPJ dissidents do not want to see the LDP regain power. As long as the Hosokawa administration continues its public-opinion-oriented politics, there should be sufficient room to hope these dissidents may provide support to the government from outside the cabinet or take a neutral, but friendly stance. The underlying cause of turmoil in the current Diet session originates with the split in the LDP which occurred when a no-confidence motion against former Prime Minister Miyazawa was passed at the ordinary Diet session last June because LDP dissidents voted in favor of the motion. A general election was then held in July with new conservative parties making rapid advances, while the LDP and SDPJ suffered major setbacks. This was then followed by a crop of dissidents from the LDP and SDPJ who were dissatisfied with their parties' decisions on the political reform bills. Such repeated occurrence of cross-voting indicates that walls dividing political parties regarding ideologies and policies have now begun to crumble. The greatest contributing factor to bringing about this situation is the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the former Soviet Union. However, it can be said that structural changes in politics have converged not because of policy issues, but rather because of issues directly linked to the interests of individual Dietmen. Thinking in such terms, we can say that it was an inevitable phenomenon to see that the LDP and the SDPJ, which have served fixed roles as the ruling and opposition parties, respectively, under the Cold War structure, can no longer hold themselves together as political parties. To change the traditional political system under which the LDP and SDPJ played the main roles -- known as the "55-year structure" -- so that it can meet the needs of the times, the two parties must inevitably fall apart and regroup. Should the two parties split, it means there will continue to be a formation of a myriad of small political parties for some time to come. There may undoubtedly be political turmoil and instability. However, there is no need to magnify such problems out of proportion as long as there can be established a basic principle under which the nation can readily respond to international problems. This is a price the people must pay to establish a new political system. Pending Issues in Act III of the Regrouping of Political Parties Act I of the regrouping of political parties has already been staged with the LDP's split and the subsequent general election last year. The coalition government's formation and the confusion over the political reform bills constitute Act II, so to speak. In view of the implementation of a new electoral system, we should now expect to see political parties allying with each other, while individual politicians and would-be Dietmen look for parties they want to join. In Act III, what is important is for parties to clarify policies and assertions under which they plan to assemble and embark on the process of regrouping. Among both ruling and opposition parties, there currently exists a "corrupt" situation where a mixed group of politicians who hold differing views on ideologies and policies belong to the same parties. To resolve this problem and provide voters with options which are easily understandable is an important task in Act III. Should the political reform bills actually be implemented, the process of regrouping of political parties would be sharply accelerated. According to the new laws, political parties will receive public funds equivalent to each individual Japanese paying 250 yen. This brings up an issue in which voters would be linked to politics in a new way. It is only natural for each individual Japanese citizen to have great interest in the issue of how the political system should be reorganized. We have urged that "results be made on political reform no matter what it takes during the current Diet session." Now that the issue has been settled for the time being, we feel it satisfactory that our hopes have been fulfilled. When the political reform bills were put up for vote in the upper house, we urged that there be no fear about expected changes and that they be tentatively approved, although there still were many problems with the bills. However, the bills were rejected. Moreover, there was not much to be hoped for in the negotiations by the joint committee of both houses. Under such circumstances, lower house speaker Takako Doi and upper house speaker Bunbe Hara were called to help break the deadlocked situation. We praise the fact that, in the end, their efforts have been realized. However, doubts have been left as to how last-minute agreements were forged; that is, there are concerns that the fact that the bills should suddenly be revived in the form of agreements which differ in content from what was put up to a vote in both houses of the Diet -- even though this was done under mutual agreement between the ruling and opposition parties -- may set a bad precedent regarding future Diet steering. "Turnaround Agreement" Should Be Treated With Caution The gist of the accord, reached through a top-level meeting between Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono, includes the revival of key points of the LDP-proposed political reform bills which were rejected at the lower house plenary session. It has been decided that the number of seats in the single-seat constituencies would be increased to 300, and a fund-raising body would be designated to accept corporate donations to individual politicians. Thus, placing priority on having the bills enacted has resulted in having to agree to almost "swallow" LDP demands "in whole." At the beginning of the ceremony to sign the accord on the political reform bills, Hosokawa and Kono said: "We came to agreement on the understanding that an unhealable scar would be left on parliamentary democracy unless the political reform bills are enacted." Apparently, they have given consideration to public opinion which urged settlement during the current Diet session no matter what it takes. However, it cannot be ruled out that such a high-handed manner of forging agreements will not become a malpractice and be applied to other issues. We would like to point this out for the sake of the development of healthy parliamentary politics. Ms. Doi, who acted as a mediator between Hosokawa and Kono, has been generally acknowledged as an adamant supporter of the Constitution. However, since this issue concerns the basic principles of Diet steering, Ms. Doi should clarify her views when she finds a chance to do so. Fortunately, there still is opportunity to conduct deliberations on the date of implementing the political reform bills at the upcoming ordinary Diet session. It is hoped the Diet will be able to resolve such apprehensions.
