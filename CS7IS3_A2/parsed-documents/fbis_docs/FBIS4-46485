Shepovalenko based on foreign publications: "`The Great Wall of Steel' (Present Status and Prospects of Development of the PRC Navy)"] [Text] The Chinese People's Republic is one of the oldest sea powers, one possessing the experience and possibilities for building almost all classes of ships. It has also developed the concept of using its naval forces to defend national interests. The origins of the Naval Forces of the People's Liberation Army of China (VMS NOAK)--such is the official name of the Chinese naval fleet--date back to 1954, when the Soviet Navy started transferring submarines, destroyers, patrol escorts, minesweepers and torpedo boats to it. Some of these ships were assembled at Chinese ship building plants on the basis of our technical documents, and out of parts, structures, units and machine units we supplied. Later on the Chinese began copying a number of Soviet ship designs with the technical assistance of our specialists. This went on for almost a decade, which may be considered to be the first stage in development of Chinese warship construction. After Sino-Soviet relations "went cold" in the mid-1960's and our specialists were called back home, the Chinese leadership found itself facing the need for developing this sector of industry on its own. The period from the second half of the 1960's to the early 1980's is the second, transitional stage of the navy's development. It was characterized by construction of ships and submarines that were a further development of Soviet designs. The mid-1980's were marked by entry of Chinese ship building into its third, modern stage. Its typical traits are: a quest for new concepts, and extensive development and implementation of original designs of warships and auxiliary vessels of various classes. The "Program of Balanced Development of the Navy to the Year 2000" was developed in the PRC on the basis of the strategy of "coastal oceanic defense" adopted in 1989. Several programs are being implemented in parallel today in accordance with this strategy. Construction of submarines--both nuclear-powered and diesel-electric--is considered to be a priority direction in this case. Development and construction of "Xia" class SSBNs (type 092) is an important accomplishment of Chinese ship builders. It was laid down in 1978, and launched on 30 April 1981; however, difficulties arose later on in "perfecting" the missile system launching "Julang-1" SLBMs. The first launching of this missile from an experimental submarine in 1985 was unsuccessful, and it was not until September 1988 that a test launch was graced with success. This was, moreover, after the SSBN had already been introduced into the navy (Figure 1). Figure 1. "Xia" Class Nuclear-Powered Ballistic-Missile Submarine It is considered that the SLBM "Julang-1" (CSS-N-3 according to the Western classification) is outfitted with a single 2-megaton nuclear warhead. However, the level of development of Chinese missile technology, which was sufficient for the launching of three satellites to different orbits simultaneously by a single launch vehicle in 1981, provides the grounds for supposing that this SLBM may be fitted out with a multiple warhead. The possibility is not excluded that "Xia" class SSBNs will be re-armed in the second half of the 1990's with a new missile system launching "Julang-2" (CSS-NX-4) SLBMs, presently under development. Despite the fact that the "Xia" class SSBN is inferior to similar American, British, French and Russian submarines in level of technological execution and performance characteristics, its introduction into the navy marks the beginning of creation of the sea component of the triad of Chinese strategic nuclear forces. Deployment of SSBNs in the Yellow and East China seas significantly raises China's military potential, and can significantly influence the strategic situation in the Asia-Pacific region. It was believed for some time that the lead SSBN would be followed by three to five similar submarines to permit maintenance of a normal combat patrol cycle. However, the fact that this submarine is still the only ship of its class indicates that it is experimental, and that it is being operated in order to acquire experience in the combat use of naval nuclear forces, and to perfect the design to permit construction of a series of SSBNs of a new class (type 094). It is expected that they will possess 16 launchers for higher-range SLBMs, and that construction will begin in the second half of the 1990's. Construction of the "Han" class multipurpose nuclear-powered submarine (Figure 2), which was started in the first half of the 1970's, is continuing as well. There are presently five such submarines in the fleet's force composition. According to reports in the Western mass media a number of design shortcomings were revealed in the lead submarine of this class, including in the nuclear reactor reliability system. Also, its noise level was high, and the effectiveness of external lighting and weapon control systems was low. Consequently, improvements were made in ships of this class beginning with the third hull. The design of the propulsion unit was improved, "Ying-ji-1" anti-ship missile launchers firing from surfaced position were installed behind the bridge, and the sonar system was modernized, with the French DUUX-5 sonar system at its basis. However, feeling that launching anti-ship missiles from surfaced position would sharply increase the submarine's vulnerability, the command of the VMS NOAK is considering, as one of the priority directions in this issue, arming them with anti-ship missiles launched from torpedo tubes. According to reports in foreign military periodicals, Chinese representatives conducted negotiations with a number of Western companies with the goal of acquiring some weapon systems, state-of-the-art external lighting systems, and technical documents for their subsequent production under a license. They include the MINICIN inertial navigation system and the Pivair (SPS) periscope with conventional and infrared observation channels produced by France's Sazhem [transliteration], and a sonar system with a long towed antenna manufactured by America's Westinghouse. Of course, in view of aggravation of American-Chinese relations at the turn of this decade and the fear the Americans have of losing their technological leadership, conclusion of the last deal is rather problematic. Figure 2. "Han" Class Multipurpose Nuclear-Powered Submarine An orientation on the French SSBNs "Le Redoubtable" and "L'Inflexible" and "Rubis" class nuclear-powered submarines is noticeable in the design of "Xia" SSBNs and "Han" nuclear-powered submarines respectively. Similarities include the hull lines, the propulsion unit and propeller, and the arrangement of the weapon systems. And the choice of the external illumination and weapon control systems with which to modernize them, which are once again French-made, is another indication of continuing cooperation between the PRC and France in development of China's nuclear-powered submarine fleet. In this case, in addition to significant attention to building nuclear-powered submarines, in the opinion of Western specialists China's main efforts will be concentrated now and in the next decade on modernizing diesel-electric submarines, which represented 92 percent of the submarine forces of the VMS NOAK at the beginning of the present decade. The most numerous among them are the "Romeo" class submarines created on the basis of technical documents for the type 633 Soviet medium submarine. They were built in two large series: in the 1960's (type 031--the base modification ES3B) and in the first half of the 1980's (type 033, improved). However, these ships have also grown obsolete, and despite the fact that the more up-to-date French DUUX-5 sonar system was installed in the last submarines of the second series, in the estimation of specialists their ASW capabilities are rather limited on the whole. Moreover they are starting to be actively transferred to the reserves in connection with expiration of their useful life. Consequently, in the 1970's China began building new "Ming" class (type 035) submarines. In this case three submarines of the first modifications (ES5C and ES5D) of this class were built in 1970-1979. And such a slow pace of their creation permits the supposition that Chinese specialists encountered serious technical problems. This is also confirmed by the fact that construction of "Ming" class submarines was suspended for a certain time, and construction of "Romeo" class submarines was resumed. It was not until 1987 that construction of "Ming" class submarines was resumed, but only two such ships of the new ES5E modification were created. In the opinion of specialists this is associated with the fact that the "Romeo" submarine type long exhausted the possibilities for further modernization. Which is why a new submarine (type 039) is being planned. It is being developed on the basis of the French "Agosta" class submarine. Its construction and commissioning are possible in the second half of the 1990's. It is anticipated that its hull will have a drop shape, and its lines will resemble those of the "Albacore" class. While the main dimensions and displacement are comparable with "Ming" class submarines, there are plans to increase the radius of operations of the new submarine, its diving depth, its submerged speed and the power of the propulsion unit. The submarine will probably have a single shaft, which together with the improved hull lines will help to reduce its noise. By the way, although noise reduction occupies one of the important directions of work in Chinese submarine building, this is not a priority objective at this stage. This is explained by the fact that the relatively shallow and warm waters of the seas adjacent to the Chinese coast significantly complicate antisubmarine warfare, and thus significantly reduce the effectiveness of modern ASW forces of the navies of the world's leading countries in these regions. The current concept of the use of the VMS NOAK does not presently foresee the navy's emergence onto the ocean, which is something for the more remote future. Construction and commissioning of a number of surface ships of a new generation was typical of China in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Thus, the "Luhu" class guided missile destroyer (type 052), which was transferred to the navy in 1993, is the first ship of this class of specifically Chinese design. It is the most powerful warship ever in the force composition of the VMS NOAK. The destroyer is well armed in antiship and antisubmarine respects, including with antiship missile system launchers, as well as modern electronic systems. Design deficiencies include the relatively weak surface-to-air armament: Although the short-range Crotale Navale-PDMS surface-to-air missile system and four 37-mm twin H/PJ-76A guns provide reliable air defense for the ship, it still is point defense. It has a combined diesel and gas turbine propulsion unit, which together with the smooth hull lines and modern superstructure architecture significantly improves its seagoing qualities and endurance. According to the handbook Jane's Fighting Ships the lead ship will be followed by a second destroyer. The possibility is not excluded that construction of the series will end with this, and the operating experience will be accounted for in developing the design of a new guided missile destroyer in the second half of the 1990's. "Luda" class (type 051) guided missile destroyers are currently undergoing modernization, during which they are to be equipped with the French THOMSEA ASBU [automated tactical control system], which includes the TAVITAC BIUS [combat information command and control system] and the Vega missile and artillery fire control system. New radar and sonar, radiotechnical and ECM systems, a navigation system and a communication equipment outfit produced in China on the basis of licenses from a number of French firms are also to be installed (Figure 3). Figure 3. "Luda" Class Guided Missile Destroyers Destroyers ("Luda-III" class) are armed with new ASM systems--four twin launchers of the Ying-ji-1 ASM system (the bow twin launcher of the ASM system is adapted for launching SU-1 antisubmarine missiles). New 37-mm twin turret guns are installed in place of four 25-mm and four 57-mm deck guns. Antisubmarine armament was also reinforced with the installation of two 324-mm triple-tube type B515 torpedo launchers firing A244S torpedoes. New electronic equipment was also installed aboard the destroyer: a towed variable-depth sonar system, and airborne and surface target detection and fire control radar, developed on the basis of Western models. The stern 130-mm and 57-mm twin gun mounts on ships undergoing modernization under the "Luda-II" project are being dismantled, and replaced by a helicopter pad and a hangar for two Zhi-9A helicopters and a SAFECOPTER takeoff and landing support system. Construction of "Luda" class guided missile destroyers obviously came to an end with introduction of the "Zhuhai" guided missile destroyer into the force composition of the navy no later than 1993. Construction of new "Jiangwei" (type 055) guided missile escort ships is continuing. The lead ship was placed within the force composition of the navy in late 1992. In terms of the level of automation and availability of different weapon systems and electronic resources this escort ship is the most up-to-date ship of its class. It carries a six-container Hongqi-61M SAM system launcher (an improved version of the Hongqi-61 system). The aft Ying-ji-1 ASM launcher group is possibly adapted for launching SU-1 antisubmarine missiles. Another two "Jiangwei" class guided missile escort ships are presently in different stages of construction, and the series will number a total of four to six units. Beginning in the mid-1980's China started modernizing "Jianghu" class (type 053) guided missile escort ships. The hull structure was changed on escort ships modernized as the "Jianghu-III" version (type 053HT): A twin deck bearing four stationary Ying-ji ASM launchers was added; the number of 37-mm twin gun mounts was reduced from six to four. The outfit of electronic equipment was supplemented by a Chinese ASBU, a early-warning aerial observation radar, ASM system and universal-caliber artillery fire control radar, light AAA fire control radar, and radiotechnical and ECM systems. The lattice mast was replaced by a tower. There are presently two "Jianghu-III" class guided missile escort ships in the force composition of the VMS NOAK. In early 1993 a "Zhoushan" guided missile escort ship of the new "Jianghu-IV" modification was transferred to the navy. It differs from series "Jianghu-III" ships in having a somewhat altered ASM launcher, which is associated with adoption of a modified variant of the Ying-ji-1 ASM of greater firing range. The second guided missile escort ship of the "Jianghu-IV" class was launched in 1992. The guided missile escort ship "Siping", which was finished as the "Jianghu-II" version (type 053HT(H)), was transferred to the navy in 1986. Together with the "Luda-II" modification of the "Jinan" guided missile destroyer, it became the first helicopter-carrying escort ship within the VMS NOAK. The design of the ship's hull from the first ASM launcher to the stern was altered with the purpose of installing a helicopter pad and hangar: A helicopter deck was added, the second ASM launcher was dismantled, and the shape and height of the falshtruba [false stack?] were changed. Changes were made in the armament: A French one-barrel 100-mm Creusot Loire gun mount and two type ILAS triple-tube 324-mm torpedo launchers firing A244S torpedoes were installed. The outfit of electronic equipment was supplemented by the French NAJA electron-optic sight for fire control of the 100-mm gun mount, the SAFECOPTER helicopter takeoff and landing support system, and two launchers firing Mk.33 SRBOC passive jamming munitions. The ship carries one Zhi-9A helicopter. Modernization efforts on other "Jiangu" class guided missile escort ships of the basic plan have been limited up until now to replacement of the single-barrel 100-mm gun mounts by twin gun mounts of the same caliber, and installation of early-warning aerial observation radar, as well as fire control radar for two twin 100-mm guns. Fire control radar for four 37-mm twin gun mounts was installed aboard some ships. Modernization of the "Jiangdong" class (type 053K) guided missile escort ship was started in 1992. There are plans to install Western-made modern weapon systems and illumination resources or their Chinese analogues aboard these ships. New escort ships--the "Luhu" class guided missile destroyer and the "Jiangwei" class guided missile escort ships--were initially planned and built as helicopter carriers: The former carries two and the latter carries one Zhi-9A helicopters, which are the Chinese version of the French Dauphin-2 helicopter. The armament of the Zhi-9A helicopter includes Italian A244 antisubmarine torpedoes or American Mk.46 Mod.2 torpedoes, French HS-12 submersible sonar systems, and a magnetometer. The helicopter can be equipped with four ASM for action against surface ships. Two ship-based Ka-27 helicopters acquired in Russia were transferred to the navy in 1993 for testing and evaluation. If they exceed the Zhi-9A in their performance characteristics, China may purchase an additional lot of Russian helicopters, or the license to manufacture them. The "Houjian" class (type 520) small guided missile ship was built and transferred to the navy in July 1991. The new small guided missile ship carries strengthened missile and artillery armament, which is twice greater in comparison with existing classes of long-range warships. It is intended for action against surface ships on the outer perimeter of the seas contiguous with continental China. In the future it is to be outfitted with PL-9N close-range surface-to-air missile systems. From all appearances it is an experimental platform intended to study the problems of combat use of small guided missile ships and to check the effectiveness of new models of armament and equipment installed aboard them. The "Houxin" class (type 037-II) small guided missile ship is the missile variant of the "Haijui" class small ASW ship. The lead ship was placed in the force composition of the navy in 1991. There are five such small guided missile ships in the force composition today, and another three are in different stages of construction. The rate of construction is three ships a year. Introduction of such small guided missile ships into the navy will make it possible to partly compensate for transfer of obsolete "Hegu" and "Huoku" class missile boats and their subsequent retirement. In 1992 the navy began receiving LSM class small amphibious warfare ships of a new design. With a displacement of 600 tonnes, their loading capacity is 150 tonnes and they can be used to land personnel and tracked and wheeled equipment on an unimproved coast, and supply ammunition and provisions to troops. In distinction from small amphibious warfare ships built earlier, the ship's superstructure is shifted from the stern closer to the middle, which improved its controllability and seagoing qualities. The ship's artillery armament includes bow and stern 25-mm twin automatic guns. The cruising range is around 1,000 miles at a speed of 12 knots. It is anticipated that by the end of 1993 there will be not less than three small amphibious warfare ships of this class in the navy's force composition. By the second half of the 1980's the minesweeping forces of the VMS NOAK were considerably worn and obsolete. They now possess insignificant possibilities for laying and sweeping mines. Class T-43 (type 010) ocean minesweepers, built in China in the second half of the 1950's on the basis of Soviet technical documents, reached the limit of their useful life by the mid-1980's. And in connection with the absence of a new design of a mine warfare ship, the naval command decided to resume their construction. Beginning in 1988 the navy started receiving "Wosao" class coastal minesweepers. By now there are five coastal minesweepers of this class in the forces, and another three ships are in different stages of construction. The rate of construction is one ship a year. The new minesweeper carries two types of acoustic (sonic and infrasonic), electromagnetic and small contact sweeps, and it is armed with two 25-mm twin automatic guns. Its hull is made from steel with low magnetic properties. The coastal minesweeper can also be used as a harbor and a river minesweeper. It will replace the "Fushun" and "Lienyun" minesweepers, refitted correspondingly out of "Shanghai-II" patrol boats and fishing trawlers. The long-range plans for developing minesweeping forces foresee construction of a new class of mine warfare ships by the mid-1990's--minehunters. Chinese developments in this area are complicated by the absence of modern mine detection and sweeping resources, in connection with which Chinese specialists intend to turn to foreign developers. There are plans for basing the design on the Italian "Lerici" class minehunter. Nor is cooperation with England's Vosper Thornycroft excluded. Negotiations were conducted with it on this matter by the Chinese side in 1988. There are also plans to make foreign purchases of mine-seeking sonar and sweeping equipment with the right of its licensed production. In 1988 the "Bieliejian" class minelayer was transferred to the navy as the lead ship in a series of three units. With a displacement of over 1,000 tonnes, it has bow and stern mine holds, each of which is equipped with a crane, and side ports for the mine tracks are located on the stern transom. The artillery armament of the ship consists of four 37-mm twin gun mounts. Construction of the "Hainan" class small ASW ship (type 037), which began in 1963-1964, is continuing (it is based on our type 201 ASW launch). A number of changes were made in the basic design: The single mast was replaced by a tripod, a surface target detection radar was installed on it, and underwater illumination resources were supplemented with a French SS-12 variable-depth towed sonar system. A similar sonar system is also being installed aboard "Haujui" class (type 037-1) small ASW ships, which are a further development of the "Hainan" design. The numerical strength of fleet forces of the VMS NOAK is shown in the Table. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Fleet Forces of the VMS NOAK as of 1 January 1994 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ship Class and Ty-|Fleet Forces |Reserves |Under Constructio-| |pe | | |n (Modernization) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Warships of the M-|300 |Over 110 |10(1) | |ain Types | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Submarines: |36 |Over 51 |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"Xia" class SSBNs |1 |- |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"Han" class nucle-|5 |- |- | |ar-powered submar-| | | | |ines | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |diesel submarines |30 |Over 51 |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Surface Ships |264 |59 |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"Luhu" class guid-|1 |- |1 | |ed missile destro-| | | | |yers | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"Luda-III" class |1 |- |- | |guided missile de-| | | | |stroyers | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"Luda-II" |1 |- |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"Luda-I" |14 |- |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"Jiangwei" class |1 |- |1 | |guided missile es-| | | | |cort ships | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"Jianghu-IV" |1 |- |1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"Jianghu-III" |2 |- |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"Jianghu-II" |1 |- |(1) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Other classes |5 |1 |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Escort Ships |5 |- |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"Hojian" class sm-|1 |- |- | |all guided missil-| | | | |e ships | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"Houxin" class sm-|6 |- |2 | |all guided missil-| | | | |e ships | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Small ASW ships |97 |- |3 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Amphibious warfar-|63 |2 |- | |e ships | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Minesweeping ships|63 |56 |2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Combatant Craft: |Over 527 |Over 550 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Missile |Over 150 |Over 60 |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Torpedo |Over 90 |Over 50 |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Patrol |Over 127 |Over 240 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Amphibious warfare|Over 160 |Over 200 |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thus construction of warships of a new generation and modernization of ships within the force composition of the navy since the 1970's indicate transfer of the line of detection of the probable enemy and of fire effect upon him from coastal waters to the outer perimeter of the seas bathing continental China. However, in terms of their combat capabilities these ships still cannot be considered to be ocean-going ships. A shortage of financial resources will obviously prevent the VMS NOAK from initiating large-scale series construction of new ship designs in the immediate future; most probably ships will be built in small series with the goal of testing and evaluating new weapons and illumination systems. Priority in developing surface forces will obviously be given to creating escort ships such as guided missile destroyers with ASM systems providing zonal air defense, and guided missile escort ships with specialized antisubmarine armament. Mine warfare ships armed with modern mine warfare resources will also enjoy further development. Evaluating the prospects for developing the navy's light forces, it should be noted that construction of new missile and torpedo boats is not currently proceeding. Launches of these types within the fleet forces of the VMS NOAK satisfy modern requirements in general, but a significant number of them are worn, and require replacement. In the second half of the 1980's China continued construction of "Huangfen" class missile boats (type 021), making changes in the composition of the missile and artillery armament: Eight (four twin) or six (two twin stern and single bow) stationary Ying-ji-1 ASM launchers were positioned on the sides of the boats in place of four Feilong-2 ASM launchers, and 30-mm twin gun mounts and fire control radar were installed in place of the bow and stern 25-mm twin automatic guns. The outfit of electronic equipment was supplemented by radiotechnical and ECM resources. The transition to building small missile ships, however, does not mean rejection of further development of the small-displacement type of missile boats. Thus, in an international arms exhibition in Abu Dhabi in February 1993 the Chinese delegation displayed plans for a small missile boat 31 m long with a 118 tonne displacement, armed with four Ying-ji-1 ASM launchers and a single-barrel 76-mm turret gun, the Oto Melara Super Rapid. In comparison with the "Hegu" and "Huoku" missile boats, this one is equipped with improved electronic equipment, and it has a propulsion unit with a greater power reserve (two diesel engines manufactured by Germany's MTU). New "Huludao" and "Huxin" patrol boats are continuing to enter the fleet forces of the VMS NOAK and river forces of the border troops of the People's Armed Militia. The "Huludao" class gunboat is a reduced version of the "Barkat" gunboat (Chinese-made), which is operating with the coastal defense forces of Pakistan. The boat's displacement was reduced from 400 to 180 tonnes, with no change in its overall layout. In contrast to the Pakistani model, the artillery armament of the new boat is limited to bow and stern 14.5-mm automatic guns (type 81). The boat's radius (1,000 miles under economical power) allows it to effectively patrol the 2,000-mile economic zone. The navy possesses four gunboats, and a fifth is under construction. The "Huxin" class river gunboat is a modification of "Hapu" class boats. It has a higher freeboard and an altered superstructure configuration. Series production of the new boats began in 1989. There are currently eight "Huxin" class gunboats in operation, and another four are nearing completion. Thus presence of a large grouping of combatant craft in the present stage (over 500 units) generally permits successful completion of the missions of fighting surface ships and maintaining favorable operating conditions in China's coastal zone.
