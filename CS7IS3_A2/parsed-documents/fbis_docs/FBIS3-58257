He urged members of the centre-right parties behind the coalition government to support the policy. Reforms would be introduced at a speed compatible with the main concern of maintaining social harmony. Expressing the conviction that "as things stand, no other policy is possible," he said: "The two absolute priorities of the government in 1994 are the balancing of the health insurance budget and control of the increase in unemployment by all the means available to us." Sarkozy, who is spokesman for the government, was giving a New Year message to the press. During January the government would announce "important decisions" concerning health insurance. He noted that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur wanted the government to work hard for recovery without paying undue attention to the timetable for a presidential election next year.
