FBIS4-6398 "dreas076_m_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 Thailand Envoy Says Israel Welcomes Thai Workers Envoy Says Israel Welcomes Thai Workers BK2004042994 Bangkok THE NATION in English 20 Apr 94 p A2 BK2004042994 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Skilled Thai workers are welcome in Israel, Israeli Ambassador to Thailand 'Uzi Manor said yesterday, as part of an Israeli government campaign to recruit an international workforce to replace Palestinian workers. "We [Israel] would be glad to have more Thai workers in our country," the ambassador told The Nation during a telephone interview. According to the ambassador Israel has experience with Thai workers and considers them skilled and reliable. Earlier this month Israel said it was looking for more than 20,000 foreigners to work in place of Palestinian workers, following attacks by militant Palestinians which left 8 Israelis dead and 50 wounded in a 24 hour period. Under a proposal put to the Israeli cabinet, some 15,000 foreign construction workers, and 3,250 to be employed in the agricultural sector would join 3,000 others whose arrival has already been scheduled. The occupied territories, inhabited largely by Palestinians, have been officially sealed since the end of March 1993 following a wave of killings, but the restrictions were greatly relaxed in the months before the Hebron massacre. Authorities tightened the ban after the February 25 massacre, in which 30 Arab worshippers were gunned down by a Jewish settler, in a bid to prevent revenge attacks. Before the March, 1993 ban 100,000 Palestinians worked in Israel, many in farming and construction. The total ban on Palestinians entering Israel is believed to throw thousands out of work. The ambassador said his country would welconne skilled workers from any nation. Meanwhile, a senior Foreign Ministry official hailed the Israel decision as good for Thai workers. He said security would have to be taken into consideration before sending Thais there, however. "First, we have to know where they (the workers) will be sent, and if these areas are safe enough for our people," the anonymous official said. He said Thailand would not risk the safety of Thai labourers by allowing them to work in areas considered insecure. "We don't want Thai workers to be kept hostage should anything happen there," he told The Nation.
