But the peak of the elections will occur in March. The main political forces are actively preparing for them: Some count on reinforcing the success achieved at the federal level, others--on retribution for the loss. Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov already anticipates victory at the local level: "I have no doubt that leftist forces will come into power if the elections are honest." The PRES [Russian Party of Unity and Accord] emphasizes in yet another statement: "The party's next step is to form bodies of authority in Federation components." Russia's Choice will time the creation of its new party to the March election campaign. According to the Constitution, definition of the basic principles of forming bodies of authority in Russian Federation components is the subject of joint jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and its components. But until a federal law is adopted, the president has entrusted this business to administration heads. The list of violations of voters' rights that are taking place in the process is not limited to the example of St. Petersburg, where by decision of the city's mayor, 100,000 residents have been deprived of the right to vote. It also includes liberties in "mapping" electoral districts, and candidates' unequal access to the mass media; requiring permission for a candidate to register instead of a mere declaration of intent; the imposition of one--majority-based--electoral system; and so on. Mostly importantly, the prospect of turning the system of representative organs from an intended counterbalance to the executive branch into an appendix of it is coming through increasingly clearly. There are countless instances of infusion of various level staff members of administrations into kray, oblast, and other assemblies. In Stavropol Kray, the head of administration repealed the decision of the kray's inner council on the 42-member composition of the duma; now the duma will have only 25 members, of which 15 are heads of local administrations. The Saratov Oblast Assembly promises to have the same qualitative composition. In Tula, of 24 duma members, six may be "appointed" by the head of the administration. Last week the Russian State Duma took this issue to heart. But the Duma attempt to interfere in the process that is well underway became complicated by internal struggle in the chamber itself. Sometimes it resembled an entertaining game of intercepting the ball from the adversary, occasionally reaching the point of pushing him outside the "playing field." The question of local elections was put on the Duma agenda at the initiative of Oleg Mironov, a deputy from the Communist Party and member of the Legislation Committee, which is headed by the "Agrarian" Vladimir Isakov. The Communists and the Agrarian Party factions prepared a draft Duma decree "On General Principles of Organizing the System of Bodies of State Authority and Local Self-Government." However, the Committees for Federation Affairs and Local Self-Government Issues, headed by PRES members Sergey Shapovalov and Anatoliy Sliva, immediately countered it with their own joint draft. Isakov's committee attempted to have itself included among the coauthors of this second draft, but PRES-ites refused to accept him into their company. On 8 February they organized a separate meeting and invited to it representatives of the Central Electoral Commission [CEC] and of the president's and government's sides. The position of both the Duma politicians and representatives of the executive branch revolved around the dilemma of whether to treat the situation regarding local elections as a gross, fatal violation (elections do not reveal the true expression of the citizens' will) or as a deviation that can still be fixed? And, accordingly, should elections be postponed until a federal law is adopted, thus throwing doubt on the president's edicts, or give the president and the Central Electoral Commission an opportunity to make some corrections? Yuriy Yakovlev, deputy from the Democratic Party of Russia [DPR], expressing the extreme point of view, characterized the processes at the local level as across-the-board "prohibition of political activities" and urged not only that the elections be postponed but also that those that have already taken place be recognized as invalid. The initial draft of the Communists and Agrarians, by the way, also assumed the suspension of elections and a declaration that the president's edicts are "no longer in force." The leaders of the DPR and LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], Nikolay Travkin and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, also urged postponing the elections until the fall. The joint draft of two committees--Shapovalov's and Sliva's--on the contrary, recommended that the president take steps toward eliminating violations of citizens' rights, and that the CEC, the general procurator, and Russian Federation component executive branches bring the components' legislation into accord with the Constitution. On Wednesday this issue was discussed at a plenary session of the Duma. Three documents had been put forward by then, and were put to a vote; none passed. It would probably be a simplification to see in the Duma's clashes only a manifestation of the chronic confrontation between democrats and conservatives. The same Yuriy Yakovlev believes that in the question of local elections "all parties have huddled together; the struggle is not between the parties--it is a struggle of all parties against the arbitrariness of the administration." This is close to the truth. At a time when the "Communist-Agrarian" Speaker Ivan Rybkin prefers not to aggravate the relationship with the president and to follow the "planned course," Democrat Shakhray, for instance, calls for moving the elections to June. On the part of the executive structures, it was delicately suggested that the Duma "not stick its head out." CEC Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Ivanchenko promised the deputies that his agency "will keep the electoral process under control." Not too many in the Duma were elated over this, since Mr. Ryabov's agency is treated here with great suspicion. Viktor Sheynis believes that the CEC de facto acts as a "ministry of electoral affairs," whose directives are accepted on the local level as a guidance for action. An original interpretation of the situation with the elections and the Duma's approaches to it came from Nikolay Medvedev, chief of the presidential administration's department for work with the territories. First, he said frankly: "We currently have to do everything we can to make at least one branch of authority stable--namely, the executive." Second, having characterized the Duma's interest in local elections as a "contradiction between the bodies of state power of the Russian Federation components and the State Duma," he seriously alarmed Duma members. It is obvious that the presidential side now has a chance to pitch the Duma against the regions by interpreting its actions on the issue of local elections as aimed simultaneously against both the Kremlin and the "provincial generals." In this instance the Duma is also being "squeezed from above" by the Federation Council, which to a considerable extent consists of precisely these "generals" and may veto a decision on suspension of elections. One can understand the provincial bosses, by the way. If it was possible to fill half of one chamber with heads and officials of various administrations, and elect deputy prime ministers and ministers into the other, why should oblast and kray "parliaments" not do the same? After all, the provinces learn democracy and parliamentarism from Moscow--there is no other source.
