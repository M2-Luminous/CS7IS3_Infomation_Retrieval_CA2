The negative effects of the WFP's measure can already be seen. Mercedes Sayagues, WFP spokesman for the southern African region, says that at least two cities are currently facing considerable food shortages, but the WFP will only resume the flights if UNITA gives security guarantees. [Begin Sayagues recording] Yesterday the WFP canceled all its humanitarian flights in Angola because UNITA has not authorized the weekly flight plan. A document will be presented to the government on 15 June and between 15 and 16 June it will be sent to Huambo for UNITA's approval. Without this approval the WFP cannot sent its personnel or aircraft to war zones, risking its personnel and aircraft. [end recording] The aid is still being distributed by road in safe areas, but Mercedes Sayagues says this corresponds only to a third of the needs. This is the first time this year that WFP flights have been totally suspended in Angola. This organization is supplying about 70 percent of humanitarian assistance distributed in Angola.
