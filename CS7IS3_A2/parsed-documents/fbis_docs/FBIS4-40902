It envisages the sale of privatized property solely for money, since vouchers are now past their validity date. Privatization methods have been widened to include methods not contained in the corresponding Russian law. They are contracts, transfer of packages of enterprise shares to private control, step-by-step privatization of loss-making and low-profit enterprises, and privatization involving the process of dividing up debts and property. The adoption of this kind of law at regional level is unprecedented in Russia.
