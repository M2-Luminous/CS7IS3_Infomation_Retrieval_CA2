FR940621-2-00030 FR940621-2-00020 Golden Field Office; Cooperative Agreement Award to Georgia Institute of Technology AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Financial Award in Response to an Unsolicited Financial Assistance Application; 36&hyph;94G010019.000. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its intention to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Georgia Institute of Technology for the design and construction of a photovoltaic power system on the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center, site of the 1996 Olympic Games. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, Colorado 80401, Attention: J.W. Meeker, Contract Specialist. The telephone number is 303&hyph;275&hyph;4748. R. L. Martin is the Program Manager and his telephone number is 303&hyph;275&hyph;4763. Dr. Paul K. Kearns is the Contracting Officer. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: DOE has evaluated, in accordance with the DOE Federal Assistance Regulations, 10 CFR section 600.14, the unsolicited proposal entitled ``The Design, Construction and Monitoring of a Photovoltaic Power System on the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center, Site of the 1996 Olympic Natation Venue'' and recommends that the unsolicited proposal be accepted for support without further competition in accordance with section 600.14 of the Federal Assistance Regulations. In preparation for the Olympic Games and other major international sporting events in Atlanta, the new construction of an open air Aquatic Center on the Georgia Institute of Technology campus presents the opportunity to construct a photovoltaic system of approximately 75,000 gross square feet over the swimming and diving facility. The design is conceived as 230 ft. long Ã— 20 ft. wide roof sections in a barrel vault configuration on which photovoltaic cells would reside. The roof structure would be composed of steel columns and trusses with a metal deck and single ply membrane. The PV panels would be integrated to the outer roof layer in segmented panels. The PV panels would be 65 W PEAK to be installed for a total of 250 to 300 KW PEAK which would provide 20&hyph;25% of the peak power requirements of the Aquatic Center. The proposed photovoltaic roof installation project objectives include: (1) Design and research of a PV system to support the increased energy consumption on campus and have a peak capacity of 3400 KW, (2) monitoring and evaluating performance of the system, (3) support Georgia Power's demand-side strategy, (4) support the Climate Change Action Plan, (5) support the Utility Photovoltaic Group (UPVG), (6) support the Georgia Tech Center of Excellence in Photovoltaics Research and Education, and (7) provide the largest, unparalleled facility integrated PV power system in the United States. The project team is a group of individuals with experience in PV research, design, manufacturing and application. Inclusion of the Aquatic Center Design Team (ACDT), comprised of architects, structural engineers, estimators and planners responsible for the design and construction of the Aquatic Center and the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG), in the project team enhances the integration of the PV system into the Aquatic Center construction project and into the integrated schedule. This project represents a unique opportunity to showcase a renewable energy commercialization project with utility-side impact and support the Climate Change Plan. This proposal has been found to be meritorious. The team has the capabilities and commitment to this project which should provide a basis for the successful implementation of the proposed project. The program cost is estimated to be $5,439,000 total, with the DOE share being $1,993,000, Georgia Power Company share being $1,848,000, and Georgia Institute of Technology's share the remaining $1,598,000. Issued in Golden, Colorado, on June 14, 1994. John W. Meeker, Chief, Procurement, Golden Field Office. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15048 Filed 6&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
