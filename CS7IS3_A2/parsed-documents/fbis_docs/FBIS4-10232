This was learned during the second plenum of the national committee of the Health Workers Union, which also came out in favor of preserving free health care services in all specialized fields, including cosmetic surgery. The suitability process among work group personnel will begin, with serenity and maturity, said Ramon Crespo, secretary general of the Health Workers Union, who guaranteed that the administrations of all organizations will benefit from this action. It was determined that attention and motivation in regard to night shift personnel could no longer be postponed. Havana Province has a successful experiment underway in this connection. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We in the province have developed and are continuing to develop a program of sponsorship by large production centers, such as sugar mills, cooperatives, Basic Cooperative Production Units, and cement factories in the muncipalities where they exist, by which the administration and political elements at those centers sponsor and attend to our night shift workers, including medical personnel on the night watch and others who work the graveyard shift. What does this involve? It involves providing dinner, an afternoon snack, or some snack or cold drink in the late, predawn, hours for those workers who are giving their best and their all to comfort and care for our people. [end recording] Cuba will be the site of the first international meeting of health care union leaders, to be held in December, 1994.
