Environment Minister Michel Barnier explained the government's policy and its prospects in the area of nuclear energy. [Strazzulla] You are the environment minister of the world's most nuclearized country. Do you get comments from your counterparts, especially the European ones? [Barnier] At no time within the Council of Environment Ministers of the European Union [EU] has France's policy been called into question in front of me. Every country has chosen its strategy; we are not the only country which opted for nuclear energy, even though in France it covers 75 percent of our electricity requirments. I think that other countries know our culture of nuclear safety, the rigorousness of our inspections, and the quality of our companies. This does not stop us from talking about it. Whatever the atom's share in energy production, we have all experienced common problems: especially with safety, electricity lines, and nuclear waste. [Strazzulla] As far as the choice of energy is concerned, what kind of maneuvering room does the environment minister have? [Barnier] The environment minister assumes a special responsibility which he shares with the minister of industry: nuclear safety. This is an issue to which I am personally committed. The government is working in a coherent manner. In the end, we ask ourselves the same questions, albeit with different approaches. The most important signal, an initiative by the prime minister, can be found in his desire to see an open, national discussion on energy and the environment. I have the feeling that this debate will raise greater interest among local and national operators than we might expect. Within the government, I feel quite easy saying, for example, that in France we must revive diversification in energy production and move toward hydroelectricity, renewable energy, and biofuels, among other things. [Strazzulla] Should we expect major changes in the national energy policy following this debate? [Barnier] There is no use in beating about the bush; our electronuclear strategy will not change. However, what might emerge from this debate is a greater understanding and a better control over this choice. It should also help revive energy conservation, which we inexcusably dismantled 10 years ago. I would add a concern to this, namely a concern for greater openness and greater control over energy policy by parliament. This is why I raised the idea of a law on nuclear safety. Lastly, this debate is linked to the law on regional reorganization and decentralization, especially as far as transport policy and the balance between road and rail transport are concerned. [Strazzulla] The alleged greenhouse effect is the new argument used by the nuclear lobby. Does this seem credible to you? [Barnier] The current debate between scientists is focused more on the seriousness of the greenhouse effect than on its existence. In addition, I am organizing the third "Segur Talks" on this topic on 16 May. While waiting to know the truth, we have to apply the principle of caution. It is essential to limit greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide. From this point of view, nuclear energy is actually a clean energy. However, it raises other problems, the most serious of which is waste. [Strazzulla] The West seems to want to mobilize to help Ukraine decommission its plant in Chernobyl. What are the main options considered? [Barnier] The shutdown of the two most dangerous reactors in Chernobyl is something desired by both the West and Ukraine. The prime minister asked us to prepare a specific initiative to bring about this shutdown, in cooperation with the other countries of the European Union and the G-7. This point will be one of the main elements in the Naples summit. Apart from the reactors, a new sarcophagus has to be built in Chernobyl and there are still the major problems of radioactive waste and water protection. In order to meet Ukraine's energy needs, we could bring two or three new reactors on line. That would assume a new culture of nuclear safety in that country, as well as exceptional support from all the Western countries. Lastly, in all the new democracies, there is an enormous amount of energy waste. Helping them better manage their networks and resources is a big part of the solution to their problems. [Strazzulla] After 40 years of operation, the problem of nuclear waste has emerged in France. What do you think of it? [Barnier] I believe that the operators and the bodies in charge of nuclear energy have demonstrated a lack of foresight by putting this issue off until later. Yet, very few political decisions affect future generations to the same extent as the production of long-life nuclear waste lasting 10,000 years or more. The issue was finally raised -- rightly -- in the late eighties. The beginning of a solution was provided by the law of 1991 and the work of the Bataille mission concerning the establishment of underground laboratories for studying deep storage. [Strazzulla] From the point of view of lack of foresight, can we dissociate nuclear waste from other industrial waste? [Barnier] All industries produce waste. In the past, industrial waste was often stored or buried in any manner and anywhere. It is true that the industries which produced this waste had no more foresight than the nuclear industry. One of my first actions upon entering government was to launch an in-depth inquiry in each department in order to draw up a comprehensive and prioritized list of polluted sites. Once this list is drawn up, we will have to find the resources to treat these sites. I do not want anything to do with a "contaminated earth" case. Nuclear energy also produces end waste. It must be made quite clear that no matter what type of reprocessing is used, we must have underground storage sites for long-life radioactive waste. As for the processing of slightly radioactive waste, this process must be more stringently managed. [Strazzulla] Nuclear physicists assure us that the waste problem will not be resolved with an incinerator. So what were the government's real motivations in deciding to reactivate the Superphenix reactor? [Barnier] Superphenix will not be built to destroy all the waste produced by France's 57 nuclear reactors. The prime minister made a basic decision, namely to stop fast-breeding operations in Creys-Malville in two years' time, in other words, to stop producing plutonium. The facility will make it possible to carry out experiments aimed at gaining better knowledge of the means of reducing the volume of the most dangerous nuclear waste. I therefore have some trouble understanding the attitude of certain ecologists vis-a-vis Superphenix at this time. Bearing in mind the mass of money, research, and expertise invested in this site, it would have been inconceivable to write it off. This decision is in line with general interest.
