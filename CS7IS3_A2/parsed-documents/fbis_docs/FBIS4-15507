FBIS4-15507 "drsov069cc_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-069 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 9 April ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 9 April LD0904072094 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0538 GMT 9 Apr 94 LD0904072094 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] [Text] Moscow April 9 (TASS) -- KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA publishes today an interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who said: "If Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy (former vice president of Russia and the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party) become president, Russia will not survive... I do not see any accord on this matter... What is the essence of it? Should we reach accord on observing the constitution? The whole nation voted for the constitution. But those who called for violence in Russia should be kept in prison. As long as Zhirinovskiy does not give up his openly fascist slogans, as long as Rutskoy does not give up hope for actually repeating in Russia the Yugoslav model, I shall never be in agreement with them." ROSSIYSKIE VESTI carries an article by Anatoliy Sliva, deputy to the State Duma and chairman of the committee for local self-government. "Russia will be neither democratic, nor law-governed, nor social state, if we do not ensure real local self-government, real people's power... The complexity of the problem consists in the fact that it is in the focus of various interests, some of which contradict each other, including those which are hampering the formation of real self-government." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article, entitled "After Predicting the Establishment of a Dictatorial Regime, Alexey Kazannik Tenders Resignation for the Second Time." It analyses the reasons for that step, taken by the former prosecutor-general of Russia. The newspaper quotes an interview with Kazannik, the whole of which will be published in the next issue. He said: "After my dramatic resignation I saw for myself that President Boris Yeltsin needs a fully controllable, (?puppet) prosecutor-general, who will fulfil any, even illegal orders, and not only of the president, but also of some clerks from his administration." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA publishes an article about Russia's Middle East policy, which says: "Moscow's activity in the Middle East is described as one of the reasons for the correction of Washington's foreign political course. However, the Russian Foreign Ministry believes that the participation in the settlement of Middle East problems is the most natural thing for Russia, and refutes both accusations of the attempts to get political dividends and the element of competitiveness between Moscow and Washington in the Middle East." "Russia has become a sort of Mecca for illegal migrants," Yuriy Arkhipov, head of the external migration department of the Federal Migration Service, said in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. "From the legal point of view, it is not refugees who come to Russia, but people claiming the status of a refugee. They can get it only after a corresponding procedure, which presupposes an appeal to migration services. Foreigners who have not undergone that procedure cannot be regarded as refugees are are living on the territory of the country illegally. According to law-enforcement agencies, there are about half a million of immigrants from foreign countries, and their number continues to grow." TRUD carries one more article about the causes of the crash of the A-310 plane near Novokuznetsk. "Valeriy Ekskuzyan, director-general of the Rossiyskie Avialinii air company, expressed disagreement with the preliminary conclusions of the government commission. He stressed that the commission's statement about the presence of third persons in the cabin is groundless. Some senior officials from the Russian Ministry of transport share his view. They say there is no indication to the incompetent operaration of the plane, which could cause its crash," the newspaper writes. A decree of President Yeltsin and a corresponding order of the defence minister have actually given a new shape to the anti-aircraft defence troops: in the future they will become a basis for the creation of Russia's air and space defence, Air Force Colonel General Viktor Prudnikov, commander-in-chief of the anti-aircraft defence troops, said in an interview with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA published today. This will be a natural thing to do, because the air and space defence spheres are so closely connected with each other that they have long been regarded as a single whole, Prudnikov said. The principle of the formation of the anti-aircraft defence system will also be changed. It will become entirely different and will be based on a territorial principle. Anti-aircraft defence zones and districts will be created within the time limit set by the defence minister. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Vyacheslav Bulavkin, director-general of the Technomash production amalgamation, which is the chief enterprises in the sphere of rocket and space technologies. "Everyday life continually brings to my mind one and the same alarming thought: what will be the first to come -- the realisation by the government and the legislators of the importance of the Russian defence industry, in which an enormous scientific and technological potential is concentrated and millions of people are working, or a social explosion? Experiments should not be staged on a live organism..." PRAVDA publishes an article by Valeriy Zorkin, ex-chairman of the Constitutional Court, who writes: "The efficiency of power itself is the most important problem today, because order cannot be restored in the country without it. Strict discipline in the state apparatus and the curbing of the corruption of bureaucrats should become the first steps towards an agreement on national harmony, towards the consent of society to the taking of anti-crisis measures by these very power structures ... National harmony is possible only on the basis of changing a catastrophic course, imposed by radical `democrats'". Echoing Zorkin, Chairman of the Russian Christian Democratic Movement Viktor Aksyuchits said in an interview with PRAVDA: "Personal, group ambitions should not get an upper hand over common interest -- those of the nation and the state. In any case, a chance for reaching accord should not be missed." The NEVSKOE VREMYA newspaper writes that cases of "housing racket" are becoming more frequent in St. Petersburg. As a rule, criminals steal keys, penetrate a flat and force its owners, using violence, to sign documents for unequal exchange or the sale of the apartment. The worsening of the crime situation in the country is influencing the situation in the armed forces, the St. Petersburg-based newspaper NA STRAZHE RODINY writes. It was reported at a session of the military council of the Leningrad military district that several attacks on sentries had taken place in the district during the past year. Several cases of stealing arms and ammunition and leaving one's unit without permission were also registered.
