Besides other issues, the meeting will focus on the date and agenda of the Azerbaijani-Armenian summit planned to be held in Moscow. IF Note: In an interview with INTERFAX, Armenian Presidential Assistant Levon Zurabyan confirmed the possibility of such a meeting under Russia's auspices. He said pleparatory diplomatic activities were carried out through the mediation by the Russian side. As has been reported, the Azerbaijani-Armenian summit planned to be held during the CIS April summit was disrupted. Armenia has been maintaining that the reason for the disruption was Azerbaijan's reluctance to accept the Russian plan for the settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh. In an interview with INTERFAX, Kazimirov pointed out that an Azerbaijani-Armenian summit could be useful on a rather advanced stage of consideration of the draft settlement agreement," based on the Russian design. Kazimirov pointed out the main provisions of the Russian settlement plan. The first stage is "short, but crucial and complicated" -- the establishment of a cease-fire. The second stage involves a shift to the elimination of consequences of the armed conflict, including a withdrawal of troops from the occupied territories, exchange of prisoners of war, hostages, bodies of the killed, information of those missing in action or killed, re-introduction of the transport and power lines and the repatriation of refugees to their permanent locations. On the third stage, political talks on the future legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh will be launched. "Whenever the sides are close enough to signing such a draft agreement, such a meeting in Moscow will be possible," Kazimirov was quoted as saying. Zurabyan said the Moscow summit was envisioned by a protocol signed at the meeting of Armenian, Azerbaijani and Nagorno-Karabakh parliamentarians in Bishkek on 5 May through the mediation of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly. IF Note: Azerbaijani Parliamentary Speaker Rasul Guliyev who signed the document with a number of stipulations came under harsh criticisms by the parliamentary opposition, the National Independence Party lead by Etibar Mamedov. According to the party, Guliyev committed high treason by signing the Bishkek protocol "together with the leader of the Supreme Soviet of a non-existent so-called Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, Karen Baburyan." The party said Guliyev "created all necessary conditions for the recognition of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic as a subject of the international law and open the possibility for concluding an agreement which would legalize the deployment of Russian troops in Azerbaijan." In the meantime, Nagorno-Karabakh Foreign Minister Arkady Gukasyan did not preclude that the reports on Azerbaijan's signing the Bishkek protocol on the settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh on 8 May were another tactical step by Baku. In Gukasyan's opinion, only the deployment of peacekeeping forces was capable of putting an end to the bloodshed. Azerbaijani Defense Minister Mamadrafi Mammadov, his Armenian counterpart, Serzh Sargsyan, and the Nagorno-Karabakh troops commander, Samvel Babayan, signed an agreement Wednesday midnight to cease-fire as of 0000 on 12 May, Interfax learned from well-informed sources from in Stepanakert. Meanwhile, the Nagorno-Karabakh Army press service reported fierce fighting along the frontline, despite the cease-fire agreement signed. The press service said that after a heavy shelling Azerbaijani troops attempted to break the Nagorno-Karabakh defense near the village of Yusifdzhanly of the Agdam district at about 0700 Thursday. The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry reported Armenian units had tried to develop their offensive on Geranboi and Agdam yesterday night.
