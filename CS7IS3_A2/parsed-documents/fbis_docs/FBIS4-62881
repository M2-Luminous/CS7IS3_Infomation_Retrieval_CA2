The privatization of enterprises is proceeding slowly, said Tbilisi Mayor Niko Lekishvili in an interview to a BS-PRESS correspondent. The situation is better regarding the privatization of living accommodations, 50 percent of which have been privatized; the process of legalization is continuing. A new stage of privatization is beginning in the Georgian capital, so-called "large privatization" that affects a number of large enterprises and commercial facilities, stated Niko Lekishvili. The corresponding decree of the head of state has been prepared and the process will begin very shortly. The question of purchasing facilities that are to be privatized in freely convertible currency so as to prevent the budget from incurring damage due to inflation is being discussed in the corresponding departments. The mayor of Tbilisi stated that one of the obstacles to privatization was the position occupied by a number of ministries and departments that were not interested in developing privatization and were hindering it.
