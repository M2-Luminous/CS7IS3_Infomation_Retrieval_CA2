A police spokesman, Colonel Raymond (Dawoud), said gang-related crime was a police responsibility and not that of the National Defense Force, which was not trained to handle the situation. Speaking on behalf of the Western Cape MEC [Members of Executive Committee] for police, Mr. Patrick Mckenzie, Col. (Dawoud) appealed to people not to allow the issue to develop political overtones. He added that crime in the area had decreased significantly since the start of Operation Gang-Bust last week.
