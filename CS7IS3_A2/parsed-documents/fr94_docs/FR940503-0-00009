FR940503-0-00009 FR940503-0-00003 Section 563.7(f) also has been revised to provide that in those instances where the initial appraisal report is deemed to be materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete, the OTS may deem the entire conversion application materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete, and in accordance with the OTS applications processing rules, 12 CFR part 516, decline to further process the application. In such cases, the applicant will be required to refile the conversion application, including a revised appraisal, as a new application and pay any applicable filing fees. Under current ยง563b.7(f)(2), the fact that a person is participating in effecting a sale of the conversion stock, either as an underwriter or as a selling agent, does not preclude such person or an affiliate of such person from being considered independent for purposes of preparing the appraisal for the conversion. Although the staff has not experienced any problems to date where a conversion appraisal firm or its affiliate have participated in effecting the sale of the conversion stock, the OTS believes that it is essential that conversion appraisals not be tainted in any manner by a real or potential conflict in such an affiliate relationship that would cause the appraiser to not be independent in his or her judgments. Thus, while no changes are being adopted at this time, the OTS is requesting public comment as to whether it should amend ยง563b.7(f)(2) to prohibit an appraiser or its affiliates from also serving as an underwriter or selling agent. Finally, in order to further enhance regulatory oversight in this area, the OTS intends to issue updated guidance for conversion appraisers that will provide specific details on appraisal methodology and report content. B. Prohibition on Use of ``Running'' Proxies Section 563b.5(d)(4), adopted in 1985, provides for management of a converting association to use previously obtained proxies, i.e., ``running'' proxies, from a voting member. Previously, the conversion rules prohibited the use of ``running'' proxies. The requirement was changed in 1985 to reduce conversion costs for marginally capitalized savings associations. 5 5 50 FR 20555 (May 17, 1985). Section 563b.5(d)(4), however, requires that each voting member be furnished a proxy statement on the special plan of conversion meeting, and only allows for use of the ``running'' proxy in the event the voting member does not grant a later-dated proxy to vote at the meeting called to consider the plan of conversion or attend such meeting and vote in person. Currently, as discussed in section I. above, most mutual associations in the thrift industry seeking to convert are well-capitalized. Thus, the regulatory rationale for truncating the proxy solicitation and voting requirements generally no longer exists. In addition, depositors in greater numbers recently have expressed increased interest in the conversion plans of their associations. The OTS believes, based on its experiences in this area, that the current ability to use ``running'' proxies has lessened the incentive of converting associations to actively solicit depositors to consider and vote on conversions. Thus, the OTS has decided to revise ยง563b.5(d)(4) to prohibit the use of ``running'' proxies. The OTS believes the prohibition is the most effective manner in which to assure full participation of the association's membership in the conversion process. The requirement to use a proxy specifically designed for the conversion will require thrift management to more actively solicit its depositors to obtain their votes for conversion. In addition, the last two paragraphs of Item 1 and Item 4(d) of the Form PS have been revised to conform with the revisions discussed above. Finally, a sentence has been added to ยง575.13(a)(4) of the mutual holding company regulations to conform with this revision. C.
