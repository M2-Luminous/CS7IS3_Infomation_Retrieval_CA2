The author is affiliated with MOFERT's Personnel Department] [Text] China has approved the setting up of more than 4,000 overseas enterprises since reform and opening up. Total Chinese investments have reached approximately $5 billion. These enterprises are scattered in more than 100 countries and regions, and they handle energy, industry, and services and other businesses. A decade of practice proved that their existence and development played a positive role in the development of China's national economy, mainly in spurring on China's export trade, and in particular, they played an irreplaceable role in circumventing the host countries' trade barriers. They also played a role in developing overseas resources to supplement our country's inadequate resources. Such overseas resources include financial and technological resources. But objectively speaking, from the point of the overseas enterprises' foreign investments and transnational operations, we have only taken the first steps, and compared to international standards, we still have a long way to go. In order to narrow the gap as soon as possible and upgrade our overseas enterprises, we must take into consideration the needs of the transnational operations and focus on our own inadequacies and make improvements and adjustments. This article addresses the existing problems and offers some countermeasures. I. Inadequacies in China's Overseas Enterprises Today 1. There is a lack of thorough knowledge of the global characteristics of the 1990's, and our entry strategy needs adjustments: To understand this problem, we must first look at the characteristics of today's global transnational operations. Everybody knows that global transnational operations which have undergone nearly 50 years of development have completed their preliminary phase and are entering an intensive development phase characterized by the following: A. Transnational operations are getting bigger. According to statistics compiled by the United Nation's Transnational Companies Center, in 1993, transnational companies were operating more overseas enterprises, but more striking is that their total overseas investments have topped $2 trillion, increasing some 20-odd folds compared to the 1970s. This change has in turn changed the world's economic pattern: Today, one-third of the world export of goods and services are transacted between the parent companies and their subsidiaries. For example, in the United States, transnational companies' annual trade and overseas profits are worth around $100 billion. By conservative estimates, their internal transactions accounted for more than 60 percent of that country's total export of manufactured goods in 1992. They also created nearly 5 million jobs. B. Expansion forces the transnational companies to go beyond regional boundaries to engage in fierce competition. For geographic, national, and historical reasons, besides investing in each other in the traditional sense, transnational companies have reached some kind of tacit understanding in the underdeveloped nations and regions based on their regional strategies: For example, Asia is dominated by Japan; the United States basically has a monopoly in Latin America; central Europe, Eastern Europe, and parts of Africa naturally fall within the European Community's domain. But increasing evidence shows that due to differences and imbalance in economic strength and technological standards, and for various political reasons, their spheres of influence are constantly under siege. The transnational companies are becoming global companies. C. Intense competition has prompted the transnational companies to change their management strategies. To adapt to the needs of expansion and regional strategies, transnational companies have modified their traditional single-operation strategy to a multiple- or compound-operation strategy. Instead of a bunch of individual nation-based subsidiaries set up only to serve their respective countries, we now see many subsidiaries that are integrated organizations with organically linked functions that cover the entire spectrum, from production to sales, with development, research, and sales promotion tasks in between. Their main characteristic is to give full play to the existing scientific and technological measures, production capacity, and development capability, and the basis of their strategy is to focus on cost and profit. Integration at this point in time has profound implications. These enterprises may appear to be coordinating trade and fund circulation, but in fact they are coordinating commodities and labor and other productive activities. What about our own situation? Our overseas enterprises have always believed that China has only just begun its transnational operations, and so long as we get out and fight our way through, so long as we find a place for ourselves, we should be happy and satisfied. Moreover, since China is still a developing nation, our transnational operations can only do business in a small way and cannot set high standards, and that belief has translated into management strategies and tactics that only allow us to make war in the peripheries. We have never seriously studied the characteristics of contemporary transnational operations and have never taken the initiative to adapt. 2. There is a very low degree of integration in management: The above shortcoming is reflected in operations with a low degree of integration. Up to now, the absolute majority of China's overseas enterprises have only tackled jobs that were there and work they could handle. Their production management programs and plans and transnational strategies and tactics are instructions handed down to them. They cannot shape the companies' behaviors or management activities. Many overseas enterprises are practically "fly-by-night" outfits and "individual peasant households." Their actual operation, business scope, and product mix often have little or nothing to do with the core business of their parent companies back home. Clearly, this condition does not foster the organic integration of domestic and foreign key factors of production, and it also makes it difficult to achieve the goal of integrating the management goals of the parent companies and their overseas companies. Of course, we should understand that some enterprises may be profitable in the short-run, but in essence, they still do not comply with the objective needs and the intrinsic laws of internationalized commodities production, and therefore they cannot be considered transnational operations or overseas enterprises in the true sense. 3. The organizational structure is still like that of an elementary business cooperative: Except for the oil refineries in the United States and aluminum plants in Australia and some other large projects, China's overseas enterprises generally operate in small scale; the degree of concentration is fairly low. The average investment per enterprise is less than $13 million, compared to an average of $45 million for the developing nations and $60 million for the developed countries. Obviously there is a wide gap. Ultimately, transnational operation is a contest of financial and comprehensive strength. Without a certain enterprise scale and financial basis, we are doomed to be weak from the start. Moreover, since the markets have already been captured by others, it makes it even harder for China's enterprises to get in. To complete the picture, these enterprises are operating with people of ordinary qualifications and a simple labor-mix and management mechanisms. People compare them to "mom and pop stores." It may not be exact, but it draws a vivid picture. Under this system, there are some problems, such as loopholes in bookkeeping and lax management, which these enterprises cannot avoid or resolve by themselves. II. Countermeasures: Several Suggestions on Raising Overseas Enterprises' Management Standards As mentioned above, Chinese enterprises' overseas investments were given impetus by the state in conjunction with its all-encompassing policy of opening up to the outside world to encourage the full utilization of international resources and international markets. The entire process had the distinct characteristic of being artificially stimulated, which was consistent with China's overall policy in the last decade or so to vigorously open up to the outside world. It is no small accomplishment for Chinese enterprises' transnational operations, which had to start out from scratch, to develop to today's scope in such a short time, but faced with the intense competition from other nations' transnational operations, we must focus on the above problems and quickly come up with some countermeasures to raise our management standards. In the near-term, I think Chinese enterprises' transnational operations should work hard in the following areas: 1. We need a proper understanding of the characteristics of the times and put our management ideas on a high point. Earlier we have briefly talked about the characteristics of today's global transnational operations. Through that discussion, we have come to understand that a characteristic of the times is that transnational companies are the product of a combination of political and economic factors. So long as these factors do not change dramatically, this characteristic not only sums up the transnational operations at this early stage but can also be interpreted as a basic requirement and the norm of transnational operations for some time to come. This fact may be more important in the practical sense and more valuable from the economics point of view. Thus, in order to achieve our goals through the global transnational operations, understanding and grasping this characteristic, and even making it the basis of our operations, are especially important. It may be regarded as the premise and the basis of improving and raising the management standards of China's overseas enterprises. This is an issue of concept and is also an issue of management strategy. 2. We should promote the concentration and optimization of the existing overseas enterprises. After we have resolved the issue of strategy, as a second step, we should begin to increase the concentration and optimize the existing overseas enterprises which are too small and too scattered. The core enterprises should make a thorough analysis of how the transnational companies stake out their territories and how regional economic integration is shaping up, and on that basis, they should conduct a solid assessment of their existing overseas enterprises and formulate a brand new program which takes into account their own strength, the market forecasts, and the territories they intend to get into. They should strive to acquire the capability to directly confront the large transnational companies in specific territories and regions and compete in global transnational operations. Whether we can formally take part in the global competition and whether we can acquire the capability to engage in direct confrontation will be critical to Chinese enterprises' transnational operations. To explain the importance more clearly, I will cite a thought-provoking example: The sale of equity rights to a New Zealand steel mill in 1989 caught industry-wide attention. Chinese enterprises put in a great effort, but because our enterprises had always engaged in small business and for other reasons, the deal which had been very promising eventually fell through because the New Zealand side had no confidence in our overseas enterprises. Imagine, if it had been successful, the status of our overseas enterprises in the world iron and steel industry and business circles would have been greatly enhanced, and we would have gradually gained strength too. Thus, modern industrial management mandates large scale; without size, there can be no efficiency. How can we increase enterprise concentration? Based on the successful experiences of global transnational operations and on what China's enterprises can handle, there are the following ways: One, within the confines of the same region, merge the small companies into one or two relatively large companies. Two, apply the shareholding system to link companies that are under the jurisdictions of different organs. Three, domestic financial organs should act as guarantors in international financing and capital expansion. Four, set up joint ventures with the host countries' enterprises or with enterprises of a third nation to increase size. As can be imagined, concentration is not something China's overseas enterprise operations can achieve in one leap. 3. We should implement international practices and general methods to improve the management of overseas enterprises. Transnational management formats and practices that are widely accepted today have been developed by many countries and entrepreneurs based on the laws of international economy in combination with many years of practice and continuous summation of past management experiences. To those of us who developed transnational operations late, these practices and methods are a priceless treasure. They are important because they can eliminate detours and failures and are an organic integration of management theories and practices. We need not come up with our own proofs or experiments. They have minimized our opportunity cost, and we late-comers can apply or utilize these methods directly under appropriate conditions. Based on our own situation, we should consider adopting the following methods: A. The heart of transnational management and administration is integration. Theoretically speaking, integrated management is self-evident for all kinds of enterprises. Even if there are different formats and mechanisms of division of power, all enterprises must still be essentially integrated. Ordinarily, this would apply to enterprises in transnational operations as well. But in order to combine domestic and foreign key factors of production, these enterprises have developed a management format whose basic characteristic is to invest and operate overseas. This mandates the separation of overseas and domestic operating entities and that the entities be relatively independent. No doubt such separation makes the operations of the parent companies at home and the overseas enterprises abroad more convenient and serviceable. But there is no denying that such a relationship also hides the potential for variances in management. In particular, enticed by easy and immediate profit, enterprises are prone to develop strategies and goals that are contrary to the core companies.' If the core companies fail to discover them or succumb to this kind of profit, the overseas enterprises may eventually become "resident-alien enterprises" and be completely independent from their parent companies. Looking at the transnational operations of enterprises of all nations, they all have strategic considerations, and what they focus on is to help the core enterprises utilize foreign resources and further expand their territories and spheres of influence. But China's transnational operations are launched not only for the above reason but also because economic constructions at home need money too. We can imagine the huge strategic importance. Under the circumstances, whether from the economics point of view or for geographic reasons, we should not allow our overseas enterprises to act alone and become independent. Instead, we should modify them and turn them into transnational management groups with the domestic core enterprises at their hub. The operations of all overseas enterprises should be put into the production and management chain of the core enterprises and turn them into an organic part of the group, such as the spare part and component producing department, the assembly department, and the group's sales department and so on, and each should also have its appropriate structural functions. B. The road to transnational operation is localization. Overseas enterprises operate in the host countries and are in an environment often more complicated than that at home. Many economic laws and human factors play a role, and in order to fulfill their responsibilities and run their transnational operation successfully, these enterprises must first acknowledge that they belong to their host countries in form and are legal entities operating in the socio-economic and legal environments of the countries where they are located. In other words, they must make localization the starting point and the only avenue. The meaning of localization is two-pronged. First, it means hiring local workers; second, it means adopting local enterprise management practices. The hiring of local works involves not just ordinary staff but also middle management and a few upper management personnel, and it also involves some special employees, such as lawyers, certified accountants, auditors and other professionals. We must interpret the use and development of foreign resources in the broad sense to include the use of human resources. There are many advantages to this, and at the least, we gain some training time. Adopting local management methods involves many areas. I think the most important is that we should directly adopt local or internationally accepted financial management systems, accounting methods, *and auditing procedure, and so far as systems are concerned, we can have partnerships, a shareholding system, boards of directors, and boards of supervisors and so on. Our existing overseas enterprises have adopted these sporadically with fairly good results, and of course those that have adopted them systematically have even better results. Thus we must be determined to adopt this set of internationally accepted methods to replace some of the unruly practices and behaviors of some overseas enterprises. Only when we begin to localize the operations can we formally get on the host countries' economic tracks. This is important not only because we are accepting the host countries' supervision and management in form, but the real essence is that this is the way to legally get the host countries' permissions to utilize their resources and reap the profit. This is the premise and the basis of transnational operations, and it is also the lifeline to improving transnational management. People often believe, in a superficial and simplistic way, that accepting the host countries' regulations and management practices will make things more complicated for ourselves and jeopardize our integrated management. But if we analyze this carefully, we will arrive at the opposite conclusion. For many years, our transnational management has been in a dilemma: We want to develop overseas enterprises but we also worry about losing control. We have tried to modify our existing management mechanisms as a way of adapting, but despite repeated efforts, we have not found a better way. If we modify our thinking and utilize the host countries' existing management mechanisms, we not only will satisfy their demands but can also utilize their management resources to remedy our own management deficiencies. That is good economics. Raising the overseas enterprises' management standards is a micro issue as well as a macro issue. Enterprises engaging in transnational operations naturally should study the matter carefully, but the state too must provide the necessary external conditions, such as designing proper government functions, creating a legal environment, and formulating a long-term economic plan. In short, this is a fairly large issue with broad ramifications. We are only making some suggestions here.
