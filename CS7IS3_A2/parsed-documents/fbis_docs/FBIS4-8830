What changes would you make to the present government if you were able to? [Karabashev] In principle, especially at the present juncture, a government should be much more of a team. I would increase the degree of team work. Team spirit is enhanced when the views of the individual ministers on the main issues are closely similar. Naturally, arguments must occur from time to time, but nonetheless as far as economic policy is concerned, ministers should not have radically opposed views. A cabinet is not a parliament, it is a government that has to work as a team. [Krusteva] Journalists have stated that the most important recent piece of news was Dr. Zhelev's statement in which he withdrew his confidence in the government. The president motivated this decision by leveling accusations against the cabinet. Which of his charges do you accept and which do you not? [Karabashev] I would prefer not to analyze what the president said. As a citizen of the country and as president, he is fully entitled to make his own assessment of the government's work. It is another matter whether his confidence or lack of confidence has ethical or political grounds, but his statement has no particular importance as far as it concerns the cabinet's future, which depends solely on parliament. I believe that the president was largely incorrect on privatization. In fact, Ms. Indzhova has invested and is investing great efforts in speeding up the privatization process. I am trying to help her within my powers, because she is in fact the one who under the law is able to implement the privatization. The numerous attacks against me claiming that this process is not proceeding fast enough show that these critics have not read the Privatization Act. As deputy prime minister, I have no direct functions concerning privatization, I cannot make any decisions, nor can I carry them out. This is the task of the individual ministers and, first and foremost, the Privatization Agency. As minister of trade, I think that I am fulfilling my functions. Mine is the only ministry that fulfilled its privatization program in 1993, and it will fulfill it in 1994 as well. [passage omitted] [Krusteva] Your party's leader, Prof. Nikolay Vasilev, has stated that you are the only member of the cabinet who is trying to carry through the privatization. Who is stopping you from doing this? [Karabashev] Krustyu Petkov asked me the same question. I have mentioned before the factors that are hindering me, including personal ones. Now I would like to give a very concrete example, something that I have not done until now, and which I am telling your newspaper for the first time. You probably recall the big arguments about the "Karabashev" and "Berov" privatization models during the summer of 1993, more than eight months ago. If the so-called "Karabashev" model had been adopted, the situation would be very different now. My project provided for a specific number of enterprises to be included in investment funds of holdings before the changes, and a dispute arose about the name. The management of these holdings was to be placed on a financial and economic basis, to make them much more independent of the state. After the first results of the activities of the holding companies had been reported -- which would be now, in April 1994, by passing the law one could then go ahead with privatizing these funds or holding companies. However, this was not done. Instead, we adopted a compromise version, and now, even if the Privatization Act is amended, this program, which will take a long time to complete, will be launched only as of now. [passage omitted]
