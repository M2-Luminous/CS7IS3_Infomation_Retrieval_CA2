Prominent traders have been detained, an investigation team dispatched from Beijing to Shanghai and personnel changes made in leading Shanghai trading companies. According to highly-placed sources, several hundreds of millions of United States dollars were lost last year when Chinese traders dealing through U.S. and British investment houses ordered huge amounts of copper at top prices for China's strategic stockpiles without the central government's consent. Prices collapsed and caused an uproar in the People's Bank of China, the central bank chaired by Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, sources said. Several high-rolling and well-known Shanghai traders had been detained. Under detention were two employees of the metal-trading department of Shanghai CITIC [China International Trust and Investment Corporation]. An investigation had also been launched against an official of the Shanghai Machinery and Electrical Bureau, who alone was alleged to be responsible for the huge trading losses on the London Metals Exchange, according to the sources. Several other companies which also suffered losses were also under investigation. "The futures trading losses in Shanghai made the Beijing government realise that commodity trading was becoming a casino for rich individuals and government companies," said a trader in Beijing. Sources close to Mr Zhu, an advocate of strong central government action and discipline, claim he was furious with the losses made as a result of speculation in Shanghai. "The futures markets were intended originally for price monitoring, not market speculation. The markets were totally misused when people thought they could become rich overnight on commodity market speculation, said the traders. As a result, the central government has further tightened controls on trading in metals as well as other commodities. All foreign currency allocations needed for letters of credits in the commodities field must now be approved by the People's Bank and other relevant central authorities. In addition, several metal futures departments of Shanghai companies were closed. In the last two years traders could get letters of credit from Chinese banks that organised currency on provincial swap markets opening the door for favours and special relationships between commodity traders and swap centres' foreign currency allocation managers. Beijing wanted to stop this practice and recentralise decisions. The huge losses in Shanghai are not unique. Mr Zhu was reportedly equally furious when during a recent inspection tour of provinces in northern China he discovered that enormous steel orders had been made with Russia outside central government plans and without Beijing's knowledge. Last year, China also suffered huge losses when large amounts of steel were imported to feed the building industry. Hong Kong traders made a fortune in deals with Chinese companies which stockpiled steel only to see the building industry and prices collapse. Steel exports to China this year have fallen dramatically. But the central government was said to have been particularly annoyed at the recent Shanghai case as traders were speculating with orders for strategic stockpile reserves, for which selected trustworthy Chinese companies can buy on behalf of the government. The huge copper orders were for government reserves. The Ministry of Finance now has to foot the bill for commodity reserves. which were purchased at the highest possible world prices. Mr Zhu is now on a confrontation course with the leading brokerage houses that were main advocates of commodity future markets.
