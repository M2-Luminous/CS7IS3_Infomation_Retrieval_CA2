Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of ARATS, and Chiao Jen-ho, vice chairman and secretary general of SEF, made the remarks at a press conference right after their meeting here this afternoon. It was the second meeting between the two side since Chiao Jen-ho arrived here Monday. Zou Zhekai, vice president and secretary general of ARATS, was also in attendance. The name of the document, or the declaration, has not been decided yet, the said. The document will consist of two major aspects: first, important understanding reached between the two organs during this talk, including "to continue to insist on the non-governmental nature of the discussions and that neither side should force upon the other its political viewpoints in discussions of such issues as the repatriation of plane hijackers"; secondly, visible progress in discussion of the issues of the repatriation of hijackers, the treatment of maritime fishing disputes, and repatriation of other personnel who have crossed the straits in violation of relevant regulations. Both sides regarded their meeting as being harmonious and frank and sad that the gap between them is shortening after exchange of views. Deputy secretary generals of the two organizations will team up two working groups and start to discuss concerned details tomorrow. Tang reiterated that the possibility of signing a non-governmental agreement in the future to guarantee the investment on both sides is not excluded. The premise for realizing such an agreement is that Taiwan must open its market for manufactured or partially manufactured goods of the mainland, cancel restrictions on Taiwan businessmen's investment on the mainland and open its labor market, Tang pointed out. He suggested that the two organs should discuss, as soon as possible, such issues as the rights and interests of Taiwan investors on the mainland and related issues, scientific and technological exchanges and the sponsoring of non-governmental economic fairs. Economic exchange and cooperation has become an important content of the relations between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits, Tang noted. The investment of Taiwan entrepreneurs on the mainland played a positive role in contributing to the economic prosperity of the mainland and the trade between the two sides reached a new level last year, he said. In 1993, Taiwan's surplus with the United States declined, and its trade deficit with Japan continued to rise. However, its trade retained a rather large surplus last year. Tang pointed out that this had much to do with the soaring trade between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits. Other sides agree that cultural and educational exchanges between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits should be broadened in principle. ARATS will organize visits to the island by the mainlands news media officials, senior journalists and students this year, Tang aid. At the same time, ARATS is ready to receive mass media officials and senior journalists and students from Taiwan, he said.
