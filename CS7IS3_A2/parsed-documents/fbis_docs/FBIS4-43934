The Zairean ambassador to France, Baya Ramazani, explained to Luc Lemonnier why he entirely approves of France's intervention: [Begin recording] [Ramazani] This is not an intervention against one ethnic group or another, but to end genocide. It is easy to moan and wonder who is criminal and who is not, but the problem we are facing clearly is to put an end to genocide. [Lemonnier] Do you think France is suited to lead this intervention? [Ramazani] I don't think there is one country better than another to end this genocide. It is up to the international community to do something. We cannot observe passively what is going on. Zaire has agreed, within the framework of this intervention, to put operational bases at the disposal of the UN forces. I don't think it will be an easy operation, but it is necessary. Should we continue to denounce the genocide and do nothing? [end recording]
