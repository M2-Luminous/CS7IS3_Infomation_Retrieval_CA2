"It is critical to preserve the current overall combination of coalition partners by reviving the memory of the initial objective of the coalition," Hosokawa told Muneaki Samejima, the deputy secretary general of his Japan New Party. However, Hosokawa, who made a surprise resignation announcement on Friday over his personal financial deals, hinted it is also crucial to win over new defectors from the No. 1 opposition LDP saying, "it is important to have more new forces defect to our side." Hosokawa's coalition stripped the LDP of its 38-year lock on power last August after dozens of LDP rebels splintered from the scandal-tainted party and joined the anti-LDP alliance. In the campaign period that led up to the 1993 general election that brought him to power, Hosokawa made it clear that his chief aim was to oust the LDP, thereby revamping the political structure in place since 1955. In a lecture meeting Tuesday afternoon in a Tokyo hotel, Hosokawa said he does not want to see Japan's power structure transformed back into the "1955 structure," where the LDP used to monopolize power on the basis of its pro-business, pro-U.S. economic and security policies. He said, "although some politicians have proposed making Japan a `normal country' or a `country that shines,' or proposed getting social democrats and liberals together, these ideas are a mere ideological carryover from the now-defunct 1955 structure in which political debate was dominated by constitutional and security issues." He was apparently referring to phrases coined by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa who warned that the international community would not regard Japan as a "normal country" unless it assumed greater responsibility in the field of U.N. peacekeeping operations. His reference to the phrase "a country that shines" revolved around Sakigake [Harbinger] leader Takemura's slogan that Japan would still receive respect from the international community even if it avoided taking a greater part in U.N. peacekeeping missions. "Now that moves toward a reconfiguration of the political community have gained momentum since my announcement of the intention to step down, (the coalition) should unify themselves into a new party with their emphasis placed on a transformation of the nation's economic structure," he said. However, Hosokawa sided with the position of Ozawa in dealing with Japan's defense policy in the face of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program. "We have to conduct domestic preparations so that we can respond appropriately to moves to be taken by the U.N. Security Council and relevant countries," he said. He called for speeding up the process of toughening the relevant laws in advance in preparation for possible U.N. adoption of a resolution slapping economic sanctions on North Korea. As for the burgeoning intracoalition hostilities over policies and ideologies, Hosokawa cautioned that the coalition might not be able to survive the current political turbulence which he compared to a storm at sea. "Now that we are running a revolutionary government, we will not be able to survive the current storm unless we suspend the `theological dispute,' saying I like this man or dislike that person and taking issue with others' political tendencies or tactics," he said.
