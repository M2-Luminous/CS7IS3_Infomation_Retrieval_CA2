Our first question was whether Rabinovich shared the assessment of American officials that some dramatic or rapid progress had been made in the Syrian-Israeli dialogue? [Rabinovich] No, I do not think that we should create an impression of dramatic progress. I think that several important things happened during the secretary of state's last visit. There were also some slight disappointments. A window of opportunity has been opened -- the secretary of state is arriving in Europe in the middle of the month and he can easily fly to the Middle East. Since some degree of progress was nevertheless made in the last round of shuttle trips between Damascus and Jerusalem, I think that everyone -- the Syrians, Israelis, and also the Americans -- thought that this window of opportunity should be taken advantage of. However, this does not necessarily indicate any dramatic progress in the negotiations. [Friedman] The term window of opportunity sounds like a very diplomatic expression to us. What is the size of this window and what opportunities can be seen through it? [Rabinovich] This window has a time frame of several days and the opportunity lies in the very fact of the secretary's arrival. When Secretary of State Christopher was here last time, he knew he would be returning to Europe in the middle of May to discuss issues related to Bosnia. Therefore, a proposal to hold the next round of negotiations in the region in mid-May was already raised then. This indeed is happening. [Friedman] You earlier spoke of the encouraging signs that the secretary of state discerned during his stay in Damascus. Perhaps you could tell us what those signs were? [Rabinovich] The positive side of what took place during the secretary's last visit was that the Syrians for the first time came out with a comprehensive, detailed, and substantial reaction to all the components of our package. A reaction which was quite novel in some aspects. This is the positive side of things. The other two less positive facets are first and foremost the fact that the Syrians started off by adopting a tough negotiating position. There is a significant gap between the package we presented and the Syrian reaction. Second, the Syrians still refuse to relate to our proposals as a package. They still believe they can take the package's six components, extract those specific elements that are of interest to them -- such as the issue of withdrawal -- and focus exclusively on them. Our position was and remains that we are discussing a comprehensive package that must be treated as a whole. [Friedman] Professor Rabinovich, you are still officially the head of the Syrian-Israeli bilateral committee which has not convened for a long time. Are we fated to be in a situation where any progress in the Syrian-Israeli track, in the event that such progress indeed takes place, can only be made when Secretary of State Christopher finds some free time on his agenda? [Rabinovich] If one looks at the last nine months, the talks had a certain rhythm where momentum was created by the secretary of state's visits to the region or by the summit meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. This momentum could then be translated into limited progress at the Washington talks; progress which could then be exploited in turn during the next visit. This was the talks' rhythm. Since not enough momentum has accrued to justify another round of negotiations in Washington, the talks have not been convened. We all hope that the upcoming visit will effect sufficient progress to justify holding another round of talks in Washington which will prove fruitful and constructive. We do not want to hold an empty round of talks. [Dan] Prof. Rabinovich, a headline on the front page of HA'ARETZ reports that Israel has asked for $5 billion from the United States as financial compensation for returning the Golan Heights. Can you confirm this report? [Rabinovich] No, I do not think that we want to get into any details. Speculation is rampant; however, the discussion was held in a very limited forum and I think that it is both preferable and possible that work on such a hypothetical aid package be conducted quietly. One must remember that this whole matter is conditional on both parties actually reaching an agreement and beginning to implement its arrangements. Everything is hypothetical and it is too early to start discussing details. Even if the details appearing in various articles are not accurate, I would prefer not to comment on them. [Friedman] We are left with a lot of speculation and very little information. Thank you, Professor Rabinovich.
