A statement released by the DSSM says that this message was sent to the Serbs in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] because some census collectors are trying to register the Serbs on forms printed in Macedonian, with the assistance of an official interpreter, which is in contravention of the Law on the Census applied to citizens belonging to national communities.
