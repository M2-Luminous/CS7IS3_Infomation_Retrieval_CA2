Was this necessary? [Kohl] Of course, an ad hoc program, a crash program is essential in the current situation. The program on principles, that the Congress in Hamburg will also adopt, defines our principles, which are the principles of the social market economy, which is what we stand in for. However, at the moment we are facing quite unique problems. We are not only faced with an economic crisis but with a deep structural slump. We now have to pay for the mistakes that were made in our society in two or three decades, which is why we must press for rapid changes. Let me give you one example: Our main problem -- unemployment -- could be tackled much more quickly. At the moment there are somewhat more than 4 million people without work in Germany, which is too many, far too many. Hence, we have to stimulate the economy to protect jobs and create new jobs. Still, we have an example in our immediate vicinity -- the Netherlands, and they can be compared with us. In the Netherlands, 34 percent of all jobs are part-time jobs, while in Germany it is no more than 14 percent. There are 2.5 million Germans who would like to work part-time and who do have employment. So something could be changed quickly. We have created the legal conditions. The state -- this also applies to us, the federal, laender, and local governments -- the companies, and trade unions must now try to create new jobs for those who are interested in part-time work. [Wickert] In your address you almost sounded like a leader of the opposition. You spoke of decades of controversy, of over-regulations, that is too say too much bureaucracy. Yet, you have been in power for 12 years. So could you not have changed a thing or two? [Kohl] The problems as far as over-regulation are concerned are not only problems of the past 10 years. [Wickert] Still, you could have changed something. [Kohl] But we did. First of all, I would like to say that I was not putting the blame on anybody. We have discussed railway reform since 1959, and now it has been put into practice. This is certainly an achievement of Helmut Kohl. We have talked about postal reform for decades. Both reforms are important conditions for securing Germany's future, which have now finally been implemented. In the years in which I was able to work without potential outside influence, so to speak, the years 1983-1989 -- we reduced state debts to almost 45 percent, created 3 million new jobs.... [Wickert, interrupting] Still, Germany's debts have never been higher than they are now. [Kohl] This is a classic journalistic claim, which is correct even though it is not the truth. [Wickert] So what is it? [Kohl] Just listen, I am going to explain it. First of all, one must look at the situation before we had German unity. Before it, we did, of course, reduce state debts. And without the policy we pursued between 1983 and 1989, we would not even have been able to make the current necessary investments in the new laender. Everything we are now investing in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, and everywhere else is, of course, an investment in the future. Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, and Thuringia will be blossoming landscapes tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, which will most likely be of advantage for all of Germany. [Wickert] Do you not regret the statement of the blossoming landscapes? [Kohl] Not at all, because it is true. Excuse me, but why should I be sorry about that statement. Even today you can see in large parts of the new laender that things are truly developing in a positive way. What is true is that developments have taken place more slowly. I was wrong on this point, and I have admitted it. It is the number of years -- it does not matter whether I say four of five years. Still, Mr. Wickert, it is also part of the truth that when I was making that statement, I started from the assumption that, as the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] did, we would export goods to the Soviet Union worth 20-25 billion German marks [DM]. However, the Soviet Union has disappeared, has ceased to exist. And now we only export DM5 billion worth in goods, and with Hermes export guarantees, at that. So I am maintaining this statement; one only has to add a few more years. But what difference does it make, whether it is four of five, or eight or 10 years? We have achieved Germany unity, freedom for all Germans -- and this is the real achievement. And nobody would like to turn back the clock, not even my severest critics would deny that we pursued the right course. [Wickert] You have just mentioned the Soviet Union. You were on the telephone with Boris Yeltsin yesterday, and, I suppose, the main issue in your talks was Bosnia. The success of the ultimatum is obvious. Yet, now Germany also has to contribute its energy. Are you ready to exert your influence, particularly on the Croats? [Kohl] What we have achieved so far has something to do with our influence, and, above all, with mine. I am happy that, for the first time -- I am not saying that it will be a success -- there is a real opportunity for achieving a peaceful solution. This would not have been possible without the contribution of the Russians. Now the Russians are there, and the Americans have committed themselves more than ever, and so have the French and British. Within the framework of our possibilities, among others within the European Community, we must also bring our influence to bear. And we must do it together with others. I hope that, beyond Sarajevo, it will be possible to reach a plan for all of Bosnia, that means that other.... [Wickert, interrupting] But that means to exert pressure. [Kohl] Yes, and I am in favor of keeping up the pressure. Still, now I am starting from a vision that I hope will become reality, namely that, over the next few weeks and months, we will achieve a carefully worked out overall plan, with the parties to the conflict -- the Croats, Muslims, and Serbs -- and that the major powers will then guarantee, so to speak, what Boris Yeltsin and others have now suggested. For the first time, I can now see a real chance, which is why the pressure has to be maintained. Since we have a special relationship of confidence, it is our main duty to talk to the Muslims and Croats. After all, it is these two groups, in particular, that want the Germans to participate in the negotiations and help protect their interests. [Wickert] It will probably take longer to solve the Bosnia problem than to conduct the election campaign: The election will be held in October. Some have already complained about the mudslinging. Are you ready to participate in that mudslinging? [Kohl] I am not engaged in such mudslinging. You know, I would say that those who are actually engaged in mudslinging are those who complain most about it. I am not engaged in mudslinging. I am in favor of discussing concepts and ideas, and who is able to show the better path into the future. Still, if I talk about the future, I also have to talk about the present, and I cannot disconnect the present from the past. We are currently facing the challenge of filling concrete positions. And he who agrees to being a candidate for the office of federal president must accept questions regarding what he did in a crucial era of German history, namely the past few years, what he did regarding the relationship with our fellow citizens in what used to be the GDR. I am opposed to mudslinging. I am also against digging up Stasi files from early morning to night. The results are quite often detestable and disgusting, and I do not get any satisfaction from it.
