However, in a statement to the Bahraini paper AL-AYYAM today, Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi noted that this agreement places the Palestinian side [words indistinct] in a difficult position because it does not address the issue of the continued Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories. Rather, he said, the agreement gives Israel more reasons to justify its denial of the Palestinian rights to self-determination, independent statehood, and repatriation. He said that he believes that this agreement can be dealt with while maintaining inalienable Palestinian rights. He noted that this can be achieved through effecting a national unity among the various political factions on a democratic basis. Talking about the situation inside the Palestinian home, the Palestinian negotiator expressed satisfaction with what is going on between Palestinian officials and the Palestinian opposition. He said that the next phase requires the PLO apparatus, which was established on the basis of an armed struggle, to make unusual preparations. Now it must adapt itself for the next phase.
