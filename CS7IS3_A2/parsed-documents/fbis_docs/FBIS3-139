The UNITA president noted once again that Huambo must not be the (?headquarters) of Angola's division. Huambo is just a rearguard base so they do not kill all of us, Dr. Jonas Savimbi said. He called on the cadres (?to be organized) and to look after human and material resources. This four-day seminar ended 26 February. During the seminar, the cadres discussed with honesty and in depth the problems faced by areas under their responsibility. [passage omitted]
