Revenues totalled 358 billion ($11.93 billion) and expenditures 356.9 billion ($11.89 billion) Czech korunas, Kocarnik reported. He noted that some minor modification in the figures could occur by January 21, but the surplus balance of the budget would not change, Kocarnik added. The budget includes a surplus on the clearing account with Slovakia amounting to 4.6 billion Czech korunas ($15 million). "This means that the final state budget would be higher by this sum," Kocarnik said. "In view of the implementation of the new taxation system I assess the result as unequivocally successful, as another successful transformation step which positively contributed to the entire stability of prices, and had an anti-inflationary effect," Kocarnik stressed.
