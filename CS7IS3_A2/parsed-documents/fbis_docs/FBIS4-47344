SERIYA: FIZIKA-TEKHNICHNYKH NAVUK Russian CSO [Article by V. A. Kuznetsov, V. A. Generalova, V. P. Kolenenkov; UDC 550.4:546.7:796(476)] [Abstract] While areas of primary introduction of radioactive materials have been studied, secondary regions (where radioactive material has been introduced by geological and geochemical processes) have not. Studies of the rivers of southeast Belarus revealed the collection of radioactive material in sedimentation of terrigenic material, from organic and clay formations, and in soils in the humus, ortstein, and illuvial layers, as well as in various alluvial facies. Channel central, and terrace flood plains were studied, as well as terraces above the flood plain. A table lists the location (geological formation), facies conditions, precipitation, the isotope and concentration, and examples of specific locations in Belarus. The ratio of present radioactivity to the 1986 and 1989 background is 2-5, and more rarely, 10. However, higher levels may be found along shorelines. Wind and water drive dust particles and aerosols to shorelines where they accumulate. It is recommended that radiometric surveying be done every 5-7 years.
