Blazevic: "We Do Not Want To Give Up a Single Inch of Croatian Territory!"] [Text] Sibenik -- "If the enemy should even think of firing a single shell at Sibenik again, I can tell him with full responsibility that he will not fire again!" This was the message addressed by Janko Bobetko, the head of the Croatian Army General Staff, to the members of the 113th Sibenik brigade at a ceremony on the occasion of its third anniversary. Before soldiers, officers, noncommissioned officers, and numerous guests -- including Vinko Nikolic, personal envoy of the Croatian president; Josip Juras, deputy defense minister; General Ante Gotovina, commander of the Split Military Region; Admiral Sveto Letica, General Milivoj Petkovic, General Ivan Basarac, as well as the president of the County of Sibenik, and the mayor of Sibenik -- Colonel Milan Perkovic, the commander of the 113th brigade, recalled the days when the Sibenik brigade was established. He mentioned that the brigade had participated in the defense of Lisane, Velika Glava and Dubravica as early as July and August 1991. He stated that the first shells against Chetniks were fired on 1 August 1991. "A real undertaking was, however, the battle for Sibenik in September 1991," he said. This already historic battle is considered the key turning point in the war for the independent Croatia. Nos Kalik was liberated in March 1992, but the liberation of Miljevacki Plateau in June 1992 is, according to Perkovic, the most important victory achieved by the 113th brigade. The brigade was not only active in the territory of its county, it also participated in battles on the southern front, Stolovi, or the Zadar hinterland. According to Colonel Perkovic this brigade is still ready to accomplish every task assigned to it. In his address to the soldiers, guests, and the inhabitants of Sibenik, Janko Bobetko said: "Why did the enemy choose Sibenik of all places as his aim? This is not a coincidence, this was the place where they wanted to begin the materialization of the dream of a Greater Serbia. They knew that this would be the strongest infliction on the dignity of Croatian people. They wanted to split Croatia into two parts at this point; they wanted to become masters of Sibenik. The second blow was directed at Zadar, and the third one should have been aimed at the Neretva River. Croatia would have been subjugated in this way, it would have lost its sea and its coast, it would have lost its islands and its connection to the world. They had been working on these plans for years. They waited for a favorable moment to achieve their aim. If the brave men from Sibenik and all over Croatia had not realized that that was a historic moment, if they had not been decisive, we would read in papers today: 'The Croats used to live here!' Sibenik must know that its famous history has been continued, that it has defended itself, that it has defended Croatia. If Sibenik had fallen, events would have probably unfolded in a completely different way," Bobetko said and repeated his message addressed to Martic and "his hen hawks," as he called them: "If they dared attack Sibenik -- the heart of Croatia -- once again, we would strike back with full force." "We have provided irrefutable evidence that Croatia supports peaceful solutions; we have made concessions, but we have retained our national right to liberate our territory. Let us do everything in order to retain our territory, since history does not allow us to give up a single inch of our territory. We only have to decide when to do that. We shall go into this battle in order to expel the enemy from sacred Croatian territory," Bobetko concluded. In the end he said that this is a year of big historical events, during which the Croatian army and Croatian people need support and unity. Josip Juras, the deputy defense minister, added that 113th brigade was a famous elite brigade that defeated the notorious 9th Knin Corps and brought Mladic's troops to a halt. This occasion was used to promote and award soldiers, officers and noncommissioned officers. The guests visited an exhibition of photographs by Sime Strikoman from the war itinerary of the 113th brigade. A wreath was laid on the grave of dead soldiers from the 113th brigade.
