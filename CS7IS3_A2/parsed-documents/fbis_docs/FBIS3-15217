The Russian diplomat said his country's position is based on the U.N. resolutions and documents as well as the final act of the 1975 Helsinki conference, under the terms of which the post-war status quo must be preserved in Europe. Svirin also pointed out that the agreement on the principles of bilateral relations concluded between Estonia and Russia in 1991 stipulates that both parties respect one another's territorial integrity. Svirin told BNS at the press conference that, if Estonia also in the future refuses to demarcate the land border, Russia "will be forced to do it unilaterally." "Allow me to remind you that Estonia was the first to station its border guards on the present borderline in 1992," the Russian diplomat said. "The border between Estonia and Russia runs along its present line, and fruitless discussions about the issue may further strain the relations between our countries." Vaino Reinart, head of the Estonian delegation for talks with Russia, announced that Estonia proposed during the 17th round of talks to discuss the border issue and the interpretation of the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty in the Hague Court. "Regrettably, the Russian delegation rejected our proposal," Reinart said. Svirin affirmed that Russia does not consider it necessary to take the border issue to the Hague Court. He said, however, that Estonia "has of course the right to approach the court."
