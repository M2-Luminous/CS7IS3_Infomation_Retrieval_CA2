The struggle between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's northern troops and those of his southern rival Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid was concentrated for the fourth day running on al-'Anad, a giant air base 60 kilometres (36 miles) north of here. An AFP correspondent reported that al-Bid's troops were defending the base from its southern perimetre against onslaughts from northern rivals on the other side in a battle which has become the focal point of the war. There were heavy artillery exchanges around the base and in nearby mountains and automatic weapons fire could be heard from inside. Aid workers also reported heavy fighting further east at Abyan, where around 100 wounded were admitted to hospitals on Thursday alone. Foreigners still stranded in al-Bid's stronghold Aden flocked to the docks desperate for a boat passage out, with all roads to the north blocked and the airport closed. About 300 arrived early to complete lengthy customs regulations. One group was trying to get aboard a Russian ship ready to set off, and the others had been impatiently waiting since the beginning of the week for an Indian boat to unload its cargo of corn. "Each morning we come here, we wait and in the evening we return to our hotel," one of them said. The Russian consul and his Chinese counterpart, the only two diplomats still remaining in the city, were trying to process their nationals as the temperature climbed to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). A Belgian businessman, known to everyone just as Patrick, was trying to deal with all the other foreign nationals, mainly Indians, Americans, Iranians and Belgians as well as a few Yemenis. The fighting around Aden was jeopardising plans to send a UN relief convoy to Somali refugees trapped in crossfire at the al-Kawd camp on a beach near Zinjibar, 50 kilometers (32 miles) northeast of the city. Rolf Guldberg, UN High Commissioner for Refugees representative in Sanaa, said the camp was in a "war zone" and supplies would only be sent once fighting eased. He hoped it would set off from Sanaa in the next few days. The United Nations had no precise figure on the total number of Somali refugees or casualties but would be trying to provide food for 4,000, the estimated number there before the Yemeni civil began on May 5. The refugees say hundreds have died in the crossfire. The Somalis fled to Yemen to escape the civil war which erupted in their Horn of Africa country three years ago, but have now found themselves caught up in a new conflict. Hundreds of refugees meanwhile flooded into Aden fleeing fighting in the surrounding mountains and countryside. The United Nations said there were at least 1,500 in Aden, and it was providing them with food. Meanwhile, a senior official from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said they had already started to visit prisoner of war camps, and hoped to complete the inspections next week. Arnold Luethold, regional ICRC director for the Arabian peninsula, gave no precise figure for war casualties or internees but said they had counted hundreds of POWs.
