[passage omitted] [WORLD MEDIA] The anniversary of the landings has also brought to mind the impressive entry of the United States onto the European scene. What kind of military role should the United States be playing in Europe now? [Kohl] The connection with the North American democracies and the U.S. presence in Europe are visible symbols for Europeans of the values shared on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as the basis for defending peace and security in Europe. I am pleased, therefore, that, at the recent NATO summit, President Clinton renewed the commitment to maintain 100,000 troops in Europe. An active transatlantic alliance, along with the European Union, is a fundamental condition for ensuring that the new European democracies can be brought into the Western community. [Mitterrand] The vitality of the connection between the United States and Europe is a basic element of our security, and the U.S. military presence in Europe illustrates this connection. Therefore, during the current discussions on NATO's development, I always defended the view that nothing should be done that would divert the alliance from its fundamental task of being a security guarantee for its members. Of course, this should not prevent the Europeans from creating a common defense. We have made progress here too. I had the feeling at the recent Atlantic summit that our overseas partners understood that strengthening the Western European Union [WEU] is not aimed at weakening NATO, but that it represents Europe's desire to accept the responsibility for its own security and defense and that it leads to it being able to provide long-term guarantees in harmony with the preamble to the North Atlantic Treaty. [WORLD MEDIA] France and Germany have agreed to establish a joint military force, a "European Corps." In your opinion, is this the nucleus for a future European army? [Kohl] By creating a European unit, President Mitterrand and myself wanted, from the very beginning, to give a European aspect to close Franco-German cooperation. Since then, our invitation to the WEU states to take part in units has been accepted by Belgium, and Spanish membership is being discussed. The European unit will operate in 1995, and it already represents a successful model for European military structures. It is strengthening both the WEU and European involvement in NATO. It may also be a prototype for further European units within the increasingly closer Union. I am especially pleased that President Mitterrand has invited German, French, and Belgian units to Paris for a parade on 14 July. [Mitterrand] My answer is clearly, yes. Will the embryo grow and will a European army be born from it? Time will answer this question. I believe, however, that the progressive establishment of a truly European defense body, supplied with the necessary equipment and serving common aims will, at the appropriate moment, be a real gauge of the European Union's success. [WORLD MEDIA] The recent commemorations reminded us that the United States plays a significant role in European politics, culture, and society. How does this role appear to you? Does it symbolize current relations between the United States and Europe? [Kohl] The transatlantic bridge that links us firmly with the United States and Canada had, primarily, a security significance during the Cold War. Now, we must make this bridge more passable and intensify cooperation in spheres such as the economy, culture, and science. First and foremost, the intensity of the exchanges between young people, who could reinforce friendship across the Atlantic, is important. [Mitterrand] The United States has an important position in Europe on all levels. This is given by its qualities, dynamism, and creativity. It is also given, of course, by its economic strength and the size of its market. Our most major competitors are here, which is intensified even more by our nonuniformity. Despite this, we in Europe have at our disposal considerable creative potential in technology, science, culture, art, and so on. As far as I am concerned, I consider this fact to be one of the other reasons for strengthening the European Union and this may then enhance the dialogue between Europe and the United States.
