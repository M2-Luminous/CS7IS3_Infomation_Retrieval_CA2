It is nothing new to say that these newspapers have adopted Zionist stances. For many years the Arab reactionary countries have been funding with their petrodollars not only hireling newspapers and propaganda trumpets, but also the bullets that are fired at the breasts of the Muslim Palestinian revolutionaries. These hireling newspapers of the reactionary countries in the region occasionally fabricate news that Tehran wishes to resume ties with Cairo. By publishing these venomous reports, international Zionism, which dictates stances to these agent newspapers, seeks to achieve several goals. Fabricating such reports is designed to suggest that officials in the Islamic Republic of Iran are not serious about their hostile position toward Zionism and that the desire to restore relations with the Camp David regime in Cairo indicates that they are inwardly inclined toward normalizing relations with the Zionist camp. Such moves would distort the image of the holy Islamic republican regime in Iran, which is one of Zionism's main goals. Another objective behind the attempts of these hireling newspapers is to dishearten the Muslim revolutionaries in the Arab world and to quell the confrontation with Zionism and the agent governments in the region. They also aim to suggest that the leaders of the Islamic revolution have reached this conclusion too, and so they want to recognize the Camp David government in Cairo, and, consequently, may reconsider their position on the Zionist entity. The third goal is to legitimize the Zionist entity in Islamic public opinion and try to make the international Islamic revival look like a futile attempt that leads nowhere. Since we consider that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the base of the international Islamic revival, spreading doubts and despair among the Islamic public about this regime's positions is considered the most important issue in the Islamic world. Portraying the Islamic revival movement as futile offers the greatest support for Zionism. Islamic revolution leader Ayatollah Khamene'i's unequivocal and firm stand on important international and Islamic world issues, particularly those dealing with confronting America and supporting the Muslim Palestinian and Lebanese revolutionaries against the Zionist entity that occupies Palestine, has always been the main factor in confronting and foiling the media schemes of the enemies of the Islamic revolution. Regarding the resumption of ties between Tehran and Cairo, the Islamic revolution leader adopts a firm and unequivocal stand on this issue, exposing the true nature of this regime which is hostile to Islam and dominates Egypt. He defined the Islamic Republic's foreign policy to our diplomatic institutions. The London-based Arabic newspaper AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT claimed recently that Iran's first vice president discussed with Syrian officials during his recent visit to Damascus the resumption of ties with Cairo. The paper also claimed that the Syrian officials expressed satisfaction with the progress of these talks during their meeting with the Egyptian prime minister. The first vice president's office refuted these claims and said that the Iranian and Syrian officials did not discuss ties between Tehran and Cairo. Naturally, adopting a firm and decisive stand on the traitorous Egyptian Government requires genuine faith in this issue; such a government will fall because it is separated from its people, is subservient to satanic forces, and is hostile to Islam. The foreign diplomatic agencies of the Iranian Islamic Republic adopt firm and honest stances in the excercise of foreign policy. Even Westerners themselves realize that the Cairo regime is dying and believe that the situation of the Mubarak government is very similar to that of the shah's government in 1978. By accusing the Islamic Republic of Iran of having a desire to resume ties with the Egyptian Government, the hireling newspapers and media that serve the reactionary countries in the region seek to save the Camp David rulers in Cairo from the crushing blows that the domestic opposition is dealing them.
