On June 9, 1994, International Securities Clearing Corporation (``ISCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the Federal Register on June 22, 1994. 2 No comments were received on the notice. As discussed below, the Commission is temporarily approving the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis through July 18, 1995. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s (b)(1) (1988). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34222, International Series Release No. 674 (June 16, 1994), 59 FR 32254. I. Description In 1986, ISCC and the London Stock Exchange (``LSE'') entered into a linkage agreement which allows ISCC to obtain comparison and settlement services in the United Kingdom from the LSE on behalf of ISCC members. Pursuant to this linkage agreement, ISCC is responsible for paying for all securities believed. ISCC has no requirement to complete open pending trades. 3 On July 18, 1994, the LSE is moving to a ten day rolling settlement cycle with trades settling ten days after trade date. 4 In response to this change, ISCC is adjusting its method of calculating its clearing fund requirements. 5 3 ISCC is not responsible for trades that are scheduled to settle after the day of default of an ISCC member. Agreement, dated December 22, 1988, between ISCC and LSE. 4 Currently, the LSE settles trades on a fortnightly basis with all trades that occur during a two-week period settling on the same day. 5 Currently, ISCC collects three percent of member's average gross settlement value over two account periods on a biweekly basis. This figure represents both market risk and foreign exchange risk. As of July 18, 1994, the clearing fund deposit will be calculated and collected on a weekly basis. The calculation will be made on Tuesday and collected within three days. Therefore, ISCC will collect clearing fund deposits prior to the settlement day. ISCC bases its clearing fund calculations on the assumption that it will take one day to sell all of a defaulting participant's positions. This results in an eleven day exposure for market risk with ten days between trade date and settlement date and one day between settlement date and close out of positions. There also will be a one day exposure for foreign exchange risk. (ISCC will convert U.S. dollars into British pounds on settlement day and will convert the proceeds from the close out of positions into U.S. dollars the next day.) The formula, therefore, is the sum of two components_the amount collected to cover market risk and the foreign exchange factor. To calculate the amount of clearing fund deposit attributable to market risk, ISCC establishes a market risk factor which is the largest percentage change over eleven days in the Financial Times Index over a minimum of 365 days. Initially, the market risk factor will be set at seven percent. 6 The market risk factor is multiplied by the largest single daily gross debit value for the applicable week less 15% of the Institutional Net Settlement (``INS'') receive value for that day based on debit values for the calendar week following the week in which the calculation is performed (``adjusted gross debit value''). 7 6 ISCC will review annually the market risk factor. 7 Under the INS system, redeliveries of securities from the ISCC member to institutional participants can occur automatically through the LSE. Therefore, ISCC generally is not required to pay the LSE for these securities. These debits are offset only partially because these items may be reclaimed by the receiver, and in such circumstance, ISCC is liable to the LSE for the full value of the reclamation. The foreign exchange factor is calculated by multiplying the adjusted gross debit value by the largest one day percentage change in the U.S. Dollar-British Pound foreign exchange rate over a minimum of 365 days (``estimated foreign exchange volatility''). 8 The product is then reduced by the product of the adjusted gross debit value times the estimated foreign exchange volatility times the market risk factor. The reduction is made because the risk of foreign exchange is on the amount of money converted into U.S. dollars after sale of the securities not on the entire amount of dollars ISCC originally converted into British pounds. 8 During the period from 1989 to 1992, the maximum fluctuation in the U.S. Dollar-British Pound exchange rate was 4.445%. Initially, this number will be used in calculating the foreign exchange factor. ISCC will review annually the foreign exchange risk factor.
