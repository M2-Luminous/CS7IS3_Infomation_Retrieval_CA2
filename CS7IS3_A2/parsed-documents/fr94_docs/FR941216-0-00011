The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;26&hyph;01 Learjet: Amendment 39&hyph;9097. Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;210&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 24, 25, 31, 35, 36, and 55 series airplanes, and Model 28 and 29 airplanes; equipped with Allied Signal outflow/safety valves, number 130406&hyph;1 or 102850&hyph;5; as identified in Allied Signal Aerospace Alert Service Bulletin 130406&hyph;21&hyph;A4011, Revision 2, dated September 28, 1994; or 102850&hyph;21&hyph;A4021, Revision 2, dated October 6, 1994; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent rapid decompression of the airplane due to cracking and subsequent failure of certain outflow/safety valves, accomplish the following: (a) Within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, revise the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include the following. This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM. ``Operation of the airplane at any altitude above 41,000 feet is prohibited.'' (b) Replacement of outflow/safety valves, part numbers 130406&hyph;1 and 102850&hyph;5, as identified in Allied Signal Aerospace Alert Service Bulletin 130406&hyph;21&hyph;A4011, Revision 2, dated September 28, 1994, or 102850&hyph;21&hyph;A4021, Revision 2, dated October 6, 1994, as applicable; with a serviceable part in accordance with the procedures described in the applicable alert service bulletin; constitutes terminating action for the AFM limitation required by paragraph (a) of this AD. Following such replacement, that AFM limitation may be removed from the AFM.

(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Operations Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Los Angeles ACO.
