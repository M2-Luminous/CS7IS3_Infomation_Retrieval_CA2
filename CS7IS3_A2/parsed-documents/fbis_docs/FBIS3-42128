The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 1 a 400-word report from Washingon in connection with a U.S. plan to replace the existing Cobra helicopters deployed in South Korea with new Apache helicopters and to send an aircraft carrier to South Korea in addition to deploying Patriot missiles. The report, quoting THE WASHINGTON POST dated 27 January, notes the Clinton Administration's plan to replace the existing Cobra Helicopter unit deployed in South Korea with two new-type Apache helicopter battalions. The report also quotes THE WASHINGTON POST as reporting that "the Clinton Administration is ready to approve the plan to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea requested by General Gary E. Luck, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, but it is now waiting for the ROK Government's final approval." The report continues to quote the U.S. paper as reporting that the ROK Government worries that the deployment of Patriot missiles "would irritate North Korea." The report also quotes THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that "the U.S. Defense Department is considering deploying an aircraft carrier on the waters near the Korean peninsula." The report quotes THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that General Gary E. Luck requested one Patriot missile battalion which consists of "64 launching platforms, 256 Patriot missiles, and special radar devices which are capable of tracing several targts simultaneously." HANGUK ILBO also carries on page 5 a 500-word article by Wsshington-based correspondent Chong Il-hwa on performance data of the Patriot missile and a 500-word article by reporter Yi Sang-won on that of North Korea's Nodong-1 long-range missile. Noting in detail the formidable performance of the Patriot missile as demonstrated during the Gulf war, the article by correspondent Chong Il-hwa describes the process of the upgrading of the Patriot system. The article by reporter Yi Sang-won notes that North Korea's Nodong-1 missile was reportedly developed from the former Soviet Union's surface-to-surface Scud missile developed in the 1980's and that it is reportedly now deployed for use in an actual war. The article notes the performance of the Nodong-1 missile, including its size and range, adding that North Korea is reported "to possess 12 to 18 Nodong-1 missiles at present." The article also cites that the Nodong-2 missile is now in the developmental stage. HANGUK ILBO carries on page 7 an 800-word article by Washington- based correspondent Chong Chin-sok on the reasons for the pending U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK. Noting the recent "hardline" moves by the U.S. Government in connection with the North Korean nuclear issue such as the pending U.S. plan to deploy the Patriot missile to the ROK, the CIA director's secret visit to Seoul, and U.S. Government officials' strong-worded remarks on the North Korean nuclear issue, the article says: "People hold that these moves are probably either a sort of nuclear negotiation card to apply pressure on North Korea or a political card for U.S. domestic purposes." The article says, however, the fact that the hardline moves against North Korea have been led by the Department of Defense and the CIA suggests that they are aimed at warning North Korea. The article notes different approaches between the U.S. Department of Defense and the CIA and the Department of State in dealing with North Korea regarding the nuclear issue. The article concludes that the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea can be interpreted as a result of the hawkish line led by the Department of Defense and the CIA. The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 600-word editorial on the pending plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK under the title "New Arrangement of the Situation on the Korean Peninsula." Saying that the plan to deploy the Patriot missile can be considered prior preparations taken in consideration of the start of the UN sanctions against North Korea, the article notes North Korea's protracted delaying tactics in the negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United States. The article also notes the recent reports by Russian nuclear experts about the possibility of North Korea possessing one to two nuclear bombs, the CIA director's secret visit to Seoul, and the deployment of a "U.S. national intelligence support team" in the ROK, and says that these moves show that "a new move for arranging the situation on the Korean peninsula in connection with the North Korean nuclear issue is in progress." The editorial continues: "In particular, the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea will bring a big change to the military situation of the Korean peninsula, regardless of whether it is intended to cope with the North Korean troops concentrated along the DMZ, whether it is a prior step in taking sanctions against North Korea, or whether it is 'a sophisticated tactic to sell' Patriot missles to the ROK." The article concludes by stressing the need for our government to properly deal with the changing situation of the Korean peninsula. TONG-A ILBO also carries on page 4 a 1,000-word article by reporter Kim Chae-hong. The article notes that "the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK can be considered to be an expression of the strong will of the United States to cope with possible North Korean provocation, but the ROK worries that the presence of Patriot missiles on the Korean peninsula would irritate North Korea and have a serious effect on the nuclear negotiations with North Korea." The article is followed by a long explanation of the technological aspect of the Patriot missile, including its performance demonstrated during the Gulf war. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "The Merit of Patriot Deployment." The editorial notes North Korea's persistent refusal to comply with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] demands for the inspection of its nuclear sites, increasing the likelihood of UN military and economic sanctions on North Korea, and says, "The U.S. plan to transfer to and deploy the anti-missile Patriot missiles to the ROK shows that the U.S. warning to North Korea in connection with the nuclear issue is becoming a reality. The ROK Government is inclined to accept the U.S. plan." The editorial then notes the deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK has been considered for some time to augment the defense capability of the U.S. ground forces in the ROK to effectively counter the North's surprise attack, irrespective of the nuclear issue, in view of the difficulty of U.S. reinforcement forces in arriving in the ROK swiftly enough in case of a North Korean surprise attack. The editorial then notes the doubts about the performance of the Patriot missile which was used during the Gulf war, citing the U.S. accounting audit personnel's revelation that the Patriot's capability of destroying the enemy's missile warheads was only nine percent. The editorial goes on to note the insufficient performance of the Patriot, namely, its fragments falling out up to one kilometer diameter, increasing danger for civilian casualties, and shrinking performance in mountainous areas like the Korean peninsula. The editorial concludes by noting, "It is, therefore, effective for combat purposes to deploy the much-improved second stage Patriot missiles. The deployment of the type which was used during the Gulf war could give an impression that the United States is disposing of old stock. The deployment of the Patriot should not be viewed only from the perspective of creating tension between the North and the South." KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 4 carries a 900-word article by New York-based correspondent Pak Su-man and reporter Song Yong-sung entitled "What Was the Background for the Deployment of the Patriot in the ROK?--Pros And Cons in the ROK and the United States." The article notes, "The U.S. Government plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK implies that the United States is preparing for the potential circumstances where not only economic but also military sanctions will have to be taken in case of a failure to bring about the settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue." The article notes the view of U.S. intelligence agencies that the Patriot will be capable of protecting the targets of a preemptive North Korean missile attack on the ROK. The article notes some ROK Government officials show an unwelcome reaction to the U.S. plan but refrain from explicitly commenting on it under the weight of the cause of building up the combat capability of the ROK-U.S. combined forces. The article also notes, "Some are of the opinion that if the nuclear inspection negotiation fails and the situation aggravates leading to sanctions on the North, North Korea may well be angered by it, and that it will then be necessary for the U.S. Forces in the ROK to be equipped with an augmented combat capability to cope with such a situation." The article then notes insufficient performance of the Patriot and some ROK Government officials' view that the deployment of the Patriot is ill-timed for the North Korea-U.S. negotiation on the nuclear issue. KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 4 also carries an 800-word article by reporter Choe Chung-ung on the performance of the Patriot missile which notes that the Patriot intercepted and shot down 50 to 60 percent of the Scud missiles during the Gulf war and the "shortcomings" of the Patriot, namely, "its enormous price, namely $120 million per unit; the extensive fallout of its fragments which can cause heavy human casualties and material loss; and the helpless situation in case the enemy fires the missile with a chemical warhead." KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 4 also carries a 200-word article by ?eporter Pak Hun-sin in the column "Reporter's Bench." The article notes the opposition Democratic Party's [DP] position concerning the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK, and refers to remarks by DPR CHairman Yi Ki-taek: "The deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK at this critical juncture when negotiations for nuclear inspection is underway can adversely affect the inter-Korean dialogue although it is said to be for defensive purposes." The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on pag? 4 carries a 1,000-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Kyong-hyong entitled "The Meaning of the U.S. Plan To Deploy Patriot Missiles--To Provide a Shield for the ROK Defenseless to Scud Gttack." The article says, "The U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK seems to be prompted by the sheer defensive purposes in preparation for a North Korean Scud missile attack." The article stresses that the Patriot deployment is far from designed to pose a new threat to North Korea, and notes, "Nevertheless, the prevailing view about the plan to deploy =atriot missiles is that it will serve as important leverage to pressure North Korea into an early acceptance of nuclear inspection." The article goes on to note, "The deployment of the Patriot missiles in he ROK seems to be the U.S. measure to demonstrate its resolute will to defend the ROK." SEOUL SINMUN on page 7 carries an 800-word report compiled from AP, YONHAP reports from Washington entitled "Patriot's Interception Capability 'Unsatisfactory.'" The report says, "The Patriot intercept missile, which the United States is planning to deploy to the ROK, is a little improved from the type used in the Gulf war but is reported to have only a limited capability against the North Korean missile attack. The PAC II-type Patriot, which is expected to be deployed in the ROK, was used by Saudi Arabia and Israel in 1991, and there is controversy over its capability to hit the target. Political analyst (Baker Spring) of the Heritage Foundation said that the United States is now developing the PAC III, and the missile to be deployed in the ROK will be the PAC II." The article concludes by quoting a#remark by a U.S. military strategist that the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK is made more from political considerations than from military considerations. The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 1 a 650-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Hae-yong citing the 27 January WASHINGTON TIMES' article which said that "To cope with the possibility of North Korea's missile attack, the Clinton Administration plans to deploy 256 Patriot missiles (64 launching pads) and special radar equipment capable of chasing and intercepting several targets at the same time to the ROK." The article also quotes the WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that "the plan to deploy the Patriot missiles in the ROK is an important sign that the United States is concerned about the failure of negotiations over nuclear inspections of North Korea's facilities." The article also quotes the WASHINGTON POST report on the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles in major ports and airports of the ROK and on U.S. plans to sell the Patriot missiles to the ROK. The article concludes by citing WASHINGTON POST as saying that "the U.S. Government is promoting the plan to station two Apache helicopter battalions in the ROK which will replace the existing Cobra helicopter battalion." The CHOSON ILBO also carries an 800-word article by reporter Pak Tu-sik on page 5 about the ROK Government's reaction to the deployment of the Patriot missiles in Korea, and notes that all along, the ROK and U.S. Governments have stressed "deployment of the Patriot missiles only in consideration of security and technology." The article says that "such an explanation by both the ROK and U.S. Governments is aimed at preventing the introduction of Patriot missiles from having a bad effect on negotiations on North Korea's nuclear issue." Then the article points out the possibility that "the deployment of the Patriot missiles may give North Korea, which has currently been driven to a corner, a pretext for frustrating negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]." The article notes the unfavorable reaction of our government's working-level officials involved in negotiations with North Korea. The article then notes prevailing opinion that "beginning with the deployment of the Patriot missiles, the United States-led regional missile defense system--'TMD-Theater Missile Defense'--should be more systematically reviewed," and also notes that "under the present circumstances with North Korea's missile threat, the introduction of weapons should be reviewed in terms of a middle and long-term plan, rather than a short-term plan." CHOSON ILBO also carries on page 5 an 800-word article by Kyong Yong-won analyzing the efficiency of the deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK, in which he notes the Patriot missiles' defects the low accuracy rate of 50-60 percent and the nine-percent destruction rate. Then the article says that "even if the Patriot missile's defects are remedied, it is doubtful whether the Patriot missiles will be efficient considering the many stumbling blocks, including high mountains, that exist on Korean terrain." Comparing Korean terrain with the Gulf war example, the article points out that although it took 20-30 minutes for a Scud missile launched in Iraq to reach a target, "the early-warning time is no less than three or five minutes" on the Korean peninsula because the battlefield depth is only 40 km. The article says that assuming that the Patriot missiles take three to five minutes to chase and intercept a target, "the Patriot missiles have almost no time to intercept a Scud missile once it is launched in North Korea." The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 4 a 1,400-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Yon-chu which cites NEW YORK TIMES and AP News Agency reports on U.S. plans to deploy the Patriot missile system to the ROK. Quoting U.S. officials as saying that "because the Patriot missiles are purely defensive, their deployment in the ROK will not aggravate tension on the Korean peninsula," the article says that "even though the Patriot missiles are defensive, their deployment is sure to strengthen the military power of the ROK Army and the U.S. Forces in Korea. It is difficult to predict what reaction North Korea will show and what effect the deployment of the Patriot missiles will have on negotiations over the nuclear issue." After noting that some U.S. State Department officials were concerned over the bad effect the Patriot missiles might have on nuclear negotiations with North Korea, the article says that "considering the situation of the Korean peninsula, the weapons for `defense' may be turned into weapons of 'political offensive' which cause crises and tension." The article concludes: "Generally speaking, the deployment of Patriot missiles will have a bad effect on the solution of North Korea's nuclear issue and on reconciliation trends on the Korean peninsula. In this connection, some analysts point out that North Korea should also be to blame for dallying too long in the political game of negotiations with the United States and the IAEA. If there had been more rapid progress in nuclear negotiations and a foundation for resolving the nuclear issue had been laid, the military hard liners within the U.S. Administration would not have had an excuse for a hard-line policy." The HANGYORE SINMUN also carries on page 4 a 600-word article by Yi Sang-ki detailing the capabilities of the Patriot missiles which he says are commonly known as the "missile that catches missiles." After noting that hundreds of Patriot missiles have been deployed in the U.S. continent, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, the article says "the supreme speed of the Patriot Missiles is Mach 6 and their firing range is known to be over 150 km. Their effective range is 70 km and it takes the Patriot missiles three minutes to launch and intercept the enemy's target." The article notes that Patriot missiles were on display at the U.S. Suwon Base during the Ulchi Focus exercise in 1992 and during the Team Spirit exercise last year, and points out that: "There are some that say that the Patriot missiles are not suitable for Korean terrain because, for starters, the Patriot missiles are too expensive with the price of each launching pad amounting to $150 million; second, considering that Korean terrain has short battlefield depth, the efficiency of Patriot missiles is doubted." The article says: "Unlike the depth of the battlefield in the Gulf War, Seoul is less than 40 km away from the Armistice Line, so the accuracy of the missile's air interception rate will not reach that of the Gulf War. In addition, contrary to U.S. press reports of the Patriot missile's 80-90 percent target-hitting rate, its target-hitting rate is in fact only about 50-60 percent." The article concludes by quoting general opinion within the army that "considering economic and accuracy conditions, the Patriot missiles will provide nothing more than mental stability when facing a southward attack." The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 2 a 500-word article by Washington-based reporter Chin Chang-ho noting the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles and a new-type Apache helicopter unit to South Korea and to send an aircraft carrier to the waters near the Korean peninsula, reporting that these moves suggest that the U.S. policy toward North Korea is moving in a hard-line direction. The article quotes THE WASHINGTON POST and THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that the United States will replace the Cobra helicopters with new-type Apache helicopters and send an aircraft carrier to the waters near the Korean peninsula in an effort to strengthen the combat capabilities of the U.S. Forces in South Korea. The article also reports a Defense Department spokesman described the performance of the Patriot missiles at a briefing session. CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word article by reporter Kang Yong-chin on the meaning and background of the U.S. plan to strengthen U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea. Noting the background of the recent hard-line attitude toward North Korea by the hawkish group led by the Department of Defense and CIA in connection with the negotiations with North Korea the article cites: "After all, the U.S. State Department, which has insisted on the need to continue nuclear negotiations with North Korea has become to realize that its concessions to North Korea have been fruitless." Noting the position of the ROK Government, which has assumed a prudent attitude toward the hard-line group led by the U.S. Department of Defense and CIA, the article concludes that the United States will continue to maintain a hard-line attitude toward North Korea "through the strengthening of its defense capability in South Korea in a bid to apply pressure on North Korea." CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word article by reporter Pak Ui-chun describing in detail the background of the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK. The article reports that deployment of Patriot missiles, though it will contribute to strengthening the combat capabilities of the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea, will have a serious effect on alleviating tensions on the Korean peninsula. The article also quotes leaders of the opposition DP, including Chairman Yi Ki-taek, as expressing worries over the possible negative effect of the deployment of Patriot missiles on North-South dialogue and on easing tension on the Korean peninsula. The article concludes that the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK should be prudently reviewed, not only because it would dampen the negotiations of the North Korean nuclear issue, but also because it would create an arms race on the Korean peninsula.
