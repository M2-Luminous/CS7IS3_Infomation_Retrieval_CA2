Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), made the appeal in an NHK television talk show videotaped Saturday to be aired Sunday. Kono said the country's two largest political parties, the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), have not participated in Hata's minority government, which is made up only of smaller parties. He said the danger facing Hata is that his cabinet revolves around just one or two people who represent and manipulate all the parties in it, in an allusion to the coalition's two key strategists -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa. "The Hata administration will have nothing to do after the budget is passed by the Diet and we will seek it to hand over power at that stage," Kono said. Debates on the budget up for parliamentary approval have been stalled during the transfer of power to Hata from his predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, who stepped down earlier this month due to a scandal over his personal finances. Kono said the LDP wants the next general election to be held under a new system combining single-seat and proportional representation formulas. He said he has in his mind the presentation of a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet to the Diet to force it to resign en masse. He indicated the LDP will promote collaboration with the SDP, which broke away from the ruling coalition Tuesday over a dispute with other alliance parties.
