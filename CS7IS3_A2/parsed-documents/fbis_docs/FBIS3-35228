[Koranic verse] From 1 Jumadi al-Akhir to 7 Sha'ban 1414 Hegira, corresponding to the period from 22 November 1993 to 18 January 1994, the Political Forces Dialogue Committee held continuous meetings in both Sanaa and Aden in a determined and sincere effort to contain the homeland's political crisis and to find genuine solutions to advance the march of the blessed Yemeni unity realized on 22 May 1990. This effort is intended to strengthen unity and democracy and lay down firm and stable foundations for the state of order, law, and institutions. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee's effort began after the political crisis and its repercussions went beyond all acceptable boundaries. That effort was in response to an urgent need for cooperation among all Yemenis to put a speedy and decisive end to that crisis and its negative and harmful consequences, which seriously threatened the homeland and the people together, and their unity and cohesion. That crisis threatened the people's national gains, which were realized after many years of suffering and struggle, during which caravans of martyrs offered their blood. As a result of that crisis, Yemen inevitably seemed to the entire world to be standing on the edge of an abyss. Basically, that crisis was the outcome of a lack of confidence, accumulating mistakes, serious transgressions and confusion in tasks and authorities, and the failure to abide by the Constitution and established laws and regulations. All this has exacerbated the security and economic situation and gravely harmed the people's way of life. Painstaking and sincere efforts have been exerted to define the steps and final rules for the return of stability and security to the cherished Yemeni homeland. In order to avoid the recurrence of what has happened, to safeguard unity, expand popular participation in the making and implementation of decisions, establish a true democracy that goes from the village to the top of the state's hierarchy, and lay down strong bricks in the building of a strong Yemeni state that safeguards rather than threatens, and maintains resources rather than squanders them, the dialogue committee drafted this document. This document constitutes the sound beginning for the building of the new Yemen, the Yemen of unity and freedom. The document shows Yemeni wisdom and places reason and logic above all considerations. Having signed and announced this document to the Yemeni people, all political parties declare their commitment to it and to continuing all efforts to implement it in the way it describes. This national document covers the important issues addressed by the political forces' dialogue. These are as follows: I. Those Charged in Cases of Security Violations: 1. Firm measures should be adopted to capture fleeing suspects in incidents of assassinations, attempted assassinations, highway robbery, and other security incidents.

The dialogue committee stresses the contents of the government's statement concerning measures for combating domestic and foreign terrorism and for deporting non-Yemenis proven to have carried out acts that contravene Yemen's policy and laws or to have propagated or instigated such acts.

Second: [as published] The Bases for Building a Modern State and Its Institutions The major task is to build the state, correcting the faults that have surfaced over the past period. Experience of the past years since the proclamation of the establishment of the Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990 has shown that the way the country was run obstructed the merger of the two previous systems and the building of the unity state. From this premise, the dialogue of the political forces has sought to leave the crisis atmosphere behind and to proceed within a serious democratic atmosphere that will achieve stability and balanced economic and social development and that will enhance national unity. That is why, in addition to the general bases and principles, this document focuses on defining the bodies of the central and local authorities, their prerogatives and their tasks in order to prevent interference and the intermingling of duties which causes confusion and leads to crises. 1. General Bases and Principles The following bases and principles shall constitute the foundation for building the state and its institutions to establish a state where order and law prevails. These bases also secure the establishment of a modern Yemeni state on the following: 1. Islam as faith and law. 2. All powers emanate from the people. They exercise these powers in a direct manner, or through a referendum and general elections. They also exercise these powers in an indirect manner through the legislative, executive, and judicial institutions and through elected local councils. 3. The Republic of Yemen is an Islamic and Arab country and Arabic is its official language. 4. Yemeni unity and republican system. 5. National unity is the basis for safeguarding and enhancing its pillars. 6. Democracy, the peaceful transfer of power, and political and party pluralism. 7. Administrative and financial decentralization are part of the bases of the system of government. 8. Protection of public liberties. 9. Respect for human rights. 10. Freedom of trade union and professional activities, as well as of intellectual and cultural creativity. 11. Encouragement of scientific research in all walks of life. II. The State Institutions: It was one of the major targets of all participants in the dialogue committee and of all proposals that have been submitted to the committee to build the state, develop its institutions and central and noncentral departments, and to complete the issuance of its laws, regulations, and statutes. This is based on their desire to rectify the course of our new unity and democratic experiment and to build the state of law, order, and institutions, a state that follows decentralized administrative and financial methods to run the affairs of the united Yemeni state. These methods should be able to absorb the state's national requirements that are based on local government and its law-governed specializations in the fields of development, services, administration, and finance. III. The Central Authority Institutions: 1. The House of Representatives: It is the legislative body of the Republic of Yemen. It is elected by the people through secret, free, and direct balloting. The Constitution defines its authorities, tasks, membership conditions, and nomination and voting methods. 2. The Consultative Council: It consists of an equal number of members representing local government units and is elected by the provincial councils. The Constitution specifies the number of Consultative Council members from each administrative unit, membership conditions, and nomination and voting methods.

To give advice on fundamental laws, especially the ones concerning local government, as referred to it by the Presidential Council, to which they are referred by the House of Representatives. Afterward, such laws are issued by the Presidency. 2. Together with the House of Representatives, it elects members of the Presidential Council. 3. To give advice on the state draft budgets and the economic and social development plans referred to it by the government, before they are approved by the House of Representatives.

The Government The Council of Ministers is the government of the Republic of Yemen. It is the state's supreme executive and administrative agency. All of the state's executive administrations, agencies, and institutions, without any exception, are affiliated with it. By adopting administrative and financial decentralization, the Government is responsible for foreign affairs, the Armed Forces, the public security, the currency, and the sovereign resources. It is also responsible for formulating the financial, monetary, economic, social, and cultural policies and for proposing draft laws and supervising their implementation. The Government is fully and collectively answerable to the House of Representatives. 5. The Judiciary The judiciary comprises the Republic's Supreme Court and the courts specified by law, as well as the public prosecution. The judiciary is fully independent. Members of the Supreme Court, who must be practicing judges and lawyers qualified in Islamic shari'ah and law, are elected by the Consultative Council for life. The term of the Supreme Court's member expires with either death or when the member reaches retirement, or when he violates the profession's ethics. In this case, he shall be dismissed and will never be allowed to work in the judicial system. The Constitution and law shall specify the tasks and powers, and methods of electing and dismissing members of the judiciary. IV. Local Government The desired local government system is based on administrative and financial decentralization under the umbrella of the single Yemeni state. It is also based on the principle of large-scale popular participation in government and a democratic course enhancing national unity. Citizens of the republic in the various administrative divisions shall exercise their constitutional rights and fulfill their duties in a way that will enable them to engage in a positive competition to build the edifice of the single Yemeni state through the economic and social prosperity of its administrative units and the establishment of justice, security, stability, and wellbeing. V. The Administrative Division The local government is based on a new administrative division of the Republic of Yemen that overcomes the existing administrative structures and units, and which will help to fully integrate the country in such a way that will terminate all manifestations of fragmentation and emphasize national unity and the new Yemen. This division must be based on scientific principles that take into account population and geographic factors and the entire economic, social, and services conditions of the population, and must provide the basic pillar for balanced development. On that basis, the republic shall be divided into four to seven administrative units called makhalif [provinces]. Sanaa, the political capital, and Aden, the economic and trade capital, shall constitute independent administrative units (municipalities). They both shall be considered separate legal entities and shall enjoy financial and administrative independence. They will have their own elected councils in accordance with the principles and regulations specified by law. The status of Aden as a free zone must be taken into consideration. VI. Powers of the Local Government The local government is based on the principle of direct, free, and fair elections of its agencies. Councils of government must be elected and enjoy full administrative and financial powers that will enable them to run the administrative, development, and services affairs of that unit on the basis of positive competition within the framework of unity. The task of building the country can be distributed by moving some of the affairs of the central administration to the local government agencies. These can be summed up as follows: Financial, Administrative, Economic, and Social Affairs 1. Administrative Affairs The local government in the administrative units shall run the affairs of the citizens and employees. The local government is fully responsible for the issues of labor, education, health, municipalities, social and economic affairs, and cultural activities within the administrative unit in accordance with the general policy of the state. The local government is also in charge of road building, city planning, and other works that do not fall within the framework of the state's sovereign tasks. The local government is also in charge of organizing the relationship with the central departments with regard to these activities on the following bases: a. General planning and supervision are the tasks of the central administration. b. Planning at the level of the administrative unit, participation in the general planning, and full responsibility for implementing these plans are the task of the local government. 2. Financial Affairs Decentralization in the financial field is considered the basis of the local government. This should produce high efficiency in mobilizing financial revenues and higher efficiency in utilization. For further clarification, a line should be drawn between the resources that fall within the powers of the local government and the ones that fall within the sovereign resources: The Sovereign Resources -- Customs revenues. -- Income taxes on the profits of companies working on the level of the republic. -- The state shares from the annual profits of the general enterprises working on the level of the republic. -- Returns on oil, gas, minerals, and fisheries. -- Any other sovereign resources defined by the law. a. Water Resources The water resources count as resources of the sovereign, and, therefore, their development and rationing use are of vital importance. They should be developed and used in accordance with rules and controls set out by law defining the relevant responsibilities of the central and local governments. b. Local Resources -- Local fees decreed by a decision issued by the administrative unit in accordance with a law that defines the powers and bases on which decisions are made and systems worked out by the local councils. -- Taxes on income, free enterprise, and commercial activity in the context of the local unit. -- Returns on economic activity in the context of the administrative unit. -- Alms. -- Tax and fees on khat. -- Tax on real estate -- Traffic, transportation, and land fees. -- Environment protection tax. -- Support offered by the central budget. These definitions are not exclusive; they are given by way of explanation only. Sovereignty and local resources shall be defined by law. Regarding spending, the spending listed in the annual budget of the local unit includes the social services and economic activity of the general units falling under the umbrella of the local unit and other related activities. Local spending does not cover items centrally funded, like key highways and other transport systems linking units or strategic projects, such as oil and gas and key minerals. -- The Central Bank will set up branches in the administrative units to handle part of its major functions.
