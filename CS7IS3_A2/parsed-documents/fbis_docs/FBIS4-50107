Meeting with renowned foreign participants to an international high-level economic forum, Li Peng said: China needs to resume its contracting status in GATT and has made efforts in this respect. In the meantime, GATT and the future World Trade Organization also need China. If a worldwide trade organization is to exclude China -- a country with a 1.2 billion population and rapidly developing economy -- it will be hard to say that such an organization is a whole one. Welcoming foreign guests to the economic forum, Li Peng said: A meeting of this nature is necessary in strengthening understanding, exchange, and cooperation between China and foreign countries; it is hoped that such a forum will be held regularly in the future. Attending the economic forum, which opened on the same day, were Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, former German Chancellor Schmidt, and other renowned foreign political and economic figures.
