It thinks the formation of an ad hoc government would just plunge the country into even more chaos. Let us listen to an unidentified COP spokesman: [Begin unidentified spokesman recording, in Creole] Our position in COP regarding the ad hoc government that is being discussed today is that this idea is not viable. It offers nothing toward resolving the country's crisis. We in COP have always said there is no solution but the Governors Island agreement for resolving the country's crisis, because the Governors Island agreement is an agreement of principle signed by General Cedras and President Aristide in the presence of the international community to resolve the country's crisis. We think that so long as stalling maneuvers are aimed at preventing the reactivation of the Governors Island agreement, the country's crisis will never be resolved. [end recording]
