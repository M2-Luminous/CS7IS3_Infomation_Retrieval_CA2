In reply to a government request, the UNHCR praised Seoul's decision to allow the loggers to resettle in South Korea and expressed its readiness to cooperate, the official said. He said the ministry asked the UNHCR headquarters in Geneva last Friday to confirm the identity of loggers who escaped from North Korean camps in Siberia and give them refugee status. The UNHCR will instruct its Moscow office to cooperate in offering refugee status to the escapees late this week when it finishes a study on how to protect, temporarily accommodate, and look into the backgrounds of, the escapees and what to do with the loggers after giving them refugee status. The government told the UNHCR about human rights conditions at the North Korean logging camps in Siberia and about escapees from the camps, and asked for cooperation in resettling the loggers in South Korea. The government plans to allow those who have been clearly identified to come here directly after consultations with the Russian Government, while those requiring further identification procedures must be screened by the UNHCR to determine their refugee status. Hundreds of North Korean loggers have escaped from Siberian logging yards, testifying later to rampant human rights violations inside the camps.
