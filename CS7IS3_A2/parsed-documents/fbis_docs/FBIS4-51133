That is what passengers of the airlines under the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) will have the chance to answer on newly-launched "appraisal cards." Jiang Zhuping, vice-director of CAAC, headed a group of CAAC staff this morning to issue the "appraisal cards" to hundreds of Chinese and foreign passengers at Beijing capital airport. A spokesman for CAAC, Bao Peide, said that this was part of the efforts CAAC will carry out this year to improve passenger service quality. He said that, starting from today, a total of 100,000 cards will be issued this year, and at the end of the year CAAC will list the 17 domestic airlines and major airports according to the passengers' appraisals. Those which have won high marks will get awards, while those with low marks will face sanctions. The card asks for travellers' comments on 22 aspects of aviation services, including the service attitude of staff, flight punctuality and in-flight service. Bao said that this year CAAC's major attention will be paid to the improvement of staff's service attitude and the services when flights are delayed.
