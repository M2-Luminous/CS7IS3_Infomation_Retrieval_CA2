FBIS4-39007 "drsov108_b_94021" FBIS-SOV-94-108 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Military Issues Secret Footage of 1969 Space Launch Failures Shown Secret Footage of 1969 Space Launch Failures Shown LD0506113794 LD0506113794 BFN [Editorial report] Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network in Russian at 0820 GMT on 5 June, in its program entitled "Aerospace salon," carries a 4-minute report on two major hushed-up space launch failures in 1969, at the height of the space race between the USSR and the United States. The report shows for the first time previously classified pictures of two launch failures. In the first decade of the space age, the U.S.'s Mariner-IV probe had already succeeded in sending back to Earth the first pictures of Mars, while all six Soviet Mars probes had failed to reach their target. "In 1969, the United States was planning to launch a further two Mariner probes to Mars," the program says. "For this reason the leadership of the Soviet Union ordered the leading enterprise for interplanetary probes, the Lavochkin scientific-production association, to urgently create probes for the orbital exploration of Mars." On the basis of the new UR-500K rocket, later redesignated as the Proton rocket, the Lavochkin enterprise hastily developed the five-tonne M-69 Mars probe. However, following the successful launch by the United States of Mariner-VI on 25 February 1969, the first attempted Soviet launch of a M-69 Mars probe on 27 March failed. Just "438 seconds after its launch the rocket's third stage motor exploded" and the probe perished. Later the same day, 27 March, the Americans successfully launched Mariner-VII. On 2 April, the second attempted Soviet launch of an M-69 probe produced yet another failure. "Immediately after the start of the launch, a fire broke out in the rocket's first-stage motor" and after rising just a short distance, the rocket plunged back to Earth close to the launching area. The Ostankino television program showed footage of both space launch failures. "Very few people have previously seen this footage," the program says. Two official TASS announcements about the successful launching of Mars-2 and Mars-3 probes, which had been compiled beforehand and later had to be cancelled before their publication in the media, were also shown on screen. At the time, the Soviet media did not mention these failures.
