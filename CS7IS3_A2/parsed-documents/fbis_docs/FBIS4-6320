FBIS4-6320 "dreas076_d_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 South Korea Team Spirit To Proceed if DPRK Rejects Check Team Spirit To Proceed if DPRK Rejects Check SK2004084494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0832 GMT 20 Apr 94 SK2004084494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the United States decided Wednesday to conduct this year's "Team Spirit" joint military exercise in November if North Korea continues to refuse additional nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and does not show sincerity in resuming inter-Korean dialogue. The decision came at an hour-long meeting between South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and his U.S. counterpart William Perry at the Defense Ministry. They evaluated the current situation concerning the North Korean nuclear dispute before arriving at their position. The top defense officials decided to consider suspending the joint military exercise in case North Korea meets such conditions for a third round of Washington-Pyongyang high-level talks. Accordingly, the governments of the two countries will hold the Team Spirit exercise should they find no progress in talks over the North Korean nuclear issue after watching the developments of the end of October. Yi and Perry discussed ways to maintain the kind of deterrent force which has defended peace on the Korean peninsula for the past four decades in preparation for eventualities in the future. The two defense ministers shared the view that the deployment of such advanced defensive weapons as Patriot missiles at American military bases in Korea would help beef up anti-air raid and anti-ballistic missile defense capability and contribute to joint Korea-U.S. deterrence of war. In the meeting, Minister Yi said the Korean military is seeking to increase anti-artillery and night combat capabilities. Perry said that the United States is persistently pushing for the modernization of its forces in Korea. The ministers, however, agreed that there are no particular signs of North Korea moving to militarily provoke for the present. The U.S. defense secretary, who arrived here Tuesday, conferred with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and senior presidential secretary for foreign and national security affairs, Chong Chong-uk. The defense secretary is scheduled to visit the Second U.S. Infantry Division Thursday before leaving Seoul for Japan.
