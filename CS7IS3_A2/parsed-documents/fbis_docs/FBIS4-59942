During the meeting, Ha'eri-Fumani, adviser to the foreign minister and general director for the Persian Gulf [title as heard], referred to the cancellation of the ceremony marking the disavowal of the infidels by the supervisor of the Islamic Republic of Iran's mission. This is as a result of the difficulties brought about made by the recent Saudi actions, which are considered to be contrary to diplomatic -- and even humanitarian -- conduct, and as being disruptive to bilateral relations. The Saudi Arabian ambassador said that he will convey the raised matters to his country's authorities. He claimed that the security measures were envisaged in order to safeguard the security and health of the hajj pilgrims.
