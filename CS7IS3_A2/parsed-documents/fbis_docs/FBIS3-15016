Speaking in Moscow on Tuesday, he said Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze, who would be visiting the U.S. at the time, might address a Security Council meeting on March 9. Georgia is supportive of the idea of Russian troops being moved into the region and of giving them the status of peacekeepers, Ukleba told Interfax. At the same time, he spoke of UN fears that as a neighboring state, Russia may fail to stay neutral. Ukleba expressed regret over the failure of the previous round in Geneva, blaming it on "the destructive position" taken by Abkhazia. He said the warring sides were expected to sign two documents - a statement on measures for a negotiated settlement to the regional conflict and an agreement for the return of refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia. However, Abkhazia did not sign the statement because of being opposed to a clause on Georgia's territorial integrity, Ukleba said. And he added that the Abkhazians must opt out of the talks if they do not recognize Georgia's integrity as indicated by UN resolutions. On the refugee issue, Ukleba said that as a pre-condition for signing an agreement, Abkhazia insisted on screening Georgian refugees to see whether or not they fought against Abkhazia. Tbilisi puts the number of Georgians fleeing from Abkhazia at more than 300,000.
