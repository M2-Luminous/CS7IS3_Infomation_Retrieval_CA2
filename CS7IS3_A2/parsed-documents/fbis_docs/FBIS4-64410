[Mehmet] First, I would like to express our satisfaction with the NATO attack on the Serb positions. Turkey asked the international circles and the United Nations to interfere two years ago because it is impermissible for a country to occupy the territories of another country. The United Nations and NATO charters stipulate this. Aggressors have to be punished. Turkey has recognized the four countries that seceded from old Yugoslavia, but the Serbs are attacking Bosnia. We are ready to help and have told the international circles that if your problem is a material one, then we are ready to pay our dues, and if the problem is the formation of an army, then we are ready for that, too. Tens of thousands have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been made refugees. Blood is being shed in Bosnia, and it is Muslim blood. Emotional ties bind us to them and the blood being shed is ultimately the blood of human beings, regardless of their race. An agreement was reached to withdraw the Serb artillery adjacent to Bosnia [as published] and this was done. But then they attacked another city and NATO was forced to attack their positions. We believe that this decision has come very late. Anyhow, despite the tardiness of the decision, we still believe that it was the right one. Several decisions were made in the past but the Serbs did not abide by them and occupied Bosnian territories. The United Nations would have lost a lot if the Serbs had not faced this operation. The implementation of the UN decision has restored its credibility. The Turkish Republic was established in 1923, and we have yearned for peace to prevail all over the world since then. We sent our army to Korea to maintain world peace on the basis of this principle. We sent Turkish troops to Somalia last year, where many soldiers were martyred. But our objective has always been to help bring about world peace. We will send Turkish forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina in implementation of the UN resolutions with the objective of achieving world peace. [Madani] Do you believe that Bosnia-Herzegovina will collapse if this international intervention does not take place? [Mehmet] This collapse will, of course, happen if this war continues. Therefore, the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be stopped immediately. Bosnians and Serbs are bound by ties of kinship and they have lived for many years under the Yugoslav regime. Why don't they live in peace now? [Madani] Has Turkey taken into consideration the possibility of intervening militarily on its own in this crisis if the conflict in Bosnia continues? [Mehmet] We do not attack anyone and have no ambitions in anyone's territories. We are only defending ourselves. It is known that Turkey is the strongest country in the Middle East from military and other aspects. But we use this strength to deter those who try to attack us or other peaceful countries. I insist that Turkey has no ambitions in other countries' territories. I hope that we will have relations of brotherhood and good neighborliness, especially with our neighboring countries. We want peace to prevail in the entire world. We have welcomed and felt relieved by the agreement concluded between the Palestinians and the Israelis. We also were much distressed by what the Israelis did to worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque because it delayed the peace process. Why should there be such bloodshed? There is plenty of room in the world for all of us, so why have war when we can live in peace and security? It is enough for the people to safeguard their territory and laws and abide by them. [Madani] Why has Germany refrained from supplying you with weapons? [Mehmet] There is a problem of terrorism in eastern Anatolia. Turkey has been facing this terrorism for 10 years. So far, the terrorists have killed approximately 3,300 people in that area, including 3,000 Turks of Kurdish origin. The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] is launching a propaganda campaign in Western Europe saying that they are unjustly treated by Turkey. They have set up approximately 100 organizations to promote this propaganda in Germany alone. Using money and other methods they have influenced the German media until they have managed to instill in the mind of Germans that there is a minority problem in Turkey. But there is no minority problem in Turkey because 99 percent of Turks are Muslims. Approximately 29 minorities speak their own languages in the country. We are all first-class citizens. For instance, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin is of Kurdish origin. The prime minister's adviser is also a Kurd. There is no distinction between Kurds and Turks in Turkey. Former President Ozal was of Kurdish origin, too. In the current parliament there are 100 Kurdish deputies. I, for instance, am a Caucasian [Qafqas], and our friend [not further identified] is from Georgia. We all live in the Turkish homeland. But the propaganda in Germany speaks of injustice. How, for God's sake, could a country oppress its own people? They also said that we use their weapons against the PKK and asked us not to use them. For our part, we have honored the terms of the arms agreement concluded with Germany; namely, that we do not use their weapons against the Kurds. We do not need their weapons. We have obtained from the Germans 5 billion marks' worth of weapons and paid them for the arms. I say that we do not need the German weapons because there are plenty of weapons on the world market; in Russia and elsewhere. Approximately 200 German journalists have visited the eastern part of Turkey. They were expecting riots during the recent local elections, but there were no riots. We use Russian weapons that are similar to German weapons. So they thought we were using their weapons, which is not true. They misunderstood. [Madani] Is there a possibility for a cease-fire between you and the Kurds so that a dialogue to achieve genuine peace in eastern Turkey can begin? [Mehmet] Not at all. I do not sit with terrorists and highway bandits. I cannot think of it. Their problem will be over this year. How can we talk to those who kill children and smuggle hashish and weapons? How can we sit with those terrorists at the negotiating table? At some point in time, they were in your country, in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley. Now they are divided in al-Biqa', Syria, and Iraq. There is no way out of this. I feel sad for those among them who are killed in battles who are only between 15 and 20 years old. I feel very sad for those children whose beards have not appeared yet. There is no complete solution to this problem other than death. Therefore, we call on them to surrender their weapons to save their lives. Between 10 and 20 of these young men die every day. I feel sorry for them; after all, they are human beings. No country in the whole world has ever surrendered to terrorism. Strong Turkey, with its 60 million people and its strong Army, will not give in to 10,000 terrorists. [Madani] Does the growth of the Islamic trend, represented by the Welfare Party, constitute a threat to your ruling regime? [Mehmet] They won the votes of the angry people. We entered those local elections at the hardest of times. I say in the name of my party, the True Path Party, that media and senior businessmen opposed our party because we raised taxes. In elections, more taxes mean lower votes. The economic hardship and the rise in the value of the dollar before the elections made it easy for the opposition to attack us. The whole opposition joined its forces against us. It is known that Turkey has 14 parties. Despite all these circumstances, we came first in the elections. The voters did try the Welfare Party before, when they withheld their votes from the Motherland Party because they were angry with the government. But this lasted for only a short period, and I believe the current situation will end soon because it will be difficult for the hardship to continue. [Madani] Some say that Turkey is facing the threat of the Islamic trend and that you are heading toward a difficult situation parallel to what is happening in Algeria. [Mehmet] Turkey is not Algeria or any other country. Extremists are found all over the world, not only in Turkey. There are left-wing extremists as well as right-wing extremists. But the majority of the Turkish people are moderates.
