Churkin expressed hope that in the long run, a peaceful approach to the solution of the problem will prevail. He pointed out that air raids do not meet the interests of the North Atlantic Alliance. In Churkin's opinion, a ceasefire agreement is currently being observed better than ever during the recent two years. "Weapons withdrawn from their positions pose no threat to Sarajevo and control over the situation must be entrusted to U.N. peace-keepers," Churkin said. He pointed out that the Russian battalion of Blue Helmets which arrived in Sarajevo on Sunday, would be stationed in the city between Serbian and Muslim residential areas. "Russia is, undoubtedly,concerned over the safety of its servicemen," Churkin pointed out. According to the Russian diplomat, a ceasefire and withdrawal of heavy weapons should be the first step on the way to establishing the U.N. control over Sarajevo.
