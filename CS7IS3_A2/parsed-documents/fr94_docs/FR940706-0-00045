Paragraph (e) of §17.72 is revised to read as follows: §17.72 Methods of collection and imposition of late charges. * * * * * (e) Interest. Where prejudgment interest is not mandated by statute, contract or regulation, the minimum rate of interest to be charged on delinquent debts is the Tax and Loan Account Rate for the U.S. Treasury (also known as the Current Value of Funds rate) as prescribed and published semiannually by the Secretary of the Treasury in the Federal Register , in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717.

Prejudgment interest shall not be demanded or collected on civil penalty and forfeiture claim unless the statute under which the claim arises authorizes the collection of such interest. * * * * * 7. Paragraph (b) of §17.110 is revised to read as follow: §17.110 Determination of indebtedness and appeal from determination. * * * * * (b) Copies of the DAS decision will be distributed to the debtor and the debtor's attorney or other representative, if applicable.
