The credit was paid back within the set deadline, December, last year, and the interest was libor [London Interbank Offered Rate] + one percent point. Half of the credit was used to buy petrol, and the other half was given to the "Stopanska" and "Komercijalna" bank which marketed the funds to their customers. 2) The next loan was arranged with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), up to US$35 million, through a STF arrangement. The first half of these funds (US$17.5 million) will become available toward the middle of February, and the other US$17.5 million, toward the middle of this year. The credit is conditioned with the adherence to the new stabilization program of the Government and certain conditions in the monetary and fiscal policy. The credit is disbursed for a 10 year period, a variable interest and a 4.5 year grace period. As the Minister Without Portfolio Ljube Trpevski, otherwise responsible for contacts with the international organizations in the Macedonian Government, told MIC, the received sum is important, however, what is more important is that this STF arrangement with IMF presents a green light for negotiations with all other international finance institutions with which negotiations would otherwise progress very slowly. The first part of the credit, which should be disbursed toward the middle of February, will be used to pay back the US$106 million debt to the World bank (IBRD). 3) Since Macedonia became a member of the International Development Agency (IDA) in December, it became possible to receive credits both from this agency and the IBRD, which IDA is part of. The total sum of the two credits amounts to US$80 million. The credit from IDA is intended for economic reconstruction (economic recovery loan) and totals US$40 million. It is to be paid back within 35 years, with a 10 year grace period, which means that the first installment will arrive in the year 2004. Beside this, the credit is without interest. The credit from IBRD, on the other hand, is disbursed with a pay- back period of 25 years, with a 5 year grace period, and the interest is variable. In view of the fact that the IDA credit is far more favorable, it will be the first to be used. US$32 million will be used to pay- back the old debt to IBRD, and the remaining US$48 million will be withdrawn in the following months. They will be used to support the balance-of-payment and the foreign currency reserves of the state. The condition for the granting of these credits is the presentation of documents for the carried out imports of goods and services by Macedonia firms. Documents for the import of tobacco, machines for the processing of tobacco, jewelry, gold, valuables, nuclear materials, etc. can not be presented in order to fulfill the condition. According to Mr. Trpevski, the Government already has sufficient documentation to immediately draw the first US$32 million, and the documentation for the remaining sum of US$48 million will not present a problem in view of the fact that the total Macedonian imports far exceed the sum of US$80 million. These two credits have been accepted by the Government of Macedonia, and Parliament has also adopted a Law for the ratification of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and IBRD. Now, when that is over, the World bank is expected to approve the credit on 8 February, and the first US$32 million will be able to be withdrawn upon the showing of the documents for the import of goods in Macedonia. 4) A new credit has been requested from Mr. George Soros, to the same amount as the previous -- US$25 million. The pay-back period for this credit is November 1994, in three installments, and the interest is libor + one percent point. US$9 million will be used to pay-back the old debt to the World bank, and the rest will be withdrawn according to the needs. The Republic is not obliged to use the entire credit, but only if there is a need. The Macedonian Parliament has already discussed this credit, and has decided to ratify the agreement between the Government and Mr. Soros. 5) A US$33 million credit has been received from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). A sum of US$27 million will be used for the construction of a 400 KWH long-distance power line from the Mining-energetic combine "Bitola" to Skopje. The remaining US$6 million will be put to use for the realization of projects from the government program for the saving and substitution of energy. The credit is obtained with a pay-back period of 12 years and a 3 year grace period. The interest amounts to 7.5%, in average. The recipient of the entire credit is the "Electrodistribution of Macedonia," whereby a part will be transferred to the Government, for its saving and substitution program, with an obligation to pay-back the same, which has simultaneously signed an agreement for guaranteeing the entire credit. 6) The Macedonian Government will soon mount new negotiations with the World bank, to obtain a new credit, which, according to the Government, is expected to total US$60 million, and would be intended for structural adjustment (structural adjustment loan). US$40 million are planned to be received in 1994, intended for projects of infrastructural importance, such as help for the restructuring of the companies and the process of privatization, and partly, for the development of the communications East-West, or, more specifically, the road (or railroad) Drac (Albania) -- Istanbul (Turkey). 7) New negotiations with IMF for the reaching of a stand-by arrangement, for which conditions are more difficult to meet, and much stricter, are expected to begin in the period May-June. The stand-by arrangement is expected to be financially supported with a sum similar or exactly like the one of the STF arrangement, that is, approximately US$35 million. 8) As far as the commercial credits are concerned, the Turkish bank for foreign trade is offering a credit for the import of equipment and food from Turkey, valued at US$23-35 million. The bank authorized for the setting of the matters and the gathering of recipients of this credit is "Komercijalna banka" from Skopje. Negotiations for this credit are still underway. 9) Beside all of this, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia plans to begin negotiations with the Paris club or the London club, during this year, for the regulation (eventual writing off or reprogramming) of the debts to these associations. Connected with almost all these credits is the debt to the World bank, which is due for payback this month, and which amounts to US$106.6 million. The financial construction of the funds for the pay-back of the debt is the following: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$26.5 million from donations: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Out of which: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$10 million from Holland | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$5 million from United States | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$3 million from Switzerland | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$3 million from Austria | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$2.5 million from Italy | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$1 million from Turkey | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$1.8 million from Sweden | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$0.2 million from Luxembourg | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$9 million from Mr. Soros' credit | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$32 million from the IDA and IBRD credit | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$17.5 million from the IMF credit | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |US$22.5 million from the foreign currency reserves of Macedonia | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total: approximately US$107 million | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |* Donations are also expected to be received from other countries, while in | |the meantime, US$1.5 million arrived from Belgium. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, it should also be taken into account that some US$ 25 million, which are due for pay-back, consisting of the principal credit + interest, will have to be paid to the World bank in 1994. Another US$11 million will have to be set aside for the private creditors and the EIB and EUROFIMA.
