FR940627-2-00023 FR940627-2-00020 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM Agency Forms Under Review AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Notice. BACKGROUND: On June 15, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delegated to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) its approval authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as per 5 CFR 1320.9, to approve of and assign OMB control numbers to collection of information requests and requirements conducted or sponsored by the Board under conditions set forth in 5 CFR 1320.9. Board-approved collections of information will be incorporated into the official OMB inventory of currently approved collections of information. A copy of the SF 83 and supporting statement and the approved collection of information instrument(s) will be placed into OMB's public docket files. The following forms, which are being handled under this delegated authority, have received initial Board approval and are hereby published for comment. At the end of the comment period, the proposed information collection, along with an analysis of comments and recommendations received, will be submitted to the Board for final approval under OMB delegated authority. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before July 5, 1994. This shortened comment period is due to the fact that all thirty-nine primary dealers have consulted with Federal Reserve staff regarding these changes and have implemented all of the necessary programming changes. ADDRESSES: Comments, which should refer to the OMB Docket number (or Agency form number in the case of a new information collection that has not yet been assigned an OMB number), should be addressed to Mr. William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th and C Streets, NW., Washington, DC 20551, or delivered to the Board's mail room between 8:45 a.m. and 5:15 p.m., and to the security control room outside of those hours. Both the mail room and the security control room are accessible from the courtyard entrance on 20th Street between Constitution Avenue and C Street, NW. Comments received may be inspected in room B&hyph;1122 between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., except as provided in §261.8 of the Board's Rules Regarding Availability of Information, 12 CFR 261.8(a). A copy of the comments may also be submitted to the OMB desk officer for the Board: Milo Sunderhauf, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, Room 3208, Washington, DC 20503. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: A copy of the proposed form, the request for clearance (SF 83), supporting statement, instructions, and other documents that will be placed into OMB's public docket files once approved may be requested from the agency clearance officer, whose name appears below.

Proposal to Approve Under OMB Delegated Authority the Extension, with Revision, of the Following Report(s): 1. Report title: Government Securities Dealers Reports. Agency form number: FR 2004A, B, C, and WI. OMB Docket number: 7100&hyph;0003. Frequency: Weekly and on occasion. Reporters: Primary dealers in U.S. government securities. Annual reporting hours: 11,544. Estimated average hours per response: 1. Number of respondents: 39. Small businesses are not affected. General description of report: This information collection is voluntary [12 U.S.C. 248(a)(2), 353&hyph;359a, and 461] and is given confidential treatment [5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)]. This group of reports (the ``FR 2004 series'') is used to collect data on positions, transactions and financing activity from U.S. government securities dealers. Data needs with respect to the FR 2004 series have changed in light of the Joint Report on the Government Securities Market submitted to the Congress in January 1992 by the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury Department, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on that report, significant changes to the FR 2004 series of reports have been recommended. A summary of those changes follows. For the Weekly Report of Dealer Positions (FR 2004A): •Money market instruments and the addendum section are eliminated. •Pass-through mortgage-backed securities and all other mortgage-backed securities are combined into one category. •Federal agency securities are combined into one maturity category and two maturity categories of Treasury securities are eliminated. •Option positions are reduced to long and short categories rather than purchased and sold calls, purchased and sold puts. •Forward positions are reported with immediate positions under the title ``outright positions''. For the Weekly Report of Cumulative Transactions (FR 2004B): •The addendum section is eliminated and the Treasury, agency and mortgage-backed categories are abbreviated as on the proposed revised FR 2004A. •``Buys'' and ``Sells'' categories are combined. •Primary Dealers are combined with ``customers'' (now called ``with others'') rather than brokers, and the ``all other'' category is eliminated. •Forward transactions are reported with immediate positions under the title ``outright transactions''. For the Weekly Report of Dealer Financing (FR 2004C): •Customer categories are eliminated. •Term agreements are reduced to one category. •The categories ``cash collateral'' and ``securities and LC's'' are eliminated and replaced by securities received as pledge or pledged. •Fails are condensed on the proposed report. For the Daily Report of Dealer Positions in Treasury Financings (FR 2004WI): •Gross long and short positions are replaced by purchases and sales. •Net financing commitments are added. For the new Report of Specific Issues (FR 2004SI): •This is an entirely new report that is similar to the addendum sections of the current FR 2004A and B, except that it incorporates financing and fails. It is designed to collect information on specific Treasury securities for market surveillance purposes. It will be collected weekly on a routine basis. Also, the Federal Reserve will have the authority to call for reporting of any issue daily, on an as-needed basis. For the Report of Suggested Evidence of Accuracy (FR 2004B.1): •Eliminated. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 21, 1994. William W. Wiles, Secretary of the Board. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15442 Filed 6&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45am] BILLING CODE 6210&hyph;01&hyph;P
