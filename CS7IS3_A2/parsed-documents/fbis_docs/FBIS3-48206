Kim asked his ministers with economic portfolios to report first as the focus of his policy in 1994 is revitalizing the economy through increased international competitiveness of Korean products, and he wanted to hear about the plans to achieve this goal before anything else, according to Chongwadae [presidential office] officials. He also wanted to relieve the economic ministries of the burden of new year presidential reports as soon as possible so that they can quickly start work preparing for internationalization and market opening. Kim questioned working-level officials, as well as ministers, to see if they knew their jobs in a phenomenon unseen in new year presidential briefings in the past, where the president heard the report and then issued instructions without any give and take. [sentence as received] Pollution of the Naktong River interfered with the 11 economic briefings and left the administration dumbfounded. Kim was frustrated in his desire to finish receiving new year reports from all government ministries and agencies by the end of January as he had to divert much attention to the issue. He told the cabinet to look into the cause of the pollution and work out a comprehensive plan to keep all rivers, especially those that supply tap water, free of pollution. "The issue has resulted from the failure of past governments to take proper anti-pollution measures for the five biggest rivers, including the Naktong," he said. "The present civilian government must not gloss over the issue but seek a fundamental solution of it to win the people's trust." Receiving the reports, Kim stressed five points -- measures against financial market opening, privatization of state-run enterprises, industrial peace, rural development, and deregulation of economic activities for increased exports. To cope with the liberalization of financial services, he said, the functions of supervisory institutions such as the Office of Bank Supervision, the Securities Supervisory Board and the Insurance Supervisory Board should be reformed to help financial institutions increase their competitiveness against foreign rivals. On the privatization program, Kim said state-run enterprises that can be better operated by private hands, including state-run telecommunications firms, should be privatized for better market competitiveness. But he stressed most the need for labor-management cooperation and industrial peace. In the Labor Ministry's briefing Jan. 13, he pointed to the need for labor and management to recognize that they are in the same boat in this era of boundless international competition and said: "The defeat in this competition means not only the end of the business for management but also the loss of livelihood for labor." Kim appears to have a firm belief that annual labor disputes serve only to hinder the effort to revitalize the economy. With the Trade, Industry and Energy, and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministries he stressed the need for measures to help corporations increase capital investment, to ease foreign trade rules for increased exports and to develop agriculture as a competitive and viable industry. It is but midway through the briefings, however, and thus too soon to evaluate the course as a whole. Distinct differences from the past are evident though. While Kim is using the sessions as an opportunity for dialogue with working-level officials on policy, the officials are using them to express their opinions on the pressing issues facing the country.
