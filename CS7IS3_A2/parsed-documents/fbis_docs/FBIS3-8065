British forces commander Major Darling informed the command of the 111th HVO [Croatian Defense Council] Brigade that their radar equipment detected the direction and even the location from where the mortars were fired, but declined to say who was responsible for the shelling of the British battalion. Fortunately, there were no casualties, but material damage is huge. Maj. Darling said that if the shelling happens again he would demand air strikes against those who fire shells on UNPROFOR.
