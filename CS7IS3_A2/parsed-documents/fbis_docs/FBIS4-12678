Meanwhile, a senior Jordanian official asked: Why has this man come and what does he want? Foreign Minister Talal al-Hasan, King Husayn's political adviser Marwan al-Qasim, and Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali arrived one after the other at the al-Hashimiyah Palace, where President Yasir 'Arafat was staying. At 2130, his majesty the king and his royal highness the crown prince arrived at the al-Hashimiyah Palace. The two sides talked for approximately one hour and then went to dine with the king. Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] reviewed part of the talks with Israel and complained about the Rabin government's procrastination, prevarication, and oscillating policies. He added that the Rabin government, which shows enthusiasm for achieving progress in the settlement process, keeps retreating from this enthusiasm as a result of pressure from the Army. Abu-'Ammar said that Israel is divided and that the views of the politicians in the Rabin government regarding the peace process are different from the views of the Army, which is becoming influential on the political level. Abu-'Ammar said that it has been decided that the settlements in Gaza will be dismantled, but Israel wants a high price in return. Regarding the Hebron settlements, the Government of Israel promised to tighten their grip on them and to place harsh conditions on the settlers there to force them to leave. Abu-'Ammar expressed his belief that all of the settlements in the West Bank will not be that difficult of a problem in the long run, however, he added, the major complication lies in the issue of Jerusalem and the settlements around it, which are growing every day. Following his review of the Palestinian stand, King Husayn asked 'Arafat: What do you want from Jordan? And how do you view Jordanian-Palestinian coordination and cooperation at the present time? His majesty said: We, in Jordan, call on you to form a permanent bilateral coordination committee so that our acts will not conflict with yours, so that the dialogue with Israel will not be at both our and your expense, so that the results of your talks with Israel will not undermine Jordanian interests, and so that the solutions will not be at the expense of Jordan and its role. When President 'Arafat failed to respond and attempted to change the course of the discussions, Prince Hasan repeated the demand to launch a permanent coordination committee, as his majesty the king had just proposed. Prince Hasan added: What we want is to create a permanent framework for cooperation, one that brings together politicians and specialized experts. This framework must have a permanent headquarters and meet regularly. This is important if our coordination is not to be accomplished in pieces. Abu-'Ammar approved this proposal. He insisted, however, that both sides start with a joint committee on Jerusalem, with the understanding that the powers of this committee will expand in the future to include all aspects of cooperation and coordination between Jordan and the PLO. This is because the Palestinian president, who is planning to return to Gaza on 15 May 1994, believes that his bargaining position will be enhanced once he sets foot on Palestinian territory. He believes that once he does so, his dealings with Jordan will be on an equal footing. His majesty the king reiterated the need for continuous and clear coordination between Jordan and the PLO in the face of Israeli ambitions and U.S. pressure. He also urged President 'Arafat to hold consultations with Syria and Lebanon, and to cooperate with them. He insinuated that true cooperation is currently taking place among Amman, Damascus, and Beirut, noting that the PLO's involvement in this cooperation would consummate inter-Arab cooperation. President 'Arafat halfheartedly agreed to the king's proposals. But, he changed the subject addressing King Husayn jokingly, saying: Your Majesty the King, please protect me from the PLO Executive Committee members. They disagree with me on most issues. Then, Abu-'Ammar plunged into a lengthy talk on the U.S. penetration of Islamic movements. He cited many things that he said he learned when he attempted to mediate between [former president of Afghanistan] Najibullah and the Afghan mujahidin. He said that he then discovered the great influence the United States wielded within the ranks of the Afghan mujahidin, an eventuality made possible by the arms provided to them by the CIA. He said that U.S. planes landed in Afghanistan, carrying the most sophisticated weapons to the mujahidin, and returned with planeloads of heroine and various other drugs. It was midnight, and the royal banquet was over when his majesty the king and other Jordanian officials left the al-Hashimiyah Palace with hopes of effecting a transition from a phase of piecemeal coordination to a phase of regular and continuous coordination between Jordan and the PLO.
