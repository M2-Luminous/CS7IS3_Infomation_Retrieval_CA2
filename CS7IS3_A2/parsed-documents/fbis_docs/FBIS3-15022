Kirsteins noted that Yeltsin's report shows that it is impossible to forecast trends in Russian foreign and interior policy. Kirsteins said that Latvia could agree to the Yeltsin's statement about the necessity to sign an agreement with Russia on minorities rights' protection so that it was possible to regulate the Russian minority's social status in Latvia. Kirsteins thinks that placing matters related to Skrunda radar in the center of the interstate talks was just a political maneuver because, at the same time, Russia does not want to sign the agreement with Latvia and Russia's demands concerning Russian retired military personnel and its further stay in Latvia are unacceptable for Latvia. In return, Faction Latvian Way leader Andrejs Pantelejevs noted that Russian presidents' report is an encouragement for Latvia to integrate sooner into Europe by passing a law on citizenship. Pantelejevs informed that the representatives of European Council will visit Latvia next week to discuss the possible Latvia's joining this organization.
