Take notice that on August 29, 1994, NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT), 525 Milam Street, Shreveport, Louisiana 71151, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;743&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to abandon and transfer by sale to Arkla, a division of NorAm Energy Corporation, segments of Lines B and BM&hyph;9, entire Line BM&hyph;6, and included within are 17 rural domestic taps, all located in Pope County, Arkansas, under NorAm's blanket certificate issued in Docket Nos. CP82&hyph;384&hyph;000 and CP82&hyph;384&hyph;001 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. NGT proposes to abandon in place and transfer by sale to Arkla: (1) Line B consisting of 16,550 feet of 10-inch pipe from pipeline station 3349+50 to 3515+00; (2) Line BM&hyph;9 consisting of 8,725 feet of 4-inch pipe from pipeline station 0+00 to 87+25; (3) the entire Line BM&hyph;6 consisting of 216 feet of 4-inch pipe, and (4) 17 rural domestic taps (16 on BM&hyph;9 and 1 on BM&hyph;6). NGT will continue to operate the remaining portion of Line B (476,720 feet) and Line BM&hyph;9 (10,303 feet). NGT states that these facilities will be abandoned as a result of a segment rerouting of Line B. The rerouting, pursuant to Section 157.208(a), is necessary due to residential encroachment caused by the City of Russellville, Arkansas annexing land for future development. Lines BM&hyph;9 and BM&hyph;6 currently provide service to Arkla's existing distribution system and are connected to the Line B portion that will be abandoned after the rerouting is completed. The rerouting of Line B will parallel a portion of NGT's existing Line BM&hyph;9 and interconnect with Line BM&hyph;9 at approximately station 87+25. Line BM&hyph;6 will not interconnect with the rerouted portion of Line B. Arkla will use the acquired facilities as part of its existing low pressure distribution system. NGT states that no customers or services will be terminated with this abandonment. Comment date: October 24, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 7. Florida Gas Transmission Company [Docket No. CP94&hyph;755&hyph;000] September 9, 1994. Take notice that on August 31, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT), 1400 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;755&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205, 157.208 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.208 and 157.216) for authorization to relocate an existing meter station and appurtenant facilities in Marion County, Florida, and to abandon pipeline facilities downstream of the existing meter station, under FGT's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;553&hyph;000, pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. FGT proposes to relocate the Ocala North meter station by dismantling, moving and reassembling the facilities 3.6 miles upstream of the present location and abandoning the 3.6 mile 2.5 inch Ocala North Lateral, which would then be downstream of the meter station. It is stated that the meter station serves West Florida Natural Gas Company (West Florida) and that the lateral line would be abandoned by sale to West Florida, which is the only shipper served through this lateral. It is asserted that West Florida has requested the relocation and will reimburse FGT for all direct and indirect costs. FGT estimates the cost of the relocation at $63,000. It is asserted that the relocation will allow a greater hourly flow through the meter station and give West Florida the economic ability to loop the Ocala North Lateral to utilize their existing certificated capacity. It is stated that the relocation will permit the delivery of up to 300 MMBtu of natural gas per hour to West Florida. It is asserted that the relocation of facilities will not result in any change in the daily or annual quantities that FGT is authorized to deliver to West Florida. FGT states that it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries at the relocated meter station without detriment or disadvantage to any of FGT's other customers. Comment date: October 24, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs F.

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and/or permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for applicant to appear or be represented at the hearing. G.

If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
