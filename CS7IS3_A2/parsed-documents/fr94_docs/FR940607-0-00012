ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains the final regulations relating to the recovery of reasonable administrative costs incurred by taxpayers in connection with an administrative proceeding within the Internal Revenue Service.

These regulations affect all taxpayers involved in an administrative proceeding within the Internal Revenue Service, and provide guidance regarding the definition of reasonable administrative costs and the period within which the costs must be incurred in order to be recoverable. These regulations also set forth the requirements and procedures for the recovery of such costs, and the definitions of prevailing party, administrative proceeding and administrative proceeding date. A table of contents to the regulations under section 7430 is provided in ยง301.7430&hyph;0. DATES: Sections 301.7430&hyph;0 and 301.7430&hyph;2 through 301.7430&hyph;6, except for ยง301.7430&hyph;2(c)(5), are effective June 7, 1994, and apply to claims for reasonable administrative costs filed with the Internal Revenue Service after December 23, 1992, with respect to costs incurred in administrative proceedings commenced after November 10, 1988. Section 301.7430&hyph;2(c)(5) is effective March 23, 1993. The amendment to part 602 is effective June 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas D.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in these final regulations has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 1545&hyph;1356. The estimated average annual burden per respondent is 120 minutes. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. Background Proposed additions to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR Part 301) under section 7430 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) were published in the Federal Register on December 23, 1992 (57 FR 61020 [IA&hyph;003&hyph;89, 1993&hyph;1 C.B. 789]). These proposed additions were issued under the authority contained in section 7805 of the Code. A summary of the proposed additions is contained in the preamble that was published with the proposed additions. Changes to the Proposed Regulations No changes have been made to the proposed regulations. One public comment objected to the failure of the regulations to provide for the recovery of amounts expended by taxpayers during the examination of their returns. As section 7430 does not provide for such awards, this suggestion was not adopted. After consideration of the public comment received, the proposed regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Thomas D. Moffitt, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Field Service), Internal Revenue Service. However, other personnel from the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department participated in their development.
