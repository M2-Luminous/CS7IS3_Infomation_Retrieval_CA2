"I cannot help describing such a decision to resuscitate the Super 301 as unproductive," the top government spokesman told a news conference. Noting Tokyo has decided to voluntarily devise a package of possible measures to further open its markets by the end of March, Takemura said, "we strongly urge the U.S. Government to take sensible action." The chief cabinet secretary made the comments after THE NEW YORK TIMES reported Clinton is scrambling to reinstate his legal authority to impose early sanctions on Japan. Super 301, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1988, gives the President the right to retaliate against countries which the United States deems to be engaging in unfair trade practices.
