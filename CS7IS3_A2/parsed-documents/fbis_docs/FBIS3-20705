Anyone who believed in the "ramming" force of the PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party] has also deceived himself. On the Romanian political scene, things will continue to remain as they have been. At least this is the outcome of the much awaited and much trumpeted "summit" meeting on Monday night between the PDSR and PUNR staffs. Although the "provincial party" of Mr. Funar said that it was "disappointed because of the postponement of the discussions" and morally offended by the insulting remark that its entry into the government had "an unpleasant effect abroad," finally, it had to swallow its pride once again (after the retraction in regard to the "Caritas" pyramid scheme in exchange for the promise that it would have a role in the governing process) and stop threatening to withdraw parliamentary support for the present government. However, this decision was made by Caesarean section and seems to have left some traces. Since, at the time of the nocturnal summit, two factions seemed to be clearly outlined: that of Mr. Funar (who persisted in the idea of withdrawing parliamentary support) and that of Deputy Chairman Ioan Gavra (who lowered the flag, agreeing to five-party negotiations for a possible reorganization, only to become poor PUNR members with something like the "bone of discord".) At breakfast, Oliviu Gherman, chairman of the governing party, was finally able to calm down Funar and his people, promising them that the PDSR would accept the protocol for governing adopted in Cluj, a protocol which would be the object of negotiations among the five parties (the PDSR, PUNR, PSM [Socialist Labor Party], PRM [Greater Romania Party], and PDAR [Romanian Democratic Agrarian Party]), which will conclude on 1 March. Although, in accordance with the psychological warfare of parallel statements, nothing should be taken seriously: "It is fortunate that this provision (that is, the five-party structure -- our note) will not be final, probably. I hope that our colleagues will have good sense and will not get into such things" (PUNR deputy Horea Pop); "We have gained two weeks; the PUNR has given up the idea of a two-color government and has accepted, in principle, the idea of a government that includes representatives of the Opposition. The deadline can be extended since it is not final" (Dumitru Pislaru -- PDSR spokesman). In conclusion, here are the words of a much quoted and disputed Dambovitan politician: In politics (and, especially, in present-day Romanian politics) there is always a subterfuge, therefore, nothing sensational!
