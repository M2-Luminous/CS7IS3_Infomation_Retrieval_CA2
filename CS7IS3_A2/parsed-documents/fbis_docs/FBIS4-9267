The government dismissed the 26 mayors on Tuesday [19 April] on charges of disloyalty and professional inadequacy. The mayors had signed a statement condemning President Michal Kovac's speech of March 19 in which he criticised the then premier, Vladimir Meciar. The SNS considers the government's approach to be a threat to democracy, and this was something especially serious in view of the coming elections (September 30-October 1), Deputy Chairman Eva Slavkovska said. Slavkovska admitted that it was not usual for a state official to criticise the head of state. However, she stressed, "it is not usual either for the president to destablilise the domestic situation in his own state." Kovac's speech is generally considered to have provided the impulse for the dismissal by parliament of Meciar and his government. Slota forecast that after changes in the leadership of the National Property Fund and the Supreme Control Office and the dismissal of the mayors, there would follow purges in the economic sphere above all, where the government parties would want to influence privatisation and finance. These changes would upset the Slovak economy further, he said. "I believe this state has now actually collapsed and will only go on through inertia," he added. "We have a long way to go to democracy, even if our ears are full of it," Slota said.
