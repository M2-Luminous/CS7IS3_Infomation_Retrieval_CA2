As a federal army, we could be among the first to be accepted into this organization," General Ante Roso, HVO representative in the Joint Command of the Federation that has recently become operational in Sarajevo, told Sarajevo OSLOBODJENJE on Thursday [19 May]. According to General Roso, the Croatian side has proposed that the home guard be the basis of the Federation's future defense. "In this way, neither would the Croats disarm the Bosniaks, nor would the Bosniaks disarm the Croats." The other component of the defense system would be the regular army, in which 18 to 25 year olds -- male and female -- would serve a 10 to 12 month term, said General Roso, and added that, for example, a student could serve his or her term in some institute, because "carrying arms is not the only way to serve in the army...." The third component of the Federation's defense would be professional brigades for interventions and border units. The Joint Command of the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in Sarajevo is for the time being not making any decisions on combat activities, and it does not have the authority to directly command the forces. The Command creates conditions for maintaining the current cease-fire, the safety of communications, and the restoration of trust between people, said General Roso.
