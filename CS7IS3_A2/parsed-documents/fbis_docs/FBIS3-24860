The soldiers moved for the first time against the protesters who had put up roadblocks in the northern Ngagara district of the capital for the third day running, an AFP correspondent said. Army chief of staff Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Bikomagu earlier said soldiers had "used the means of discussion" to make people go back to their homes, but warned that "if they refuse and the situation worsens, we have other means." [passage omitted] Opposition leaders on Tuesday refused to meet Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi, a Tutsi, to try to settle the dispute. On Wednesday, one party leader, Joseph Nzeyimana of the Rally for Democracy and Economic and Social Development, said on the radio that "the opposition refuses to talk to a government which has made itself both prosecutor and jury in this affair." [passage omitted] In the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, a gathering of foreign ministers in the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) on Wednesday denounced what they called "negative actions" aimed at "torpedoing efforts to bring peace" to Burundi. In a statement, the OAU ministers expressed their "full support for the OAU in its backing for the legitimate government in Burundi." The pan-African body has agreed to deploy a confidence-building and protection mission of 200 men, including 180 soldiers, in the country, but the opposition has vowed to oppose this move. Kinigi's government asked for international help after it was forced into hiding in foreign missions for several weeks during the strife that followed the murder of Ndadaye, the first elected Hutu president, and some of his aides.
