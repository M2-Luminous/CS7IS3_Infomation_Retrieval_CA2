He stressed to ITAR-TASS that computer crimes themselves are capable of causing as much monetary damage as all the art thefts in the entire world. The most danger is represented by attempts to penetrate the networks controlling energy systems, the production of dangerous substances, and the use and control of troops and weapons, Rubanov said. Some of the state's top-priority tasks in the information security field concern the defence of personal informational rights and intellectual property, the official said. Special attention should be paid to preventing the distortion, concealment, and destruction of information. Leaks of information representing state secrets must likewise not be tolerated. Adherence to such guidelines is designed to ensure information security in the political, economic, military, and other essential spheres of Russia's activity, Rubanov explained. Important steps towards the defence of security contained in and transmitted by computers will be personal access devices which identify the user of a computer and the quick-acting algorythyms in the cryptographic programme "electronic signature". If these defence measures are not taken advantage of, computer crimes could block the work of Russia's banking systems, as exemplified by the recent attempt to steal 68 billion roubles through the Russian Central Bank's computer system. The Russian Federation's conception of information security, which was examined by the Security Council Inter-Departmental Commission on Monday, should be considered an integral part of the country's system of national security, Rubanov declared.
