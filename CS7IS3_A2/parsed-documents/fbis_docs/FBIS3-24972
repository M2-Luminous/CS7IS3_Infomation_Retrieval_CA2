The shooting, which was heard in Lome, provoked a movement of panic among the peaceful people of our capital. As our security forces posted around the Protestatnt High School were getting ready to face any threat, there was another serious incident in which one person was wounded. The government hereby reassures the people and asks them to go about their normal business. One may recall that during two recent meetings between Togolese and Ghanaian security officials, it was agreed that every effort would be made to prevent shooting in order not to cause panic among the people on both sides of the border.
