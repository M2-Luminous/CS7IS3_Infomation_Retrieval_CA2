He also raved that the workers, entrepreneurs and "government" should all make every possible effort to make this year the first year of "labor-management cooperation". Commenting on this, a MINJU CHOSON analyst today says it is another crafty sermon aimed at destroying the labor movement. The news analyst goes on: The traitor Kim Yong-sam's call for concerted efforts of the workers, entrepreneurs and "government" stems from his ulterior intention to benumb the fighting consciousness of workers through tieup between the puppet authorities and comprador business men. He blared that workers should completely discard the concept of the past that antagonism and struggle are the only way of living. This means, in the final analysis, that workers should not put any any demand, not wage any struggle but meekly obey the acts of exploitation by entrepreneurs. His talk about active support for the businesses successful in "labor-management cooperation" and no profits for those under disputes means that privileges and special favor will be granted to the comprador businesses and that the authorities and entrepreneurs will contain the labor moement of workers through their tieup. The traitor Kim Yong-sam, flocking together with the comprador clan which battens on the sweat and blood of people, will never stand on the side of workers.
