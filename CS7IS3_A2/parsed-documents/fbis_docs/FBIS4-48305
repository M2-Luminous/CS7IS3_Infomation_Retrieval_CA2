The money was spent on tidying up the nation's books and settling some apartheid debts. Economists warn that SA [South Africa] is careering to South American-style debt and future generations will bear a heavy burden. The nine new regions will shoulder part of the R15-billion debt inherited from the homelands. Finance Director-General Estian Calitz says the regions will be responsible only for "that portion of the debt linked to assets". Most of it will be taken over by the Government. It is faced with a 13 percent rise in the interest bill from R20.5-billion in 1993-94 to about R23-billion -- the largest item in the next budget. Mike Brown, economist at stockbroker Frankel Pollak Vinderine, says: "State debt is approaching danger levels. The real problem is the rate at which the interest burden is rising relative to economic growth." Economist Edward Osborn says the interest burden is running out of control, restricting the new Government's ability to embark on radical spending programmes. "There is no easy way out. The new administration inherits the problems caused by decades of economic mismanagement. The country is in a public-debt trap." Total State debt is more than R200-billion, about 55 percent of gross domestic product [GDP]. This compares with R155-billion, or 46.5 percent of GDP, in March last year. It is still shy of the internationally accepted ceiling of 60 percent of GDP. In a valedictory vote of thanks to public servants, government stock of R7.3-billion was issued to offset the R29-billion actuarial shortfall in State pension funds. The outgoing Government borrowed R30.5-billion in the past year to balance the Budget, bringing to R45-billion the amount of interest-bearing stock issued for the year. The interest is R4- billion. Dr Calitz says: "The homeland debts were being serviced all along through transfers from SA and the homelands' own resources. Consolidating the homeland debt does not add to overall expenditure, it merely shifts its location." Notions that SA is "underborrowed", as suggested by some in the ANC, are rejected by economists. Mr Brown says: "The reconstruction and development programme will have to be partially funded through the capital markets and this will strain the capacity of the market to absorb new debt issues. "The Government will have to offer higher interest rates on new stock, adding to the interest burden." Mr Osborn questions official figures showing the deficit for the year to March to be on target at 6.8 percent of GDP. "I suspect that they have fudged the final deficit figure. There is R2-billion of additional expenditure for the provinces which does not appear to have been accounted for." Mr Osborn predicts the interest bill could be as high as R26- billion in the coming year. Finance officials dispute Mr Osborn's predictions. Finance Minister Derek Keys says extra-budgetary commitments add R2-billion to the deficit.
