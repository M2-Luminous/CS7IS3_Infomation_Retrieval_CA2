FBIS4-34698 "drlat121_o_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-121 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 Colombia Pastrana Holds News Conference on Drug Tape Pastrana Holds News Conference on Drug Tape PA2306005394 PA2306005394 BFN [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish at 1519 GMT on 22 June broadcasts live in progress, from an undisclosed location, a 62-minute news conference by Andres Pastrana, former Colombian presidential candidate of the New Democratic Force party, with unidentified domestic and foreign reporters. Pastrana begins by saying "the president-elect is lying when he tried to implicate the campaign of Andres Pastrana and Luis Fernando Ramirez in drug trafficking activities." He then adds: "That is why I convened this news conference, to set the record straight." At 1521 GMT, Pastrana comments on the audio cassette recordings of individuals allegedly linking his and President-elect Samper's presidential campaigns with drug money. He then reads a statement, which begins by noting that "on 15 June at the Intercontinental Hotel in Cali, upon leaving a banquet offered by Valle del Cauca political leaders, a person gave me a tape and said it was important." Pastrana then gives a chronology of the events leading up to the disclosure of the cassette recordings. Pastrana later reads a letter he sent to Samper asking him to rebut charges drug money was being used for his electoral campaign if there was nothing to hide, "a thing he did not do." Pastrana explains he refused to use this recording for electoral purposes. He states: "Knowing about this tape before the elections, the cassette was not used for electoral purposes." At 1530 GMT, Pastrana begins playing a portion of the tape recording, with poor reception, of two unidentified individuals suggesting that Pastrana's and Samper's campaigns received drug money. He stops the recording to note that his campaign treasurer had turned down an offer, conveyed by journalist Alberto Giraldo, from "some people in Cali who wished to donate money for the campaign of Andres Pastrana." Pastrana then continues playing the recording of two unidentified men discussing possible campaign contributions. After playing the recording, Pastrana says: "At no time does the recording refer to donations to my campaign." He then says he received a call from the prosecutor general asking him to confirm the delivery of the tape to President Gaviria, and he says he will confirm this delivery. Pastrana states that "from the tapes, it cannot be inferred that my campaign requested or received offers of drug money." He states: "If it is proven that the Colombian president-elect's campaign received funds from drug traffickers, he will relinquish the mandate he received from the people; otherwise his credentials will be distorted." When asked if he is asking Dr. Samper to resign, Pastrana asserts: "If it is confirmed that drug money was used for his campaign, he should be ready to resign the presidency as I would be if I won the election and if my campaign had received drug money." When asked how can he assure he did not receive Cartel money, Pastrana says: "Do you think I would go to the president of the Republic and tell him, here is a tape that compromises me, please investigate me." He continues: "Three days before the elections I made a clear proposal. After learning about the tape, I said I was willing to resign if it were proven that there was drug money in my campaign." Pastrana explains he is not hesitant to surrender the accounting books of his campaign, adding: "Those books are always open. In my case, we have not only turned the books over to the supervisory commission but also to the National Electoral Council, which closes out electoral campaign books." When asked if he would be willing to cooperate with the Samper administration after it is confirmed Samper did not receive drug money, Pastrana says: "I personally do not hope to participate in the Samper administration." Pastrana asserts: "No one in the world can say my campaign was funded by drug money." When asked about General Maza's involvement in this episode, Pastrana responds: "This is worrisome; there are statements in the recording that are very worrisome. It is up to the public to assess these statements." Responding to an indistinct question, Pastrana says: "More than thinking about a deterioration of relations with the United States, the country demands that this matter be clarified." When questioned if he is ready to lead a movement to force the resignation of a corrupt president similar to those in Brazil and Venezuela, Pastrana says: "I would rather wait for the results of the investigation." Pastrana concludes his news conference by saying he has received death threats from the drug cartels and by answering questions on the upcoming soccer match between Colombia and the United States.
