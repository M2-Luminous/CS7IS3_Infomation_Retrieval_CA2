FBIS4-45649 "jpten015___94052" JPRS-TEN-94-015 JPRS Environmental Issues 9 June 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA RUSSIA Draft Concept of Russian Federation Environmental Security Draft Concept of Russian Federation Environmental Security 94WN0267A Moscow ZELENYY MIR in Russian No 1, 1994 pp 6-9 94WN0267A Moscow ZELENYY MIR Russian CSO ["Draft Concept of Russian Federation Environmental Security"] [Text] When the Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources begin developing a draft "Concept of Russian Federation Environmental Security" in February 1992 it recruited the assistance of more than 50 scientists and specialists from the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and the science sections of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Russian Ministry of Health and other ministries. The project's scientific director was V. G. Gorelov, doctor of medical sciences and deputy chief of the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Main Administration for Environmental Security. When (on 8 February 1993) a draft version of this Concept was approved in its entirety by the ministry board, a recommendation was made by A. V. Yablokov, Russian presidential advisor for ecology and health care, that the draft Concept be sent to regional environmental protection agencies so that they could examine it, interpret it, discuss it and formulate their comments and suggestions... The Main Administration for Environmental Security under the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources [Minprirody Rossii], taking the numerous comments into consideration, further edited the draft in the spring of last year and, as is customary, sent it out for consultation with regional environmental protection agencies and affected ministries and agencies. We should note that an absolute majority of the 46 responses (41 from environmental protection agencies and five from ministries and other agencies) received by the framers of the draft Concept expressed support for the main points in the Concept. All comments and suggestions of a primarily editorial or clarifying nature were taken into consideration in the version of the draft Concept being published in ZELENYY MIR today under the heading "A Document --Let Us Discuss It..." Do the Concept's authors agree with all the comments? No -- they contested all comments that were purely directed toward a single department (the Russian State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight [Gossanepidnadzor Rossii] and the Russian Federation State Committee on Civil Defense, Emergency Situations and Liquidation of the Consequences of Natural Disasters [GKChS Rossii]). But compromises were reached on those points as well in the course of further editing. * * * Table of Contents Introduction 1. General Principles 1.1. Fundamental Concepts and Definitions 1.2.

Conditions Essential for the Implementation of Environmental Security Strategy * * * Introduction This Concept reflects the official views of the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (Minprirody Rossii) on current principles, methods and mechanisms for environmental protection and efficient use of natural resources, which are an inalienable part of state policy with regard to our country's economic and social development. The current scale of environmental changes is creating a real threat to the public's life and health. The necessity of compensating for losses due to major accidents and natural disasters will require that economic resources be shifted away from performing strategic tasks in connection with the formation of a new economic structure toward fruitless attempts to maintain the economy in its current state. The greatest environmental threat is due to chemical factors, protection against which should be regarded as a priority objective. A faulty method of neutralizing emissions and discharges now predominates -- i.e. their dispersion and dilution to "safe" levels, levels that were established without consideration for the possibility of secondary concentration of eco-toxins at points in the environment, or their transformation into more toxic compounds. Particularly dangerous are the super-toxins, pollution by which is increasingly rapidly. There is a tremendous environmental threat from radioactive contamination, and one that is rapidly increasing in proportion to the accumulation of radioactive waste from spent atomic reactors from nuclear power plants, submarines, nuclear-powered surface ships, etc. There is a great danger of changes in the biological balance, particularly the correlation between pathogenic and saprophytic microorganisms and undesirable mutations in them. The speed with which the intensity of the adverse effects of external factors is increasing has surpassed limits on the speed of living systems' capability of biological adaptation to their environment. Destabilization of the environment is directly linked to a decline in public health. Russia ranks fifty-first in the world in terms of average life span, and its infant mortality rate is high. If these negative trends are not halted, then by the middle of the 21st century scarcity of food, water and oxygen, coupled with the genetic burden, will significantly accelerate the degeneration of populations and their gradual extinction. The basis for the creation of an environmental security policy is the creation of an adequate organizational, legal and sociopolitical economic mechanism for the management of natural resource use that is based on modern quantitative data regarding the possibility of counteracting anthropogenic and naturally-occurring biosphere destruction. In order to solve these urgent problems it is essential to formulate a general Concept of Russian Environmental Security and develop a methodology for its implementation. 1. General Principles 1.1. Fundamental Concepts and Definitions The environmental threat is the probability of destruction of the human habitat and the plants and animals connected with it as a result of uncontrolled economic development, outdated technologies and anthropogenic accidents and disasters which result in disruption of living systems' adaptation to the conditions under which they exist. Environmental security is the process of providing protection for the vitally important interests of the individual, society, nature and the state against actual or potential threats created by human or natural influence on the environment. An environmental security system is the aggregate of legislative, technical, medical and biological measures aimed at supporting the balance between the biosphere and both anthropogenic and natural external burdens. The subjects of environmental security are the individual, society, the biosphere and the state. The objects of environmental security are the vitally important interests of the subjects of security -- rights, the individual's physical and intellectual needs, natural resources and the natural environment -- as the physical foundation of state and social development. An environmental security policy is purposeful action by the state, public organizations and legal and physical persons to ensure environmental security. Environmental risk is the probability of unfavorable effects on the environment as the results of any anthropogenic changes in natural sites or factors. Maximum permissible environmental burden is the maximum level of effects by anthropogenic factors at which the functional integrity of ecosystems is maintained. An environmental emergency zone is a section of territory where as a result of commercial or other activities there occur persistent negative changes in the environment, resulting in disruption of public health or disruption of the balance among natural ecosystems, in particular damage to the genetic stock of plants and animals. An environmental disaster area is a section of territory where as a result of commercial or other activities and/or natural disasters irreversible changes have occurred in the environment, resulting in a rise in the rate of diseases and mortality among the population and destruction of biocenoses. Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not simply the absence of the incidence of disease or disability (World Health Organization). 1.2. Specific Economic and Social Features of Russia's Development From the standpoint of environmental security one must delineate the following specific economic and social features of Russia's development: -- extensive development of the economy coupled with single-purpose use of natural resources, huge volumes of raw materials extraction and sales, the absence of a system for processing household and industrial wastes, and development of new agricultural land and abandonment of previous agricultural areas; -- a distorted economic structure with a prevalence of natural resource-intensive types of production that create a constant and excessive overload on ecosystems; -- a militarized economy; -- unreliable technical systems and inadequate training of personnel at enterprises with heightened environmental risk; -- outdated and ineffective environmental protection equipment at the final stages of technological processes; -- biological hazard -- danger to human beings, produce and natural ecosystems as a result of activity by living organisms; -- increasing urban population and an increasing supply of goods and services in the state-owned and private sectors of the economy, resulting in greater consumption of natural resources; -- natural and anthropogenic accidents, disasters and catastrophes; -- transportation-related effects; -- a distorted system for assessing environmental benefit and environmental losses, resulting in unprofitable natural resource use; -- a lack of institutions and experience with environmental regulation of commercial activities; -- a lack of a well-designed national system for environmental education and training and cultivation of an environmental world view; -- a lack of unity in the state's administration of environmental security. 1.3. Laws, Principles and Regulations Pertaining to Biosphere Function Laws "Internal dynamic balance": the matter, energy, information and quality of individual natural systems and their hierarchy are interconnected to such an extent that any change in one of those indices causes accompanying functional-structural qualitative and quantitative changes, maintaining the total amount of matter and energy and the informational and dynamic qualities of systems and their hierarchies. "All or nothing" (Kh. Boumech [sp?]): weak influences may not cause reciprocal reactions in natural systems until such time as they accumulate and result in the development of a turbulent, dynamic process. "The minimum" (Yu. Libikh): opportunities for life are delimited by environmental factors, the number and quality of which is close to the required minimum for an organism or an ecosystem, and further reduction thereof will result in the death of the organism or destruction of the ecosystem. "Evolutionary and environmental irreversibility": an ecosystem that has lost part of its elements cannot return to its original state. "The irreplaceability of the biosphere" (V. G. Gorshkov): reduction of the natural biota in an amount exceeding a threshold level deprives the environment of stability that cannot be restored through the use of treatment facilities or a transition to no-waste production. Principles The Le Shatelier-Braun Principle: in the event of an external influence that brings a system out of stable balance, the balance shifts in the direction in which the external influence becomes weaker. Remoteness of events: a phenomenon that is distant in time or space appears less significant. In the field of natural resource use this principle is especially frequently the basis for incorrect practical measures. Sudden intensification of pathogenicity: unexpected intensification of pathogenicity occurs upon mutation of a disease-producing organism, upon introduction of a new disease-producing organism into an ecosystem which has no mechanisms to regulate its numbers, or upon a very sharp change in the ecosystem's environment. Reasonable sufficiency and acceptability of risk: expansion of any human activities should not result in socioeconomic or environmental disasters. Rules Mutual adaptation (K. Mebius and G. F. Morozov): species in a biocenosis are adapted to each other to such an extent that their community constitutes an internally contradictory yet unified and interconnected systemic whole. Integral resource: competition between economic sectors with regard to the use of specific natural systems is inevitable, and they harm each other more in proportion to how significantly they change their jointly exploited environmental component or the entire ecosystem. Measures of natural system transformation: in the course of utilizing natural systems there are certain bounds that must not be overstepped if those systems are to maintain their self-supporting capacity (self-organization and self-regulation). Correspondence between environmental conditions and an organism's genetic predisposition: a species of an organism can exist only so long as the natural environment surrounding it is in line with that species' genetic adaptation capacity relative to the environment's variations and changes. Chain reactions from "strict" management of nature: "strict" and, as a rule, technical management of natural processes is fraught with the possibility of chain reactions, a significant portion of which will prove environmentally, socially and economically unacceptable. 1.4. Fundamental Principles of Ensuring Environmental Security The fundamental principles of ensuring environmental security consist of the following: -- social and economic development of society in the course of which people are ensured an improving quality of life coupled with a reduction in or stabilization of negative effects on the natural environment, and in which the laws of development for the biosphere and natural climate zones are observed; -- compliance with permissible levels of effects on the natural environment and on human beings as established by the state and the components of the Federation; -- non-depleting natural resource use in which the resource supply satisfies the interests of current and future generations equally; -- the obligation to compensate for damage done to the health of human beings and nature, and mutual responsibility of territorial administrative units for the state of the environment and cross-border transfer of pollutants; -- timely identification and restoration of disrupted territories (or bodies of water), ecosystems and natural complexes; -- preservation of biological diversity; -- the applicability of international law and compliance with bilateral and multilateral treaties regulating natural resource use and quality of life. 1.5. Goals of the Concept of Environmental Security The goals of this Concept are: -- development of conceptual foundations for an overall strategy in the field of environmental protection and efficient use of natural resources for the purpose of our country's sustainable economic and social development; -- definition of achievable mid-range and long-range goals and tasks in the field of environmental protection; -- definition of the structure and tasks of and mutual relations between components of the system for Russia's ensuring environmental security; -- identification of specific goals and tasks involved in the planning of policy and programs that must be adopted and carried out by the Government and regional administrative bodies. 2. Environmental Problems and Trends The current state of the environment attests to the fact that environmental problems are due to two basic factors: wasteful natural resource use, which reduces the biosphere's productivity, and pollution, which threatens all living things and in particular human health and well-being. It would be appropriate to consider critical environmental problems within the framework of the following sections: the atmosphere, inland surface and underground waters and seas, soil protection and land use, forests, wilderness and genetic resources, wastes and toxic chemicals, social factors, energy, industry and transportation. 2.1. The Atmosphere The principle pollutants in the air and precipitation are sulfur oxides, nitrogen, carbon, airborne organic substances, suspended particles, bonded heavy metals and organic compounds. These all have an adverse cumulative effect on human health, animals and plants. Also alarming are pollutants such as chlorofluorocarbons, halogens, and nitrogen and carbon oxides, which alter the distribution and concentration of ozone, affect the thermal balance and change climate. Environmental problems connected with the cross-border transfer of atmospheric pollutants over great distances are acute. 2.2. Inland Waters and Seas The priority environmental problems in the field of water protection are: -- diversion of water from a number of river basins and underground sources in excess of environmentally permissible levels; -- depletion of small rivers; -- large water losses as a result of water system disrepair and imperfect technological processes; -- discharge of polluted waste water into bodies of water; -- cross-border water pollution. The greatest contribution to surface water pollution comes from enterprises in the ferrous and non-ferrous metals, chemical, petrochemical, oil, gas, coal, timber and paper industries, as well as agricultural enterprises and municipal services enterprises. Russia's sea basins are beings polluted by petroleum products, phenols, copper, zinc and chrome compounds and chloro-organic pesticides, with a trend toward increasing levels of pollution. 2.3. Soil Protection and Land Use The following types of pollution and soil degradation are most widespread in various regions: -- planar and channel erosion; -- gully erosion; -- accumulation or depletion of specific chemical elements; -- rise or fall in underground water level; -- salination; -- solonetzization; -- loss of organic substances and humus; -- loss of nutritive elements and increasing soil acidity; -- accumulation of toxic substances; etc. Large-scale use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides has resulted in contamination of surface waters and alteration of aquatic ecosystems. As a result of erosion processes, the spread of excessively wet, salinated or swampy land, and overgrowth by forests and shrubs there has been a decrease in the extent of arable land. Soils for a distance of several tens of kilometers around cities and industrial centers are contaminated by petroleum products, heavy metals and toxic organic substances. Large sections of land have been removed from agricultural use by development of oil, gas and coal fields, iron ore deposits and other minerals. The mining industry is one of the largest sources of environmental degradation and pollution. 2.4. Forests Degradation of forests results from gaseous air pollutants, precipitation of acidic components and heavy metals, changes in climatic conditions, etc. As a result of intensive commercial activity and losses due to forest fires, stands of mature timber are declining in evergreen forests in the European part of Russia. Forests are protected against fires on just 65 percent of Russia's total forest area. Deforestation creates environmental problems such as rapid sedimentation of bodies of water, soil erosion, reduction in water supply, etc. 2.5. Biological Diversity The present state of the environment permits one to define the principal negative phenomena in the environmental life cycle as: -- decreasing biological diversity; -- smaller populations of a number of species; -- accelerated aging of populations; -- disappearance of individual species from biocenoses; -- impoverishment of flora and fauna, particularly in areas with a high concentration of industry and population. 2.6. Wastes Russia currently has more than 50 billion metric tons of wastes stored on an area of 250,000 hectares. A significant portion of this waste is classified as toxic substances of industrial origin. Russia lacks appropriate environmental standards for enterprises with regard to the neutralization and storage of toxic industrial waste. Approximately four billion curies of radioactive waste have accumulated in special containers, uncovered pools, other bodies of water and near-surface burial sites. Each year more than 130 million metric tons of solid household waste is created and transported to dumps and landfills. Industrial and household wastes place a major burden on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and present a serious threat to the health of human beings and the environment. 2.7. Energy, Industry and Transportation Approximately 25 percent of all substances that pollute the air in Russia enter the environment as a result of the combustion of fuel in power-producing, heating and industrial boilers. The degree of environmental pollution in areas where heavy industry is concentrated is horrifying. Motor vehicle exhaust fumes pollute the air with hydrocarbons, lead and oxides of sulfur, nitrogen and carbon, and also contribute to acid rain. 2.8. Social Factors The social environment may be envisioned as being comprised of subsystems such as demography, economics, education, social structure and culture, as well as dependent factors -- stresses on human beings. In this period of economic transition to a market economy the following events have become critical: -- loss of our country's intellectual potential due to emigration by scientists and specialists; -- changes in nutrition; -- a decline in the birthrate; -- lack of access to medical care among certain segments of the population; -- vocational reorientation; -- inaccessibility of recreational sites due to their high cost; -- a state of heightened personal and social stress. 3. A System of Long-Range Goals The following may be defined as strategic goals: -- creation of an environment favorable to human health; -- assurance of rational, non-depleting natural resource use, biosphere balance, preservation of the genetic stock as well as species and landscape diversity, and balance between the processes of reproduction and utilization of renewable natural resources. 3.1.

The Russian Environmental Security System (RosSEB) 4.1. Goals and Tasks The components required for compliance with environmental security requirements are guarantees of chemical, radiation, biological and industrial safety throughout Russia. Involved in the implementation of measures designed to achieve, maintain and monitor compliance with environmental security requirements are various Russia ministries, agencies, institutions and organizations. A real effect from such measures can be achieved only if they are applied in a comprehensive manner, which in turn will require the application of a clearly-defined mechanism for organizational management of all participants in this process. A Russian Environmental Security System (RosSEB) [Rossiyskaya sistema ekologicheskoy bezopasnosti) will have to be established to provide that mechanism. RosSEB's principal tasks will be: -- organizational management of the process of achieving target indices of environmental security throughout all of Russia and in its individual territorial administrative units; -- organization and implementation of monitoring of compliance with environmental security requirements; -- interaction with other state systems working to support the life of society and the public, in particular with the Russian Council on Emergency Situations; -- prevention and elimination of the environmental effects of industrial and natural accidents and disasters; -- prevention of the emergence of environmental problem and disaster zones or environmental emergencies, as well as participation in the organization of efforts to eliminate their effects when they do emerge; -- assessment of the state of environmental security in Russia, and projection of its dynamics; -- provision of a unified state policy that will formulate guarantees for the reliable existence and sustainable development of the objects of environmental security; -- planning and coordination of compliance with comprehensive programs for environmental protection and efficient natural resource use; -- creation, development and equipping of personnel and means for ensuring environmental security in Russia; -- coordination of international agreements on ways to ensure Russia's environmental security. 4.2. RosSEB Structure RosSEB will consist of macrosystem administrative bodies, personnel and equipment which will support systems and perform the tasks assigned to RosSEB, as well as means of information support for the decision-making process. All these elements of the macrosystem should be interconnected in a single system for information transfer and command-and-administrative actions. Establishment of the RosSEB should occur on principles of organizational unification of the individual functional elements and structures which currently exist within ministries and agencies for the purpose of resolving individual environmental security issues. The principal organizational support mechanisms should be: -- directed state programs in the field of environmental security; -- unified environmental security requirements; -- unified targeted indices of environmental security and unified regulations and procedures for achieving them; -- unified state monitoring of compliance with environmental security requirements and compliance with target indices; -- information interaction in support of organizational management. Performance of these functions should be assigned to the state administrative agency that is responsible for implementation of policy in the field of environmental security, i.e. the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (see chart). The functional subsystems of environmental security administration include: -- a subsystem for regional administration of environmental security; -- a subsystem for administration of the environmental security of potentially hazardous sites; -- a subsystem for management of industrially-produced and other environmentally hazardous and toxic wastes; -- a subsystem for nuclear and radiation security; -- a subsystem for recovery from the effects of environmental emergencies; -- a subsystem for management of environmental security in connection with military activities (with the exception of a special period); -- a subsystem for management of the state of public health; -- a state monitoring system (environmental monitoring, industrial monitoring, etc.). The state monitoring system: environmental monitoring (EGSM [Unified State Monitoring System], EGASKRO [expansion unclear]); medical and biological monitoring (the AIS "Zdorovye" [Health Analysis and Information System], etc.); monitoring of industrial, energy-related and transportation facilities; monitoring of nuclear power facilities; monitoring of potentially hazardous sites; monitoring of sites where hazardous chemical, radioactive or biological wastes and substances are stored or buried; monitoring of production- and consumption-related wastes; monitoring of shipments of hazardous substances and materials; monitoring of hazardous natural phenomena; Monitoring of global natural phenomena and processes; monitoring of agricultural production; monitoring of soils and land. The federal information and analysis system: the information and analysis system (IAS) for environmental security under the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources; territorial (regional) information and analysis systems under the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources; the Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight [Gosgortekhnadzor] IAS; the Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor] IAS; the Russian State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight [Gossanepidnadzor] and Ministry of Health IAS; the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control [Rosgidromet] IAS. The Environmental Security Automated Information and Control System [AIUS "Ekologicheskaya bezopasnost"]: a consultation and administration system under the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (the Ministry's central apparatus); a consultation and administration system under regional agencies of the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection (the Ministry's regional committees); administrative systems under the Russian State Committee for Emergency Situations, Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight, Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, the Russian Ministry of Health, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control. The means of achieving environmental security are: a normative legal foundation; environmental programs; state environmental monitoring; licensing of activities; environmental impact assessment; regulations and standards; environmental education and training; international cooperation. The personnel that will ensure environmental security are: subordinate divisions of environmental assessment and inspection agencies; Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection emergency environmental aid personnel; subordinate divisions of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Russian Ministry of Security; subordinate divisions of the Russian State Committee for Emergency Situations, including Civil Defense units; medical services; services for the protection of plant and animal life; subordinate divisions of the Russian Ministry of Transportation, the Russian Ministry of Railways, and other specialized units and divisions which carry out measures and actions to protect the public and the natural environment. The objects of administration are the ministries and agencies which carry out state administration of environmentally harmful and hazardous types of activities, in particular the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, Ministry of Fuel and Energy, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Agriculture and State Committee for Architecture and Construction. 5. The Mechanism for Ensuring Russia's Environmental Security The mechanisms for achieving this goal are: -- a legislative and normative legal basis for activities in the field of environmental security; -- an organizational basis for administration of efforts with regard to ensuring environmental security; -- economic mechanisms; -- a technological basis for environmentally safe development of industry, energy production and transportation; -- state monitoring of activities by ministries and agencies in the field of compliance with environmental security requirements as they go about implementing Russia's state environmental policy; -- use of scientific-technical and production potential in the defense sectors of industry. 6. Conditions Essential for the Implementation of Environmental Security Strategy Environmental security must become an inseparable part of efforts by the state and its organs in the field of ensuring the overall security of society and the state. Environmental protection efforts must become one of the most important functions of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. Environmental protection is based on integration of environmental, economic and social policy. Economic development is based on development of low-waste and no-waste technologies and minimizing of the social and environmental cost of economic activity. There must be active participation in compliance with international conventions on the environment. Current and pending Russian Federation legislation regarding environmental protection and the rational use of natural resources as well as the Statute on the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources are to be based on this Concept. Materials from annual Russian Federation state reports on the state of the environment, the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) and materials from the International Labor Organization, UNESCO, the European Economic Community and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were used in the preparation of this Concept. Individual environmental security concepts submitted to the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources by scientists from various institutions were also analyzed. Figure
