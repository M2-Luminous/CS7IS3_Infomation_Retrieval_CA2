FBIS4-37736 "drnes122dd_94006" FBIS-NES-94-122 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs 'Arafat on Prisoners, Settlements, Independence 'Arafat on Prisoners, Settlements, Independence TA2306174794 Jerusalem AL-QUDS in Arabic 23 Jun 94 pp 1, 18 TA2306174794 Jerusalem AL-QUDS Arabic BFN [Report by 'Abd-al-Jabbar al-Barghuthi] [Text] Tunis -- Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat has condemned the Israeli policy, based on procrastination and foot-dragging, concerning the prisoners and their right to breath the air of freedom and live among their families and near their children, who have been waiting for them impatiently. He called on Rabin's government to honor its obligations by completing the release of prisoners in Israeli jails, without discrimination or vacillation, and granting them the right to live with honor and dignity in any place they wish without being forced to go to this or that area inside the one homeland. 'Arafat affirmed his clear response to the Israeli notion which is trying to put controversial issues on hold under the pretext of "the final stage solution." He considered Jerusalem to be an urgent issue whose final status should be discussed as soon as possible, as stipulated by the Oslo accord despite its bias. 'Arafat said: Our position on the issue of settlements must be one of isolation. We should not create any opportunity for coexistence with the settlements or accept them. They contravene international resolutions and laws and were built, from the start, on a false basis. 'Arafat said: It was not appropriate to refer to the settlements in the economic agreement despite the fact that the Israeli authorities receive 100 percent of the taxes deducted from Palestinian workers in these settlements. We do not want the settlements to remain and do not encourage work in them under any inducement. 'Arafat assured the Palestinian people that the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, with holy Jerusalem as its capital, was inevitable regardless of the statements or the climate propagated by Israeli extremists. 'Arafat affirmed that the aspired for state, for which our people have always dreamed and struggled with their most precious possessions, will belong to all Palestinians wherever they may reside. In this state, they can develop their national and cultural identity and enjoy full and equal rights. Their religious and political beliefs and human dignity will be upheld within framework of a democratic parliamentary system based on freedom of opinion, freedom to establish parties, protection of the minority's rights by the majority, and the minority's respect for the majority's decisions. 'Arafat added that this system will also be based on social justice, equality, and no discrimination toward universal rights on the basis of race, religion, color, or between male and female. This, within framework of a constitution that ensures the sovereignty of law and an independent judiciary and on the basis of effective loyalty to the Palestinian spiritual and cultural heritage of tolerance and smooth coexistence among religions throughout centuries.
