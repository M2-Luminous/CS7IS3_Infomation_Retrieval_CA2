ACTION: Interim final rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim final rule authorizes the use of smaller sized olives in the production of limited use styles for California olives during the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. This action is intended to allow more olives into fresh market channels and is consistent with current market demand for olives. As required under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, this action also changes the import regulation so that it conforms with the requirements established under the California olive marketing order. DATES: Effective September 16, 1994; comments received by October 13, 1994 will be considered prior to issuance of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this rule.

This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements for certain listed commodities, including olives, imported into the United States that are the same as, or comparable to, those imposed upon the domestic commodities regulated under the Federal marketing orders.

The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.
