The State Council members will hold a special meeting today at 0900 in Santa Fe de Bogota to discuss in detail the speech delivered by President Gaviria yesterday at noon and rebroadcast by television at 2000 last night. Caracol interviewed State Council President Amado Gutierrez during the past few hours. Here is his statement: [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] The president obviously has his own criteria, which we respect, but the State Council does not share his views. After thoroughly reviewing the situation--not only yesterday during an eight-hour meeting but for the past 20 days--we reached a different conclusion. We believe our opinion is as respectable as the one the president has just expressed. [Unidentified reporter] President Gaviria has said the State Council's position is political and very vague, which apparently was the reason why he was so upset. [Gutierrez] Regarding our opinion as being political, I must say this subject concerns our national sovereignty and the constitutional system we have had since 1991. From that viewpoint, we could say the matter is political, based on the old concept that politics is the art of governing people the best way possible. It is political in that sense, not in the sense the word politics is usually meant; in other words, it is a political opinion, because it regards the Constitution. Regarding our opinion as being vague, we believe a lengthy report is not necessarily more precise. I believe if we clearly present in two pages a situation actually occurring in the country, it should be enough. [Reporter] How does the State Council view President Gaviria's position on this case, considering the situation of international cooperation in the antidrug-trafficking struggle? [Gutierrez] I do not see why we should associate a statement from the State Council with the antidrug-trafficking struggle. First, the public in general was informed about a community assistance project and the construction of a school and a health center; after that, military exercises were mentioned, and recently the topic is being linked to drug-trafficking problems. Within that line of thought, we do not know where this is going to end. We are respectful of the government functions and policy in dealing with crime in general; we respect that. Nevertheless, we do not see why this matter should be linked to that subject, as it was only mentioned superficially in the document we received from the president. In our opinion, this is basically a legal problem. According to the Constitution, approval by the Senate, which was in session on 29 October 1993 when the agreement was signed, was necessary. During the time the Senate was not in session, the State Council's previous authorization was necessary. It is strictly a legal problem. Any other incidental considerations concerning the policy against crime is totally irrelevant to the subject. [end recording]
