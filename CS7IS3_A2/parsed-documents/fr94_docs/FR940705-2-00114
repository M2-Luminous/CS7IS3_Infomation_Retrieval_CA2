FR940705-2-00114 FR940705-2-00080 [Release No. 34&hyph;34257; File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;11] Self Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change Modifying Fund/Serv Fee June 24, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 1 notice is hereby given that on June 21, 1994, National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by NSCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The text of the proposed rule change is as follows: Italicized text indicates additions Bracketed text indicates deletions Addendum A. * * * * * IV. Other Service Fees * * * * * Q. Fund/Serv (FN10), $0.40 per side per order. * * * * * (10) This fee applies to Members utilizing the revised Fund/Serv service available after December 31, 1992. [Members not utilizing the revised service will continue to be charged $.50 per side per settled transaction.] Effective July 1, 1994 for Members who do not convert to the revised Fund/Serv service by July 31, 1994, the fee will be $.75 per side per settled transaction. * * * * * II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change NSCC advised its members that it would discontinue the old Fund/Serv service on June 30, 1994. Because some members have not completed the conversion from the old Fund/Serv service to the new Fund/Serv service, NSCC has determined not to discontinue the old Fund/Serv service on June 30, 1994, as originally planned. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to modify the fees charged by NSCC for the old Fund/Serv service so as to reflect, in part, the additional cost of simultaneously maintaining both versions of the Fund/Serv system. Currently, old Fund/Serv transactions are $.50 per side per settled transaction. Effective July 1, 1994, for members who do not convert to the revised Fund/Serv service by July 31, 1994, the fee will be $.75 per side per settled transaction. Members who successfully achieve conversion from the old Fund/Serv service to the new Fund/Serv service by July 31, 1994, therefore, are being given an additional one-month grace period from the effectiveness of the new fee. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will have an impact on or impose a burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others No written comments have been solicited or received. NSCC will notify the Commission of any written comments received by NSCC. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and subparagraph (e)(2) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19b&hyph;4 in that the proposed rule change establishes or changes a due, fee, or other charge imposed by NSCC. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549.
