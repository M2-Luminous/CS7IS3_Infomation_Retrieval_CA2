This is a proof that the days of the "civilian government" are numbered, declares NODONG SINMUN today. The news analyst says: It has recently been brought to light that the traitor Kim Yong-sam at the time of the "presidential inauguration" last year manipulated the "Ministry of Health and Social Affairs" to buy toothpaste and other goods with the "money donated for helping poor neighbours" and distribute them as "gifts." It was also exposed that officials of the puppet Defence Ministry built the "defence hall" equipped with deluxe amusement facilities with the money squeezed from the people including primary school children allegedly for the sake of "defence" and indulged in luxury. Scandals of the puppet Home Ministry and many other units are reported one after the other. The traitor Kim Yong-sam's advertisement of "clean politics" is being shattered. In fact, the "civilian government" is the hotbed of irregularities, outdistancing the "Fifth and Sixth Republics." This shows the puppets are engaged in irregularities and encouraging them behind the facade of "reforms."
