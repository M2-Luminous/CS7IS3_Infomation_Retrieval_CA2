This budget will nullify the government claim that there is no alternative to the new economic policy which means dependence of foreign debts. This can be called a citizens' budget. Through this citizens' budget, they are trying to raise a national movement against the government's economic policy. All organizations are participating in it. This is a new dimension of the alternative budget. A citizens council is working to find an alternative to the government's economic policies. Prof. Arun Kumar is its organizer. This council has economists, political leaders, social workers, and actors as its members. A preliminary efforts was made by them last year. They had also presented model of an alternative budget. This time, the concept of this alternative budget is becoming a movement. Next month, on 13-14 February, a conference will be held at Gandhi Shanti Pratisthan. The alternative budget will be approved at that time. The new economic policy of the government, meaning of Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, is pressured by all kind of limitations. The dependence on foreign debts is known to all. It has become a common knowledge that the government had written the 1991 budget under pressure from the IMF and the World Bank. Manmohan Singh is the creator of the new economic policy. He was an economic advisor in the Chandra Shekhar government. A report was sent by the World Bank during those days. This report was kept hidden from Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar. It is a secret as to who made that decision. Was the decision made because of World Bank pressure? This new economic policy was born from that report. Because of its dangerous aspects, the citizens council was created in December 1992 and it is still working. Prof. Arun Kumar says that the alternative budget will be able to solidly refute the government claims. The government claims that the path it has taken is the only alternative. He maintains that it is not true. The alternative budget will show that if the nation uses its own resources properly, it will not need to borrow from abroad. The government opposed to it says that foreign debts are necessary and unavoidable. The decision to accept the Dunkel proposal is part of this effort. The alternative budget will show that. The alternative budget points to black money for resource. Arun Kumar says that at least 30 percent of the total economy is in black money, and it is not openly visible. Prof. Surajbhan Gupta had estimated in 1987 that this portion was 47 percent. According to Prof. Surajbhan Gupta, there are over four trillion rupees in black money in our economic system. Prof. Arun Kumar estimates this amount to be 2.5 trillion rupees. If we are successful to bring this portion under a taxation system to the government treasury, it is estimated that the government will earn 1.1 trillion rupees. At present the government earns only 200 billion rupees in direct taxes. The total budget deficit is 370 billion rupees. Even after paying that deficit, the government will save 630 billion rupees. The alternative budget emphasizes bringing the black money into the taxation system. It pushes for expanding the sphere of direct taxes. At present about six to seven million people are covered by direct taxes. If we change the meaning of this government looking after the interests of only three percent of the population, we will be able to understand the philosophy behind the alternative budget. They want to bring those three percent population under the taxation system to protect the interests of the rest of the population. Can strong political desire be changed in support of it? This question is under discussion in this council. A workshop was called in October 1993 to discuss the alternative budget and the fact that our foreign currency deficit is related to the black money was discussed at that time. The foreign currency deficit is about 210 billion rupees. It is important to know that foreign exchange of about 450 billion rupees goes out of the country because of black money. In addition, political leaders, businessmen, and industrialists are sending about 180 billion rupees abroad underreference' plan. According to one estimate, between 1.8 trillion to 6 trillion rupees from our economy are in other countries. The interest on it is about 180 billion rupees which does not come to our country. The truth is that the effort to make an alternative economic policy is a part of the swadeshi movement. More people are joining it now. Representatives of other campaigns are also joining it. The alternative budget will be an exercise. Sub-committees on agriculture, imports-exports, employment, institutional change, industries. taxation policy, and social services are working for preparing the budget.
