Following the vogue for stock exchanges and Eurobonds, the purchase of companies and real estate has become the fashion among foreign investors. Citibank, for example, is investing $1 billion in the privatization of Brazilian state-owned enterprises and in launching a $100-million fund to purchase shares in Brazilian companies. The Chemical Bank has followed suit. It is analyzing Brazilian companies with growth potential. Funds like these are also open to Brazilians, but their financial resources must be huge -- anybody with $5 million at his disposal may consider himself a candidate. This is the reason why investors are companies and capitalists at the top of the tree in the financial world. Garantia, one of the forerunners of this new market in Brazil, is successfully managing an investment fund that has already invested $30 million. The purchase of Artex by Garantia was, in fact, that sort of business deal. The new owners of Artex are the shareholders -- both Brazilians and foreigners -- in Garantia Partners (GP) -- a fund especially established for this business transaction. Claudio Haddad, a Garantia manager, stated that this market deals with companies that do not negotiate shares on the stock exchange and that have some special characteristics. "We also have a special fund for medium-sized companies," he said. Pactual and Icatu Bank have also followed suit. The largest fund is that of Icatu, with assets totalling $100 million. The much-publicized DM-9 advertising agency only exists because of investments by Icatu. Once Nizan Guanaes became a successful, international advertising man, Icatu sold its shares in DM-9 to the owners of the company. This market looks as if it will be the fashion in the financial world this year. JP Morgan recently bought 15 percent of Latasa stocks and 10 percent of Mappin stocks. This is a strategy followed by JP Morgan worldwide -- it buys shares in companies with good possibilities and then sell them at a profit. As Citibank Vice President Jose Monforte explains: "We are beginning a new round [preceding word in English] of company ownership changes. The generalized feeling is that the country will achieve stability, because of time considerations, and resume growth. This situation creates a good opportunity to make money." If everything turns out all right, the value of assets will increase. Monforte believes many companies will be unable to keep up with the new stage of growth due to the lack of capital. "Once they become aware of that, they will inevitably have to start selling," he says, adding that "every foreign investor with whom I talk remarks on this trend." Icatu Bank President Daniel Dantas explains that investment funds may also participate in new endeavors that spring from brilliant ideas -- like what happened in the United States with Apple, one of the great successes in computer science that started in a garage. Dantas notes: "We invested, for example, in Nilton Molina, a former insurance broker. It is a pleasure to see how successful he is. If any businessman, regardless of the size of his business, wishes to talk to us, he need only look for us. Money is no problem." This aggressiveness in the Brazilian market has led the Chemical Bank to bring specialists to Brazil. "Capital flows wherever there are good business opportunities," says Chemical Bank Investment Director Wayne Perkins, adding that "we must enter now, otherwise our competitors will outstrip us."
