However, Beijing's political atmosphere seems like winter during this period. This is particularly true now as this year marks the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident. While being highhanded with the democratic, worker, and student movements as these days approach, the authorities are also showing their special "solicitude" toward "some other people." For example, the authorities recently issued a circular, calling for precautions against national level churches formed by all kinds of religious organizations. The circular also prohibited ties between these churches and their counterparts abroad. Churches Must Not Develop Ties With Foreigners The State Council's Religion Bureau recently held a national conference in Beijing for chiefs of bureaus in charge of religion work. In light of the spirit of the speech made by Jiang Zemin at the National United Front Work Meeting, the conference initially laid down the principle of offering "classified guidance" to different religious groups. The principle for different religious sects is to prevent the establishment of a national religious organization and its ties with foreign organizations. Buddhist and Taoist Organizations May Not Indiscriminately Receive New Members Regarding Buddhism and Taoism, the present task is to support and help Buddhist and Taoist organizations at all levels to strengthen their building, improve the quality of the monks, and exercise proper management over existing monasteries. The circular says: "Measures must be adopted to resolutely check practices of indiscriminate preaching of monastic disciplines and recruiting new members." Statutory procedures should be undergone to build monasteries and no monastery may be built without approval. In places which hold regular religious activities in small rural temples, it is necessary to strengthen management and let them open the temples to disciples after undergoing registration procedures. Guard Against Islamic Interference in State Policies Regarding Islam, it is necessary to guard against its interference in the state's policies. The circular reiterated that they cannot meddle in the state's administrative, judicial, education, and marriage systems and may not restore the abolished feudal privileges and the exploitation system. The "Haiji Monastery," "imam [a hong 7093 6059]," and "jaiz [re yi si 3583 0181 2448]" must not be allowed to resume. Moreover, it is necessary to step up management of the Islamic monasteries, rectify and improve the "ahung [7093 6059]" and "imam day [yi ma ri 0122 3854 2480]" management system. Furthermore, it is necessary to positively and steadily resolve the contradictions and disputes between and within the sects and adopt forceful measures to stop the violent conflicts. Step Up the Handling of Underground Catholic Forces Regarding Catholic work, the stress should be put on reforming the rites and gradually introducing mass in Chinese. It is necessary to further implement the policies on churches and premises and create conditions for normal religious activities. Shortages of bishops and clergymen is an outstanding question. Training should be given to those who are politically competent. If the question cannot be resolved temporarily, the responsible bishop can concurrently take up the job. Efforts should be stepped up in comprehensively handling the underground Catholic forces. Measures should be adopted to promptly dissolve the already established organizations. As regards the organizations which have not yet taken shape, it is necessary to take precautions and not allow them to develop. Moreover, the establishment of a national center for Catholicism will not be allowed. Regarding Christianity, the religious departments should tackle the "thorny issues" together with the Christian organizations at all levels, namely, individuals proclaiming themselves missionaries, the establishment of private meeting places, and the question of minority religious sects. Family Gatherings Not To Be Seen as Private Gatherings He who proclaims himself a missionary, who openly opposes the socialist system and government leadership, who publicize extremism, and who disseminates heretical beliefs shall be punished according to law. Measures should be adopted to check missionary work done by those unqualified to preach or who are not even disciples. As regards the private meeting places set up directly by those who proclaim themselves missionaries or under their influence, and the gathering of some disciples who have separated themselves from the open religious establishments for various reasons and formed their own organizations, they shall be banned if involved in illegal activities. If their activities are normal, they can undergo registration. Some should be guided to participate in religious activities at the registered establishments. The traditional Christian family gathering should not be regarded as a private gathering. Nevertheless, the family gatherings should be replaced by churches and these people should be associated through the registered churches. No National Level Organizations Should Be Established On the question of Christian sects, it is necessary to uphold association, seek common ground while reserving differences, and strengthen unity. Some localities with a large number of sects and disciples may be allowed to set up churches in places where conditions permit. However, no sect will be allowed to resume or establish national or regional organizations; nor will it be allowed to resume or establish ties with the religious organizations abroad. The organizations of the new sects introduced from abroad or established domestically of their own accord will be regarded as illegal organizations in light of relevant Chinese regulations.
