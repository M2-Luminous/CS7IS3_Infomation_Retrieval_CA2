The four officers fled with Visconti to Lima, Peru, following the failed coup attempt on 27 November, 1992. Gen. Visconti Osorio arrived with his four subordinate officers at the Military Court at approximately 1330. The men were transferred from the Lino Clemente Battalion headquarters, where they are being held. Visconti told reporters: I am not interested in commenting on any issues. He was asked: Are you considering returning to the Venezuelan Air Force? That is our greatest hope. Are you sure President Caldera will grant a pardon? We are sure of that. That is part of the peace policy the President and the government are promoting. What are the conditions? The basic condition is for us to face justice and the government will guarantee a pardon. The general was also asked about a rumor that the officers exiled in Peru were given millions of bolivars to return to Venezuela. He responded by shaking his head with a smile of amazement. Why did you flee the country on 27 November? He said flatly: We have already answered that question before. What is your opinion about the arrest warrant issued for former President Carlos Andres Perez? You have studied that in detail and know more about it than I do, as I have just arrived, he answered. You have said you have "great hope" for the country. Our intention is to contribute to finding a definitive solution for all of the soldiers who remain under arrest, following the 4 February and 27 November uprisings. Why were you the last to return? Because I was the highest ranking officer to go to Peru and the process demanded I return last, he explained. "Panorama" asked Visconti if he would accept a position in the Caldera administration, as Commander Arias Cardenas did, once he is pardoned and leaves the Venezuelan Armed Forces. He flatly said: "That we will have to study when the situation requires that type of evaluation." Do you have any political aspirations? There is nothing in that direction at this time, he said. Captain Freddy Rio Pacheco, the presiding judge, reported that once the officers have been formally served with the arrest warrants, Carmen Salinas will temporarily act as their defense attorney. Rios explained that this would be "to assist them in preparing their deposition at the inquiry, read the trial records, and set the dates for the formal inquiry.
