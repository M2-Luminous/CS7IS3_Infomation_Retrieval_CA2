It is necessary to take severe measures to ban the practices of rushing for raw materials at high prices and competing for market share by lowering commodity prices; otherwise, such practices will severely affect the sustained power of our exports. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation has achieved very good results in inviting bids for 10 or more export commodities this year, which helps curb such ill practices. It is necessary to sum up these experiences and spread them as soon as possible. Meanwhile, it is imperative to take effective measures to prevent the loss, especially the nonnoticeable loss, of the property of state-owned foreign trade enterprises. It is necessary to invigorate them through reform and to ensure that state-owned property maintains and increases its value. The key to achieving this goal lies in changing enterprises' management mechanism. He expressed his hope that the banking sector will provide the necessary circulating funds for those foreign trade enterprises with good export earnings and economic performances. The areas with good achievements in carrying out the policy of reform and opening should take active measures to further improve the investment environment, particularly the intangible environment, so as to explore new ways to develop foreign trade and to attract foreign funds. Accompanied by Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of Guangdong Province; Guangdong Provincial Governor Zhu Senlin; and Wu Yi, minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation; and relevant leaders of the State Economic and Trade Commission, Li Lanqing inspected the 75th Guangzhou Trade Fair, the Huangpu customs office, and the Huangpu bonded zone. He heard reports made by responsible comrades of Zhuhai and Zhongshan cities on the work of improving foreign trade and attracting foreign funds. He inspected the new airport in Zhongshan city. In addition, he conducted a comprehensive study of some reform measures to be carried out this year. Li Lanqing said: To build a basic framework for our socialist market economy, the central authorities have come up with many major measures for reforming the systems governing fiscal affairs, taxation, banking operations, modern business operations, investment, foreign trade, and foreign exchange. The performance in the first four months shows that the implementation of these measures has been quite stable. The problems we have encountered today are not caused by reforms but rather are the old system's defects that have been exposed by reforms. To deal with these problems, we must count on deepening reforms and replacing the operating mechanisms, and not by retreating, which has no way out. Leading authorities at all levels must consider how to reinvigorate state-owned enterprises as an important issue and place it high on their agendas. Li Lanqing listened attentively to everybody's ideas for reinvigorating state-owned enterprises, especially state-owned foreign trade enterprises, and he discussed the ideas with them. On special economic zones' future development, Li Lanqing pointed out: After 15 years, special economic zones have undergone major changes from enjoying preferential treatment and flexible measures -- such as paying lower taxes but retaining more profits -- to improving their own operating mechanisms and accumulating more capital for development. In order to remain special, our special economic zones must continue to improve their investment environment, especially the intangibles environment, in accordance with international norms. To attract more investment from large consortia and transnational companies in accordance with China's development strategy and industrial policy, special zones must use foreign capital more efficiently and on more technologically advanced projects. Meanwhile, special economic zones should take the lead in launching pilot reform projects and adopting good foreign experiences useful for China. Li Lanqing was highly interested in educational investment and teachers' pay, especially their housing situation. Passing through a residential housing area in Zhongshan city, he demanded to visit the home of a retired teacher. He was glad to see that because of the government's preferential treatment, the teacher had living quarters in which each member of his family had on average more than 13 square meters of floor space. He fully acknowledged the city's experiences in solving teachers' housing problems. At a meeting with leaders of Jinan University, Li Lanqing stressed that universities should proceed with reforms with the objective of achieving higher academic quality and better educational results. He said that universities should explore a new way to arouse the enthusiasm of all quarters and promote educational cooperation at home and abroad, and universities should make greater efforts to train versatile personnel useful for the development of the market economy -- personnel who are knowledgeable about the economy as well as about industrial technologies. While the government is increasing investment in education, he said, schools must also speed up their reforms. Li Lanqing praised Guangdong for its attention to education in recent years. Li Lanqing also mentioned that smuggling activities must be cracked down on with protracted efforts and on a regular basis, and that bonded zones must do a good job in providing storage service, handling indirect trade, and processing supplied materials according to international norms.
