Bonn is prepared to lift the delivery stop if these weapons are really used in accordance with the NATO rules in Turkey. Cetin's criticism is "not right," government spokesman Vogel stated at a news conference in Bonn today. It is clear that the government is not biased. The Workers Party of Kurdistan has been banned in Germany, and there are efforts to adopt tighter rules concerning the deportation of Kurdish rebels. Vogel quoted Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who stated in an ARD interview that he will not bow to the terror of any group in the streets of Germany.
