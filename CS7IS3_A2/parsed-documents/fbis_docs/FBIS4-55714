The reason for this invitation, according to the PNT-Lambru, is the fact that the Russian politician is "a person who has a thorough knowledge of the true history of Romania." Authorized sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed us a few days ago that it is out of the question that the Russian extremist can receive an entry visa to Romania. We wish to remind our readers that a few months ago the Russian leader sketched a "map of Europe" in which Romania is not included at all as a state.
