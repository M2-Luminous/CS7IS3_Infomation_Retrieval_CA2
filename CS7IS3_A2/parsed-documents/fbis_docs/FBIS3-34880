The Zionist regime is to receive more than $3 billion, while Egypt is to receive $2.116 billion of this amount. Political observers believe that such so-called financial aid is to pursue objectives that are 100-percent political in nature. The six-point criteria of the U.S. State Department, which is in charge of distributing this aid, does not fully justify the method of distribution, and this signals the existence of other covert motives. The allocation of more than $6 billion of this aid to boost the U.S. economy by expanding commercial ties with East European countries and countries of the former Soviet Union shows that the major objective of the United States behind such aid is to expand its foreign markets by creating dependence. Also, the allocation of about $3 billion of this aid to the defense of democracy on the international scene reveals another truth. The use of this aid by Israel, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Palestinian people, as well as by the Egyptian regime, which imprisons or murders dozens of combatant Muslims on charges of fundamentalism, shows what kind of democracy the United States supports. The allocation of $5.225 billion, or in other words, one-fourth of U.S. foreign aid, to Middle East peace reveals how important the success of the current talks on solving the Middle East crisis is for Washington and the White House rulers. Until now, the Zionist regime has successfully played its role of middleman between the West and part of the Third World and has been able to increase the dependence of these countries on the West. Extensive U.S. investment in making the so-called Middle East peace process successful will decrease the regional differences that Israel and the United States are facing and will pave the way for the infiltration of the Zionist regime in the Arab and Islamic world. Even though U.S. plans for extending financial aid are based on political realities and the extent of cooperation among governments, there are other variants that upset these plans. When the Camp David compromise deal was signed, various agreements in the field of political and economic cooperation and especially in the field of tourism, industry, and agriculture were signed. However, the steely determination of the Egyptian people prevented the implementation of most of these agreements. Now the Zionist regime's industrial and agricultural cooperation with Egypt, as well as tourist exchanges between the two countries, are at the zero level. This reality shows how effective the people are in the outcome of decisions.
