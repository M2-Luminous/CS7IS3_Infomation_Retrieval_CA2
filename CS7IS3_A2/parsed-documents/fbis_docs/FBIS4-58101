An agreement was reached, we received something, and I am also absolutely sure that peace, coexistence, and security will be achieved for all the civilians living in the territories. [Segal] What about the agreement between the PLO and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]? [Al-Rajub] There never was, nor will there ever be such an agreement after we enter the territories. We will abide by everything we signed. [Segal] Do you see any possibility for cooperation between Hamas and the PLO? [Al-Rajub] It is not a question of cooperation, but rather of a national interest. I think it is in the national interest of the Palestinian people to convince most of the public to abide by the agreement. [Segal] What about collaborators? [Al-Rajub] Look, as you say in Hebrew, it is necessary to stamp out all traitors. I think that those who shed blood and those who crossed the red line will be tried. We are entitled to put these people on trial. It is inconceivable that a man who opened fire and killed people because he collaborated with the occupation forces will be pardoned. This will never happen. [Segal] What about the others? [Al-Rajub] Look, we will examine every case individually. [Segal] What remains to be solved before the comprehensive agreement is signed on Wednesday? [Al-Rajub] It has been determined that the agreement will be signed on Wednesday, which means that all the other problems will be overcome in the next three days.
