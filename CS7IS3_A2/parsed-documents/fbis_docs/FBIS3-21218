(Toshiba Tungaloy), jointly with Cho-Onpa Kogyo K.K. (Cho-Onpa Kogyo), has developed an instrument for measuring ``high-temperature total dynamic elastic moduli and vertical and horizontal internal wear,'' which is expected to become a powerful, supportive tool for R&D concerning new materials including structural ceramics. This epoch-making ultrasonic device is capable of simultaneously measuring nine material dynamic parameters, including various elastic constants and internal friction, over a temperature range of from room temperature through 1,550�C. With this device, it is now possible to easily and simultaneously determine elastic moduli and internal friction unique to a given material, which had previously been difficult to measure. Thus, materials design should be made easier than before, and useful information can be obtained for clarifying material behavior. Toshiba Tungaloy is scheduled to present a paper on this development at the sixth Fall Symposium of the Japan Ceramics Association, which will start on 6 October 1993. The Toshiba Tungaloy group developed a compact, ultrasonic device capable of dealing with small samples. With this device, the group succeeded in simultaneous determination of nine parameters for structural ceramics, such as _a_-alumina, _b_-alumina and cubic zirconia polycrystal [(Y)TZP], from room temperature through 1,550�C in an argon atmosphere. These parameters were seven, elastic modulus-related parameters (Young's modulus, shear modulus, volume modulus, compressibility, Lame parameter, Poisson ratio and acoustic velocity anisotropic constant) and two parameters of vertical and horizontal internal frictions. The group found that, for _a_-alumina, Young's, shear and volume moduli decreased, while Poisson ratio increased parabolically, as temperature increased. From these results and with a decrease in the acoustic velocity anisotropic constant, the group obtained data for _a_-alumina that hinted the activation of shear mode at high temperatures. The group also obtained data clearly indicating behavior of (Y)TZP from the super-plastic phenomenon and the grain boundary sliding-involving phenomenon, while pursuing parameter changes with increasing temperature. The elastic moduli of a solid, like its dielectric constant, are the fundamental properties unique to the material, and they are extremely important for evaluating the material and designing with the material. Today, not many data on various elastic moduli have been published, and no high-temperature data are available since it has been impossible to determine parameters at a high temperature and to simultaneously determine elastic moduli in horizontal and vertical directions. It has been known that the internal wear can be widely used for studying glass transition, lattice flaws, residual stress, structural state and grain boundary dispersion, and can be useful in determining correlation with various physical properties over an entire temperature range of measurements. However, no discrimination has been made for various physical phenomena occurring within a material due to vertical (elongation) wear and horizontal (shear) wear. No simultaneous measurement of these parameters to 1,550�C has been made either. The development of this new measurement device is expected to significantly spur materials R&D. Toshiba Tungaloy plans to aggressively sell the device to universities and major manufacturers at a price of ¥30 million for the device capable of measuring to 1,550�C and ¥20 million for the one capable of measuring to 800�C.
