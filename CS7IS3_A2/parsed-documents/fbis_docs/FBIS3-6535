FBIS3-6535 "dreas053_a_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-053 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Mar 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan JCP Reports Dead Mouse in Thai Rice OW1803153294 Tokyo KYODO in English 1438 GMT 18 Mar 94 OW1803153294 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- The Japanese Communist Party [JCP] said in a statement Friday [18 March] that an employee at a rice milling factory on the southernmost island of Kyushu found a dead mouse last January in rice that had been imported from Thailand. The JCP statement said that the employee discovered the mouse at a milling factory in Fukuoka Prefecture while he was removing rice from a bag to put it into a flour milling machine. Rather than consulting with the factory management, the employee brought news of the find directly to the local JCP branch office, the statement said. The party's statement was issued to substantiate remarks made in the Diet earlier this month by JCP parliamentarian Yuko Takasaki, who claimed Japanese rice millers have so far found a dead mouse, bird bones and cockroaches in shipments of imported Thai rice. The allegation has had the effect of creating widespread doubt among the general public about the quality and safety of imported rice, particularly that coming from Thailand. Officials of the Food Agency, however, said that no such allegation has yet been confirmed. They said the factory in question has been subject to its inspection aimed at ensuring the quality of imported rice. The Thai Embassy in Tokyo earlier this week expressed concern over the prominently reported allegations. In a letter to a Japanese daily newspaper, the embassy said that each rice shipment is strictly inspected before export to Japan, by both Thai authorities and Japanese experts, and then reinspected upon arrival in Japan.
