The author of the article says: The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year address declared that the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and the DPRK Government would consistently adhere to the foreign policy of independence, peace and friendship to meet the requirements of the present situation. This year, too, the WPK and the DPRK Government will consistently adhere to the foreign policy of independence, peace and friendship. The DPRK is a dignified country that regards independence as its life and soul. To maintain independence is an invariable position and policy of the DPRK. The DPRK deems it the basic principle of its activity to think and judge all things independently, act in accordance with its faith and solve all problems in a self-determined manner. The idea of independence in the foreign policy is based on the chuche idea, the guiding idea of the DPRK. We never allow others to infringe on our sovereignty, interfere in our internal affairs and dominate and control us. We also object to violating other country's sovereignty. We will judge and deal with all problems in the international life with independence as the yardstick and fight on against infringement on independence. To avert war and preserve peace is a very urgent problem to the Korean people. Out of the sense of obligation to preserve peace in our times, we will actively fight to terminate the tension and military confrontation on the Korean peninsula, denuclearize this part of the world, check and foil the acts of aggression and war on the part of the imperialists and reactionaries and safeguard peace in Asia and the world. Our people value friendship with the world's people. On the principle of independence we will make positive efforts to unite and cooperate with the socialist and nonaligned countries and develop good-neighborly and friendly relations with the capitalist countries which respect the sovereignty of our country.
