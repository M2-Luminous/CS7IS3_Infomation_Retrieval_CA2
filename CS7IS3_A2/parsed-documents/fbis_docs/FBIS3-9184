In its appeal, the SNS draws attention to the "difficult situation in which power has been seized by people who brought about destabilization and are trying to preserve this situation under the slogan of democracy and by inciting provocations." It expects a further escalation of the attacks on the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the SNS, and, therefore, it appeals to citizens not to let themselves be provoked into ill-considered actions, the consequence of which might be the introduction of a police regime and a ban on national parties. "Let us hold out together. Today's situation in parliament does not reflect the will of the population. The SNS, in cooperation with the HZDS, avails itself of all political means, with your help and by making use of the referendum as the most democratic means to get rid of power people who were opposed to the independence of the Slovak Republic or who, after losing their lucrative posts, have left the political entities that deserve the credit for the founding of the Slovak Republic and for returning decisionmaking on Slovak causes into Slovak hands."
