BACKGROUND INFORMATION: On March 5, 1986, the Commission issued an affirmative injury determination with respect to investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;263 (Final), Iron Construction Castings from Canada, 51 F.R. 7646 (March 5, 1986), following the U.S. Department of Commerce's final determination that imports of the subject merchandise were being sold at less than fair value (LTFV). 51 FR 2412 (Jan. 16, 1986). The Commission's determination was based on a cumulative assessment of subject imports from Canada with subject imports from Brazil, the People's Republic of China (China), and India, which Commerce also determined were being sold at LTFV. 51 FR 9477 (March 19, 1986). Commerce issued antidumping orders covering subject imports from all four countries. On May 20, 1994, the Commission received a petition, filed pursuant to section 751(b) of the Act, to review its final injury determination with respect to Canada in light of changed circumstances. The petition was filed by counsel on behalf of Associated Foundry, Ltd.; Laperle Foundry Division of Fonderies Bibby-Ste-Croix; Fonderies Bibby-Ste-Croix, Inc.; and Titan Foundry, Ltd._producers of the subject products in Canada. The alleged changed circumstances include: (1) an exclusion of foreign producers from an estimated 60&hyph;75 percent of the U.S. market due to a 1991 extension of Buy America provisions to iron products used in highway construction; (2) an exclusion of foreign producers from an additional 2 percent of the market due to a 1992 extension of Buy America provisions to iron products used in airport and airway construction; and (3) an effective exclusion of foreign producers from an estimated 12 percent of the market for heavy iron castings due to Customs' 1986 enforcement of a 1984 statutory requirement governing the marking of manhole covers with regard to country of origin.
