FR940506-2-00140 FR940506-2-00079 4. The Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will facilitate the ``securitization'' of portfolio loans of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, and the SBL Subsidiary. Securitization of loans held by the SBL and SBIC Subsidiaries will be effected by the sale of the loans to Bando, followed by the sale of the loans to the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary. The Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary then will sell the loans to a ``company'' that is not taxed as a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code, in exchange for cash and securities issued by the company. The directors of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will not be identical to those of Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, or the SLB Subsidiary. This will enable certain securities issued by a company and collateralized by the loans purchased from the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary to obtain an investment grade rating. A majority of the directors of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will be directors of Bando. All loans would be sold on a non-recourse basis and neither Bando nor any of its subsidiaries would guarantee payment of such loans. Applicants' Legal Analysis A. Section 12(d) 1. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act limits the amount of securities a registered investment company may hold of other investment companies. Section 12(e) provides an exemption to the section 12(d)(1) limitations for acquisitions of securities of certain corporations, such as those that furnish capital to industry, provided that, among other things, the aggregate cost of the securities does not exceed 5% of the total assets of the acquiring company at the time of purchase. Subsequent to the Bando's initial acquisition of the outstanding common stock of the SBL Subsidiary, Bando's additional purchases of the SLB Subsidiary's common stock may exceed 5% of Bando's total assets and, therefore, the section 12(e) exemption will no longer be available. 2. In addition, because Bando will hold more than 3% of the outstanding voting stock of the SBL Subsidiary, Bando's loans to the SBL Subsidiary could violate section 12(d)(1) if such loans were considered acquisitions of the SBL Subsidiary's debt securities. Bando's organization of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary and subsequent purchases of the subsidiary's common stock also will violate section 12(d)(1) absent an exemption, and section 12(e) will not be available because the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will not engage in any of the businesses specified in section 12(e). Accordingly, Bando requests an exemption from section 12(d)(1) to permit Bando to (a) make further acquisitions of the common stock of the SBL Subsidiary, (b) acquire notes and other indebtedness of the SBL Subsidiary, and (c) acquire the common stock of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary. B. Section 17(a) 1. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits sales or purchases of securities between registered investment companies and any affiliated person of that company. Bando, the SBL Subsidiary, and the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will be affiliated persons. Since the SBL Subsidiary will be fully owned by Bando, Bando's initial acquisition of the outstanding common stock of the SBL Subsidiary will be exempt under rule 17a&hyph;3 from section 17(a). 2 In addition, applicants assert that investments in the SBL Subsidiary in the form of stock purchases, capital contributions, or loans do not violate section 17(a) because the seller is the issuer and is controlled by Bando. Purchases and sale of portfolio securities between Bando and the SBL Subsidiary, however, appear to be violations of section 17(a). 3 Accordingly, applicants request an exemption from section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit purchases and sales of portfolio securities between Bando and the SBL Subsidiary. 2 Rule 17a&hyph;3 provides in part that transactions solely between a registered investment company and one or more of its ``fully owned subsidiaries'' are exempt from section 17(a). Rule 17a&hyph;3 defines a ``fully owned subsidiary'' as a subsidiary that, among other things, is not indebted to any person other than its parent, the parent's other fully owned subsidiaries, and/or banks or insurance companies in any amount that is material in relation to the particular subsidiary. 3 After the SBL Subsidiary begins operations, it will no longer be considered a ``fully owned subsidiary'' under rule 17a&hyph;3 to the extent that the SBL Subsidiary becomes indebted to parties other than Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary, banks, or insurance companies in any ``material amount.'' 2. Applicants assert that the organization and operation of the Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary does not raise any issues under section 17(a) because it will be able to rely on the rule 17a&hyph;3 exemption.
