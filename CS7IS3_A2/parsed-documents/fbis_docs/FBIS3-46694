Yoshiharu Sato, chairman of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives (Zenchu), told reporters in this northern Japanese city that he expects to submit his resignation to the Tokyo-based organization on Thursday. Sato, 68, has been in hospital for cancer treatment. He did not name a successor but said he hopes the new Zenchu leadership will work out a policy to deal with the opening of the rice market. Sato, who became Zenchu's chief in July 1993, has criticized the government's decision to partially open the rice market as "totally unacceptable" for rice growers. The decision last month by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government marked the end of Japan's half-century ban on rice imports. Tokyo accepted a proposal made by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which calls for Japan to open 4 percent to 8 percent of its domestic rice market as the minimum access for imports, while giving a six-year moratorium for replacing all import restrictions with tariffs.
