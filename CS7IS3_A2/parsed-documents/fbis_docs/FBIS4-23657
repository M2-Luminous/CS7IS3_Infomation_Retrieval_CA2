Well, Fred Eno is a personal assistant to Chief Abiola and was with him when he gave security personnel, who had surrounded his house, the slip. On a mobile phone to Lagos, Mustapha Ibrahim asked Fred Eno how Chief Abiola had made his escape. [Begin recording] [Eno] Well, they (?surrounded) the more obvious entries and exits of his house, but there are several other exits which apparently there was policeman there, so we used it. [sentence as heard] [Ibrahim] Now, what sort of vehicles did you use when you left the house to go to your destination? [Eno] We used one of his cars, a private car. [Ibrahim] Where did the chief go next? [Eno] He went straight to the venue where he made his declaration. [Ibrahim] Where was this venue? Was it in Lagos or somewhere outside Lagos? [Eno] Yes, it was on Lagos Island. It was at the Eleganza Plaza, at the sports center, and this was done at the back [word indistinct] yesterday in the evening. [Ibrahim] Now, at that time of the night how was it possible that there were people at such a lonely place. [Eno] We are used to that. We used to campaign during the whole night during campaigns. We used to campaign at 10, 11, 12 o'clock at night, so I don't think there is a problem getting people there. Chief Abiola is not any other name in Nigeria.... [Ibrahim, interrupting] How was the atmosphere? How many people were there? [Eno] Electric, electric. By the time we got there the place was crowded and by the time word got out to... [pauses] There are markets and other place around there, so everybody in the market abandoned their wares and trooped down to the venue. [Ibrahim] What exactly did he say in his speech.? [Eno] It is an eight-page statement. I cannot release all of it to you right now, but I think he made the pertinent point in which he declared himself the president, considering his victory in the 1993 election and all the other democratic structures, particularly the Senate, which is going to reconvene and then consider his cabinet list, which still remains confidential. [Ibrahim] So after this declaration, he left? [Eno] Oh yes, we didn't stay there. We left.... [Ibrahim, interrupting] And where is he now? [Eno] And went back home, his home. [Ibrahim] You came back to his home, but where is Chief Abiola himself? [Eno] He is having meetings with other colleagues of his at different venues. [Ibrahim] It is being alleged that Chief M.K.O. Abiola is hiding at one of the Western embassies and that he is going to seek recognition from these other countries. [Eno] I will suggest you check that because it is not correct. [Ibrahim] A price has been put on the chief's head. He has been declared wanted by the police, is he not going to give himself up? [Eno] That is an abuse on the Nigerian people. You don't put a prize to somebody they elected to be their president. We have a due process in which he is going to take an oath of office, where he will be sworn in [word indistinct] a declaration accepting the mandate and considering himself the legitimate winner of the elections and the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I don't think there is any controversy in that. [Ibrahim] When is this going to take place? [Eno] When the democratic structures go to ratify the entire process I will give you a program.
