Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal said Iraq was "working to divide the GCC" and was "still a threat to security and stability in the region." He urged the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to "restate the member nations' joint position on Iraq, to block any attempts" to drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Bahrain and Qatar. Observers said Prince al-Faysal, in his opening address to a two-day GCC foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh, was implicitly criticizing Baghdad's links with Oman and Qatar. Oman was the only GCC country to maintain relations with Baghdad after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Qatar has also drawn closer to Iraq in the past few months, arousing deep concern in Kuwait, which was liberated by a US-led multinational coalition in February 1991. In Cairo last weekend, the Omani and Qatari foreign ministers held talks with their Iraqi counterpart Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf on the sidelines of an Arab League ministerial meeting, officials said. Al-Sahhaf described Iraq's relations with Oman, Qatar and Bahrain as "good" at the meeting, they added. The GCC session was also expected to cover the Middle East peace talks, notably the multilateral track in which the Gulf is involved. Qatar and Oman are to host Israeli delegations for meetings of multilateral working groups. Likewise on the agenda was Iran's territorial dispute with the UAE, the official Emirates news agency WAM said. In Cairo, the 22-member Arab League reaffirmed support for the UAE in its dispute with Iran over three strategic islands in the southern Gulf. The UAE has warned it could resort to international arbitration to resolve the dispute with Iran over the islands of Abu Musa, Tunb al-Kubra, and Tunb al-Sughra. Iran insists the problem must be tackled through direct dialogue. The UAE and Iran had strong political and economic links until the dormant dispute flared anew in 1992 following accusations that Tehran had annexed the UAE part of Abu Musa and expelled some of its residents. The GCC defence, political and economic alliance was created in May 1981 during the Iran-Iraq war.
