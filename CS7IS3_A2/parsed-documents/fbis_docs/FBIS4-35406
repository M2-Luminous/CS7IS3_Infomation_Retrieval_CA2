[passage omitted] Dr. al-Iryani added: Yemen's position on this issue is that it regards what is taking place in Yemen as an internal affair and that the Security Council is not entitled [to discuss this]. At the same time, since the move began at the Security Council, we have not said that we categorically reject any resolution issued. We cannot say in advance that we will accept any resolution issued. We adhere to this opinion, and we do not want to have differences with this international institution. However, it is our right to [word indistinct] and to have doubts about the reasons behind raising this issue. We have the right to say that this is the beginning. No one, however, knows what is the end of this new discussion of an internal Yemeni problem. Al-Iryani continued: Thus, the Yemeni leadership decided to send a Presidential Council member and the justice minister to the United Nations to explain Yemen's viewpoint on this internal affair and to stress that the Republic was established on genuine bases according to the international law, that both the declaration of the Republic and even its timing were made in consultation with the United Nations, and that the foreign ministers of the two formerly independent states which merged into one state, the Republic of Yemen, signed all [word indistinct] statements at the United Nations and for the members of the diplomatic corps. [words indistinct] we signed all statements and decisions and [words indistinct] unity on the ground, so he later said: [passage indistinct] once again asserts its [word indistinct] and commitment to the international charters and the UN Charter by legitimate decisions. We cannot at all have difference with the Security Council. However, we have the right to express our viewpoint and not to accept interference in our internal affairs. I reiterate this [words indistinct] and that we have the right to say that interference in our internal affairs is not permitted according to the UN Charter. Brother al-Iryani added: As for the principle of a cease-fire, I assert that we appreciate and respect everyone who demands stopping any war anywhere in the world. However, [word indistinct] any war has conditions and [word indistinct]. The reasons for this war and the intentions of the rebellious side should be known. It is clear that the intention of the rebels was secession. Did [words indistinct] the secessionists to cease fire know in advance that [word indistinct] want secession and at the same time they demanded a halt to fighting? We leave this question for the (?future).
