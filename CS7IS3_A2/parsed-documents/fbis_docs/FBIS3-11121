Foreign Ministry official Omar Morales told PRENSA LATINA that since the beginning, his country was pleased with the idea of creating the AEC because it is considered an important step toward regional and Latin American integration. He underscored that Cuba's main objectives at the meeting that will be held 16-18 March in Kingston will be to work toward integration and to tighten the cultural, scientific, and technological ties of the countries of the region. The Caribbean Basin and Central American countries, as well as the countries of the Group of Three (G-3) -- namely Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico -- should comprise the AEC. Morales added that the largest Antillean island is considered a potential member of the future AEC and that "we are willing and politically determined to take part in all of the regional integration processes." Morales said the Foreign Ministry commends this project, "because we are, above all, members of the Caribbean." Asked about the importance of this zone for Cuba, he replied that the island's current trade with these countries amounts to some $25 million, which he deemed "a significant amount." "This area has a lot to offer us in the tourist sector, and Cuba, as member of the Caribbean Tourism Organization, has signed agreements in this sector." He said the signing of other agreements on the tapping of maritime resources and transportation also confirm the need for a greater Cuban presence in the region. He added that, after the Kingston meeting, the foreign ministers of the member-nations will meet to sign the charter and that the AEC will become a reality with the signatures of the heads of state. "The preparatory work will conclude sooner than later, and everything will be ready to make this project a reality," he underscored. Deputy Foreign Minister Ramon Sanchez-Parodi will head the delegation that will go to Kingston.
