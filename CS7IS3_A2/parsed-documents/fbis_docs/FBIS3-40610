Therefore, it is necessary to be extremely careful. He mentioned a nuclear accident in Russia. He revealed that the electricity produced at the power plant China will help built cost three rupees per unit. The prices of another power plant is lower and it can be built in shorter period. It will produce more electricity and will cost only 50 paise per unit. What the honored minister has said appears to be unbelievable since electricity produced in nuclear plants is considered to be the cheapest in the world. At present the electricity provided for domestic use in Pakistan costs less than one rupee per unit. In the light of this information, how can we believe that the nuclear power plant that our government is purchasing from the Chinese government will produce electricity at three rupees per unit. Who will buy electricity at this rate since there is a lot of anger in the country over the present electricity rates. How will the people react when there will be a 400 percent increase? Who will be able to tolerate the change from 100 rupees to 400 rupees in the electricity bill? The federal social welfare minister said that the electricity plant being built at Hab will produce electricity at 50 paise per unit. If it is true then the question is why should not we built similar electricity generating plants. Why should we buy a power plant which will produce electricity at three rupees per unit and whose safety is also suspect? Dr. Sher Afghan grants that Madam Benazir Bhutto had made the deal for the Chashma nuclear power plant during her previous administration. He also claims that during Mian Nawaz Sharif's government the original deal was changed in such a way that it is a losing deal for Pakistan now. He admits that this amended agreement was approved by a group of Pakistani officials which included some nuclear experts. This strange circumstance shows that China did not warn Pakistan about the harmful aspects of the amended agreement, although China is a kind of friend who would never advise us to go into a losing deal. It appears that Dr. Sher Afghan is trying to create bad feeling about Pakistan's great friend China while Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is there on her visit. Which power is it that our minister is trying to please and does she not want our trusted friendship with China to prosper? Dr. Sher Afghan is the first minister from whom the law portfolio was taken a few days ago and then the present position was given to him. It appears that his political mind does not agree with the PPP government. Suspicions are being expressed that he receives instructions from a specific place, which is especially dear to him. Anyway, the facts that he has revealed about the Chinese nuclear power plant in his interview have created a nuclear scandal. Now the people want to know all the facts. If the Chinese nuclear electricity plant is unsafe and the electricity produced here is going to be very expensive, the prime minister should review this nuclear project during her visit to China. On her return she should explain the details to the nation so that the people know how much truth there is in what one of her ministers has said.
