"In the last 10 years, we have been inward-looking, removing impediments and opening out our economy," Senator Cook told THE AUSTRALIAN yesterday in his first extended interview since taking over the portfolio in January. "The next 10 years is understanding the marketplace we're in, and being flexible enough to adapt to it and take advantage of it." For the first time, Senator Cook spelled out a detailed framework for the industry statement that will be part of the White Paper on employment to be delivered by the prime minister, Mr Keating, on May 4. The statement will have two broad goals: to boost the competitiveness of local industry and to improve access to international markets. Cutting tariffs had largely forced industries trading in world markets to become competitive. In the non-traded goods sector, the important issues were micro-economic reform and competition policy, Senator Cook said. The agreement by the States to expose their business enterprises to more competition, by agreeing to the Hilmer report recommendations, was crucial in spurring micro-economic reform at a State level, he said. The other important way to boost competition was to address the question of access to finance by small and medium-sized companies. "There will always be a fairly clamorous argument between the providers of finance and the seekers of finance," Senator Cook said. While the banks had all said they would do better by lending to small and medium-sized business the system could be improved. While he would not give details it is believed a package of finance measures will be a key part of the industry statement. It is expected to include an education campaign for both lenders and borrowers to overcome the traditional reliance on lending against assets without considering lending against cash flow, as well as improvements to pooled development funds and infrastructure bonds and more relaxed rules for direct bank investment in companies. Changes are also expected to enhance the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank which provides venture finance capital for small business. Senator Cook also foreshadowed improvements to research and development incentives -- now a 150 per cent tax write-off. "There is a case for the Government to investigate how it encourages that investment to come sooner and quicker, in higher technology, in computer-aided manufacture, and to develop the necessary networks in industry in the small to medium-sized companies, to encourage them to embrace that with a bit more confidence," he said. The Government was still considering whether to give incentives to multinational firms to set up regional headquarters in Australia. Senator Cook outlined a two-pronged strategy to boost industry access to foreign markets: improved access to advice from Austrade and on other government schemes and bodies, and a bigger effort, after completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, to reach bilateral trade agreements, especially with Asian countries. It was also important for Australia to encourage both China and Taiwan to join the new World Trade Organization, he said. Senator Cook's strategy builds on the past decade, when industry policy was dominated by former industry minister Mr John Button, whose chief goal was to manage the dismantling of the tariff wall around Australian industry.
