Earlier, until Nikolay Golushko's resignation this week, Stepashin had held the post of FCS first deputy director. Informed sources say that there were also other candidates for the post of new director. But, the sources said, the other aspirants "have opted out." The FCS press service issued a brief statement by the new FCS chief. Among his department's priorities he mentioned work "to expose, prevent, and curb intelligence-subversive activity by foreign special services and organizations, and illegal encroachments on Russia's constitutional system, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and defense capability." Sergey Stepashin is convinced that the Russian president needs "strong and effective special services." According to Mr. Stepashin, there are plans to hold an all-Russian conference of territorial counterintelligence chiefs in March which will consider concrete measures and define optimal forms of FCS activity. In an interview with INTERFAX he said that yesterday's Russian Federation Security Council session, which examined the federal program to fight organized crime in 1994-1995, specified the FCS' tasks in the area of combating corruption, including in the upper echelons of power. Therefore this Russian special service has retained the functions of countering criminals inside the country, which earlier belonged to the ministry, without confining itself only to fighting the external threat.
