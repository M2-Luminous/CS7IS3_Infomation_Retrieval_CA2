In an interview with LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG (Friday edition), Scharping called on the state to act against the activities of the Workers Party of Kurdistan "in a consistent and tough manner." The SPD chairman said: "I would also have any Kurd deported to Turkey who commits act of violence here, threatens other people, and ignores or breaks laws" and who "is threatened neither with torture nor the death penalty in Turkey." However, one thing is impossible, Scharping said, addressing the Federal Government: intending to carry out radical deportations and, at the same time, carelessly accepting the systematic oppression of the Kurds by making arms deliveries or looking the other way.
