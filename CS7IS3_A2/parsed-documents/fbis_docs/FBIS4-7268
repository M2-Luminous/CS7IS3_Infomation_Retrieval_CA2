Sakigake controls 15 members in the 511-seat House of Representatives, while Group Seiun consists of three lower house members who quit Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) in protest at his approach to the ruling coalition's core party Shinseito headed by new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Political sources said more JNP members may leave the party and join the Sakigake-Seiun front.
