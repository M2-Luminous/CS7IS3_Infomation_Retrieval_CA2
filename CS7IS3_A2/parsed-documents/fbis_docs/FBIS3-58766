There are even indications that he may end up in a better position for the presidential election. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators having taken to the streets clamoring for [Education Minister] Bayrou's resignation; a piece of legislation hastily shoved into a closet... The analogy between Alain Devaquet and Francois Bayrou does no go beyond this point. First of all, because the political climate is not the same; because the demonstration on Sunday [16 January], although impressive, remained good-natured; because the Socialist leaders shrewdly downplayed its political significance in order to reap larger benefits; and because -- with the exception of Patrick Devedjian [Rally for the Republic, RPR, MP], who wondered aloud whether Mr. Bayrou might resign from his position as National Education minister -- the majority remained united, whatever it may have to say privately about Mr. Bayrou's method and mistakes. And there was no Malik Oussekine! In any case, Francois Bayrou did not flinch. "He who is prone to being seasick, should not be a sailor," was his rather gallant answer. And he accepted Michel Rocard's proposal to call for a national forum on education, which he prefers to call "assizes," in order to have everyone concerned talk about the future of the educational system. It is clear, however, that in the negotiations that begin at rue de Grenelle [Education Ministry] today, the minister is in a weaker position in front of teachers' unions, which he rather hastily considered to be ruined by their schism. With a view to next week's roundtable at Matignon [prime minister's office], the unions already have been asking for a five-year programming law. Money, always more money... In such a context, Francois Bayrou will be hard put to push forward his pet project: the reform of the single college... Furthermore, there is no definite indication that Edouard Balladur would have given him the go-ahead. One will remember that the Devaquet affair had terminally bogged down the Chirac government's reform machinery, which had previously been going full speed ahead. Comparing Balladur's current policy with Chirac's boils down to comparing a waltz to hard rock. And yet, with the attempted revision of the Falloux Act, Balladur had indulged a little, so as to satisfy both his more conservative electors and the majority leaders who never failed to remind him of this electoral promise. The fact that Edouard Balladur made the final decision to revise the Falloux Act on the very day the GATT agreement was signed is no coincidence. It may be due to a kind of euphoria, as Raymond Barre puts it. One may be assured that the prime minister will not twice let himself be blinded by pride. And that he will even find in his disappointment an additional reason to hold on to his certainty -- repeated over and over -- that in the excessively fragile French society, where passions may flare up at any time, any reform must be slow, explained, and accepted by all. This will inevitably make it more difficult to reform the social security system, a task the government has been getting ready to tackle. After Sunday's demonstration, one may wonder under which shape Balladur -- who no doubt remembers the disastrous impact of the 1987 Seguin reform -- will let it come out. Concurrently, Balladur is taking other, more political risks. His consensus-oriented policy, based on negotiation, expert consultations, and snail-paced reform, will increase the impatience of those who, at the UDF [Union for French Democracy] and the RPR, already charge him with being "Rocardized." In addition, the failed attempt to revise the Falloux Act gives Jacques Chirac new ammunition when he claims, much to Edouard Balladur's irritation, that real change can only take place after the 1995 presidential election. First Ballot A presidential election for which Balladur's mistake has not disqualified him, however -- another major difference with the Devaquet affair. The prime minister, as usual, has made sure he stood on safe ground, even though he did appear on TF1 [TV network] to defend the government position. It is worth noting that the demonstrators were asking for the resignation of Bayrou, not Balladur. The most recent opinion polls indicate that his fight with a newly combative left has increased his influence within the RPR electorate. And according to a Sofres poll to be released today, he would win a presidential election in the first round of voting! This is what a UDF elected representative calls the "Balladur mystery." And this mystery is not about to fade away. Indeed, as Balladur watchers have pointed out, should [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard's chances in the presidential race improve, thanks to the mobilization of the left in favor of anticlerical values, the majority would be constrained to unite behind a single candidate. In other words, an RPR candidate who is not only accepted but happily backed by the UDF: Edouard Balladur. On the other hand, Chirac supporters would rather consider that the rebirth of the left is bound to deflate Balladur's popularity ratings due to his image, which is much more consensual than Chirac's. Provided the current crisis -- which brings back the traditional left-right rift within French society -- does not provide Edouard Balladur with the party leader profile he absolutely needs in order to become a genuine presidential candidate instead of a mere politician with stellar opinion ratings, not unlike [Social Affairs Minister] Simone Veil, for example. Should this happen, the mystery would deepen further still...
