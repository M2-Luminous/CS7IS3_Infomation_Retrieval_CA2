He came without any previous announcement and without an agenda; however, all measures were taken to avoid unscheduled media contact. At 1930 on Saturday, the Serbian Embassy informed the editorial boards of newspapers that there would be a news conference, knowing perfectly well that there would be no one there at that time. On 17 April, a carefully filtered and abbreviated piece of information about the talks with the Bulgarian foreign minister was faxed. As could be expected, after the fraternal embraces with the socialist government in Athens, Jovanovic demanded that the Bulgarian Government insist on a lifting of the sanctions against the FRY -- in other words, demanding that the Bulgarian Government oppose the United Nations. This is something that the great friends of the Belgrade regime, the former Bulgarian Communists, tried to do last week. It was to the credit of Minister Daskalov that he clearly said to the uninvited guest that regardless of the material difficulties related to observing the embargo, Bulgaria will adhere to the UN resolutions, guided by the premise that they are a peaceful, political means. The issue of lifting the sanctions directly depends on finding a lasting and peaceful solution to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. When the Bulgarian side posed the issue of violating the rights of the Bulgarian minority, the Belgrade minister said, as usual, that there are no such violations. Jovanovic did not have any information about Lyuben Stoichkov, a Bulgarian from Bosilegrad who was sentenced by the Serbian authorities for talking to Bulgarian diplomats. Asked why Belgrade is preventing foreign correspondents, including Eli Yurukova, Radio Free Europe, and DEMOKRATSIYA, from doing their job, Jovanovic said that the correspondents present the regime's policy as "satanical." As a true Communist, he described the reporting of the truth about the military activities in Bosnia as an "abuse of journalistic ethics." Everything else the Belgrade diplomat said in Sofia followed propoganda rules. He even utilized the decision of the Bulgarian Parliament to allow the passage of the UN equipment convoy through our country in order to voice the slogan that the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] was not threatened from the north, and that the presence of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] observers there was a result of "false claims and manipulations." A long time must pass before good-neighborly relations are established between Belgrade and Skopje, Jovanovic said. After he decided that his propaganda mission was accomplished, the minister departed yesterday. This time he was guarded like Madonna.
