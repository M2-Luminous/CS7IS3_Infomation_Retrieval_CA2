FR940516-2-00077 FR940516-2-00050 Supporting Statement 1. Need for Information and Legal Requirements Section 3 Reporting Form Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Section 3) mandates that the Department ensure that employment and other economic opportunities generated by its housing and community development assistance programs are, to the greatest extent feasible, directed toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients of government assistance for housing. The Housing and Community Development Act (HCDA) of 1992 requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to submit to the Congress, not later than one year after the date of enactment, a report describing (1) the Secretary's efforts to enforce Section 3; (2) barriers to full implementation of Section 3; (3) the anticipated costs and benefits of full implementation of Section 3; and (4) recommendations for legislative changes to enhance the effectiveness of Section 3. Congressional actions support the need for a data collection instrument to assess Section 3's impact. Responding to a directive in the Conference Report on the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, the Department in FY 1991 issued a report to Congress. This report assessed the impact of HUD-assisted activities on enhancing the employment opportunities for lower income persons and the use of businesses located in the area of assisted projects. Further, the Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, at Section 808(e)(6) requires the Secretary of HUD to report annually to Congress, and make available to the public, data on beneficiaries of HUD-assisted programs pursuant to Section 3. In addition, Section 562 paragraph (a) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 requires HUD to collect data and report annually to Congress on the racial and ethnic characteristics of persons eligible for, assisted by or otherwise benefiting from each community development and housing assistance program administered by HUD. Since the provisions of Section 3 apply to community development and housing assistance programs, Section 562 authorizes the Secretary to collect information determined to be necessary and appropriate in order to complete this report. In spite of these numerous reporting requirements, no data is collected on Section 3 which allows the Department to determine the potential or to evaluate the impact of the statute in meeting its objectives. Congress, as well as the Department's Office of Inspector General, have admonished the Department in failing to systematically implement Section 3. The primary impediment is the absence of a regulation which conforms to the statute and applies to all Section 3 covered assistance. The regulations governing Section 3 at 24 CFR Part 135 have been revised to incorporate the statutory amendments in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992; reflect certain changes in the Department's programs that are subject to the Section 3 regulations; clarify the obligations of individuals and entities subject to the requirements of Section 3; and simplify the Department's administration of Section 3 requirements. The revised regulations include recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The section 3 proposed rule was published on October 8, 1993 for public comment. As a result of comments received, the Department made a number of changes to the rule. Accordingly, the previously approved section 3 reporting form, OMB No. 2529&hyph;0043, was revised to reflect the changes made in the rule. Changes in the rule affecting the recordkeeping and reporting requirements are the establishment of numerical goals to be reported in staff hours for training and employment and numerical goals to be reported in percentages for contracting opportunities. The section 3 reporting form, OMB No. 2529&hyph;0043, requested that data be reported on the number of section 3 residents hired in available positions and the total dollar amount of contracts awarded to section 3 business concerns. Based on revisions to the rule, the data collection will reflect staff hours for new hires and section 3 positions, and a percentage of the total dollar amount of contracts awarded to section 3 business concerns. These are elements needed for an effective program performance measurement system as required under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. In addition, we are adding a Complaint Register which will be used to file section 3 complaints for your approval. Although the regulations implementing section 3, since 1973 have provided for HUD processing of allegations of non-compliance, this is the first request for OMB approval of a formal complaint form for this requirement. The Department is seeking a three year approval of the revised section 3 reporting form, OMB No. 2529&hyph;0043; and the section 3 complaint form.
