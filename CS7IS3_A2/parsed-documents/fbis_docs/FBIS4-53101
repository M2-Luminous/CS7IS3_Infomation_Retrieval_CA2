Saito told a press conference that Tokyo considers it too soon to include Russia in all discussions at G-7 summits because Japan does not yet have a peace treaty with Russia and because Russia still does not have the same status as other G-7 nations despite its reform efforts. Other G-7 nations also share the same view, Saito said. Saito said, however, the "sherpa" or personal representatives of G-7 leaders, are currently discussing ways to hold dialogue with Russia during the G-7 summit talks. The prevailing view in the sherpa meeting is that it is necessary to include Russia, at least partially, in discussions on political topics to which Russia has some connections, such as the problems in the former Yugoslavia, Middle East and Eastern Europe, Saito said. But the sherpas are negative on including Russia in discussions on economic matters because although Russia is making reform efforts, it is still a recipient of economic and financial aid, he said.
