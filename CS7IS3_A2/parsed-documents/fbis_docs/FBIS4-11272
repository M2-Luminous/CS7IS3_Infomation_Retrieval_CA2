At the conclusion of the conference, Castro met with all the guests at the Palace of the Revolution. He did not participate in any of the three days of meetings between the Cuban Government and 225 representatives of the moderate exile community. The conference closed last night. Officials of the Batista government, former combatants of the thwarted Bay of Pigs invasion (1961), fierce anti-Castro activists of other eras, and people with less active backgrounds filed by the Cuban leader, who greeted them one by one. "The rumor that he was seriously ill is a lie because it would have been impossible for him to be on his feet for more than one hour greeting everyone," Lazaro Farinas told EFE. Farinas was a member of an armed group that in the early years of the 1960's struggled against the revolution. "It is true he is an elderly person, he carries his age, but I found him alert and receptive. I do not know whether he is ill, but I saw him calm and relaxed, very normal," Farinas added. Juan Manuel Rodriguez, a former captain of the revolutionary army who left Cuba in 1960 and today is a prosperous businessman in Costa Rica, said that "if someone says he is dead, I have spoken with a dead man, and in addition, he asked me about financial moves that might help the country." Castro embraced Luis Ortega, a journalist who left Cuba 41 years ago, and then confessed to him that he had a little flu. Juan Manuel Martinez, who was spokesman of the Batista government and fled the island on 1 January 1959, the day of victory for the Revolution, was surprised by "Fidel's great memory." Martinez said Castro recognized him immediately, that he had faithfully followed the development of the conference, and that they both agreed that "they must jointly travel a long stretch until the goal is reached." Max Lesnik, one of the founders of the Cuban Change [Cambio Cubano] organization led by former revolutionary combatant and former political prisoner Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, said that "for his years, it did not seem to me he had negative symptoms." Lesnik also said that with this reception all the guests -- not a single one was absent -- Fidel "endorsed the results of the conference." Those results were the formal promise that these contacts will continue -- although there is as of yet no date for the next meeting -- and the possibility that most of the Cubans residing abroad will be able to return whenever they want. They were also encouraged to invest in the country under the same conditions as other foreign businessmen, in other words, in partnership with Cuban state capital, something that, for the time being, rules out small businesses for them or their relatives. This was apparently an objective of a good number of the participants at the meeting. Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina also said that a department will be created in the Foreign Ministry to deal with the emigrants' problems and he indicated that the Cuban Government has communicated to the U.S. Government its desire to open a consulate in Miami.
