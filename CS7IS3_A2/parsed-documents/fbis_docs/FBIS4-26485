The China Association for the Promotion of International Technological and Economic Cooperation in Northeast Asia, with members from the central government and provincial governments, prominent academic institutions and major companies, is poised to play a big role in mobilizing the countries and regions in Northeast Asia to form closer links in developing the regional economy. "Though the countries and regions in northeast Asia differ widely in terms of economic development, the region, with rich labor and natural resources and a strong industrial foundation, has the greatest growth potential and brightest prospects for cooperation," said Ma Hong, honorary president of the association, who heads the Development Research Center of the State Council. According to him, all countries in this region had expressed strong desires to promote international cooperation within the region. The association has already established contacts with some domestic and overseas economic and technological organizations, social groups and investment groups and begun to explore ways of cooperation with them. Some enterprise groups in Asia, America and Europe have even invited the association to launch joint ventures overseas. "The expanded exchanges and cooperation will probably lead to the establishment of an international economic cooperation organization in Northeast Asia in the future," said an association official. A specialists' committee will soon be set up within the association to study key issues related to regional cooperation and provide policy consultations for relevant departments of the State Council. The association also plans to hold a large international academic symposium and trade fair in April or may next year, the official said.
