A Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] official said: "Biddings are held fairly. The results merely reflect who are the competitive bidders." On the other hand, there are views that the results can bring considerably favorable effects on the whole course of the deadlocked Japan-U.S. framework talks because the governmental procurement biddings issue has been symbolic of frictions between Japan and the United States. In 1990, the Japanese Government instituted the procurement procedures based on the principle of competitive bidding. A Ministry of International Trade and Industry official insisted: "Our procurement system treats Japanese and foreign bidders completely without discrimination. Therefore, there is no problem." Commenting on the results, a MOFA official said: "The fact is simple. Competitive bidders have won the bids." Concerning the report that U.S. Cray Research Inc. is dissatisfied with the results, a MOFA official said: "The reason Cray won fewer computers than it had expected is not because there were problems in the procedures but because Cray lacked competitiveness." Meanwhile, another official criticized Cray's action, saying: "It is unfair to resort to political actions."
