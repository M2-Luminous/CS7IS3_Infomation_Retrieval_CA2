The population of central Bosnia is most at risk following delivery of only 28 percent of its food needs in December, added the UN food relief organisation, which is based here. Airdrops of food will be more than trebled to 3,600 tonnes a month to prevent a threatened spring shortage caused by the fact that only 65 percent of needed supplies are in place, the WFP said. Throughout Bosnia, only half the available food aid reaches its final destination, the WFP added. Between 20 percent and 30 percent of children in the Moslem enclave of Maglaj, central Bosnia, are suffering from malnutrition, because of a Serb blockade of humanitarian relief, it said. Three quarters of the food aid required was parachuted in during November and December, but it was unknown how much actually reached the population, the WFP said.
