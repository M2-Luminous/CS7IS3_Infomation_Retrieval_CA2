FR941213-0-00008 FR941213-0-00003 Speed Control Is Speeding a Problem of National Concern? NHTSA and FHWA tentatively concluded in the NPRM that speeding is a problem of national concern, based on a number of considerations. The agencies explained in the NPRM that speeding is defined as not only exceeding the posted speed limit, but also driving too fast for conditions. While the agencies recognized that reliable data on travel speeds are relatively limited and often difficult to compare, NHTSA and FHWA tentatively concluded in the NPRM, based on the most reliable data available, that the travel speeds of motorists have increased in recent years. The NPRM explained that NHTSA studies suggest that most drivers recognize that speeding is a violation of the law, but few regard the violation as a serious offense. This led the agency to conclude that the public does not view speeding per se as an immediate safety risk. However, as NHTSA and FHWA pointed out in the NPRM, speeding is one of the most prevalent reported factors associated with crashes, and studies identify correlations between speeding and other factors often associated with crashes, including alcohol involvement, young drivers, male drivers, motorcyclists and nighttime driving. The agencies reported in the NPRM that speeding is cited as a contributing factor in approximately 11 percent of all police-reported crashes and in approximately 34 percent of all fatal crashes (NHTSA, Fatal Accident Reporting System, 1991). The agencies estimated that in 1991, 13,909 fatalities and 77,000 moderate to critical injuries occurred in speed-related crashes, resulting in an economic cost for all speed-related crashes (including all injury levels) of over $19 billion. As explained in the NPRM, excessive speed contributes to motor vehicle crashes in a number of ways. Drivers have less time to react when travelling at higher speeds since speed increases the distance a vehicle travels during the time it takes for a driver to react to a perceived danger; speed increases the total stopping distance necessary to halt a vehicle; and speed reduces a driver's ability to steer safely around curves on highways or objects in the roadway. Speed variance, the difference in speed among vehicles in the traffic stream, also contributes to motor vehicle crashes. As speed variance increases, vehicles come close to each other more frequently, which leads to more frequent lane changes and passing maneuvers as the faster drivers seek to avoid slower-moving vehicles. Research studies have shown that motor vehicle crashes are more likely where speed variance is greater, and data have shown that a speed variance of 20 mph from the average speed can result in a crash risk 11 times greater than those travelling at the average speed. Finally, increased speeds result in reduced margins for error and increased severity for those vehicles involved in crashes. As the speed of a car increases from 20 mph to 80 mph, a factor of four, the energy of the impact delivered in a collision with a fixed object goes up by a factor of sixteen, increasing dramatically the chance of death or serious injury. Citing a recent FHWA study entitled Assessment of Current Speed Zoning Criteria, the NPRM indicated that: (1) On average, seven out of ten motorists exceeded posted limits; (2) average speeds ran approximately two to six mph above posted limits; and (3) prevailing 85th percentile speeds ran approximately eight to twelve mph above posted limits. One commenter, the West Virginia Division of Highways, questioned the agencies' tentative conclusion that speeding is a problem of national concern. The State asserted that the agencies' comparison between the 85th percentile speed and the speed limit indicates a problem with speed zones (which, according to West Virginia, are set through public pressure rather than by engineering principles), not with speeding. West Virginia further suggested that, as drivers have gained additional experience driving faster than 55 (following the speed limit's being raised to 65 on certain rural Interstates), ``it is to be anticipated that speeds would gradually increase.'' The agencies accept West Virginia's explanation that, as drivers gain additional experience driving faster, their speeds tend to increase. We disagree, however, that this supports a conclusion that the difference between the 85th percentile speed and the speed limit indicates a problem with speed zones, not with speeding. In fact, if West Virginia's explanation is correct, the agencies believe that, if speed limits were increased to match the 85th percentile, speeds are likely to gradually increase even further, as drivers adjust to the higher speed limits. All other comments received in response to the NPRM supported the agencies' conclusion that speeding is a problem of national concern. New Mexico, for example, reported that it continues to suffer among the highest rates of motor vehicle deaths in the nation, and some 25% of their crash fatalities involve excessive speed. Michigan reported that in 1991 excessive speed accounted for 43% of the total crashes, 44% of fatal crashes, 52% of injury crashes and 41% of property damage crashes in that State. Alaska commented that traveling at unsafe speeds is the leading cause of the State's motor vehicle crashes and is a contributing factor in 27% of its fatal crashes. North Carolina stated that in 1992 speed was noted as a contributing factor in 32% of all crashes and 39.8% of fatal crashes. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) provided data supporting the agencies' conclusion that travel speeds are increasing. In addition, IIHS stated that fatalities have increased along with travel speeds. According to IIHS:
