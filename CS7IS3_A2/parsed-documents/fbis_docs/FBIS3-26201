Beijing's repeated references to recovering Hong Kong ahead of schedule make the "run-up" even more unpredictable.... One sign drawing special attention is that the entire city of Beijing has been "mobilized spiritually," and public opinion has been prepared for "the elimination of the proxies of the British colonialists." Friends in Beijing's political circles told this writer that they also have noticed the CPC's tune in the campaign to criticize Chris Patten -- exaggerating the matter and raising the Hong Kong issue to the higher plane of "safeguarding the motherland." According to their analysis, the CPC top leadership "has ulterior motives" in this move, for the British have never said that they will hold on to Hong Kong after 1 July 1997; moreover, what worries the Beijing authorities most does not seem to be Hong Kong's economy (they believe that with the backing of the huge mainland market, Hong Kong's role as a "window" will not be weakened; on the contrary, Hong Kong will become more prosperous than before), but the ways to "rule over" the 6 million Hong Kong people. They believe that under Hong Kong's present situation -- wherein democrats, who Beijing considers "anti-China" elements who are attempting to turn Hong Kong into chaos, still enjoy the popular support of the public -- Hong Kong may "get out of control" after 1997. Friends in Beijing said jokingly: Everything would be OK if democrats in Hong Kong enjoyed as little credibility as the members of the Preliminary Working Committee [PWC]! Jiang Zemin Stresses the Need To "Eliminate the Influence of British Colonialism" We can get an inkling of the matter from Jiang Zemin's recent speech on the Hong Kong issue. In the speech he delivered at a Political Bureau meeting at the beginning of this month [January], Jiang Zemin stressed the following points: National sovereignty is above all else, and Hong Kong's sustained stability and development is the foundation. Alongside the changes in Hong Kong's political situation, the central authorities, based on the aforementioned line and policies, will draw up resolute decisions and measures to safeguard national sovereignty, eliminate the evil legacy of British colonialism and the pernicious influence of the proxies of British colonialists, and put into practice the PRC's policy of "one country, two systems." Does the "elimination of the evil legacy of British colonialism and the pernicious influence of the proxies of British colonialists" mean that a campaign of political "disinfection" will be carried out in Hong Kong after 1997? On 10 January, the key points of Jiang Zemin's speech were relayed to the ministries, commissions, and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, as well as to the party committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. Qian Qichen Again Clarifies the Chinese Side's Bottom Line The speech by Qian Qichen, who is in charge of Hong Kong affairs, also was relayed to the ministries, commissions, and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, as well as to the party committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. In his speech, he made a thoroughgoing analysis of Hong Kong's present situation, and emphatically pointed out the British authorities "plot." His speech is divided into the following three parts: 1. Britain has changed its China policy; 2. Britain's purpose in deliberately sabotaging the Joint Declaration and the agreements already reached between the two countries; 3. The initiative is always in China's hands. Qian Qichen stressed in his speech that Sino-British relations will turn for the worse as a result of Britain's plotted moves to sabotage the Joint Declaration and to openly deny any agreements already reached between the two countries. This is an inevitable result of Britain's China policy, which is formulated after the U.S. China policy, and Sino-British relations will be unlikely to return to normal in the coming three years or even for a considerable period to come. China will not take the initiative to improve its ties with Britain. It has never begged Britain for compromises, it does not currently beg, nor will it do so in the future. This is the policy of the Chinese Government toward Britain. Scaring People by Predicting the Emergence of "Chaotic Phenomena" in Hong Kong Qian Qichen then switched to another subject: "The further Britain and the British Hong Kong Government slide down the wrong road of violating and sabotaging the Joint Declaration and the agreements already reached between the two countries, and of denouncing the Basic Law, which is purely China's internal affair, the easier it will be for us to find a fundamental solution to the matter. Both the initiative and the timing are in our hands. In order to prolong its rule in Hong Kong, the British authorities have brought up in a planned way a number of pro-British, pro-U.S., and anti-China ultra right forces to contend with the government of the future special administrative region [SAR], and to turn Hong Kong into a political city in which foreign countries will scramble for spheres of influence. In order to safeguard the national sovereignty and dignity of the Chinese people, in addition to making political, propaganda, and economic preparations, we also will follow the development of the situation with close interest and prepare to pay certain costs as long as we can deter Britain from succeeding with its plot." All this serves to show clearly the Beijing authorities' state of mind, that is, the Beijing authorities wish for Hong Kong to run into chaos so they can adopt "antiriot" measures with perfect justice and eliminate all democratic figures who now enjoy public support. If this is the case, even though they are flying in the face of the people's will, they can cover the truth with the signboard of "safeguarding national sovereignty and dignity." Qian Qichen also scared people by claiming that political turmoil will take place in Hong Kong during the transitional period and after China's recovery on 1 July 1994. British colonialism and U.S. hegemonism undoubtedly will support the anti-China ultra right forces in Hong Kong in stirring up trouble and fanning the flames of disorder under all kinds of pretenses with the aim of opposing the central government and terminating colonial rule, the Basic Law, the PLA garrison, and the PWC, which has been set up with the approval of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The central government, however, is entirely capable of taking the situation into its own hands and of coping with the sabotage of pro-British, pro-U.S., and anti-China ultra right forces. Anti-China ultra rightists who throw in their lot with foreign forces with the intention of stirring up trouble are only a tiny minority in Hong Kong. Deliberately Strangling Hong Kong's Democrats This writer once reported in the 1993 December Issue of CHENG MING that the CPC had already drawn up a blacklist of Hong Kong people, and without any legal trial have determined their nature as "anti-China ultra rightists with the intention of stirring up disorder in Hong Kong" by using the same standards as those used for "counter-revolutionaries" on the mainland. The fact that Qian Qichen foresaw a disordered and chaotic Hong Kong, and that he placed all the blame on Hong Kong's democrats, who China considers "thorns in its flesh," obviously shows that China intends to spare none of these democrats when the time comes. People cannot help asking: Now that Beijing believes that "anti-China ultra rightists who intend to stir up disorder in Hong Kong" are only a tiny minority in Hong Kong, why take these people so seriously, make so many threats in a such a flustered and exasperated manner, and stress the issue over and over again? How can the PRC, as large and great as it is, be perplexed by "this tiny minority" of people? The Ultimate Target of the CPC Is To Counter the Hong Kong People As a matter of fact, by acting against democrats in Hong Kong, the CPC ultimately aims at countering the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong people. Having lived in a free and well-informed society for such a long time, the Hong Kong people have developed their own political views and moral standards. The 4 June incident, which took place in Beijing in 1989, as well as the CPC's encirclement and suppression of democrats in Hong Kong will not shake their fixed beliefs easily. A recent public opinion poll has showed that the Hong Kong United Democrats, who are considered enemies by the CPC, still are the most popular political party in Hong Kong. By comparison, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, a pro-China base camp, ranks last on the list. Another public opinion poll also has showed that most Hong Kong people share the Hong Kong governor's view that PWC members lack credibility and cannot represent the interests of any group. Under such circumstances, the greatest difficulty facing the CPC in its recovery of Hong Kong is how to bring about a U-turn in the ideology of the Hong Kong people and make them recognize the outlook of value practiced in their socialist motherland. "We Have the Ability To Recover Hong Kong in a Single Night" There have been many conjectures concerning the CPC's recovery of Hong Kong ahead of schedule. People generally believe that Beijing will not take such a reckless action. Qian Qichen gave a clear-cut answer on this issue: "The Chinese Government has studied this issue carefully and has made a decision, that is, if the British side wishes to return Hong Kong to us tomorrow, we will tell them: Alright, on the same night. However, we are not going to give them a receipt." It also was revealed in Qian Qichen's relayed report that the relevant sides have made sufficient preparations: Once drastic changes or turmoil take place in Hong Kong, the PLA basically is able to bring the situation under control within four hours. A Military Maneuver Aiming at Quelling Turbulence in Hong Kong I do not believe the following is a fabricated story: According to a source from the Guangzhou Military Region, on 2 January, crack troops from the 12th Regiment, the 25th Division of a group army garrisoning Guangdong's Conghua Prefecture and the special mobile forces of the 7th Regiment under the Guangdong Provincial District carried out a joint military maneuver code-named "Success 240," a contingency exercise aiming at stamping out any political turmoil or political incidents stirred up by Britain during Hong Kong's transitional period. With the airborne support of a helicopter regiment under an air unit of the ground force, the entire maneuver took only 200 minutes to complete. It turns out that Qian Qichen's boast that "turbulence in Hong Kong can be put down" within four hours (240 minutes) is based on this latest military exercise. What particularly should be mentioned is that the "240" in the codename of the maneuver refers to the maneuver's predetermined length of 240 minutes. Yet, the exercise went so smoothly that it came to a successful end in only 200 minutes. Many senior-ranking officials showed up and watched the "Success 240" military maneuver, among whom were Lei Mingqiu, deputy political commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region and commander of a group army, as well as officials from the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. The Guangzhou Military Region held a summarization meeting on the second day following the conclusion of the maneuver. At the meeting, Xie Fei, member of the CPC Political Bureau, read out a message of congratulations from the State Council on this "tremendously successful military exercise." It affords food for thought that the congratulatory message was sent by the State Council, not by the CPC Central Military Commission. Does this mean that the CPC's arrangements for using military means to recover Hong Kong also are in the run-up?
