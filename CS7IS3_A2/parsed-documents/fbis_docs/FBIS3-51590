Petrella stressed the system "of verification and transparency" signed by the three countries, and added that the opposite would have been "submitting Argentina to a system of separation and isolation that would have led it to lose the train of development in the nuclear area." In remarks to a radio station, Petrella said the document ratifying the Tlatelolco Treaty by Argentina was submitted today in Mexico City by Foreign Policy Under Secretary Rogelio Pfirter. However, so far Brazil has not ratified the treaty, although it had agreed with Argentina and Chile to simultaneously submit the documents. "What happened was a little lack of synchronization, but Brazil will ratify the treaty, possibly in the course of the first quarter of this year," Petrella said. The vice foreign minister denied that the Tlatelolco Treaty's ratification would reduce Argentine sovereignty in nuclear matters "because it is just a matter of preserving the country's current capacity, attained very well in the past." "In this manner some situations will be whitewashed and we will be in a position to have access to technology that the National Atomic Energy Commission and the entire Argentine nuclear industry need," he said. Petrella said: "Ukraine, which is a nuclear power, wants to stop being one, the same as the Czech Republic, and North Korea, a country with which the international community is negotiating." "I would say that most countries will be members not only of the common agreements but of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as well, which Argentina hopes to join this year, as conveyed by the president," he said. Petrella also stressed the "distrust" that existed among Argentina, Brazil, and Chile concerning the nuclear issue, "partly created by the origin of the Treaty for the Provision of Nuclear Weapons that has marked a sort of discrimination between those that could be nuclear powers and those that could not." "Those countries that conducted a nuclear explosion before 1967 could become members, while all other nations, some of which had tremendous industrial development, were left out," he said. In that order he said: "That sort of discrimination has generated a distrust in countries that, in this manner, could not have access to technology that would allow them to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes." "This has demonstrated that the treaty was baseless because countries such as ours have broadly developed that technology without violating, by self-control, what the treaty prohibited," he said.
