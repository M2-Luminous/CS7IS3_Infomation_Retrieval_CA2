A source in the 20th Jehadi Division of Baghlan Province reported to Bakhtar Information Agency that Shir Khan Bandar-Kabul supply route has been repaired and was opened to traffic through (Kotel-e Murgh). Esteemed Ahmad Shah Masud; and Esteemed Abdul Hay Haqjo, commander of the 20th Jehadi Division of Baghlan Province, accompanied by the high ranking representatives of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, watched the process of arrival of the supply convoy and transport vehicles which arrived from Shir Khan Bandar to Kabul and travelled from Kabul to Shir Khan Bandar via (Kotel-e Murgh). Sayed Abdul Motaleb, official in charge of the repair and construction of this road said that the repair and construction of this road began two months ago with the cooperation of the government officials and the Muslim people of Andarab and (Neharin) districts and was completed recently. It is now opened to traffic with this first supply convoy to pass through. A correspondent of Bakhtar Information Agency adds that the oppositions of the Islamic State of Afghanistan who are the enemies of our land and Muslim people, were using the economic blockade of Kabul city as a strong propaganda tool. The opening of the road between Kabul and Shir Khan Bandar, which connects Afghanistan with Tajikistan, in Central Asia, is a considerable victory for the Islamic State of Afghanistan in removing the economic blockade imposed by the oppositions of our country against our Muslim nation and is another obvious defeat for the opposition. Once more supply convoys arrive to Kabul the price of food will come down and the economic problems of our country will become relatively less.
