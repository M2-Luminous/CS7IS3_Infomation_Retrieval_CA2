The men were friends whom he had known a long time. These men told him there was a job in Honduras for which someone was willing to pay $80,000. The work consisted of setting fire to a paint plant without leaving any trace so the plant owners could collect the insurance money. On 7 March, the three men went to Honduras, where they contacted the person who allegedly had made the proposal. The person was a Honduran citizen named Luis Hernandez Sosa, approximately 38 years old. The men checked into a Tegucigalpa hotel. The next day they went to a store, owned by an man of Arab descent, whom the two men presented as the person interested in having the work done. Later, they told this Nicaraguan citizen that another meeting would be held on Wednesday. At that meeting, the Honduran men told the Nicaraguan that the job was not exactly to burn down a paint plant but to kidnap a Honduran citizen who had approximately 20 million lempiras in his safe. Later, the Nicaraguan and Hondurans went to another place, a nightclub. The Hondurans reportedly used a small amount of cocaine. During the talks, they said that the work was not to kidnap this Honduran businessman but something else, a job that paid $400,000: It was to assassinate Honduran President Reina. We contacted the Honduran Embassy on the same day we learned of this plan. On 14 March, Honduran authorities sent a special delegate to Nicaragua in accordance with a letter that Colonel Alvaro Antonio Romero Salgado, chief of the presidential staff, addressed to Government Minister Mendieta. This special delegate met with the Nicaraguan citizen who gave us the information at this ministry. The Nicaraguan citizen was asked whether he was willing to travel to Tegucigalpa and identify the places where they had been and the people he had mentioned in his statements. He agreed. They left on 15 March for Honduras. Honduran authorities thanked us for the information. We believe it to be our duty to reveal this sensitive information to a government and people with whom we have excellent relations. Honduran authorities today told us that, according to the preliminary investigation in Honduras, a group, probably linked to auto theft and most likely to drug trafficking, had been active in this connection. According to Col. Romero, the investigations have been unable to establish whether there was really a plot against President Reina. The investigations continue. I want to reiterate that the investigations are being conducted by Honduran authorities in Honduras. We are willing to cooperate with the Honduran authorities in any way we can to fully resolve this case. I hereby reiterate our pledge to exchange this type of information and any other information of international or national interest with all countries; particularly in terms of the plot to assassinate the president of Honduras. The Honduran authorities told us that they revealed this information today because it was leaked by certain news media, but the investigation has not concluded. [passage omitted]
