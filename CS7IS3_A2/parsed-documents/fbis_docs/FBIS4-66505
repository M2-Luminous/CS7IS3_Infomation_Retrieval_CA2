Murderous bullets snatch husbands, sons, brothers, or fathers from them in the daily violence. In Algeria today, as in Kabul, Afghanistan, women cannot properly celebrate their day because dozens of their sisters are being raped and killed by terrorists. The list of victims is a long one, and the story of their tragedies is terrifying. Since the criminal attack that took the life of Mrs. Bougtache and her husband, a police captain, in Algiers' Notre Dame de l'Afrique district on 17 November 1992, the list of women being killed every day by murderous bullets has been growing steadily longer. On 1 April of last year, in the very center of the main thoroughfare in Belouizdad, a 30-year-old dressmaker named Zahia was kidnapped from her home by a group of armed individuals. Some time thereafter, her kidnappers let her go after having subjected her to the worst humiliations. Six days later, terrorists struck violently in Eucalyptus. A girl employed in the company benefit office at the DGSN [Directorate General of National Security] was killed in front of her home. Named Karima Belhadj, she was only 17 years old. She had been engaged for over a year and was planning to be married within a few months. On 18 May of the same year, this time in Bouira in the Maala region, an armed group consisting of about 10 individuals broke into the home of an imam. Unable to find the person they were looking for, the terrorists collectively raped the imam's wife. Despite the trauma, the woman told her husband about the horror she had just experienced. He immediately lodged a complaint. At 0200 on 7 July 1993, a group of armed individuals broke down the door of a house located in the village of Benkhellil in Boufarik that belonged to Saheb Oubelaid and his wife Rachida. After killing the husband, the criminals pursued his wife Rachida, who had fled with her three small daughters through the emergency exit in an attempt to get help from the neighbors, and shot her several times in the head in front of her children. A month later, this time in the locality of El Attaf (Ain Defla Governorate), the terrorists killed Mrs. Haddad Oum El Kheir, a 39-year-old fortune-teller. The victim was five months pregnant. On 12 August, another woman, 50-year-old businesswoman Allel Aouicha, was killed by an armed group inside her home in the locality of Ouled Slama in Blida Governorate. Also recalled is the horror experienced by the family of police officer Zermani Redouane in Haouch Gros in the Boufarik region last 13 July. A group of about 20 terrorists armed with Kalashnikovs and dressed in combat uniforms came looking for the police officer. They turned heavy fire on the members of his family, killing the mother immediately and seriously wounding the two sisters, aged 24 and 20 years. In the locality of Mendaz near Relizane on 5 December, two sisters, B. Fadela and B. Fatma, were kidnapped from their home in front of family members by a group of armed individuals. They were released a few days later after being raped and undergoing the worst cruelty. Ten days later in Kherrouba in Boumerdes Governorate, an elderly clairvoyant--60 years of age--was mistreated and raped before having her throat slit by armed terrorists. In Meftah and Larbaa, two cleaning women--Meloufi Aicha, 40, and Mansour Yamna, 36--were killed at point-blank range by terrorists using sawed-off shotguns. On 25 December, the mother of a police officer was beaten to death by terrorists. She was about 50 years old. On the 28th of that same month, another woman, 40-year-old Ikhlef Fadela, had her throat slit in Bouira. This year, the terrorists are increasing their ferocity and stepping up their murders of women. Last 5 January, for example, the sister of a police officer was kidnapped from her home in front of family members by a group of armed men in the locality of Ain Lahdjar, Ain Temouchent Governorate. She was released a few days later after being mistreated and raped. Four days later, Mrs. Bouchelaghem Aicha, 47, the mother of nine children, had her throat slit by individuals in Sidi Moussa (Blida). On the 23d of the same month, Mrs. Diroueche Mimouna, a 28-year-old mother of five children, was decapitated in front of her family at her home in Frenda, Tiaret Governorate. On the same day, this time at the Bouziane estate in Douaouda, Tipaza Governorate, a group of terrorists set fire to the home of Mrs. Maameri Fatma, the mother of four children. On 4 February, 80-year-old Garmit Kheira was killed by bullets to the head after refusing to turn over her savings to 10 or so armed individuals who had broken into her house at night. In Bourouba on the 17th of that same month, terrorists used shotguns to kill a mother, 50-year-old H. Cherifa, and her 25-year-old daughter. In Sidi Bel Abbes the next day, Mrs. Boudjar Keltoum, 94, had her throat slit by 10 terrorists. Twenty-four hours later in that same governorate, a girl named T. Naima was kidnapped and then released after being mistreated and raped. On the 21st of the same month, when a police officer they wanted to kill could not be found at home, three armed terrorists raped his sister in the terrified presence of her father at his home in Senia (Oran). Three days later, the 72-year-old mother of the DEC [expansion not given] in Bordj Emir Khaled had her throat slit. In Medea the next day, another woman, 73-year-old Lounis Safia, met the same fate. And in Sidi Bel Abbes that day, two sisters, G.M. and G.Z., aged 15 and 12 years, respectively, were kidnapped and raped before being released in the Tighalimet Forest. In Algiers two days later, the principal of a CEM [College of Intermediate Studies], Mrs. Meziane Zhor, 54, the mother of three children, was killed by three bullets fired by terrorists in her office. In Gue de Constantine that same day, the wife of customs official Hami Boubakr was killed along with her husband inside their vehicle a few meters from their home. Bengana Katia, a 17-year-old lycee student, died when she was shot by a terrorist in Meftah, Blida Governorate. On 3 March, an old lady, 69-year-old Hadjou Samia, had her throat slit in Tlemcen, while in Blida, Mrs. Bernarbia nee Tebeni Barkahoum, 44, was killed by a group of criminals who intercepted her while she was driving home in her vehicle. Foreign women are not spared, either. Last 5 December, Mrs. Ayadi Larissa, a Russian national aged 55 years, was also shot to death in Diar El Afia in Algiers. On the 18th of that same month, a Frenchwoman married to an Algerian, Meme Afri, was killed a few dozen meters from the French Consulate in Algiers, where she worked.
