Niksdorf, parliament secretary of SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA: "At a Session of the Zhogorku Kenesh of the Kyrgyz Republic the Government Was Confirmed. Two Vacancies Remain"] [Text] The main event of the session's work yesterday turned out to be the confirmation of the composition of the Government. But this came at the end of yesterday's session. And beginning in the morning the usual lawmaking work took place. After the war, when the soccer players of the Moscow "Dynamo" team completed a triumphal tour of Great Britain, the operetta "The Eleven Unknown", the libretto for which was created on the basis of motifs from this trip, enjoyed great success. I was reminded of the already forgotten operetta yesterday morning when the speaker, M. Sherimkulov, remarked jokingly that all the same the list of the "unknown" 11 parliamentarians, who do not want to receive their hard-earned "deputy allowances," should be made public. Yes, however strange, but there turned out to be people in the Zhogorku Kenesh, who voted against raising the salary of deputies. That question was not on the agenda, but here the parliamentarians turned out to be insistent and yesterday began precisely with it. Now the people's deputies, by way of compensation for expenses connected with deputy activity, will receive a sum in the amount of l.5 times the minimum wage every month. It was proposed to carry out the recalculation beginning of December 1993. However, here, too, the deputies insisted that they be paid "on the new plan" retroactive to June. In general, decrees with a retroactive date are not adopted, but here a vitally important problem was discerned. The speaker put the question to a vote. The indicator board illuminated the numbers: 265--"for", 11--"against", 1--abstained. It was precisely then that M. Sherimkulov permitted himself the joking remark. Not without reason do they say: Charity begins at home. Not for a single proposal did our deputies vote so unanimously as for this. And then, when they continued the discussion of a draft law on the election of deputies, interest in voting fell among many--somewhere between 230 and 235 deputies took part in it. Perhaps not all should be paid at 1.5 times the wage, but only the most active ones? But then we get the obvious egalitarianism, which is quite in the spirit of the laws of the time of stagnation. Meanwhile some orators have complained that many of their colleagues almost do not appear at evening sessions. Precisely for this reason it is impossible to adopt a number of important decisions. Now I understood why the deputies put the question of their own wages in first place on Friday. Yesterday the deputies, of course, impatiently awaited the question of the composition of the Government. But, first of all, they included on the agenda another question--about its structure. Why, as is well known, a new broom sweeps in a new way, and Premier A. Dzhumagulov, speaking on behalf of the President, told about the innovations. The most important ones: The Ministry of Economics and Finance [Minekonomfinans] is being divided once again into the Ministry of Finance and the State Committee for Economics. The Ministry of Finance will now include the tax and customs inspectorates, as well as the State Agency for Securities. This will make it possible to concentrate monetary policy in the same hands and to improve matters with budget fund receipts. The State Committee for Economics will be engaged in analysis and forecasting, moreover not only long-term, but also short-term. Its functions will also include tasks of the structural reorganization of the economy, as well as problems of prices and anti-monopoly policy. Speaking about today's Ministry of Economics and Finance, the prime minister remarked bitterly: "We lost in it essentially the second half--economics." The government, A. Dzhumagulov continued, must provide enormous support to small and medium-sized business and attract entrepreneurs to the priority programs. It is necessary also to bring together into one tight knot the questions of the production and sale of products. For this reason, the new structure combines into one two present-day ministries--industry, as well as trade and material resources. The Ministry of Power Engineering is being abolished, and the oil, coal, and gas industries will be included in a single Ministry of Industry. A Ministry of Agriculture and Food is being created. Its new tasks are evident already from the very name. The main thing is not only to increase agricultural crops and to develop animal husbandry, but also to put products on the table for people. A number of government organizations are increasing their status. The State Agency for Statistics, as in the good old times, will be the State Committee for Statistics, but will operate already in a new way. The State Inspectorate for Architecture and Technical Control of Construction has also been transformed into the State Committee [for Architecture and Technical Control of Construction] and will carry out coordination work in the sphere of construction, as well as a unified town-planning policy. The State Committee for Defense Affairs has been transformed into the Ministry of Defense. Some departments, inluding the aviation department, are being brought into the Ministry of Transportation. Those are the main changes. As the prime minister said, in the near future 16-20 percent of the administrative personnel will have to be cut. Then the prime minister answered numerous questions from the deputies. They came forward also with a proposal concerning the structure of the Government. However, through the electronic voting procedure the President's proposals were approved. During the declared hour-long intermission of the plenary session, the permanent commissions of the parliament discussed the proposed candidates for members of the government. But the intermission dragged out for another hour. Only at 18:10 did A. Dzhumagulov step up to the rostrum, who one by one gave the names of the members of the Government, and the people's deputies expressed their attitude to the proposed candidates through their vote. The following were approved by the Parliament: A. MATUBRAIMOV -- first vice-premier of the Government. O. IBRAIMOV -- vice-premier. Dzh. AMANBAYEV -- vice-premier. A. IORDAN -- vice-premier and minister of industry, material resources and trade. E. OMURALIYEV -- vice-premier and chairman of the State Property Fund. Ya. FISHER -- vice-premier, chairman of the State Commission for Emergency Situations and Civil Defense. Confirmed as ministers: finance -- K. SHAKIROV; internal affairs -- A. SUTALINOV; transportation -- S. ABLESOV; education -- A. KAKEYEV; water management -- M. ZULPUYEV; health care -- N. KASIYEV; communications --E. BEKTENOV; labor and social questions -- Z. KHAKIMOV; justice -- M. CHOLPONBAYEV; defense -- M. SUBANOV; culture -- Ch. BAZARBAYEV. Confirmed as chairmen of state committees: for economics -- A. MURALIYEV; architecture and construction -- I. KADYRBEKOV; geology --Sh. TEKENOV; national security -- A. BAKAYEV; environmental protection -- I. MURATALIN; training of skilled workers and entrepreneurs -- I. KASENDEYEV; physical culture and sport --K. OSMONALIYEV; science and new technology -- K. ZHUMALIYEV; tourism - A. MOISEYEV; statistics --Dzh. AKINEYEV. E. Karabayev, who was proposed for the post of ministers of foreign affairs, did not get the necessary number of votes. The permanent commission of the parliament also did not agree with the candidacy of B. TALGARBEKOV for the post of minister of agriculture and food, and the speaker did not start the call for a vote "in order not to traumatize the individual." It seems, he acted, as always, wisely -- to act in the heat of the moment is not worth it, and tomorrow it may be possible to come to a general agreement. A. Sharshenaliyev was confirmed as procurator general of the Kyrgyz Republic. In closing the session, M. Sherimkulov emphasized that the parliament will work amicably with the new membership of the Government. One may be so bold as to say, he declared, that no black cat will cross our path. Today the session is continuing its work.
