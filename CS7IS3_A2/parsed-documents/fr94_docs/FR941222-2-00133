Eligible Applicants Any public or private nonprofit organization or agency is eligible to apply for a grant. Grants are awarded only to those organizations or agencies which are determined to demonstrate the capability of providing the proposed services and meet the statutory requirements. Care Programs Under this announcement, funds are available for local care demonstrations only and not for multi-site national projects. The project site must be identified in the application rather than selected after the grant is awarded. Under the statute the purpose of care programs is to establish innovative, comprehensive, and integrated approaches to the delivery of care services for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents under 19 years of age at program entry, with primary emphasis on unmarried adolescents who are 17 years old or younger and for their families. This includes young fathers and their families. The OAPP encourages the submission of care applications which propose to do the following: (1) Add care services to supplement existing adolescent health services in school, hospital or other community settings, (2) provide care services to minority or other disadvantaged populations, (3) continue services to clients after the delivery of the baby to enable them to acquire good parenting skills and to ensure that their children are developing normally physically, intellectually and emotionally, (4) stress self-sufficiency skills, such as school completion (in mainstream or alternative schools and GED programs) and/or job training preparation and placement, and (5) involve males and promote male responsibility. Applicants should base their approaches upon an assessment of existing programs and, where appropriate, upon efforts to establish better coordination, integration and linkages among such existing programs. Applicants for care projects are required to provide, either directly or by referral, the following 10 core services: (1) Pregnancy testing and maternity counseling; (2) Adoption counseling and referral services which present adoption as an option for pregnant adolescents, including referral to licensed adoption agencies in the community if the eligible grant recipient is not a licensed adoption agency;
