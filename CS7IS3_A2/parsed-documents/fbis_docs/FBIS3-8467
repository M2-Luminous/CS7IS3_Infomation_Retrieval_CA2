They discussed peace initiatives, the engagement of the Russian troops in Bosnia, territorial divisions, and the Washington Muslim-Croatian agreement. During separate meetings with Andrey Kozyrev and Vitaliy Churkin, Silajdzic also raised the issue of establishing diplomatic relations of the government in Sarajevo with the Kremlin. Judging from the statements that the protagonists of today's talks gave to journalists, nothing has happened that would give a new, more decisive impetus to the resolution of the Bosnian crisis. This especially refers to the meeting of Haris Silajdzic and Andrey Kozyrev, whose talks seemed to have been primarily of a courtesy nature. What will influence the current peace process happened behind the doors of Moscow's Savoy Hotel, where Silajdzic and Yeltsin's special envoy for former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin held direct talks. It is only natural that talks behind closed doors are more frank; however, the public is told considerably less than could be said. Before Silajdzic's arrival in Moscow, there was much speculation about important messages that Radovan Karadzic would like to convey to the Bosnian prime minister via a Russian intermediary. Unfortunately, nothing can be said about their contents. The Kremlin today also learned first hand of Croatia's views. Immediately after Silajdzic, the head of Croatian diplomacy Mate Granic entered one of the elite negotiating buildings of the Russian Foreign Ministry. He would not disclose the reasons for his hasty arrival in Moscow either, but it is hard to believe that the reason could be a mere routine exchange of opinions. In any case, the results of today's Moscow talks will become more certain when Russian and U.S. diplomatic heads Kozyrev and Christopher meet in Vladivostok next Monday. It is no longer a secret that Washington and Moscow will shape (?importantly) the final agreement to end the Bosnian crisis. This has been Vlasimir Mijovic, permanent OSLOBODJENJE correspondent from Moscow, reporting specially for Bosnia-Herzegovina Television.
