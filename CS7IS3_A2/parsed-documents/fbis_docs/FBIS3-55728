He said the factions have decided not to disclose the preliminary agreements on this issue, but did not deny that the Communist Party would not claim the speaker's post as "it does not consider itself to be a small faction". The leaders of the four biggest factions agreed that the post of the speaker should be occupied by the representative of "a neutral small faction" while all the big factions will get the posts of deputy speakers, according to a statement made by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party. But on January 7 leaders of the Russia's Choice bloc abandoned the talks on the question. Zerkaltsev regards this decision of the Russia's Choice bloc as "surprising". Until recently the bloc "though not accepting the candidates still agreed with the conception of choosing the speaker", he pointed out. He believes that the chairman of the State Duma will be elected on the second day of the session. Otherwise the process will become endless, Zerkaltsev stressed.
