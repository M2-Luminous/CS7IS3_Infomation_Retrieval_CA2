In a communique, he noted that he has yet to receive a firm notification concerning the place and date of the meeting. He insisted that written communication between the EZLN and the peace commissioner is the only valid source of notification, adding that, because of the importance of the meeting, it is imperative to maintain a single source of notification. In this way, he was denying reports that the dialogue would take place on Saturday [5 February]. Here is a report from Jaime Guerrero: [Begin recording] [Guerrero] Chiapas and its images of war have been viewed around the world, and nobody wants this to happen again. Reports indicate the peace process in the country's poorest state is clearly advancing toward reconciliation. On Thursday, Camacho Solis left Los Pinos Presidential Residence after meeting with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari for 90 minutes. Although the two sides have yet to sit down at the bargaining table, Camacho has been in contact with the Zapatists for a month. He told reporters that he believes the EZLN has assumed a responsible attitude. [Camacho] This is why we have been able to advance in the peace process. I also want to say -- indeed, I think this is an important point -- that I found a responsible attitude on the part of the EZLN. With each and every message, we have received a corresponding response. [Guerrero] When asked about the interventionist attitude of U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli and his virtual impact on the negotiations, Camacho replied: [Camacho] This is a matter we, the Mexican people, are going to resolve. That is the position of the EZLN and the government. This is the position of all political forces. [Guerrero] And so, the process continues. Camacho Solis said there have been private communications on several points, including the one dealing with General Absalom Castellanos. The peace commissioner told the press that until now he has not made a statement that has not been in line with the facts. He showed an optimistic outlook, but he warned there is still a risk that the talks with the EZLN will reach an impasse -- a situation that would bring about negative consequences. [end recording]
