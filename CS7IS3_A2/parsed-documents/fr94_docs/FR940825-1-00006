FR940825-1-00006 FR940825-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR Part 1960 [Docket No. F&hyph;01] Request by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for an Alternate Standard for Emergency Egress in Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs) AGENCY: Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Department of Labor. ACTION: Proposed rule; Request for Comments. SUMMARY: The FAA has requested approval from OSHA for an alternate standard regulating emergency egress in Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs). In this notice. OSHA has published the proposed alternate standard for public review and comments. DATES: The last date for interested persons to submit comments is September 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments are to be sent to the Docket Office, Docket No. F&hyph;01, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N2625, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20210. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. John Plummer, OSHA, U.S. Department of Labor, Director, Office of Federal Agency Programs, Room N3112, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210; Telephone: (202) 219&hyph;8151. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 19 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (the Act) contains provisions to assure safe and healthful working conditions for Federal employees. Under that section, it is the responsibility of the head of each Federal agency to establish and maintain an effective and comprehensive occupational safety and health program which is consistent with the standards promulgated under section 6 of the Act. The Secretary of Labor (the Secretary), under section 19, is to report to the President certain evaluations and recommendations with respect to the programs of the various agencies, and the duties which section 24 of the Act imposes on the Secretary of Labor necessarily extend to the collection, compilation, and analysis of the occupational safety and health statistics from the Federal Government. Executive Order 12196, Occupational Safety and Health Programs for Federal Employees, issued February 26, 1980, prescribes additional responsibilities for the heads of agencies, the Secretary, and the General Services Administrator. Among other duties, the Secretary is required to issue basic program element in accordance with which the heads of agencies shall operate their safety and health programs. These basic program elements are set forth in 29 CFR Part 1960. Although agency heads are required to comply with all standards issued under section 6 of the Act and to operate a program in accordance with the basic program elements, those elements contain numerous provisions which, by their terms, permit agency heads the flexibility necessary to implement their programs in a manner consistent with their respective missions, sizes, and organization. Thus, an agency head, after consultation with agency employees or their representatives and with appropriate safety and health committees may request the Secretary to consider approval of an alternate standard. Pursuant to 29 CFR 1960.17, when requesting an alternate standard the agency head must do the following: (a) Any request by the head of the agency for an alternate standard shall be transmitted to the Secretary. (b) Any such request for an alternate standard shall not be approved by the Secretary unless it provides equivalent or greater protection for affected employees. Any such request shall include: (1) A statement of why the agency cannot comply with the OSHA standard or wants to adopt an alternate standard; (2) A description of the alternate standard; (3) An explanation of how the alternate standard provides equivalent or greater protection for the affected employees; (4) A description of interim protective measures afforded employees until a decision is rendered by the Secretary of Labor; and (5) A summary of written comments, if any, from interested employees, employee representative, and occupational safety and health committees. This Notice is a request for comment on the proposed alternate standard submitted to OSHA by the FAA. This action is intended to assist the Secretary in assuring that ample opportunity has been given to allow affected employees, employee representatives and interested parties, such as occupational safety and health committees, to comment on the effectiveness of the proposed alternate standard and on its equivalence to appropriate OSHA standards. The Secretary also believes that review of this alternate standard by the scientific community and those National Committees responsible for developing comparable standards is essential so that workers in ATCTs are free from the hazards posed by inappropriate means of egress. Alternate Standard The FAA provided materials in support of the proposed alternate standard to 29 CFR 1910.36 (b)(8). FAA's request was based on the following: •A number of specifications established in the existing alternate standard for ATCTs require types of construction beyond those mandated in OSHA regulations or in life safety and building codes. •A licensed fire protection engineer has provided several alternate protection measures for ATCTs which were not included in the existing alternate standard. •The existing alternate standard does not address important operational ATCT requirements (e.g., 360 degrees field of vision at the cab level) or their relationship with protective structural or procedural features. Additionally, FAA describes the alternate as follows:
