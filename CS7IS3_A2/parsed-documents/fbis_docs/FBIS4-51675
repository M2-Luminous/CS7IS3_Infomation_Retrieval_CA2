Yamagishi called it "regrettable" that the new coalition failed to maintain the framework as it existed under former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. He said that Rengo, which had cooperated with the Hosokawa cabinet, would point out rights and wrongs as it sees them in assessing the policies of the Hata cabinet. Rengo is Japan's largest federation of trade unions.
