Vladimir Grinev, a quite youthful doctor of science from Kharkov, took third place among the six candidates. Recalling the contest, Vladimir Borisovich says: "At the time I was only trying my strength. Today I am feeling more resolute." To judge by the mounting authority of the "New Ukraine" movement he heads, in the opinion of sociologists he has quite good chances of becoming head of state. Especially as he has coordinated his actions with the no less popular candidate Leonid Kuchma. They will go to the new presidential elections together. Nonetheless Grinev believes that at the present stage for Ukraine the election of a new president is not the main issue. Beginning radical reforms without delay is far more urgent. Because for the young independent state which has come under the pressure of economic and political collapse delay is like death. [Grinev] I believe that Ukraine has fallen into a quagmire because of an abominable domestic and foreign policy, he says. Having won independence through suffering, its president and Supreme Soviet decided to set off on their journey with the old administrative-edict baggage. And without making any moves in the direction of reform. And a state with an enormous domestic potential in industry and agriculture ran aground. The attempt to retain all-embracing state control over the economy naturally ended in catastrophe. Successes are no better in foreign policy. Ukraine is so integrated with the East that in the next few decades it will be unable to exist without it. But politicians see a threat to its sovereignty from Russia. But the threat in fact does not come from Russia, as the national-radicals are trying to persuade us, but from spurning rapprochement with our Eastern neighbor. Without Russia and the CIS countries, without economic alliance with them, it is impossible to improve the prosperity of a people driven into deep poverty. From my viewpoint, we must immediate eliminate border barriers which impede the movement of citizens, goods, and capital. Ukraine is most interested in this. And of course we are perturbed by RUKH leaders' statements that the thwarting of the ratification of the treaty on economic alliance is a victory for the democratic forces. The president, instead of adopting a firm stance on such a decisive issue, has resorted to his favorite method -- maneuvering and playing word games with himself. Meanwhile we have contrived to lag very considerably behind Russia. I view economic alliance with it primarily as a prerequisite for joint movement along the path of reforms. [Sverdlov] So the present authorities cannot amend anything? [Grinev] Naturally. The question today is this: Can the present authorities bring Ukraine to the repeat elections without cataclysms and in general will we live to see the repeat elections? I can reply in the affirmative. [Sverdlov] If you are elected president what first three edicts will you issue? [Grinev] The first will be on the land market, the second on the capital market, the third on the real estate market. It is naive to believe that without putting these levers into operation we can, for instance, stabilize the financial system. [Sverdlov] As deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet you suggested to parliament your own economic program for Ukraine's resurrection. But it was not supported.... [Grinev] There is nothing surprising in that. The parliament tried to do in the old way what cannot be resolved under the new conditions. But, you see, I mounted the rostrum with the demand that the economy be reformed through the market. It is a good thing I was not hissed off the platform. I realized then that I could not deal with that Supreme Soviet and I resigned. Today there are at least five or six fine programs for stabilizing the economy. And they have all been shelved merely because there is no one to implement them. Neither the president nor the parliament relies on a single political force. [Sverdlov] You are running with Leonid Kuchma in the election campaign. Are you not afraid? After all, it was under Leonid Kuchma that Ukraine's economy started to crack at the seams. [Grinev] To be precise the seams had cracked under the former premier. Incidentally, Kuchma's popularity rating is increasing. He is a man who only tells the truth and who, counter to politicians of a nationalist bent, who have only an anti-Russian syndrome to their name, he is resolutely advocating rapprochement with Russia. And to all appearances the majority of voters are in solidarity with him.
