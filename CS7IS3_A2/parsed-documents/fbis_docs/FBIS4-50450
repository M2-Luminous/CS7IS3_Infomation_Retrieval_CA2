The new restrictions are contained in provisional regulations drafted by the State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC) Commission in coordination with the Bank of China (BOC), according to the China Newsletter published by Price Waterhouse. Although the new regulations had not yet been released, they reportedly contained stiffer procedural requirements regarding the repatriation of foreign exchange earnings by "foreign investment enterprises". "Foreign investment enterprises" are joint ventures between foreign investors and local Chinese. Under the new regulations, there will be an increase in the number of approvals required of foreign investment enterprises that wish to repatriate forex earnings. For example, if, at the application stage, a new foreign investment enterprise did not envisage it would be able to balance its foreign exchange books, it has to seek SAEC approval, according to Price Waterhouse. Without SAEC approval, a foreign investment enterprise may not be granted access to the forex swap centres at a later date, Price Waterhouse said. The new rules would also make it mandatory for foreign investment enterprises with overseas offices to remit any foreign exchange "hard currency" earnings back to China instead of keeping them abroad. However, the foreign investment enterprises would be allowed to keep the remitted foreign exchange earnings in their own accounts, rather than being required to sell their foreign exchange to the Bank of China. Few foreign investment enterprises are expected to be affected by the mandatory remittance requirement, because, while there are currently many foreign joint ventures on the mainland, few of them have existing overseas offices. Also under the new regulations, the State Planning Commission may draw up two lists of businesses: those that are restricted (class A) and those that are promoted (class B) under current policies, Price Waterhouse's newsletter said. Foreign investment enterprises engaged in class A businesses may only be given access to swap centres for a three-year period, during which time they would be required to demonstrate their ability to balance their foreign exchange books. Those engaged in class B businesses, such as power station projects, would be granted SAEC approval to use the swap centres without the additional restrictions imposed on class A enterprises, Price Waterhouse said. There has been a lot of activity in the area of foreign exchange controls by Beijing since the beginning of this year, according to bankers. The SAEC and the BOC have been drafting a number of regulations intended to restrict repatriation of foreign exchange and strengthen remittance requirements. The policies of restrictive trend towards foreign exchange stems from the Chinese government's efforts to cope with its balance of payments difficulties.
