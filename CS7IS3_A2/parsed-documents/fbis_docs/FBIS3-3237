F. K. Hu, a member of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], said the SAR should adhere to Hong Kong's existing system and encourage local citizens to work hard and build "capitalism with Hong Kong characteristics" under the guidance of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the SAR Basic Law. Economically, it is necessary to carry out a laissez-fair trade policy and consolidate the open market economic system to ensure fair and free competition among investors and industrialists, said Hu, chairman of the Hong Kong Ryoden Electric Engineering Co., Ltd. In terms of law, the SAR should uphold the spirit of lofty fair legislation to boost the confidence of investors, and the most important thing in this regard is to protect private properties and human rights, he said. The future Hong Kong should also maintain political and economic stability, adopt a simple taxation system and build infrastructural projects to attract investors, he said. It is imperative to follow the duty-free policy to facilitate free flow of funds and goods, free investors and businessmen of unnecessary worries, and avoid procedures and overheads caused by various control measures such as foreign exchange control, he said. He suggested that the SAR maintain the existing civil service system, build housing whose prices are lined with costs and sell units to low-income residents; and strengthen education, medical care and social security services. Hong Kong and the mainland should expand exchanges, trade and cooperation, he said.
