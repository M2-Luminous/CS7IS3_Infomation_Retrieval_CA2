[Holubchenko] Undoubtedly, the most important thing today is "to stir up production." A whole range of measures must be adopted, which would allow producers to work normally, would stimulate rather than choke them with taxes, and would defend them against the highhandedness of bureaucrats, corruption, and crime. It is necessary to resolve the issue of working capital as well as the indexation of people's banking accounts. The issue of social protection of pensioners is also very acute, since, no matter how surprising it seems to be, pensioners and elderly people, who apparently have already done their job, are the most politically active sector of society, which, in particular, was confirmed by the elections. If normal living conditions were created for them, they would become less politicized, and their place would be filled by more reformist-minded people with the advanced views. People, who currently live as our elderly citizens do, cannot rest. What kind of rest can there be in poverty? To create conditions for a normal life of pensioners, which would allow us to conduct reforms, is also one of parliament's tasks. Relations between bankers and industrialists are another very serious, and probably even a key problem. Industrialists are currently blaming bankers for all sins, and the latter are blaming industrialists. None of them, however, has ever sat at a negotiating table and discussed how to overcome the crisis. I believe that a union of bankers and industrialists holds the link, with the help of which one can pull out the whole chain. Bankers must understand that they will live better only if they are able to financially ensure normal work of industry. Industrialists will then see bankers as not their enemies and oppressors, but as friends and fellow champions. Clearing of payments will then not take three months, and banks will not use this money for credits, but they will want to quickly deliver payments to customers. One must help these two groups reach an understanding, and I believe that the parliament, the National Bank, the Cabinet of Ministers, and perhaps new nonstate industrial-banking unions can play a certain role in this. [Nikolaychuk] As far as I know, you have been one of the first people in Ukraine to suggest that the main reason behind the crisis is the conflict between industrialists and bankers, and that their union will be beneficial for the state. You have built a whole concept around this issue. What is the main point? [Holubchenko] Banks' profits have currently exceeded those of industrial enterprises by three or four times. Additionally, enterprises are being stopped and closed. But where are the banks' profits? Where have they been directed, where are they working, and where have they been invested? Currently, our large industrial enterprises do not trust small commercial banks -- they go only to large ones. But when they need credits they ask small commercial banks, because they cannot obtain them from large ones.... Banks must also understand that when a customer comes to them and deposits money or collateral, they must make all possible efforts to deliver the money to the addressee within two or three days. A customer who has money in an account must have the confidence that, no matter what happens, when he orders a bank to transfer money, it will be done. A bank must work in a way to ensure that it always have these funds, and that a customer can receive a credit on working capital whenever he wants. This is what industrialists currently need. This is not someone's whim, but a current demand. A bank must also be interested in investing money in industry. Of course, a bank must have the confidence that a customer will not leave it, that he will pay the interest rate for a credit received in time (since credit resources are essential), and that it will receive a part of profits for investing its capital in enterprises. This is an entire system that should have the form of an agreement between a bank and an industrialist. For over a year and a half in my work in government, every day I have been hearing from industrialists how bad bankers are, and from bankers -- about bad industrialists. This is not normal. Yet, they all do the same thing. I believe that when bankers understand that their prosperity depends on industry's wellbeing, things will be put in order in our country. [Nikolaychuk] Yet, one can also understand bankers: Given the current level of inflation, long-term credits are unprofitable, and profits are produced only by short-term credits, which, at best, can be used for purchasing ready-made goods for resale, not for developing, or all the more, for launching new production. [Holubchenko] The point is that banks must give up huge profits. They must live very modestly, in order to not let industry die, and to help it overcome the crisis. If industry stops, banks will have no place to obtain money, and nobody will support them. Banks will begin to die following industry, whether we want this or not. Our government must be wise enough to conciliate the two forces and to convince them to work for each other. It must create conditions for friendly work of these two groups, so the search for guilty stops, and productive work begins. This, of course, requires an appropriate training of cadres, qualifications, skills, and talent. At least, I would like to see such a new government -- not a fiscal one, but creating normal relations and conditions for harmonious work. [Nikolaychuk] Based on your theory, however, the government will have to force banks to accept small profits, even if this method of "carrot and stick" comprises much more of the second component.... [Holubchenko] One must not force them! I am convinced that if bankers sit at "a round table" with industrialists and become aware of the state of affairs in industry, one will not have to force them -- they themselves will agree to establish such a union. [Nikolaychuk] Who, in your opinion, can play the leading role on both sides? [Holubchenko] These can be, for example, the Association of Commercial Banks and the Ukrainian Union of Entrepreneurs and Industrialists, led, of course, by the government. [Nikolaychuk] Provided that your theory is implemented, when can we expect positive results? [Holubchenko] The point is that we do not have time for long- term things and distant forecasts. Circumstances and the crisis are advancing so rapidly, that we have, perhaps, a few months to resolve such essential issues as, first of all, the problem of working capital and the payment crisis, which would allow the industry to rebound. By the way, a union of bankers and industrialists can become one of the primary measures aimed at overcoming the payment crisis. The payment crisis is a drag on the path to move forward -- on political resolution to all kinds of relations in Ukraine, on friendship among all parties, on parliament's work, and the people's mood. It does not let us breathe, it does not let us work, and it does not let us look to the future. If one cannot see any perspective, one cannot move forward.
