The precise location of their camp has not yet been decided, added a spokesman for the Defense Ministry. Around 100 Belgian troops are already based in Vitez. They belong to a transport company (comprising 102 men) entrusted with getting humanitarian aid through to the civilian population. This company is part of the Belgian-Netherlands battalion. The troops have dubbed the present operation "Moving Star." The armored infantry company sent from Croatia as reinforcements will participate in monitoring the cease-fire agreement concluded last Wednesday between the Croats and the Muslims, which provides for the deployment of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops along a front line 350-km long. In the area around Vitez, the fighting had involved Muslims and Croats.
