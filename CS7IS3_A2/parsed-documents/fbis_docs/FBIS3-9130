The reporter is Szilveszter Varga. [Varga] One week before the VMDK conference for the reelection of officials, there is a danger of a rift in the organization. This is what the two deputy chairmen, Janos Vekas and Sandor Hodi, have told the Novi Sad paper MAGYAR SZO. According to Vekas, although the internal differences do exist, none of the trends that have emerged within the VMDK have turned against the autonomy demand itself. For this reason, according to Vekas, there is a chance that the dominant idea relating to the justification for the autonomy concept will hold the VMDK together. Sandor Hodi is also saying that even after the 27 March general meeting for the election of officials, the Hungarians in Vojvodina will be left to their own devices. In his opinion, here too the same question in essence will have to be decided as at the Hungarian elections in May -- whether the VMDK should keep to the right, the left, or straight ahead. According to Hodi, a left-wing faction has evolved within the VMDK leadership which is openly striving for the expropriation of power and for a showdown with those who think in a different way. However, an even bigger problem is posed by the fact that [VMDK Chairman] Andras Agoston, at the head of this group, considers that the time has come for an understanding, or even an appeasement, with the powers that be, which could endanger the autonomy endeavors of the Hungarians of Vojvodina, Sandor Hodi asserts in the Novi Sad paper MAGYAR SZO.
