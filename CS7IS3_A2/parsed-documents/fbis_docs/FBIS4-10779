In a secret political negotiation, in which President Itamar Franco himself participated, Cardoso obtained the support of the so-called Rio Grande do Sul group, which is led by Senator Pedro Simon. This group is against the alliance between the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and the PFL [Liberal Front Party]. Cardoso also obtained a promise from ex-President Jose Sarney to support his candidacy as soon as the internal PMDB elections reveal stronger support for ex-Governor Orestes Quercia. Recife Mayor Jarbas Vasconcellos and some PMDB candidates to state governorships will work for Cardoso's candidacy after the PMDB internal elections. [passage omitted]
