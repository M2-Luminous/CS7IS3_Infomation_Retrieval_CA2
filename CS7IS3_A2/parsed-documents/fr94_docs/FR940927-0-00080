FR940927-0-00080 FR940927-0-00011 Description of the Dredging The dredging operation will be taking place 24 hours per day, seven (7) days a week. Excavation of the river bottom will be with a 100 ton bucket dredge mounted on a 120 foot by 45 foot spud barge, MANITOWAC. The MANITOWAC will be tended by M/V JOE KIZZIAH and should always be in position to allow safe passage to either its left or right. Mariners should contact M/V JOE KIZZIAH for passing instructions. Upon request, the MANITOWAC will cease dredging operations and move to allow sufficient distance for the safe passage of commercial traffic. The M/V JOE KIZZIAH, as well as the dredging and drill barges, will display proper day marks, and lighting during night operations. Such night operations will not involve explosives. Description of the Blasting On the average, contractors plan to blast just once a day, occurring sometime after 3:00 p.m., but before dark. No blasting will take place when there is restricted visibility (the contractor must be able to see from bank to bank before blasting). The purpose of the blasting is to form a trench across the subsurface of the Ohio River into which sections of piping will be laid. The drill barge, DRILL BARGE NO. 1, will work in concert with the dredge MANITOWAC drilling into the dredged subsurface of the river and place explosives in the drilled holes as it goes. Drilling will cease each day at 3:00 p.m. at which time contractors will put detonators in place and prepare the area for blasting. Both the dredge and drill barges will be removed to a position well distant from the blasting. Notification of blasting will take place two hours, one hour, forty-five (45) minutes, thirty (30) minutes, fifteen (15) minutes, and immediately prior to blasting. Notification will be via VHF radio channels 13 and 16. After the drill and supply barges have been moved to a safe distance, two boats will be available for the security of the immediate blast area. The boats will be placed up and downriver of the blasting area. These boats will patrol and warn any recreational/commercial vessels traffic of the impending blast. No blasting will be permitted unless all river traffic is removed to a safe location outside of the blasting area. In addition to radio transmissions, contractors will sound warning signals. The warning signal will be a one (1) minute series of long blasts three (3) minutes prior to the blast signal. The blast signal will be a series of short blasts one (1) minute prior to the blast. Immediately following the blast and an inspection of the blast area, an all clear signal will be sounded. The all clear signal will be a prolonged blast, followed by radio notification on VHF channels 13 and 16. Signals will only be sounded by the person responsible for blasting operations. If a vessel not involved with blasting operations is within the safety zone, the contractor will not conduct the detonation until that vessel has cleared the regulated area. The drill barge and blasting equipment will be moved off site to the river bank every night to reduce the obstructive river hazard. The establishment of this safety zone regulation ensures that vessels transiting in the vicinity of the blasting area will maintain a safe distance to eliminate the associated risk. The safety zone also ensures that communication is established between the contractors and vessels transiting the waters within the safety zone. With proper communication between all parties, the contractor is assured of having ample time to comply with a request to move his operation temporarily to allow a vessel to navigate through the zone safely.
