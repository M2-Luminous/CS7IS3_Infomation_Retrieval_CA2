GIO officials made the decision during a Monday [7 March] meeting presided over by GIO Deputy Director-General Charles C. L. Wu. The GIO prohibited the import of Japanese films in 1973, one year after diplomatic ties between the Republic of China [ROC] and Japan were severed. But since 1984, the GIO has allowed limited imports under a quota system. The current quota system will expire on September 30 at which time all import restrictions are expected to be lifted. The elimination of restrictions on imported Japanese films will have a favorable impact on Taiwan's bid for full GATT membership, the GIO noted. Participants at the Monday meeting included representatives from the Foreign Ministry, Education Ministry, Board of Foreign Trade, and movie industry.
