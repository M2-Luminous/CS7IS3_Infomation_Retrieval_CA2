He said they wanted to influence the pope to adopt the opposition's viewpoint and stand. Al-Hariri stressed that the pope's visit will take place as scheduled in spite of all these circumstances. [passage omitted] Al-Hariri told AL-BAYAN that his government is in the process of adopting a plan to review the recent threats against the state. Al-Hariri stressed that this review, which his government started by tackling the situation on the judicial, security, and information levels, stems from the fact that his government will puruse its tasks without a cabinet reshuffle. Al-Hariri said he expects the general atmosphere in the Middle East, particularly in Lebanon to change in light of the satisfaction with the UN Security Council resolution condemning the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.
