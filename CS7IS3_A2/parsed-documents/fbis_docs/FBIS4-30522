Describing the June 23 memorandum of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland as an indictment of their development of nuclear weapons, the news analyst says: The South Korean authorities have long since promoted the development of nuclear weapons, laying stress on the development of reprocessing facilities. The post-irradiation test facility in the Taedok complex is a reprocessing facility under the veil of "test." The facility was completed in 1985 and put into full operation in 1987. With an investment of tens of billions of won, it has been expanded into a large one today. The post-irradiation test facility, closely linked with the multi-purpose research reactor, forms a plutonium production system. Its danger is increasing still further. In South Korea, insufficiently spent nuclear fuel discharged from the heavy water reactor and the multi-purpose research reactor is systematically reprocessed at the post-irradiation test facility to extract plutonium. A total of 50 kg of plutonium has so far been extracted. The South Korean authorities also scheme to import a large quantity of plutonium lawfully. The purpose of the development of a fast heavy water reactor they have promoted is the production and import of a large quantity of plutonium. When their development of a fast heavy water reactor faced strong opposition at home and abroad, they recently chose a remodeled light water reactor as the next-generation reactor. But this was intended to mislead public opinion. Their development of nuclear weapons has got more undisguised these days. The South Korean authorities must immediately give up the nuclear arms development and open to the public the truth of their nuclear arms development and apologize for it, as demanded by the Korean people and the world peaceloving people. If they continue to proceed with nuclear weapons development, they will encounter stronger opposition from the home and foreign public and meet their doom.
