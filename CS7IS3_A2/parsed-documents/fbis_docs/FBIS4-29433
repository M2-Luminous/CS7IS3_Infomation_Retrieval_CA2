According to data released from the Trade, Industry, and Energy Ministry and foreign car importers on 16 June, foreign cars sold in the domestic market in the January-May period numbered 1,059, marking an increase of 44 percent over the 735 cars sold in the same period last year. The number of foreign cars sold was 148 in January, 119 in February, 233 in March, 227 in April, and 332 in May, thus registering a marked increase since March. During the period, 586 U.S. cars were sold, accounting for 55 percent of all the foreign cars sold. This was followed by 249 German cars (24 percent), 139 Swedish cars (13 percent), 63 French cars (6 percent), and 22 Italian and British cars (2 percent). The rate of increase in the importation of cars for the first five months of this year was 15 percent, far lower than the rate of increase in sales in domestic market. This must have resulted from the considerable old stock of last year carried forward to this year. The foreign cars imported for the first five months of this year were 1,286, an increase of 15 percent from the statistics for the same period last year. Of all the foreign cars imported, U.S. made cars were 768, accounting for 60 percent of the total imported cars, an increase of four percent over the same period last year (735 cars).
