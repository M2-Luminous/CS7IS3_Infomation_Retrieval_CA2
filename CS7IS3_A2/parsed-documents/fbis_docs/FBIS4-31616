But while also reporting other clashes, a UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman insisted that the ceasefire had generally held since coming into force Friday [10 June]. The truce signed in Geneva last week was intended to make time for talks on an overall settlement. "Conflict continued to decrease substantially over the past two days indicating continuing compliance with at least the spirit of cessation-of-hostilities agreement," UNPROFOR spokesman Eric Chaperon said. The British UNPROFOR patrol, comprising two Warrior armoured troop carriers, fired back after being targetted by 15-20 mortar shells and several bursts of machine gun fire Sunday evening, Chaperon said. "The Warriors were clearly showing the UN flag, therefore it was a deliberate attack against UNPROFOR," said a UN Protection Force report issued in Kiseljak, northern Bosnia. The incident happened on a Moslem-Serb frontline north of Maglaj, near the village of Halilovici, it said. Chaperon said 30 machine gun bullets hit the armoured vehicle, but there were no casualties. The British UN forces responded by firing 80 7.62 mm shots before withdrawing a short distance. The patrol was targetted again about two hours later by about 20 mortar shells, Chaperon continued. Ten of them landed some 10 metres (yards) of the Warriors. Following the second attack the patrol withdrew to Halilovici, Chaperon said, adding that on both occasions the shots were fired from Serb positions. He added that UNPROFOR commanders on the ground did not request air support from North Atlantic Treaty Organization planes. The British patrol was in a new zone, which could have surprised the Serbs, he added. [passage omitted] In a separate development, a Jordanian UN soldier was injured Sunday in a mine explosion in southern Croatia, a UNPROFOR spokesman said in the Croatia capital Zagreb. The officer lost a foot in the incident, which happened on a road on the front line between Croatian and Krajina Serb forces, the spokesman said, quoted by the HINA news agency. It said the road in question had been cleared and demined by the Jordanian UN battalion in the region during the day.
