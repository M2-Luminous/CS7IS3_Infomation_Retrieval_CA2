The 200,000-word article originally titled "Strengthening the Dominant Role Played by the Central Government in the Change to a Market Economy" was completed last June and drew the immediate attention of the Chinese leadership including the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Poltical Consultative Conference, all of which circulated the full text while major mass media across the world gave it a prominent coverage. The report on the national situation aroused great interest at home and abroad mainly because of its exposure of certain problems facing China including its weakening capabilities. The report suggested that reform did not amount to the releasing of power to lower levels and the getting rid of profit, and opening the country to the outside world did not account for the general practice of preferential policies being given to foreign businessmen. The report also put forward some concrete proposals on the upgrading of national strength and the building up of a stable relationship between the central authorities and local ones and many of these proposals were accepted by the leadership in the country. The proposals called for a continuous increase of financial revenue put at 25 percent for the short term, 30 percent for the middle term and over 35 percent for the long term. The proportion of financial revenue for the central authorities in the overall financial income will reach 50 percent in the short term, 60 percent for the middle term and over 65 percent for the long term. Some important revisions were made to the report before its publication including into its concluding part three prerequisites for the strengthening of the dominant role played by the central government and five items required of the establishment of the market economy system. As China is now undertaking the 16th financial restructuring since 1949, Mr Hu incorporated material regarding the previous 15 financial changes and his comments on them into the appendix of the report. The article also put forward nine main policies to be applied to maintain the relationship between the central authorities and regions because the handling of the relationship between the central government and regions had become a hot issue.
