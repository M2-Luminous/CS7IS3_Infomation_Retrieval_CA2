The Palestinian services' jurisdiction will apply throughout the territories. This constitutes a crucial -- possibly cardinal -- precedent. This sphere of activity is the first in which PLO-Fatah has been granted freedom of action outside the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. The Palestinians will be able to set up preemptive intelligence offices in Nabulus, Tulkarm, Hebron, Ramallah, and other cities in the territories. Since both sides have a vested interest in the matter, an agreement in this spirit was recently attained in the Cairo talks. Although the Palestinians had reneged on a previously achieved agreement on the issue, a new agreement similar to the previous one has now emerged. The Gaza Strip preemptive intelligence, or rather preemptive security (al-amn al-wiqa'i), will be headed by Muhammad Dahlan, member of the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo talks. 'Arafat selected 34-year-old Dahlan, a native Gazan, for this pivotal, powerful, and consequential position because of his extensive connections with local activists. Dahlan, who was deported at the beginning of 1987, had been one of the founders of the Fatah Shabibah [youth movement], and he had organized the mass disturbances which preceded the intifadah. He maintained his connections with Gaza Strip activists throughout the intifadah and while in Tunis. Dahlan had been put in charge of the military activities in the Gaza Strip, and this capacity plus his connections with the locals made him a central and powerful figure close to 'Arafat. Dahlan's appointment to the sensitive position undoubtedly reflects 'Arafat's full confidence in him. The head of the preemptive intelligence in Judaea and Samaria will be Jibril al-Rajub. Al-Rajub, 41, a deportee since 1988, was born in the village of Dura in the Hebron District. As a Fatah activist, he was arrested for terrorist activity and served a prison sentence in Israel. He was released in 1986 in the framework of the "Jibril deal," immediately after which he resumed his Fatah activities, becoming one of Faysal al-Husayni's close aides. Al- Rajub cultivated extensive ties with local activists, as a result of which he became one of the central PLO-Tunis figures and an 'Arafat aide. [passage omitted]
