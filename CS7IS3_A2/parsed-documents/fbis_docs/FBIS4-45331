FBIS4-45331 "jptdd025__l94083" JPRS-TDD-94-025-L JPRS Narcotics 10 May 1994 WEST EUROPE UNITED KINGDOM Committee Reports on Drug Use in Scotland Committee Reports on Drug Use in Scotland 94WD0373A London THE GUARDIAN in English 10 May 94 p 20--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94WD0373A London THE GUARDIAN English CSO [Article by Erlend Clouston: "Scots Drug Abuse `Costs £1bn a Year'"; first paragraph is THE GUARDIAN introduction] [Excerpts] Erlend Clouston reports on a Commons inquiry that suggests a third of Scots in their early twenties could be experimenting with drugs, and talks to an addict about his lifestyle. Drug abuse in Scotland is costing the taxpayer almost £1 billion a year--25 times the official calculation. A report by the all-party Scottish Affairs Committee released yesterday suggests that up to one-third of Scots in their early twenties could be experimenting with various drugs; 20,000 people are thought to be injecting illicit substances--11,000 in Greater Glasgow alone, including almost half the children in one Strathclyde secondary school class. Funding an injected addiction is said to cost a weekly average of £300. The report recommends wider provision of synthetic opiates and an education programme to tackle Scotland's growing drug crisis. The committee estimates that, taking into account theft, interdiction, prisons and treatment, drug abuse north of the border is costing the taxpayer £936 million annually. "It is a much more serious and extensive problem than any of us imagined," said committee chairman Willie McKelvey, Labour MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, at yesterday's launch of a document that has taken seven months to prepare and involved the 11 members in visits to the Netherlands and the United States. Up to 90 per cent of young people attending raves are thought to be using Ecstasy, LSD or amphetamines. Temazepam, a pharmaceutical painkiller, has become one of the favourite opiates of "the least well educated and post-socially disadvantaged as groups of mis-users". An Edinburgh GP told the committee that his surgery's prescription of the drug had risen by 131 per cent recently. However, the report drew back from making a direct link between poverty and drug-taking, preferring to talk of a correlation rather than a causal relationship. The recommendation that the substitute drug methadone be made more freely available by health boards was the most controversial aspect of the report. It cited a US study which showed that the crime rate among a group of 491 addicts on a methadone course had dropped by 79 per cent. While acknowledging that it was the perfect solution, the report found that the advantages of the "soft landing" approach--no injecting, and addicts kept in touch with the support agencies--were too great to be ignored. [passage omitted] To alert potential drug consumers to the dangers--57 per cent of Lothian HIV sufferers contracted the virus from infected needles--the committee called for an education programme starting at primary school. Mr McKelvey said many Scottish mothers were "fraught with despair in some areas as all their kids are at risk". Finding an effective solution will not be easy. Both "shock-horror" and neutral information packages distributed in the Netherlands have provoked a rise in the level of drug-taking. The committee obliquely criticised the police for failing to do more to impound the possessions of drug dealers. In 1992 the authorities in England and Wales seized assets worth £16 million. In the same year the Scottish forces confiscated goods and property worth £28,440. "The Association of Chief Police Officers accepted that the police had not been up to speed on the issue," the report records.
