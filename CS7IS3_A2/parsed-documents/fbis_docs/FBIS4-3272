At a press conference, Karadzic said the Serb attack was not aimed at taking the entire town, but just the south bank of the Drina river, "which has always belonged to us." The river divides Gorazde. But reports reaching here said that Serbian forces shelled UN buildings in Gorazde Tuesday, showing no signs of honoring pledges to stop their attack on Gorazde, a Muslim enclave suffering one of the worst assaults in Bosnia's two-year war. UN officials lost contact with aid workers and military observers in Gorazde late in the day when their building was hit by shells. In Washington, President Bill Clinton met with his national security advisers to examine military and diplomatic options for dealing with the Serb defiance. In Moscow, the Russian government, angered at the Serbs' broken promise to halt their attack on Gorazde, also announced it was shelving its longstanding bid to get UN sanctions against the Serbs lifted. The developments were seen as a major break between Moscow and the Serbs, fellow Slavs with whom it shares historical and religious ties. "The conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina is on the verge of dangerous escalation despite the energetic diplomatic efforts of Russia taken in conjunction with the United Nations and other members of the international community," President Boris Yeltsin said in a statement issued by his office Tuesday night. "The Bosnian Serb leadership must fulfill its promises given to Russia, stop the attacks and pull back from the town of Gorazde," he said. The Serbs attacked Gorazde just a day after Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said they had promised to halt their offensive. His assurances led NATO to cancel plans for new air strikes against the Serbs. Russia has 1,300 soldiers serving in the UN force in former Yugoslavia and is eager to avoid direct confrontations with the Serbs. It sent 200 more paratroopers to the war-torn region on Tuesday to replace other Russian peacekeepers. Serbs' SRNA News Agency reported Muslim-Serb fighting near Brcko, which is the narrow point of a corridor linking Bosnian Serb territories in the northwest and northeast. State radio in neighboring Croatia also said Serbs were reinforcing their forces near Brcko. According to another report, on Sarajevo's southern fringe, as many as 150 Serb soldiers brushed aside 30 French peacekeepers at the Lukavica barracks and took back 18 anti-aircraft guns they had surrended under a NATO threat of air strikes two months ago. NATO officials responded cautiously Tuesday to a request from UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for broader authority to call in air power to protect the six UN-designated "safe areas" like Gorazde.
