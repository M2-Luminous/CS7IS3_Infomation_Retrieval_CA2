The decision it will make regarding the presidency will not only determine the camp's immediate victory or defeat but also define the right wing's form and future. The right wing has two possible choices: It can either seek agreement with the camp associated with the Democratic Union [UD] and the Liberal-Democratic Congress and strive to come up with a joint, compromise-based candidate in the presidential elections, or unite around Lech Walesa again. On a party level, that would also mean an alliance with the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. Peasant activists will most probably have their own candidate for the Belweder Palace, but, until such an official candidate is named, Walesa will try to avoid alienating a potential ally who could lend his popularity to the currently unpopular head of state. While deciding on one of the above-mentioned options, the right wing will also choose the part of the political scene it wants to occupy, and with whom it wants to rule Poland in the future (of course, such are its aspirations): With Waldemar Pawlak, Michal Strak, and Jacek Soska, or with Bronislaw Geremek, Jan Rokita, and Donald Tusk? Sympathies of right-wing politicians are diversified. It is easier to predict the future of the liberal coalition made up of the Union for Real Politics, the Conservative Party, the Peasant-Christian Party, the Party of Christian Democrats, and the Democratic-National Party because any kind of rapprochement between the coalition and the PSL is impossible for program reasons. But, on the other hand, this bloc (known as the Accord of 11 November) also includes politicians who continue to believe in Lech Walesa's lucky star. Despite many bitter disappointments, they would most certainly be willing to place their bets on this quite worn-out and uncertain card. But support for Walesa's candidacy is regarded as a last resort by the Accord of 11 November, while sympathies for him are treated as a rather shameful trait. One party declares unofficially--in a whisper and in secret--that there is still some love for Walesa glowing in another party. The other party, in the meantime, says the same thing--in a contemptuous tone--about the first party. There is no one daring to admit openly his like for the current president. That is even more so because the little whispers are being efficiently jammed by determinant and tough declarations by Aleksander Hall, the conservatives' leader, who, ever since the "war at the top," remains Lech Walesa's vigorous critic. It was precisely Hall who was one of the first activists to initiate a campaign for the sake of a broad agreement among Solidarity-derived forces and who has been calling for the "After-August [1980] Poland" to come up with a joint presidential candidate. And, according to Hall, Walesa cannot be the one, if only because he makes a bad president, but also, which is of importance, as well, because he has no chance for reelection. It is quite a different story with the other right-wing bloc, which comprises the Center Accord [PC], the Christian-National Union [ZChN], the Movement for the Republic, the Peasant Accord, and the Conservative Coalition [KK]. On the face of it, the issue is less complicated in this case: The camp is driven by anti-Walesa moods that spread from the PC and are gladly taken up by the other parties. This right-wing dislike of Walesa can be easily explained. In statements by politicians of this side of the political spectrum, who, after all, contributed to Walesa's taking over his post in the past, disappointment with his actions is prevalent. They continue to hold it against him that he strengthened the left wing and weakened the right, that he betrayed his election program, that he approved and expanded on the principle of a "thick line," and that he is looking for support among remnants of the Polish People's Republic [PRL] power apparatus. The right wing list of accusations against Walesa is long, and it seemed that the Belweder's cooperation with the "screwups" [Walesa's description of right-wing activists] is just an unrealistic fantasy. But, faced with the coming presidential election, Walesa began to look vigorously for allies: He vehemently attacks the postcommunists, and he mentions a need for decommunization and file-checking. For the moment, the right wing ignores the president and pretends that it is not at all interested in the Belweder's occupant because it is aware of the bankruptcy the previous investment in Walesa resulted in. But there is a trait in many people of the right wing that could push them right into the incumbent president's arms again: an obsessive hatred of UD. This hatred is sometimes the main driving force of political action, and sometimes it is even an indicator of "being right-wing." Such right-wing politicians as Slawomir Siwek (who used to be in the PC) and the ZChN's Jan Lopuszanski long ago called for the establishment of an anticommunist and anti-UD front based on the Belweder. But, back then, Walesa contemptuously ignored the proposals. Now he is making an attempt to revive sympathy for himself (which has waned significantly) among right-wing men. Reluctance to UD may be helpful in that regard; this is even more so because, even now, some right-wing politicians (who, it is true, are active on the margins of the coalition of the "five") have been declaring slogans for a return to Walesa's bosom, accompanied by the spread of anti-UD banners. But a majority of right-wing leaders (among others, PC President Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a majority of ZChN politicians, and KK's Kazimierz Ujazdowski) are absolute opponents of such a scenario. The implementation of the scenario in practice would bring about serious and long-term consequences. First of all, it would turn out that the Polish right wing does not exist as a subject on its own, while, without a battering ram like Walesa, it is not capable of scoring a political victory. This would reduce the right wing's role to one of an imitation, a dummy, or an artificial limb that can be used to lean on when there is a need, instead of a serious camp capable of political and ideological influence over Poland. The right wing would mean nothing without Walesa. Second, right-wing voters could feel confused and could say: First we are called on to support Walesa, then we are told repeatedly that he is evil incarnated and a traitor, and then, in the end, we are to support him again. What is this all about? Have the wounds that were inflicted on the right wing in political battles with the president healed completely? Will Walesa not lead us astray this time? These are questions they could ask, and quite justifiably. Some right-wing politicians also think it is the PSL that would be their best partner for a future ruling of the country; Walesa would also see the PSL in his camp willingly. While praising the "Christian-Democratic" and national aspects of the PSL, the party's admirers fail to perceive its weaknesses. The right wing would have to pay with economic concessions in return for an alliance with PSL activists: Centralist and state-control tendencies would most certainly score a triumph in the economy. But, first of all, it is precisely the PSL, along with the Democratic Left Alliance, that has been defending the legacy of the PRL period particularly willingly, and they are also the ones that have been attacking especially aggressively the accomplishments of the four years of Solidarity-derived governments (in the latter aspect, the PSL is definitely even "better" than the postcommunists themselves). It is Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak who surrounds himself with Polish United Workers Party apparatchiks, whom the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic tries to hide particularly well in the vast areas of its premises. It is PSL politicians who have been comparing the post-1989 years with the Nazi occupation. The anticommumist right wing should keep that in mind.
