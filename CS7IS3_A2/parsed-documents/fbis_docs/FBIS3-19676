[Vranitzky] Very badly, and not long enough, because I was on the telephone until after midnight. [PROFIL] And the fact that, at the time, you had already decided that Peter Ambrozy would have to resign as chairman of the Carinthian Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPoe], did not improve your sleep? [Vranitzky] It did not make the bad results any better. [PROFIL] According to pollsters, four out of five Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] voters said that they had voted for Haider's party because the FPOe was exposing the mess produced by the big parties. Is this not also a vote that goes beyond the context of a provincial election but also has something to do with politics at the federal level? [Vranitzky] It is absolutely clear that we cannot say at the federal level that we are not affected by the election result. Still, I do think that Sunday's elections were first and foremost affected by regional affairs. [passage omitted] [PROFIL] Somebody, whom you do not appreciate a lot -- the chairman of the FPOe -- undoubtedly managed to win votes from groups of people who used to be traditional SPOe supporters. One in four FPOe voters is a worker, while this percentage is only insignificantly higher for the SPOe. [Vranitzky] This has not least to do with the fact that the significance of party work at the grassroots level has diminished. It is true that Haider has raised issues that are related to workers. Yet, it is equally true that, in reality, he is making major pronouncements and promises that can easily be weakened or disclosed as half-truths or lies. Yet this disclosing is not taking place to a sufficient degree. [PROFIL] This brings up the question whether disclosing such things is enough to prevent the voters from supporting Haider in the polls. [Vranitzky] It is not the argument alone, it is also the way in which such an argument is presented. It is also a question of rhetorics and clarity. [PROFIL] People have been voting for Haider for almost eight years now. Neither the SPOe nor the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] have been able to think up a convincing strategy. [Vranitzky] This is not a purely Austrian phenomenon. The progress of civilization does not only produce winners. Those who lose or, at least think that they are not among the winners, are particularly responsive to those who criticize our highly-developed, highly liberal system. [PROFIL] Has the FPOe not meanwhile become too big for the others still to maintain that it is nothing but a protest party that represents the losers? [Vranitzky] This is not what I said. This group of voters has been added to the traditional FPOe voters. [PROFIL] [President of Parliament] Heinz Fischer once said that Haider would ultimately win himself to death. Do you see a dying man somewhere on the horizon? [Vranitzky] It has become clear that the SPOe's good results in surveys at a national level are not a warranty. There is no election victory without fighting. Therefore, I do not want to deal with the question whether he has won himself to death or whether he has reached a ceiling.
