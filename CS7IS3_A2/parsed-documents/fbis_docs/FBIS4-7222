On 22 April 1994, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk issued a statement proposing that a roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation be held under his chairmanship. 2. On the same day, after receiving the king's statement, H.E. Khieu Samphan, chairman of the PDK, immediately sent a telegram to the king. The contents of this telegram is as follows: I am pleased to receive your 22 April 1994 statement. In keeping with the deepest desire of our entire nation and people, I, on behalf of the PDK, would like to express total support for the proposal, which is the product of your profound insight, to organize a roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation under your majesty's august chairmanship. 3. On 23 April, with a spirit to enable this roundtable meeting to be held successfully with good results in line with the king's wish and the deepest aspiration of our entire Cambodian nation and people, H.E. Khieu Samphan sent a telegram dated 23 April 1994 to the king. The content of this telegram is as follows: The PDK's support for the king's proposal on a roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation comes from the persistent stand of Democratic Kampuchea, which zealously wants the Cambodian problem to be resolved quickly to achieve genuine national reconciliation and unification and enable our Cambodia to enjoy peace. All along, Democratic Kampuchea has always supported the ideas put forth by the king with great insight to enable Cambodia to achieve national reconciliation, unification, and peace. The PDK has fully and unconditionally supported His Majesty the King's five-point political guideline. At the same time, I have tried to propose meetings of various levels with a spirit to accomplish your majesty's five-point idea. But they have all along opposed our proposals and sought every means to destroy the peaceful solution. At the same time, I sought to have an audience with Your Majesty with an aim to seek a solution to end quickly the bloody war caused by the foreigners and them. Recently, Your Majesty and the respected queen kindly permitted me to have an audience with you on 13 April. But Your Majesty knew about the security situation, which cannot be guaranteed even 60 percent, for me and the entire PDK delegation. Thus, with lofty spirit of responsibility in your capacity as the father of the nation, Your Majesty kindly canceled the audience on 13 April and instead grant me an audience in Beijing in June instead. The PDK has voiced happily and promptly its support for the king's proposal on a roundtable meeting made in your 22 April 1994 statement. I would like to cite some developments for Your Majesty's information with the aim of arranging favorable conditions for a secured and neutral negotiation. This is in line with the profound and sacred desire of the father of peace and national reconciliation and in line with the aspiration of our entire nation and people. The PDK office has come under constant monitoring and threats since 18 April 1994. The employees working there could not carry out their normal activities. The police even prohibited them from going to the market to buy daily food. They were allowed to go sometimes, but with policemen tagging along in the same car or policemen on motorcycles following behind. There are between 10 and 15 policemen and troops standing in front of the office gate to show constantly their force. Telephone lines have all been disconnected. The masses who are relatives of the PDK members have also been prohibited from entering the office. This causes a problem, which affects the chances for the roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation that the entire Cambodian nation and people, including Democratic Kampuchea, want so much. I would like to beg Your Majesty to help arrange for the PDK's office to resume its normal activity. In addition to this, there is the issue of the National Assembly members, whose true nature is known to all, proposing a draft to outlaw the PDK, to make it the rebel. This is direct and arrogant opposition to the king's proposal for the roundtable meeting. This law, either with a two-thirds or a three-thirds majority, is in opposition to the roundtable meeting and to national reconciliation, national unification, and peace in Cambodia. The situation has deteriorated since the time the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia. They kept opposing and trampling upon the Paris agreement even after signing it. They resolutely rejected the four-party policy. In reality, that was outright opposition to national reconciliation and unification. They refused to give any role to the four-party Supreme National Council [SNC] as well as to the king, the SNC chairman. Immediately after the elections organized by the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia], they began their joint offensive to kill the PDK and kindle the flame of war which has continued to rage Cambodia until today. I and the PDK, like our entire nation and people in the countryside, in Phnom Penh, and abroad, want so much to achieve national reconciliation and unification and to rally all forces under the shade of the throne and the king. All of this is in order to bring peace to Cambodia and enable our Cambodian people to live and make their living in peace and happiness. In this spirit, despite their trampling upon the Paris agreement and opposition to the PDK, even by jointly attacking, opposing, and trying to kill Democratic Kampuchea, I am willing to let bygones be bygones without any desire for vengeance. I only think about how to achieve national reconciliation, rally all national forces, and reunify the nation in line with His Majesty's national reconciliation policy. This will respond to the profound aspiration of the entire nation and people, who want genuine national reconciliation and reunification in a peaceful, unified, and neutral Cambodia. For all of the above reasons and through experiences gained in our Cambodia and from the world, I am of the opinion that the roundtable meeting should be held in a neutral place -- inside or outside the country -- where security is guaranteed for all parties to the negotiation and talks. Only by so doing can the negotiation and talks proceed normally and the meeting achieve good results. The above information that I have reported to Your Majesty comes out of our thoughts, with a sense of responsibility for the fate of our nation and people, on what to do in order to enable the roundtable negotiation be held successfully in line with Your Majesty's desire and our people's profound aspiration.
