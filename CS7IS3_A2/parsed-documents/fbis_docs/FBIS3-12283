Habash also held the U.S. Administration responsible through its protection of Israel. Habash did not exempt Yasir 'Arafat and the Oslo-Cairo team, as he said, from responsibility through their signing of agreements that entrench the occupation and protect the settlements. In a statement published in the Iraqi newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH, Abu-al-'Abbas [Muhammad 'Abbas], secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Front [PLF], called for halting the negotiations with Israel and resuming armed struggle. Through its official spokesman Ibrahim Ghawash, who spoke at a news conference, Hamas called on the PLO to return to its people. Hamas criticized the president of the PLO for continuing negotiations. Hamas reiterated its rejection of the Oslo-Cairo agreements and said these agreements maintain the settlements as time bombs that explode in the faces of Palestinians every day.
