For the person who, during the past two years, has made poked fun at the Left with the fire of this grand and terrible word, it looks like a bitter awakening. But also those people who were more attentive to this country's history, more concerned about the extreme difficultly of governing a convulsive transition phase in a democratic fashion, had become intuitively aware of the danger, and indeed had little reason to express satisfaction. There is no getting round the fact that this is not the way we thought we should move from the night of the First Republic to the dawn of the new one. With a disordered and crazily ferocious election campaign. With a vote which makes the conflict even more radical. In the coming hours we will see the dimensions of the pole for freedom's success, in particular in terms of parliamentary seats. The new electoral system can play brutal tricks, even on the best opinion pollsters, and a relative majority, however large, is something totally different from an absolute majority. We shall also see whether, and to what extent, and if necessary how, [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, who had stated his readiness to renounce the soccer title for Milan for the sake of this victory, will be able to hold together his highly litigious allies: the League which, according to the forecasts, is in difficulty, and the MSI [Italian Social Movement]/National Alliance, which on the other hand is getting ready to enjoy the pleasures of a triumph which is probably above anything they had expected. But in the meantime that victory of the Right, or rather of three different and potentially complementary rights, is there. Revealing in part deep and ancient tendencies in the country, which have been kept under control for almost 50 years during which Italy was governed by a center which, whilst looking leftward, took good care not to lose its ability to represent the majority of the moderate and conservative electorate, and to keep it as far away as possible from the reactionary camp. But an excess of history is of little use in helping us understand. Because Forza Italia is not interpreted by the majority of Italians, nor even less by those voting for it, by the yardstick of a recycled repetition of the five-party system, as the adversary propaganda noisily and ineffectively pretended. Because Bossi's League was not only a striking sign of the collapse of the ancien regime, but also a highly active and original political player in the process. Because Gianfranco Fini's MSI-National Alliance, with all the concerns which its major step forward arouses, is something different from Giorgio Almirante's at times squad-like and at times smart-suited MSI. In other words, Italy's three rights have roots which are more or less old and deep, but which represent, each on its own, and all together, a new phenomenon. As if public opinion, and finally [philosopher] Norberto Bobbio, have perceived the recipes which these parties have formulated, more or less completely, for overcoming the Italian crisis by paths opposed to the traditional consensus approach as being new, and in any event newer than those suggested by the Left. It would be surprising if such a large number of novice rhetoricians were to evince surprise and indignation at the revolution which has come out of the vote. Right now, in any event, the first job of the pole for freedom's heterogeneous components and of Berlusconi, before even getting down to proving in practice the efficacy of the therapy in question, is to demonstrate that they are able, together, to reap the benefit of their joint victory. In brief, to give the country a government, individually and in conjunction with the other parties. And the task, judging from the virulent polemics of the past weeks and the first "hot" reactions of Bossi and Fini, is not an easy matter. If the numbers of the new parliament prove them right, and if they succeed in this enterprise, everyone of the Right which has become a governing force and who is looking for a democratic way out of the crisis must renounce every temptation to crush, and must fully respect the rules of the game and the rights and the reasons of the defeated. And at the end of an election campaign, one of the most poisonous fruits of which has been the rampant tendency to transform the figure of the adversary into that of a mortal enemy, divested ultimately of his legitimacy not only to govern, but even to exist, and into an incarnation of evil, and in a situation of serious political and social tensions, the same applies identically to the Left. What is at stake, naturally, is the fate of Italian democracy, which has become fragile. But, looking at the situation closely, what is at stake is the very future of the Left, which is guilty as much, if not more than the Right, of the mortal sin described above, and which will probably pay a very high price for this. Just last December, on the day after the second round of the local elections in Rome and Naples, [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Achille Occhetto and his allies considered themselves, and were almost universally considered to be, the certain victors of the general elections, being confirmed in this position first of all the incommunicability between the League and the National Alliance and the desertification of the center. Against any recomposition of which, forgetful of the less antiquated part of the same [former communist leader] Togliatti tradition, they then took steps to fire point-blank. From this unjustified euphoria the progressives were entirely unable to free themselves after the direct entry onto the stage of Berlusconi, even though clearly destined to radically change the situation. Gradually the quasi-certainty of victory receded, a situation which, however, they translated into virulence, extremism, and denunciation of mortal risks for democracy, for the ability to live together, and for the fight against criminality in the case of a victory by the opposition. With at least the first indications of how the voting went, the outcome appears to be that they have convinced fairly few electors outside their own traditional field of influence: a result certainly made no less disappointing by the success of the PDS list. It would be the worst thing possible for the same Left if, rather than to withdraw and seek to understand the reasons for the defeat, it were to persevere in error. Shouting about plots and the bogeymen. It would be wrong for them to seek a way out of the awkward situation by seeking to radicalize social combat, or by exchanging judicial initiatives for the continuation of the political battle by other means. In preparing a responsible approach, the Italian Left could draw inspiration from the French left. Certainly, Silvio Berlusconi has nothing of a Charles de Gaulle about him. But it was precisely in the years of the government of the right that, in France, a left, finally emancipated from the consensus vices of the Fourth Republic succeeded in building, not a gay and therefore useless war machine, but a leader, a program and a winning line-up.
