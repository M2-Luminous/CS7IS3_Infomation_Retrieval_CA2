That was the judgment passed on Vyacheslav Kebich in absentia by the participants in a recent press conference given by leaders of the Belorussian [Belarusian] People's Front. A letter has been sent to the parliament and the general prosecutor demanding that judicial proceedings be instituted against the head of government. This hasty move, which is patently aimed at an excitable audience, only causes a wry smile. The opposition is jumpy.... It has been so convenient for many months now to accuse the prime minister of deluding the people with the impracticable idea of creating a unified ruble zone and gradually reverting to a normal life worthy of man! Let us be frank. Kebich sometimes left himself open. His frequent overly optimistic statements that there was just one step to go to monetary union failed to materialize with suspicious regularity, thus alienating long-standing allies. In a desire to score as many propaganda points as possible from this, Stanislav Shushkevich did not wait for the official announcement of the election campaign but rushed to tour cities and villages saying how bad the parliament and government are. It is of course no secret to the retired speaker that this does not square with universally recognized norms. But the following has long since been well-known: Where there's a will there's a way. Another month or two is all that is needed! But.... Readers saw that Premiers Chernomyrdin and Kebich ratified a treaty in Moscow with their signatures, giving the two countries' economies equal rights, removing customs barriers, and fixing unified prices of energy sources. Without the slightest chance of competing with Western output, Belorussian goods are once again turning up on the immense Russian market where there was always demand for them. Thus, enterprises that had shut down are beginning to work again. And the timid "hare" [the Belarusian currency] is giving way in people's wallets to the full-blooded ruble. One may argue about whether Vyacheslav Kebich was involved in the breakup of the USSR, which was formalized, to our shame, in Viskuli, and how personally accountable he is for the agony of the Belorussian economy. These questions will probably be given exhaustive answers at some point. Today, there is no time for moralizing. It is important to understand something else: What direction should be taken now -- toward the East as the government is insistently urging or toward the West, where the opposition is painting alluring mirages? [Osinskiy] Vyacheslav Frantsevich, you are perhaps starting the presidential race in the most disadvantageous position. None of your rivals bears the burden of responsibility for the current state of the economy. At least that is what they themselves think. Even Stanislav Shushkevich is rushing to disavow what he has done in parliament. But you cannot get away from critical fire. Your rivals will pin "all manner of charges" on you. So here is a roundabout question for you: What is the reason for our collapse? [Kebich] Gorbachev's perestroyka, beyond any shadow of a doubt. Having begun this without a well-founded concept, instead of replacing the rotten roof and ceilings and recasting the internal layout of our all-union home, the leaders of the CPSU set about shattering walls that had been built over centuries. Had Gorbachev agreed at Novo-Ogarevo to turn the country into a confederation, I have no doubt that even the Baltic countries would have accepted this plan. However, the vain general secretary was convinced that he knew the situation better than anyone. The result was that, when the leaders of the three republics met in the Belovezhskaya Forest, the edifice of the USSR was already breaking up. However, even at that critical moment it still could have and should have been saved. That was the aim of the document that the prime ministers signed. It enshrined a common economic area, a unified ruble zone, and transparency of borders. I am not ashamed of my signature on this treaty. But in practice it proved a totally meaningless appendix to the document initialed by the heads of state. Political ambition and a desire to escape from the "union center's clutches" gained the upper hand. They gave rise to terrible centrifugal forces and brought about political, economic, social, and moral catastrophe. [Osinskiy] Do you think that not everything was all that bad with the USSR's economic system? Have I understood you right? [Kebich] Absolutely. In an attempt to justify their actions, "democrat" politicians are effectively committing blatant forgery. Ask any of them: Where does salvation lie? And you get the response: in the market. And everyone pictures a huge Komarovskiy bazaar [allusion unknown] across the whole country where total anarchy reigns. Gentlemen, no capitalist countries have a market like that! It only exists in your fevered imagination. While I was chairman of the Republic's State Planning Committee I made frequent visits to the United States. And you know, the first person to whom I was introduced in each state was the governor's first deputy for planning. State regulation is an indispensable condition for a normal market. [Osinskiy] During my work in the FRG I also encountered this at every turn. Small German firms, for instance, curse the government like nothing on earth for not being given quotas to import cheap vodka and consumer goods from the CIS countries. Agricultural regulation is even tougher. East German peasants were forced to leave half their land fallow so as to prevent overproduction of grain. Admittedly, the state's diktat is not administrative but economic here. [Kebich] That is the whole crux of the matter, the main distinction from the preposterous capitalism that is being cultivated in our country. Something similar happened in the West during the "Great Depression." Leading capitalist countries extricated themselves from economic crisis not despite but with the help of reasonable planning and regulation. Take for example the states of Southeast Asia which are a household name today. Why did Japan, South Korea, and Singapore reach the heights of economic prosperity so rapidly? Because everything was laid down there, planned down to the finest detail. For two years we too succeeded in preventing the wholesale breakup of the economy thanks to the tremendous safety margin built in during Soviet times. The republic had a very strong and disciplined industry and highly developed agriculture. Remember: In 1989 national income rose around 8 percent and we did not drop below the figure of 6 percent even during the worst years. Belorussia almost reached the U.S. level in terms of per capita meat production and outstripped it by a factor of 2.5 in terms of milk production. The government tried to restructure the economic mechanism without putting it out of action as happened in Russia and other USSR republics. Joe Public had the impression (and the opposition did its utmost to foster it) that reforms were being deliberately delayed. In fact, we prepared them carefully, avoiding ill-conceived actions, and thanks to this we have kept ourselves afloat for the time being. [Osinskiy] The opposition claims that the main secret of the relative stability of the time was the low price of energy sources. [Kebich] That is not true. They were higher then than in Russia and the difference became even more tangible from month to month, but we nonetheless held our ground and the Russian economy collapsed. To be honest I am surprised at how we succeeded in surviving! Since even Ukraine, with its wealth of natural resources and favorable climate, ended up on its knees right away.... No, it was this safety margin that saved us. That has now disappeared. And people have become fully aware of rampant savage market forces. [Osinskiy] I think that the "democrats" would disagree with you there. They think that the situation in Russia is improving because Gaydar and his team jumped into the cold water of the market without fear and doubt. Needless to say, they swallowed a lot of water, but then they started swimming! We are all standing on the bank testing the water. [Kebich] They may have started swimming -- but to where? Back to the bank that they left so easily. Chernomyrdin's government is making increasingly vigorous use of plan levers and is channeling state investment into those sectors on which the future of the whole economy depends. If you want to know, it is not Belorussia that needs to overtake Russia but Russia that needs to restore what we have managed to preserve. [Osinskiy] The opposition looks as though it is right about some things: Have Kebich and his government deliberately held up market reforms. [Kebich] Yes. Just add the prefix "pseudo" to the word "reforms" -- "pseudoreforms." I do not consider "reforms" that are designed to destroy the economy and which advocate shock therapy, and hence the mass impoverishment of the population, to be genuine and I will never support them. [Osinskiy] Vyacheslav Frantsevich, a very complex election marathon lies ahead. With what platform are you beginning it? [Kebich] I will present my election program later. But I can tell you now that it is based on the position of centrism as a basis for popular accord. I think that the future president should use ideas, plans based on their good sense regardless of which party proposed them, and support ideas and plans that come from "left" or "right." During the election campaign let us seek a more acceptable economic model for our country without slighting one another and without digging up the dirt. And may victory go to the person whose arguments the voters consider the most cogent.
