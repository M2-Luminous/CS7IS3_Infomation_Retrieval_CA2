The Lucky-Goldstar Business Group has in principle accepted an offer from the Pyongyang government to take over the management of Kim Chaek Steel Mill, the largest steel maker in the North, a high-ranking group official said on condition of anonymity. "North Korea has put forward the proposal because it needs the money to resuscitate the steel mill whose operating ratio has been falling sharply," said the official in an exclusive interview with THE KOREA HERALD. Kim Chaek Steel Mill now appears to be heading for a shutdown as the North Korean regime doesn't have enough U.S. dollars to import coke, a coal derivative needed to melt iron ore, from Russia, he said. The steel mill's shutdown may have a disastrous effect on North Korea's already moribund economy. Apparently, to avoid such a scenario, North Korea contacted Lucky-Goldstar, the nation's third- largest business conglomerate. Pyongyang secretly delivered the proposal to Lucky-Goldstar via its officials in China late last year. "We have since then negotiated with Pyongyang officials, including a vice minister, on the matter in China. Recently, both sides have reached a tentative agreement in Beijing," he said, declining, however, to elaborate on the deal. In late March this year, the conglomerate sent a delegation, including the unnamed Herald source and two other senior officials from Lucky-Goldstar International Corp., the group's trading arm, to Beijing to fine-tune contract terms with their North Korean counterparts. "When realized, it will be an epoch-making bilateral economic cooperation project between the two Koreas," said the Lucky-Goldstar official who is now responsible for planning the group's investment projects in the North. At present, inter-Korea cooperation is not active. A typical form of cooperation now is South Korean firms sending materials for such light goods as textiles and toys to their North Korean partner for processing. Firms in the South export the processed products abroad. Pyongyang's unprecedented offer to Lucky-Goldstar led North Korea watchers to confirm that the Communist country's economy is nearing the verge of collapse. To revive it, they noted, the help of foreign countries, including South Korea, will be essential. The fact that Kim Chaek Steel Mill may be closed soon was all the more shocking to the experts in Seoul because North Korea promoted Hong Sok-hyong to deputy premier in charge of the economy in 1993 in a recognition of his achievements as director of the steel mill, they noted. "Our investment strategy toward North Korea focuses on heavy industry where we haven't yet advanced in the South," the Lucky- Goldstar official said. Under a long-term strategy mapped out in 1993, Lucky-Goldstar aims to make a presence in the steel, auto and shipbuilding industries by acquiring or setting up plants in the North, he said. "This is why we have in principle accepted the Pyongyang proposal although the investment risks are high," said the official, adding that such efforts will contribute to helping reunite the two Koreas in the long run. In this regard, Lucky-Goldstar is also considering advancing into the auto industry by taking over the North Korean automaker Sungni Machinery, the official revealed. "At present, the Pyongyang government regards Lucky-Goldstar as the most reliable partner among South Korean business groups," the official said, citing the group's consistent efforts to gain the confidence of Pyongyang officials. Meanwhile, the Samsung Business Group has also decided to invest in developing a North Korean port on the eastern coast. According to a Samsung official, the group has recently accepted an offer from Pyongyang via an ethnic Korean entrepreneur in China. "In addition, we are expected to sign an agreement with the Pyongyang government soon on establishing a joint venture for container production in the port city near the North Korean border with Russia," said the Samsung official on the condition of anonymity. According to the two unnamed officials of Lucky-Goldstar and Samsung, their business groups have applied to the Unification Board for approval of their direct investment projects in North Korea. Until 1992, North Korea had made overtures to Hyundai and Daewoo to attract capital in developing its outdated infrastructure. Both Hyundai and Daewoo are strong in heavy industries. In particular, the Pyongyang government appeared to regard Hyundai as the best business partner in South Korea. It invited Chong Chu-yong, the Hyundai chairman, and during his visit, Chong promised to invest in heavy industrial fields. The North Korean leadership, however, felt betrayed as the Hyundai group founder could not keep his investment promises, said Kim Yong-sin, an official of the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA). Along with Hyundai, Daewoo also lost the confidence of the Pyongyang leadership. According to the KOTRA official, North Korea has since focused on maintaining a close relationship with Lucky-Goldstar which it found to be more reliable and better managed. As a result, Lucky-Goldstar has tried to build confidence by placing orders with North Korean firms to produce men's jackets and toys, the official said. "At the meeting in Beijing, we also discussed with North Korean government officials the establishment of a joint venture to manufacture umbrellas in the Najin-Sonbong free trade zone in the estuary of the Tumen River," the Lucky-Goldstar official said. Regarding the development of the free trade zone, the Chinese government has asked Lucky-Goldstar to take part in its project to build a road linking China with Chongjin, a northeast North Korean port city, he said.
