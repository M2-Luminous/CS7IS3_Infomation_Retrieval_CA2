In an opinion poll carried out by Finnish Gallup for HELSINGIN SANOMAT, support for the SDP is about 34 percent. Support for the party is 12 percent higher than the number of votes it received in the last parliamentary elections. According to the opinion poll, the main government parties -- the National Coalition Party and the Center Party -- would both receive support of just under 18 percent. Joint support for the four government parties is now 43 percent. The opposition thus has a clear majority of support from the voters. Support for the Leftist Alliance was 11 percent, and support for the Greens has dropped to 6 percent. Support for the Finnish Rural Party has dropped to almost nothing. Last week, 2,000 Finns were interviewed for the opinion poll.
