ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning diseases claimed to be the result of exposure to ionizing radiation. This amendment is necessary to implement recommendations by the Veterans Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards (VACEH) that tumors of the brain and central nervous system be considered ``radiogenic.'' The intended effect of this amendment is to add tumors of the brain and central nervous system to the list of radiogenic diseases for service-connected compensation purposes. EFFECTIVE DATE: This amendment is effective September 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lorna Weston, Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 273&hyph;7210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 3.311(b)(2) to include tumors of the brain and central nervous system on the list of diseases VA will recognize as being radiogenic in the Federal Register of February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6607&hyph;08). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments, suggestions or objections concerning the proposal on or before April 12, 1994. As no comments were received, the proposed amendment is adopted without change. The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.
