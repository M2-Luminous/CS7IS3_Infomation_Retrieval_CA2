The delegation of Black Caucus Republican congressmen was headed by Dr. (Thomas Ferguson), its chairman. [name and title as heard] (Ferguson) was accompanied by his wife (Siegrid Furguson) and by (Lerone Toltson), executive chief, assisted by Mr. (Herb Barsman). The chairman of the Republican Black Caucus, Dr. (Furguson), stated he came to Haiti so as to inform the [U.S.] Congress all about what the delegation sees during its stay in Haiti. The delegation did not come to interfere in the nation's political affairs because Haitians have enough experience and education to solve their problems by themselves. [passage omitted] Dr. (Furguson) went on to say that Haitians are determined people, and they can manage to establish democracy in Haiti. If foreigners do not want this, those who do not agree should leave Haiti and go home. Dr. (Furguson) said he talked with the Army commander in chief for two hours. He talked to them [not further identified] so they can help the Haitian people establish law and democracy. (Ferguson) forcefully condemned those who are asking that the embargo against Haiti be strengthened. [passage omitted] After Dr. (Ferguson's) speech, more than 12 political leaders or heads of people's organizations presented their grievances to the black Caucus senator [position as heard], hoping he would pass their messages on to President Bill Clinton. The secretary general of the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, which is the neo-Duvalierist party headed by Toto Constant, presented a somber report on Haiti for the period from 29 November [1987] to the present. Secretary General Constant seized the opportunity to ask the people of the United States, as a people, that is, in his opinion a moral people, to help the young Haitians who are the future of Haiti so they can rebuild the country and set it on the democratic track. [passage omitted] For his part Hubert de Ronceray, leader of the Mobilization for National Development, one of the biggest opponents to President Aristide's return to power in Haiti, said, in a speech approximately 15 minutes long, Dr. (Ferguson's) presence in Haiti constitutes a guarantee for the progress of the democratic struggle. De Ronceray considers (Furguson) the ambassador for the Haitian cause. [passage omitted] Unionist Jean-Auguste Mesyeux; Dr. Sylvan Jolibois, leader of the Patriotic Urban and Rural Union; and Richard Vladimir Jeanty, leader of the Haitian Party of God joined the president of the Senate of the Republic and Hubert de Ronceray in forcefully condemning the embargo. In conclusion, Senator Bernard Sansaricq, president of the unofficial [Senate] office, who spoke like a prophet, asked Dr. (Furguson) to ask President Clinton to change his policy toward Haiti and to ask Ellen Cosgrove, a political officer of the U.S. Embassy in Haiti; Stanley Schrager, U.S. spokesman in Haiti; and Ambassador William Lacy Swing to stop interfering in Haitian political affairs because they, in the Senate of the Republic, are working very hard to find a solution to the Haitian crisis.
