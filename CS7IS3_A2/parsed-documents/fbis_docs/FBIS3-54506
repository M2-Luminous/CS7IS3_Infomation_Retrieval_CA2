This, after the deterioration in Palestinian-Gulf relations in the aftermath of the second Gulf war and the subsequent inter-Arab rifts as a whole. Undoubtedly, any effort toward clearing the Arab climate and restoring its harmony and serenity is now more necessary than ever. If the Gulf war was a black cloud in the Arab nation's history and a negative development in relations between brothers, insistence on maintaining that dark and painful chapter and keeping the wound of fraternal Arab relations bleeding will benefit no one but the adversaries of this nation and those who try to exploit differences and crises to achieve gains and goals at the expense of all the Arabs. The hope is that Palestinian-Saudi relations in particular, and Palestinian-Gulf relations in general, will be elevated to their well-known level, even if in stages. Those states were -- and it is hoped they will remain in the future -- supporters of the Palestinian cause. It is a cause which the Arabs believed was above Arab differences and disputes and a reason for unity not discord, convergence not divergence. The Palestinian people have proceeded on the road to peace and are now passing through a difficult stage in the negotiations for implementing the interim agreement. Many foreign parties have declared their support for the Palestinian people's efforts in building their entity, institutions, and infrastructure. The Arab brothers everywhere are called upon to play an active role in this sphere. Not only the Palestinians but the entire world expects them to do so. Certainly, the supreme Arab interest requires one to forget the rancors, sensitivities, and pains and to develop a positive pattern of relations between the various Arab states based on cooperation and mutual respect. This is what the Palestinian cause requires at these delicate circumstances through which it is passing. Moreover, this will represent a great achievement on the pan-Arab level following the collapse and decline witnessed by the Arabs during the past years.
