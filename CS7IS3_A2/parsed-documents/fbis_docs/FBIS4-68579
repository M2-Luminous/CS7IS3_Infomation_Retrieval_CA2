Proposals for Reform of Our Banking System"] [Text] Position Calls for reform of Russia's banking system, including its Central Bank, have begun to appear more and more frequently in the press recently. In the opinion of some, the Russian banking sector should be transformed based on American experience (following the model of the Federal Reserve System of the United States). Others think that the banking system of Russia should be reformed according to the German model (following the experience of the Bundesbank, with a developed network of branch banks and strict control from the center). While agreeing in principle with the need for banking reform, the Central Bank thinks that it should not be conducted hastily, but gradually, that it will take about two years to complete it, that to mechanically apply readymade structures from other countries to a Russian base is unfeasible, and that it would be more correct to take advantage of the experience both of the Federal Reserve System and Bundesbank and of the Central Bank of Russia. Inclining more toward a position of a weighed approach which takes into account both the patterns and the peculiarities in the development of the banking business, national culture and historical traditions, and the overall condition of the Russian economy as an economy in transition, we, however, think that when determining the direction for the development of its banking system Russian society must first resolve a number of principle issues for itself. Do we have the right to reform the banking system or would it be more correct in this stage to speak about creating its design? Does this system exist in Russia or does it still have to be formed? In which stage of bank construction are we and are we certain enough about how what has developed should be transformed? Can we postpone the transformation of banking in the country and limit ourselves solely to discussions and declarations, allowing ourselves to become involved in heated but particular discussions (this would not be the first time this has happened in our life, it is happening at this very moment as we are beginning to react to one idea or another that has been foisted upon us) and philosophize at length without proposing something specific in exchange? Finally, will we continue for long to grasp individual ideas and parts without resolving questions of its creation and management comprehensively? When answering these questions a great deal depends on how we evaluate what has already happened with our banks. If we understand the task as being primarily to destroy the old system--the monopolism of the former State Bank of the USSR, the state monopoly in forming banks, then we can say that we have carried it out to a considerable degree: The Gosbank [State Bank] as a concept in the history of Russian banking has receded into the past and modern business banks are being generated not only on state but also on private initiative. If, however, we set as our tasks not only to destroy but also to construct something new and adequate to the market, then, naturally, the answer will be negative. One can probably agree that our banking system is for the time being some kind of hybrid of the market and centralized systems. The Central Bank is no longer the state bank, but it is not a bank that corresponds to a market economy. Commercial banks are not branches of a single giant but they are still far from being banks that have their own set of banking services and have the capital base and technology of operations enabling them to carry out large-scale capital investments. Which path shall we take from here? Let us try to formulate several general approaches. 1. First of all we should agree that transformations in the banking sector are not short-term acts, they are a long-term, stage-by-stage program of actions based on increasing both the activity of the Central Bank itself and the activity of large commercial banks, banking associations, scientific centers, and organizations. 2. During the process of reconstruction of the banking system we cannot reform just one element of it--just the Central Bank or just the commercial banks. The formation of a new type of banking system must be comprehensive in nature, affect all elements of the banking sector, provide for the necessary interaction among them, and provide for effective functioning not only of the Central Bank but also of the banking sector as a whole. 3. I would like to give warning about something else--we must not regard the transformations of the banking sector as a panacea for solving all and especially larger (than purely banking) national economic problems. With all their economic and political power the banks operate in a sphere which is only a part of the reproduction of society. Their activity is linked to the formation and distribution of monetary resources and mobilization of savings for the needs of economic development. The monetary-credit policy of the banks therefore can resolve a limited number of problems. Of course, it can exert an influence on the acceleration (retardation), and expansion (narrowing) of production, but mainly through exchange, a system of special (monetary) instruments. The banks influence the utilization of resources and have an impact on liquidity, capitalization of incomes, consumer demand, and capital investments, but one must not forget that they operate on the basis of already created accumulations, their "capital-creating" capabilities are limited, and they are practically nonexistent under conditions of high inflation. To exaggerate or underestimate the role of the monetary-credit policy are two extremes, both of which can lead to new disproportions. 4. Banking monetary instruments are capable of exerting an influence on social development only in concert and simultaneously with other instruments. Transformations in the sphere of banking should therefore be regarded only as part of systemic general economic transformations. Since the banking system as a whole in a certain sense is derived from the economic and political structure of the country and since changes in the banking sector should take place only to the proper degree and as a reflection under the conditions of the transition period and in real branches of the national economy and state and political structures. Therefore one can assert that the transformation of the banking system is merely an element of the overall economic strategy, which is called upon to serve the process of other reforms (in the area of diversification of property, demobilization, the establishment of new markets, restructuring of interregional and interrepublic relations, etc.). 5. The reforming of banks has independent significance and should provide for democratization of the banking system, strengthening of credit institutions, and the formation of a banking market and banking infrastructure. Transformations in the banking system should, in our view, begin with a solution to certain conceptual problems. Strange as it may be, they include discovering the essence of the banking system itself. Let us recall that the banking system is frequently interpreted as the totality of particular banking and nonbanking institutions (so-called credit institutions). With this approach there is no system, because a system presupposes not only elements in relation to one another as they interact but also elements that are interconnected with the external environment. It includes, consequently, not only the aforementioned credit institutions but also something that is actually lacking in our life, namely a banking infrastructure, a money market, and a legislative base. Unfortunately, a banking market in the real sense of the word has not yet been formed in Russia. Accumulations, on whose basis the banking sector could develop and which could nourish the resource base of commercial banks, are clearly inadequate. The average deposit of the population as of the beginning of this year was little more than 1,400 rubles [R]. Bank deposits (including call deposits and short-term deposits in the Sberbank, and also certificates of deposit) amounted to R8,135 billion or 21.1 percent of the overall money supply. The proportion of deposits in commercial banks was little more than 11 percent. Deposits from the population in the overall total of liabilities of Russian commercial banks amounted to a miserly sum--0.88 percent (as of 1 September 1993). The capital base of enterprises has been bled dry by the severe inflation. Many years will pass before real accumulations will reach a level sufficient to consider the banks to be provided with resources for granting credit. The market presupposes vigorous trade. Although trade among banks is developing, a number of commercial banks are operating not so much with their own capital and capital in the accounts of their clients along with interbank credit as on the basis of regular infusions from the Central Bank. Centralized loans account for more than 80 percent of the overall sum of credit obtained by commercial banks from other banks. Essentially, the old machine for distribution of resources in the form of credit limits of the State Bank have largely been replaced by a system of distribution of credit of the Central Bank. One can say that the system of market mechanisms, including the sale of credit at auctions, is just taking its first steps. The fundamental questions include also the very understanding of a bank, its essence, functions, and role in the economy. Let us note that it is not such a simple matter to give a definition to a bank. Banks have been in existence for several millennia and their modern activity is so diverse that sometimes it is not easy to distinguish them from other financial institutions. Yet an analysis of their essence makes it incumbent on us to single out something special, specific; in a word it makes it incumbent on us to single out that which distinguishes the phenomenon under consideration from any other. In modern science and practice the definition of a "bank" is approached from two positions: legal and economic. From the legal standpoint a "bank" is defined from the position of what it does (which operations it performs) and what it can do. Of course, this approach has a right to exist, but it can only be of secondary significance. What seems more rational to us is an analysis that includes in the essence of a bank what it does and how this distinguishes it from other institutions and therefore makes it a bank as such as distinct from other financial institutions. Unfortunately, our previous research on banks was not as deep as we would have liked. Let us recall that it was linked to the understanding of the bank as part of the state apparatus, of a particular superstructure. Hence--the more banks there were, the greater the costs of administration and the more national income that was eaten up. Such an understanding was justified to a certain degree. Society and the banks lived with a different kind of measurement, interbank competition did not exist and could not under the conditions where the spheres of activity of numerous credit institutions were divided up and essentially there was mandatory "registration"--assigning each client to a particular bank. The market changes the position of the bank. It forces banks to work not with resources obtained from above through distribution but on the basis of its own capital and largely on the basis of what it has managed to collect from its clients. Under the conditions of the market the productive nature of banking activity is manifested more clearly. The bank creates its own specific product in the form of means of payment and traditional and nontraditional services, without which it is impossible to maintain or accelerate production and circulation. The bank inevitably becomes part of the base of society and creates a certain increase in gross product and national income. The concept of a "bank" thus goes beyond the framework of the purely theoretical debate. Unless this concept is defined correctly we cannot defend the interests of depositors or correctly conduct tax policy regarding banks and we open up the possibility for nonbank institutions to unjustifiably acquire the status of a bank. In our view, the productive character of banking activity gives us every justification to depart from the old representatives [as published] and inevitably leads us to a definition of a "bank" as a basic element--as a special enterprise. This is demonstrated by international experience as well. In the modern legislation of a number of developed countries (Germany, France, and others) the bank is described precisely as an enterprise. There is also other evidence of this which may be indirect but is nonetheless important. It is no accident that according to generally accepted ideas the bank is characterized as an independent autonomously financed legal entity, and many normative documents regarding the bank and the enterprise proceed from the same principles and provisions (inclusion of expenditures in production cost, taxation, etc.). Let us assume that the concept "banks" in the Law "On Banks and Banking Activity" can be defined as follows (two versions): 1. "A bank is an enterprise that engages in the emission of means of payment on a credit basis, cash settlement services for clients, and accumulation and distribution of monetary means on the basis of repayment and interest payment." 2. "A bank is an enterprise that produces a specific product in the form of emission of means of payment, organization of settlements, accumulation of resources, and their distribution based on principles of recoverability." It is no accident that we began by speaking about one of the banking laws. The fact is that it is precisely at this time, as has been noted repeatedly in the Russian press, that at various levels, including in the banking subcommittee of the State Duma, there is discussion of a new redaction of two main banking laws. The existing Laws "On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation" and "On Banks and Banking Activity" unfortunately contradict certain provisions of the new Constitution of the Russian Federation, the Civil Code, and the Fundamentals of Civil Legislation. Some of their articles are obsolete and require development. The Law "On Banks and Banking Activity" should not merely define what a bank is, but correctly reflect the types of banks. As we know, functioning in Russian practice are not only commercial but also investment, innovation, savings, mortgage, authorized, and municipal banks. Unfortunately, existing legislation does not make it possible to strictly determine the list of operations they have the right to perform while considering the interests of the depositors. All these banks strive to be universal commercial banks, which in principle should not be the case from the standpoint of protection of savings and deposits of the clients. A number of Russian banks have ended up in the role of "puppet" banks, held captive by the stockholders. Wanting to gratify their stockholders and finding themselves dependent on them, a number of Russian banks invest their own and attracted funds in the economies of stockholding enterprises, helping them, and they increase the risk of defaulting on credit payments and essentially place themselves in a position of potential bankruptcy. None of these cases are described in existing legislation and they require concretization and development. This pertains also to such an apparently inoffensive concept as "credit institution." It was no accident that it appeared in the drafts of new banking legislation. The fact is that in the banking market there is a group of financial institutions which have been granted the status of bank although essentially that is not what they are since they do not simultaneously perform the three mandatory operations (deposit, credit, and settlement), which provide justification for considering them banks (according to international standards it is thought that it is this sign of simultaneously performing the three traditional banking services that provides grounds for including one institution or another in the category of bank). The term "credit institutions" introduced in the draft of new banking legislation is improper since it does not separate nonbanks from authentic banks, which mainly act as large credit institutions. Moreover, although it is incorrect to call these "special financial institutions," that is what they are called in banking legislation of a number of Western countries. For banking legislation it is of principal importance not only to more completely designate the system of banks and determine the boundaries of the activity of each type but also to determine their social significance. It is known that in the consciousness of modern Russian society banks are perceived not only as a real economic force that accumulates immense monetary wealth and is called upon to serve the economic needs of the national economy and nourish the economy with additional "energy" resources. In the awareness of a fairly broad segment of people banks are associated with speculators, shopkeepers, money lenders, and bribetakers who are concerned only about their own advantage. The idea that "banks are for the rich and not for the poor" with all the antagonism instilled by decades will be present for a long time to come in the awareness of simple people, essentially keeping both them themselves from saving at least part of what they have in modern life, ravished by inflation and political instability, and the banks from prospering, for the latter can prosper only if the people are wealthy and are motivated to save. To be fair, we must not fail to note that certain banks provide reasons for a negative assessment of their role in society. Being commercial in essence and working according to the principle of profitable management (that and no other), through their activity the banks contribute to the acquisition of profit by the clients and hence to their own profit. The appetites of certain banks, however, turn out to be too hefty, their "grasping" reflex becomes apparent, and it surpasses their concern for the common good. Banking legislation creates no barriers for restraint here. Taking into account the idea that is developing in Russian society of banks as purely commercial structures supposedly striving for their own exclusive advantage and also keeping in mind the actual existence of certain banks with these kinds of reflexes, it would be expedient, in our view, to include the following important provision in the law: "The bank as an enterprise, being a social institution and representing generally accepted interests, is called upon to provide for the economic and social development of society." Of course we are far from thinking that all bankers will become good boys and stop shifting all their risk to the shoulders of the clients; this will not happen directly or immediately, but it will be strictly established, if you will, that there is a legal and moral norm which no bank generated by the interests of society and called upon to contribute to the satisfaction of these interests will have the right to forget. This provision goes beyond being a declaration and should be reinforced by concrete legislative measures. Thus it would be expedient, in our view, legislatively to restrict the proportion of interbank credit (except for centralized) in the overall volume of attracted resources of commercial agents. This will create incentives for expanding the clientele of commercial banks, which is possible only on the basis of radical improvement of the quality of the services granted and their diversity. It could be extremely useful to have a special code for the banker, which would determine his behavior in the capital market and constantly assert the idea that work for the sake of the client's profit is the most advantageous and profitable kind of commercial activity, and that "fleecing people," conversely, is the most disadvantageous operation for the banker. Among the conceptual issues we discussed previously is the understanding of the essence, functions, and role of the Central Bank. Let us try to figure these out in greater detail. According to our estimates (and also the estimates of Western experts) the load on the Central Bank of the Russian Federation as an institution for financing exceeds its actual capabilities. In industrially developed countries the proportion of assets of the Central Bank in the assets of the banking system does not exceed 15 percent (and there is even a tendency toward reduction), while in Russia this indicator is no less than 50 percent. The burden on credit as a whole as a source for making expenditures is at its limits. Centralized credit, including the one-third granted to banks of Russia to cover the federal budget deficit (not including a considerable proportion of the government expenditures also covered by credit), is ready to blow up the money supply and undermine the already weak incentives for growth of production and increase of the productivity of public labor. It is in this connection that it is important to figure out what they are and what functions and purposes they have. The paradox of modern banking practice is that neither in theory nor in existing banking legislation are these fundamental concepts applied to the activity of the Central Bank of Russia, nor are they clearly defined. The authors of the new draft Law "On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation" proceed from the previous idea of the Central Bank as the only emission center. Such an interpretation is more typical of a strictly centralized system and does not correspond to accepted universal practice of issuing money that is being practiced currently in Russia whereby a multitude of economic entities have the right to issue stocks, bonds, bills, and other securities and means of payment. In modern practice, in various kinds of publications and also in banking laws themselves, the concept of "functions of the bank" is used fairly frequently. It subsequently turns out that the function of the bank is equated with its operations, but this is something altogether different. Banking legislation still has to define what the function of the bank is and what its operations and tasks are. It seems to us that within the framework of the new redaction of the Law "On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation" its content could be defined as follows: "The Central Bank of the Russian Federation is the emission center for the Russian Federation which is granted the exclusive right to put state bank notes and metal coins into circulation." The functions of the Bank of Russia should include: 1) regulation of monetary-credit relations; 2) oversight of the activity of commercial banks; 3) analytical-informational activity. It is important both in practice and in legislation more clearly to articulate the idea of the special political responsibility of the Central Bank. Unfortunately, we have confused two things here: The superfluous political battle which the Central Bank waged of its own accord or by coercion, and its responsibility for political stability in society. While the former aspect of the bank's activity is worthy of sympathy and discussion, the latter circumstance in inevitable, because whether the Central Bank likes it or not, one way or another its monetary instruments bear a political load. Everyone knows that withholding the payment of wages to workers and employees through the fault of the Bank of Russia (for example, in the summer of 1992) caused severe social conflicts. Poor protection of the monetary units from forgery and theft in the form of false notes had a direct effect not only on the incomes of the state but also on the deposits of the banks which, as a result of these thefts, ended up on the verge of bankruptcy. And the very instrument of the monetary and credit policy and the fight against inflation are capable of causing significant social consequences. In our view it would be more correct in the Law "On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation," having reflected this circumstance, to write that "within the framework of the economic policy that is being conducted the Central Bank of Russia is responsible for political stability in society." Within the framework of the regulatory function performed by the Central Bank it is important to determine unequivocally that it does not perform operations for serving clients (neither through its territorial administrations nor through the excessively bloated network of cash settlement centers, a significant proportion of which need to be transformed into purely commercial credit institutions). A certain amount of regulation is also needed with the oversight function of the Central Bank. It is known that the stability of the banking system depends on how well this is performed. It is precisely for purposes of increasing the role of this kind of activity of the emission bank that it is more expedient to separate it in the form of a social state department under the jurisdiction of the Bank of Russia. Unfortunately, the analytical-informational function of the Central Bank has almost not been designated in legislation and is clearly in need of improvement in terms of content. The Bank of Russia should provide analysis of the monetary-credit sector, payment discipline, the dynamics of prices and savings, prognostication of the development of monetary-credit relations in the country, and on a regular basis publish information about the condition of the money supply and the payment condition of the state and branches of the national economy. On the whole, we are inclined to think that the most important thing in the reform of the Central Bank of Russia should be not so much renovation of its management structures as maintenance of its activity. Whether the Central Bank will be constructed according to the American model (Federal Reserve System) or the German model (Bundesbank) is, as they say, of little importance. Both the German and the American models deserve respect not because of their particularity, the exclusive features of their construction, but because of their content, their smooth operation, their analytical potential, a particular monetary view, and their evaluation of the development of production. The formation of the National Banking Council of Russia as an organ not under but over the Central Bank should help in the matter of restructuring the banking system. The National Banking Council should include representatives of state power, the Bank of Russia, commercial banks, the national economy, trade unions, and the scholarly community. The purpose of this Council is to consolidate the interests of the Bank of Russia, the national economy, the government, and the banking community as a whole, to develop recommendations for the Central Bank of Russia concerning strategic issues in the development of the banking system and the most crucial current problems of monetary-credit regulation and the development of a legislative and normative base, and to work out a policy for interaction between the Russian and the world banking systems in financing state programs for the development of the country's economy (including the private sector) and a number of other fundamental decisions. This Council could also take on functions of coordinating research problems of banking, international relations, and programs for reconstruction of the Russian banking system and inform the country's president and State Duma in periodical reports on the condition of the monetary-credit system. Decisions of the Council as the national organ for the Central Bank of Russia could be an essential aid in implementing the general program for transforming the banking sector. An important direction for the reform of the Central Bank is to increase its role in the formation of the banking infrastructure, providing for reliability, stability, and viability of the banking system and protection of the interests of the depositors. The banking infrastructure includes the development of legal foundations and methodological and scientific support, the development of bookkeeping and auditing, the formation of structures providing ratings of banks and their clients, training and retraining of personnel, etc. Unfortunately, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation has organized all these structures poorly and their condition gives cause for serious alarm. As was already noted, Russia really has no banking system because it lacks, among other things, this most important element, without which the concept of a banking system is given a literary, prosaic, but not strictly defined scientific interpretation. In order to form a banking infrastructure it is necessary: --to step up the work for creating methodological support for the activity of banks (regulations, instructions, and methodological and practical aids); --to form on a joint-stock basis a Fund for the Development of Basic Research and Modern Banking Technology; --to develop a plan for priority research in the area of banking; --to form analytical consultation firms with a banking profile as parts of the Central Bank of Russia and independent founders; --to prepare a program for extensive on-the-job training of Russian economists in Western banks and banking scientific centers; --to form a permanent international work group of experts working on problems of regulating banking in Russia; --to draw up a state program for the development of training and retraining of personnel with a financial-banking profile; --to form a network of certified educational institutions providing for continuous personnel training; --on the scale of the country, to develop a system of training and retraining teaching personnel for educational institutions and replacing scientific cadres; --to set up a system of information support, including a rating system for evaluating the activity of banks and their clients (on the basis of special agencies and joint-stock companies and the creation of rating information), publication of archive and contemporary statistical materials on the condition of banking in the country, etc. It is necessary to establish the responsibility of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation for the creation of a system for insuring deposits and other systems providing for stability of the functioning of banks and the preservation of confidence in them. It seems that insuring deposits and investments (especially of the population) should be organized on a centralized basis, creating for this purpose a "Specialized State Centralized Fund for Insurance of Investments and Deposits." In order to complete the formation of the banking system of Russia there will be a considerable amount of work for improving banking legislation. In such cases everything is usually reduced to amendments to the two existing Laws "On Banks and Banking Activity" and "On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation." Actually a new redaction of them is needed and it is also necessary to update and augment information on a number of important issues we have already discussed as well as other, no less essential ones that have to do with licensing commercial banks, relations between the Central Bank and the legislative and executive branches, etc. But it is not just a matter of these amendments and additions. The modern banking legislative base is fairly limited, it does not encompass the entire banking sector and therefore requires essential expansion. Russia still has to adopt and implement a legislative program which includes not only a new redaction of existing laws but also a package of other laws, including: "On Organization of Oversight of the Activity of Banks and Special Financial Institutions," "On Bank Holding Companies," "On Procedure for the Activity of Foreign and Joint Banks on the Territory of the Russian Federation," "On Equal Opportunities and Protection of the Interests of Depositors, Borrowers, and Other Categories of Banks and Special Financial Institutions," "On Savings and Loan Institutions," "On Foundations of the Structure of the Credit System of Russia and Credit Operations," "On Mortgage Banks," "On Bank Secrets," "On Securities and the Stock Exchange in the Russian Federation," "On Financial Companies," "On the System of Insurance in the Russian Federation," etc. A separate discussion should be devoted to the system of Russian commercial banks, including normatives for regulating their activity, expansion of the network, strengthening of the capital base, and conditions and measures for gradually including Russian banks in the world banking community. But that is the subject for a separate discussion.
