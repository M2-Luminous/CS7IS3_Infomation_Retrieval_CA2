The issue was clouded by the Russian General Staff Operations Directorate and Border Guard Troops High Command, which flatly denied the existence of such a directive, although the Far East Military District commander confirmed the report in a confidential conversation. Our sources in the Defense Ministry did not deny the existence of the directive, but stressed that it is not a question of withdrawing Border Guard Troops but of preparing a schedule for withdrawing troops in the event of "unforeseen circumstances." The question of whether the decision to hand over the islands to Japan can be classed as "unforeseen circumstances" remained unanswered. It was approximately in this form that the "sensation" started making the rounds in the pages of the Western press. Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, has now officially confirmed Ilyukhin's report. Since Cold War times a machinegun-artillery division has been stationed on the South Kurils, and it is this to which the president's directive evidently refers. A scandalous interpretation could have been avoided had the directive been immediately followed by explanations. Although one can understand the Defense Ministry -- it is too "hot" a topic. The only deep-water strait which is a nuclear-powered submarine channel is located in the area of the South Kurils.
