FR941125-2-00074 FR941125-2-00055 [FRL&hyph;5111&hyph;8] North Dakota; Adequacy Determination of the State's Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (Region VIII). ACTION: Notice of tentative determination on application of the State of North Dakota for full program adequacy determination, public comment period, and public hearing. SUMMARY: Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or conditionally exempt small quantity generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). Section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing the State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will allow both States and Tribes to apply for and receive approval of a partial permit program. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal Criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLFs. The State of North Dakota applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed North Dakota's MSWLF application and made a tentative determination that all portions of the State's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. The State has revised the remainder of its permit program to assure complete compliance with the revised Federal Criteria and gain full program approval. North Dakota's application for full program adequacy is available for public review and comment. Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of people express interest in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact given below within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on the date given in the DATES section. The Region will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it decides to hold the hearing. In addition, anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section. DATES: All comments on North Dakota's application for a determination of adequacy must be received by the close of business on January 12, 1995. The public hearing is tentatively scheduled for 10 a.m. to 12 p.m., January 12, 1995, at the North Dakota State Department of Health Environmental Training Center, 2639 East Main Avenue, Bismarck, North Dakota 58501. Should a public hearing be held, EPA may limit oral testimony to five minutes per speaker, depending on the number of commenters. Commenters presenting oral testimony must also submit their comments in writing by close of business on January 12, 1995. The hearing may adjourn earlier than 12 noon if all of the speakers deliver their comments before that hour. North Dakota will participate in the public hearing held by EPA on this subject. ADDRESSES: All written comments should be sent to Gerald Allen (8HWM&hyph;WM), Waste Management Branch, U.S. EPA Region VIII, 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2466.
