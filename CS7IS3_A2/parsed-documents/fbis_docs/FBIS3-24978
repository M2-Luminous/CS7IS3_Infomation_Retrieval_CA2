The designation of ambassadors will be done through diplomatic channels. The agreement was signed in Taipei on 2 February, corresponding to the second day of the second month of the [word indistinct] year of the Republic of China. It was signed for the Government of Burkina Faso by External Relations Minister Thomas Sanon and for the Government of the Republic of China by acting Foreign Minister Chin-Yen Fang. In line with the resumption of diplomatic relations between Ouagadougou and Taipei, the Burkinabe Government has issued a statement, which is read here by Theodore Kilimite Hien, the communications minister and government spokesman: [Hien] Today, 2 February, the Government of Burkina Faso and the Government of the Republic of China, have decided to resume their diplomatic relations which were suspended in 1973. The resumption of relations with the Republic of China is based on the Burkinabe Government's willingness to establish relations and bonds of cooperation with all countries of the world for mutual benefit. At a time when African countries are confronted with terrible economic difficulties that are even threatening national unity, it is imperative for Burkina Faso to widen the circle of her friendship and to find partners in every part of the world, who are willing to support her development efforts in a continuous manner. By resuming normal relations with Taipei, the Burkinabe Government has obtained the assurance from the Republic of China that it will help our country on its path toward achieving progress through the following channels: Self-sufficiency in food production through a special agricultural development program, namely rice and soya bean production, the promotion of the informal sector, the reduction of unemployment, the revamping of youth employment schemes, the development and improvement of the health sector, and the building of a sports infrastructure, including the construction of a sports complex in Bobo Dioulasso and a sports stadium in Ouagadougou. This initial program will be pursued through a wider range of operations in the future. In resuming relations with Taipei, the Burkinabe Government remains faithful to the fundamental option of its external policy, which is based on realistic views and adjustment to the changes that are now marking international society. It is in line with the same policy of loyalty that Burkina Faso hereby reaffirms its willingness to maintain, to pursue, and to consolidate its relations with the People's Republic of China. Signed in Ouagadougou on 2 February 1994.
