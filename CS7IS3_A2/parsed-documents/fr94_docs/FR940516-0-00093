FR940516-0-00093 FR940516-0-00030 Response: Information about the average height of fish in a bin is a critical element in volumetric estimates of groundfish catch weight. NMFS believes that processor vessel operators must provide the appropriate viewing ports or windows, bin lighting, and readable markings in order to provide the observer with the opportunity to make an estimate of the average height of fish in the bin that is as accurate as possible. Comment 8: Marking all internal walls of a bin may result in less accurate estimates of the height of fish in the bin than could be obtained by marking fewer walls. For example, if all markings in a bin with more than four walls were used to calculate a simple average of the height of fish in the bin, the procedure would skew the height estimate toward the part of the bin with the most marked walls. Response: The accuracy of the estimates of height of fish in a bin is based on the procedure used by the observer to determine average height and not necessarily on the number of marked walls. Identifying the sides of the bin that would always provide the best information to observers is difficult, because the surface of the fish in the bin is often not level or smooth due to the trim of the vessel or other reasons. NMFS believes that the requirement to mark all internal sides of the bins provides the maximum amount of reference points for an observer. Observers will use as much information as is available to determine the average height of fish in a bin, but they will not be instructed to calculate a simple average of the height of fish at each marked wall for reasons suggested in the letter of comment. The rule requires that vessel operators submit certification documents prepared by an authorized, independent agent who measured the bins, witnessed the location of the marks, and calculated the volume of the bin associated with each set of marks. Instructions or recommendations from the certifying agent to estimate properly the average height of fish in the bin, or to use height-to-volume conversion tables, would improve the reliability of the volumetric estimates. Comment 9: It is not necessary to mark the inside of the bin wall that contains the viewing port or window, because the observer cannot see these marks from outside the bin. Response: NMFS agrees that, for some bins, an observer would not be able to see the marks on the bin wall that contains the viewing port. However, in other cases, the observer can look inside the bin from the viewing port and see the level of fish against the wall that contains the viewing port, thereby increasing the accuracy of the estimated average height of fish in the bin. NMFS prefers one standard for all bins used for volumetric estimates. NMFS will continue to require markings on all internal walls of the bin, but will not require that the markings on the side of the bin that contains the viewing port or window be readable from the outside of the bin. Comment 10: Ultrasonic bin level sensors (bin sensors) should be considered as an alternative to determine the average height of fish in bins that are not visually accessible. Response: Bin sensors employ transducers installed in the overhead of the bin to measure the distance from the top of the bin to the surface of the fish in the bin. The transducers determine distance by ``sounding'' or measuring the amount of time it takes for an ultrasonic sound wave to travel from the transducer to the surface of the fish. The average height of fish could be estimated by locating transducers in several places throughout a bin. NMFS has two concerns about the use of bin sensors. First, the appropriate number of transducers, location of the transducers, and direction in which they are pointed are important determinants of the accuracy of the information provided from the bin sensors. The appropriate system design depends on the configuration of the individual bin, the way fish are loaded into the bin, and the distribution of fish once inside the bin. Developing regulations that would specify a general system design applicable to all bins would be difficult. Also, NMFS does not have the resources to review and evaluate system designs for individual bins or to work with the industry to develop the appropriate configuration for individual bins. The second, and more serious, concern relates to NMFS' ability to monitor both the initial calibration of the bin sensors and their use aboard the processor vessel to determine the level of fish in a bin. One mothership in the Alaska groundfish fisheries currently uses bin sensors to make volumetric estimates of the groundfish catch delivered by catcher vessels. However, these bin sensors are installed in fish receiving bins that have markings on the internal sides of the bins that can be seen from outside the bin. In this case, there is little difficulty in verifying the readings of the bin sensors.
