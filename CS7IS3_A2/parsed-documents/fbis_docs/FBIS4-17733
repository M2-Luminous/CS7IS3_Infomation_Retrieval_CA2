The main argument in favour of this rather unusual decision was that Zhirinovskiy's "intuition has never let him down in such cases". In turn, Zhirinovskiy said that he will take the final decision on Thursday morning (the date scheduled for a ceremony of signing the accord) "maybe after consulting" his party leadership. The LDPR faction expressed doubt that Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin has the right to sign the memorandum on behalf of the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament. The faction is going to submit their doubts for Duma's consideration on Wednesday.
