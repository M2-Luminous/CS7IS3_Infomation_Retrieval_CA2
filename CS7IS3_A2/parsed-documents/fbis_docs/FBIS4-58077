Brothers and sons, members and fighters of the 3d Armored Brigade in the unity state: With deep sorrow and pain, we ask God to have mercy on our righteous martyrs, our beloved sons. We ask God not to forgive those who hatched out this suicidal conspiracy among the comrades in arms, among the Armed Forces members. You are the nation's vanguards. You became the vanguards of Yemeni unity when you supported the political decision as it was announced on 22 May 1990. Had it not been for the insistence of the fighters in the Yemeni Armed Forces in what was formerly known as the southern and northern parts of the homeland, unity would not have been attained. Had it not been for the insistence of the fighters and the pro-unity members in the Armed Forces in what used to be called the two parts of Yemen before 22 May, unity would not have been achieved. We know the irresponsible, treacherous, and political designs under which our people, sons, and colleagues in the southern governorates have been erroneously mobilized and how they [the south Yemeni leaders] would govern Yemen in their own way, on the basis of Marxist ideology. They have thus instilled false ideologies in the minds of our Arab and Muslim people and said Yemen would be governed by the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership, which has not respected what we agreed to on 30 November and 22 May when it found itself on the verge of falling in the wake of the collapse of the Socialist bloc. I went to heroic Aden to meet with our unionist colleagues. Some of the YSP leaders have gone back on their stands and retreated due to the mistaken calculations that unity would be achieved and [words indistinct] the two parts of Yemen, this united Yemen with our Marxist ideologies in spite of the collapse of the Socialist bloc. They did not learn from their adventures in 1972, and 1979 when they tried to fabricate fighting among the comrades in arms, among the Armed Forces members. They did not learn. The best proof of this is the suicidal operation which took place in the 'Imran camp where they received false information, and they became certain that they should disengage the Armed Forces members and that the 3d Armored Brigade, those heroes, my sons, and brothers would attack their colleagues in the 1st Brigade. They then planned to act through the elements they had sent to topple the republican regime, the regime of the unity state in Sanaa. The brigade was to have left for Sanaa. As proof of this we see that when unity was achieved the YSP insisted on sending the best fighters to Sanaa. We agreed to this if this would secure unity and reassure the YSP leaders. As you know, the party has become accustomed to carrying out attacks every four or five years. We remember 13 January. We remember the [word indistinct] incidents]. We also remember the [word indistinct] incidents. In all these incidents, people were killed and blood was shed. I hold the officers, NCO's, and soldiers responsible. They should tell the facts, fear only God, and tell the Yemeni people the truth about how the party falsely mobilized them. This is an adventure [word indistinct] in a losing battle between you and your colleagues in the 1st Brigade. Only the homeland's enemies benefit from it. [Words indistinct] in whose interest is this, who wins from this? Who [words indistinct] crisis and who has tried to bring back the homeland to the pre-22 May era? This scheme is aimed at getting rid of you because you are the fighters. As for the politicians, they are now depositing their money in European banks. They are depositing the money they received as a price for the crisis and the martyrs. They are depositing the money in European banks and we are today paying the price. People were killed in 'Imran. They want to see people killed in Abyan and Lahij. Was this insufficient? Will the Armed Forces learn the lesson? [Words indistinct] I do not blame you at all and you bear no responsibility. This is the responsibility of those who received the price of the blood of martyrs and Army hardware. You are not at all to blame; it was the fault of wrong mobilization, the fault of the secessionist elements that want to restore the pre-22 May situation so they can assume power while raising the slogan of power or death. Pure blood, the blood of strugglers who carried out the 14 October revolution, and who fought in 'Ayban, Madir, and al-Mahabishah in defense of the republican regime. Today, they (?come) and say that you are besieged and you were praying in one mosque, living in the same barracks, and eating together. But classifying people as northerners and southerners or Congress members was wrong. I hold you, especially the officers, responsible for this. Let them tell us the truth, what is the secret behind this classification? Let us hear the plain facts. Now 'Ali Salim al-Bid is contacting the outside world saying the 3d Brigade is still fighting and that [words indistinct] its hardware and soldiers. Is it like this? Have you not [words indistinct] with each other? [crowd shouts "yes"] He contacts the outside world [words indistinct]. I am sure that you extended first aid to each other. You aided the 1st Brigade personnel and vice versa. You were made to fight each other but you aided each other. Is this not true? [crowd shouts "yes"] This is because you are comrades in arms and [words indistinct], everyone of you regrets what happened to him and to his colleagues because those killed were our sons and those who survived are our sons. The Armed Forces should follow constitutional legitimacy represented in the state of unity for those who are unionist in the capital of the state of unity. If the defense minister is indeed a minister of defense for the Republic of Yemen, he must command the army from the Defense Ministry and fight in the army in defense of unity, democracy, security, and stability. The defense minister should not represent only one part of the homeland nor should a chief of staff represent only one part. This is an agreement which we announced and said this is our state and this is our capital and these are our problems. They tried the [East] German president, and Germany, which was a stronghold of socialism, fell. The Soviet Union also fell. The Socialist Party [words indistinct] say may God bless our brothers who rescued us from this quagmire and brought us unity for the sake of security, stability, and democracy [words indistinct] and coexist because we are Muslims, because we are Arabs, because we are brothers [words indistinct] we are one nation. We are a Muslim people who believe in God's book and the traditions of God's prophet, his peace and blessings be upon him. Brothers, sons, and colleagues: My heart is bleeding over what happened in 'Imran. The Socialist Party is imposing a total siege on your colleagues, the comrades in arms, in Abyan, and on your colleagues in (Zirwahah) and your brothers in Aden. Have we besieged any unit in the northern governorates? No. The general escalation [words indistinct]. The officers are not to blame. The blame is on the wrong classification. [Words indistinct] the 14th or the artillery brigades. What happened in 'Imran happened, and we are investigating the incident. The Armed Forces should follow constitutional legitimacy, and not the leadership deviating from constitutional legitimacy. For those who are unionists we say this is the capital of unity and our Armed Forces in Hadhramaut, Shabwah, and every governorate, in Sa'dah, and in Abyan should announce their loyalty to God, the homeland, the revolution, the republic, the Yemeni unity, and the national unity. They should disregard all wrong orders from those who want to implicate the Armed Forces. 'Imran sacrifices are enough. 'Imran martyrs are enough. We consider them martyrs of unity, martyrs of security and stability. Will the Armed Forces be aware of this or not? Accordingly, we will continue to reject the party's orders. Let them come to Sanaa for dialogue and understanding. This is our capital and not the capital of the north only or the south only. This is our capital, Sanaa, and our capital, Aden, and the capital of all (?presidents of the Republic). This is a very mistaken mobilization. I am sure that you (?were besieged) and that your families and fathers are concerned about you. Why are they concerned? They are concerned about you because they believe that, according to the party's practice, anyone who enters a detention camp [words indistinct]. This is the biggest proof of (?13 January) when they used to (?take in batches). Your sons and brothers are afraid. This is true, because they are concerned about you as you may be detained, imprisoned, [word indistinct], tortured, and measures could be taken against them, and, perhaps, they could be liquidated. People [words indistinct] wrong, wrong. In other words, [words indistinct]. It happened between colleagues. Enough, enough [words indistinct]. This is so because no one would benefit from it. However, now everyone [words indistinct] and safeguards his colleague. You are brothers and comrades in arms. Mobilization and [words indistinct] the other party which is standing in trenches and breaching the legitimacy. Brothers and sons, (?do you accept) this ordeal which we are passing through these days? [crowd shouts "no"]. Will our Armned Forecs take a lesson? [crowd shouts "yes"]. I have come to visit you. They say we [words indistinct]. Did you [words indistinct] or did you turn yourselves in? [indistinct shouts ] I came to you [words indistinct] as a father, brother, and colleaque. [Words indistinct] all that happened [words indistinct] these heroes any problem. Today when [words indistinct] the price. This is the truth [words indistinct] from a losing battle to a camp in the capital. This talk should be terminated among the officers and other ranks. We are not [words indistinct], but in the event of any battle the killed and wounded should be evacuated. The elements who enjoyed safety should also be evacuated to safe areas. First of all, I would like to confirm this [words indistinct] I came to you, to visit you, and to tell you: This is your unity. This is your camp. The 3d Brigade exists. What remains of it. Our units are there. You are the army of unity, the army of security and stability. Rely on God and go on leave to visit your families and relatives. This all depends on your conscience. Those who support unity will be supporting honor. Those who support secession... [shouts and applause]. Your tank is there and your artillery is there under the canopy of the unity state. Those who will [word indistinct] will be condemned [shouts and applause). These are your tanks, and your artillery. If we are sincere in what we say, [words indistinct] all your losses. There is no danger on you in the battle. I will pay for them. I will pay all your salaries. I will pay all your indemnities. You will come out with me with your personal weapons to let you regain your prestige. You lost, and the 1st Brigade lost. I will arm you and the 1st Brigade and restore the two brigades' credibility. The other units in the Armed Forces should learn the lesson, that we are waging a losing battle. However, we will be forced to fight to defend unity and democracy and confront the secessionists. We will confront any secessionist [applause]. Now, what are we doing? We are [words indistinct] come and besiege the 2d Brigade. The brother chief of staff has been tasked to disburse salaries and to distribute personal weapons to the officer, NCO's, and soldiers. Then, after your return from your leave, we will form a committee comprising officers from the 1st and 3d Brigades to determine material losses incurred by the officers, NCO's, and soldiers in a responsible manner and we will then try to compensate what we can. Some believe that these officers, NCO's, and soldiers will [words indistinct] bring pressure to bear on the YSP leadership to have it not carry out any hostile actions against their colleagues in the (?south). If they carry out any aggression against their colleagues, they will pay a prohibitive price [applause]. They will pay a prohibitive price, and I am sure that you will side with unity and support your colleagues [applause]
