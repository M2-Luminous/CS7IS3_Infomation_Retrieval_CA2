Kolosova, and others] [Text] China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen is due to come to Moscow on Monday [27 June] evening. On Tuesday he is scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. It is not ruled out that Russian President Boris Yeltsin will meet with the Chinese minister as well, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov reported in his interview with Interfax Friday. As he said, the parties will continue preparation for an official visit of Chairman of the People's Republic of China Jiang Zemin scheduled for September. "In addition, it is necessary to coordinate our positions on several sharpest international problems, in particular, to discuss preparation for the first ASEAN forum on security which is to be held late July and which head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Andrey Kozyrev is to attend and the situation on the Korean peninsular," Panov said. He recognized that there are differences in Moscow's an Beijing's approaches towards the Korean problem. "The Chinese count on bilateral contacts. In their opinion, it is more expedient to go "along three roads with four partners" where "three roads" mean bilateral negotiations between North Korea - the United States, North Korea - South Korea, North Korea - IAEA. However, the Chinese do not rule out that it will be necessary to hold an international conference at a certain stage. As far as Russia is concerned, we are not against bilateral relations, however, everyday practice demonstrates that it brings no results. Then why should we become hostages of this form of relations? That's why we persistently call to convene an international conference," Panov said. He does not rule out that in the course of Qian Qichen's visit the parties will touch upon the problem of demarcation of the Russian-Chinese border. He recognized that until now part of the population in the regions bordering China did not understand principles of demarcation. "They even appealed to denounce the 1991 Russian-Chinese agreement which was ratified by the Russian parliament. This is clearly an unrealistic approach," Panov continued. He reported that he had recently visited Khabarovsk and met with its residents. In addition, Genrikh Kireyev, head of the Russian delegation at the negotiations on border issues, made a televised address. "We have presented necessary explanations. As a result, those who wanted to understand the situation perceive it as sober- minded people. But it is difficult to persuade those who want to build local policy on this," Panov said. He reconfirmed that in accordance with the 1991 Russian-Chinese agreement the border will be laid along the fairway of the navigable rivers and in the middle of non-navigable ones. "The thing is that there has been neither any border laid here nor any demarcation. The principle "who is strong he considers that this is his territory" reigns here. Now we start to draw a civilized border, for the first time in the history of the Russian-Chinese relations. - Panov continued. - Naturally, we are to go away from some territories which were occupied by us in the thirties without any notifications and agreements. On the other hand, we shall receive a legal right for other territories." Panov specially stressed that there is no question about "any dramatic concessions." "If there are any concessions, these are concessions to the international law and sound sense," he said. Mentioning the fate of the islands of Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarov which are situated near Khabarovsk, Panov pointed out that they "remain in our possession. There are no doubts about this," he noted. When asked whether the parties would discusses trade-economic cooperation and, in particular, military shipments to China, Panov answered that "they do not stand on the agenda." "These issues were in detail discussed during the recent visit of Premier Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Beijing," he explained.
