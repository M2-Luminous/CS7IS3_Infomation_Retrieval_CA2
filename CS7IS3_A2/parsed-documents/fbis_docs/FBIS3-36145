Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday, Chubays said that "there is a threat to the course of reform, although a potential one." "There is not a single decision of the government which could be regarded as a move to slow down or stop reforms," he said. Chubays stressed that the government will adopt a budget for the first quarter of the year shortly. "Only after that will we be able to understand whether the government is ready to continue the course of reform which was pursued in 1993. It will also become clear whether the government will continue the programme adopted in September 1993," he said. "Only after that can one give a final assessment of the government reshuffle," the vice-premier said. Speaking about his plans for the future, Chubays said that he "intends to bear responsibility for the course of privatisation to the end." "The programme of privatisation continues to develop. According to our programme, bigger and more efficient enterprises will be put on auction in February, March and April," he added. Chubays expressed the confidence that the "programme of privatisation will be implemented in full and within the terms envisaged by the presidential decree."
