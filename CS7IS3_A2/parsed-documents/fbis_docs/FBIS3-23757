Shlyakhtina: "Continuing To Rob the Press and Subscribers, Moscow's Postal Authorities Have Increased the Cost of Delivering Newspapers by More Than Threefold"] [Text] During a recent regularly scheduled round table discussion, journalists from our newspaper and other interested parties were discussing the problem of newspaper distribution. A certain very important person from a ministry, "who had the scholarly look of someone who knows," summarized the views, worries, and outright alarm of subscribers who have been helpless in the face of the market environment that had intruded into their lives: "A subscription is a blessing for everyone. Subscribers are guaranteed each issue; the post office receives money up front, which they can use; and the publisher has permanent readers." It is wonderful that these words are so idyllic, that "everything is so good, oh, beautiful marquise." A subscription is a good thing. It exists now and will exist forever. In actual fact, however, the picture that emerges is not so radiant. Excessive and openly larcenous tariffs, constantly implemented by postal and telecommunications officials, are--as they say--chopping down publications at their roots and even without all this, choking to death the subscriber who can barely make ends meet. As everyone knows, for a long time the cost of delivery has been higher than the cost of the newspapers themselves. Publishers have been forced to make an incredible effort, at times engaging in commercial, rather than creative activities, so that the subscriber would not suffer. Let us remind you that in the subscription campaign that just ended, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA offered its readers a half year subscription for only 600 rubles at a time when the post office announced a nearly fourfold increase in the price of newspaper delivery. We shall not even speak about the postal and telecommunications workers around Moscow, who--as everyone knows--presented a figure that was totally unthinkable, as a result of which the publication office was again forced to place 3,000 rubles in an account for postal and communications employees on behalf of each suscriber around Moscow. This came at a time when newspaper production cost the publisher several hundred million rubles per month. Why, then, do some publishers look for and find sources of revenue, while others just hope that those who are not yet losing money will be "taken" the next time. Can ads be published endlessly, using sponsors' money? What is the solution? First of all, it probably would be worth looking in detail at the calculations; that is, seeing exactly what is included in postal expenses for this new six-month period. In particular, are the wages justified for postal carriers, who incidentally have stopped delivering mail in afternoons and evenings and have only one morning delivery, and even that one is not done the way it should be. As of February 1st, a postman's pay will be somewhat higher than that of a physician, a scientist, or an artist, whose work is no less important, and whose work, of course, takes many hours more than--for example-- a postman's job. It also would not hurt to clarify whether, as a hedge against future increases, funds have been allocated for new delivery prices. That move would be a barrier to postal and communications workers' ability to carry on at least some kind of commercial activity as soon as we start living according to the laws of the market economy. Prices just cannot be increased practically every three months for using the same post office box, nor can postage prices be drastically increased, especially since no additional effort has been expended and delivery of mail has not been speeded up, but on the contrary, slowed down. The main point is, however, that as long as we pattern our present lives exclusively on civilized states that we consider models of capitalism, we should not forget that in those developed and flourishing states the postal system is a government service and is protected in every respect by the governments of those states. In actuality, no matter what one says, the postal service also fulfills a social function in our country by helping people attain their constitutional right to know about everything that is going on in the world. It would be unjust to assert that no one in Moscow understands this. Let us remind you only of the generous impulse of the mayor's office, which clearly foresaw the threat of a drastic decrease in the number of newspaper issues published in Moscow and presented the Moscow Post Office with a subsidy of 100 million rubles. It is true, of course, that the postal and communications workers had to "squeeze" this money out bit by bit; nevertheless, the fact is that they received it. Also there was the order given last March by B. Nikolskiy, first deputy premier of the Moscow government, charging the Directorate of Pricing Policy to look into price increases by the Moscow Post Office of the State Postal Service for delivering periodicals. In addition, he also asked the Finance Department to resolve the issue of subsidized expenses for delivering newspapers during the second half of last year by taking into consideration the inflation factor. Today it is still essential to subsidize our capital's postal service, which has been degraded to the same level as the trade and banking business. If it is not subsidized, in the end all the readers of Moscow's newspapers will suffer because of the intolerably excessive financial burden that they will have to bear.
