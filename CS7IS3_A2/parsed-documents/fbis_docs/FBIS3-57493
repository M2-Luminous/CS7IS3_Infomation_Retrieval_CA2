This fact was supported by two sequential meetings of Andrey Kozyrev with his Azerbaijan and Armenian colleagues. There are all reasons to think that the West has somewhat reduced its peaceful efforts in Nagorno-Karabakh after President Clinton's visit to Moscow. The details of talks held in the multi-storey building on Vosstanie Square remained behind the closed doors. Unexpected may be considered the participation in the summit of Arkadiy Gukasyan, the Nagorno-Karabakh foreign relations minister. He has received the invitation from Kozyrev on his way back from the former Yugoslavia to Stepanakert via Yerevan. By the available information, the Azerbaijani foreign minister Guseynov has remained not completely satisfied with results of his talks with Kozyrev. As told by TURAN news agency, he insisted on unconditioned withdrawal of the Armenian troops from the territory of Azerbaijan, having in mind the Karabakh territory as well. Galina Sidorova, his assistant, told that Guseynov expressed discontent with position of the CIS countries, particularly of Russia, which by his view "does not demonstrate adherence to principles in connection with Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan". TURAN news agency has circulated a report, with reference to the "well-informed source in the Russian Federation Foreign Office", in which the tendencies of Yerevan are stated. According to these statement [as received], Armenia asks Russia to dispose Russian troops along the Azerbaijani-Iranian border, which will make Azerbaijan-cut off Iran-be more agreeable. As refers to the post-war setup in the area of conflict, the same "informed source" has presented the Armenian model according to which Azerbaijan must provide a broad political autonomy to Nagorno-Karabakh, present him Shusha city, and leave inviolable the humanitarian corridor connecting Karabakh with Armenia. The author of this project, according to TURAN, is the President Yeltsin's adviser, the well-known politologist Andranik Mihranyan. However Yerevan did not confirm the truth of this news. In difference to Gasanov, the head of Armenian Foreign Affairs Department Vahan Papazyan thinks that the Moscow summit should be considered as a significant step on a way to prepare the cease-fire agreement. In his interview to NEGA news agency he has emphasized that it is necessary to resume the talks with Azerbaijan. Special concern, by his belief, should create the tendency to internationalize the conflict, since Afghan mujahedins and mercenaries from the former Soviet republics are being involved in the conflict, and arms concentration is increased. Papazyan has emphasized that the balanced approach of Russia to the conflict settlement is completely acceptable for Armenia since it agrees to the documents adopted by the CSCE and approved by the UN Security Council. Russian side intended to organize the meeting between Gasanov and Papazyan, which however failed. Meanwhile, the official Yerevan has revealed restrained attitude to Moscow talks. It would be premature to bind special hopes with these talks, told SNARK one top official of the Armenian Foreign Office. The difficulty is, he explained, to make consistent the opposite positions of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
