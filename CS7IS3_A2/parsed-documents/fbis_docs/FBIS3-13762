JANA's international affairs editor has commented on those reports saying: Such statements have revealed that the American President was under pressures from the Jewish lobby in America. It was the Jews who initiated the Whitewater scandal and they implicated Clinton in it, and because of its repercussions, which have increased his fears for his political future as president, the American President is now trying to side fully with them. However, the victims of such a support will be, without any doubts, the Arabs, as usual. The American President's announcement that he supported the idea of Jerusalem as the united and eternal capital of the Zionist entity was like a new Belfort [name as received] Declaration, through which he who did not own gave to whom who did not deserve. If the American President wanted to give something to the Jews why doesn't he give them his wife, Washington, or New York for example; Jerusalem is an Arab city and he has nothing to with it. JANA's international affairs editor wondered, however: Where the Arabs were, at time they can see that their capitals were being sold to or just given away in order to win the Jews' amity? Where are those who have been singing pan-Arabism, Islam praises, and lifting the banner of martyrdom at a time when they can see Christians showing contempt to their holy places and legitimizing their usurpation by the Jews?. The editor added: The time to sort out who is who has arrived because matters have become clear; any Arab, who stands with America, is an infidel. Arabs ought to carry out Jihad; they have every right to martyrdom for the sake of their land and their rights.
