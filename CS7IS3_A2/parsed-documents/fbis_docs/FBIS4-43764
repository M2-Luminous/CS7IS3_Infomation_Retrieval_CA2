He confirmed claims that the budget deficit has been removed and budget spending is under control. That has inspired hope for the future. However, the hope must be supported by confidence, without which investments and production cannot be increased. According to Atilla's disclosure, the budget deficit, which totaled 51.3 trillion Turkish lira [TL] from January to March 1994, decreased by TL4.3 trillion in April. The situation further improved in May. The budget had a surplus of TL6.3 trillion. Meanwhile, compared with May 1993, tax revenues covered an additional 6 percent of the budget spending in May 1994. However, the footnote in the Finance Ministry's disclosure has caused dissatisfaction. It said that the amount paid for the interest on Turkey's foreign debts in May, which totaled TL6.5 trillion, was not included in the budget spending for that month. That amount should have been included in the calculations because Turkey paid the interest on its debts in cash. Why should the Finance Ministry resort to trickery? Obviously, its objective was to exaggerate its success in reducing the budget deficit. It would still have been successful even if the amount paid for Turkey's foreign debts was included on the balance sheet for May. A deficit of only TL200 billion would have been seen on the balance sheet. Obviously, the trickery was aimed at creating an opportunity for the government to convince the people that its budget incurred a surplus for the first time. That was not necessary. Those who are aware of the situation will not be misled. If the government wished to deceive the people, then that is another matter. However, risking the loss of the people's trust for the sake of undeserved appreciation is a stupid approach.
