FR940712-1-00003 FR940712-1-00001 Under the proposed regulation, the term employee would include all persons, other than special Government employees, employed by the Corporation. Pursuant to the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (P.L. 103&hyph;204), the Corporation is also required to consider the employees of contractors as employees of the Corporation for certain purposes. Therefore, the term employee would include, for purposes of 5 CFR part 2635 and §§3201.103 and 3201.104 of this part, any individual who, pursuant to a contract or any other arrangement, performs functions or activities of the Corporation, under the direct supervision of an officer or employee of the Corporation. The term employee would not include independent contractors who are not deemed to be employees under 12 U.S.C. 1822(f)(1)(B). In the case of members of the Board of Directors, it would include only the three members appointed by the President under 12 U.S.C. 1812(a)(1)(C). The proposed regulation provides a broad definition of the term security which includes an interest in debt or equity instruments such as, for example, stocks, bonds, and commercial paper. However, the term security would not include a deposit account. The term State nonmember bank is a statutory term taken from 12 U.S.C. 1813 and would include all State banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System. The definition of subsidiary was taken from section 3(w) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, codified to 12 U.S.C. 1813(w), and would include all companies owned or controlled directly or indirectly by another company. Section 3201.102␣Extensions of Credit From FDIC-Insured Depository Institutions The proposed rules on extensions of credit from FDIC-insured depository institutions provide the conditions under which certain specified categories of Corporation employees can obtain credit from depository institutions insured by the Corporation. Restrictions on the availability of credit to Corporation employees are necessary for several reasons. First, 5 CFR 2635.403(a) permits the Corporation to prohibit or restrict the acquisition or holding of a financial interest or class of financial interests by Corporation employees, and the spouses and minor children of those employees, when the Corporation has made the determination that the acquisition or holding of such financial interests would cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality and objectivity with which Corporation programs are administered, and 5 CFR 2635.403(c) specifically provides that the term financial interest may include an indebtedness relationship. For purposes of the extensions of credit covered by §3201.102 (a) through (d), the Corporation has made such a determination. These prohibitions and restrictions on employees entering into financial arrangements with institutions over which the Corporation has regulatory and resolution authority are necessary to prevent loss of public confidence in the integrity of the Corporation. In addition, the borrowing prohibition would incorporate the substance of the statutory prohibition at 18 U.S.C. 213 on bank examiners accepting certain loans. Finally, limitations on borrowing from FDIC-insured depository institutions would avoid a high number of employee disqualifications that would have a detrimental effect on the Corporation's administration of its multifaceted responsibilities. Under proposed §3201.102(a), a current or contingent financial obligation of an employee is considered a financial obligation for purposes of the prohibition, disqualification, and retention provisions of proposed §3201.102. A current or contingent financial obligation of a spouse or minor child is attributed to the employee for purposes of this section since the Corporation has determined, pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.403(a), that there is a direct and appropriate nexus between the efficiency of the service and the prohibitions and restrictions in §3201.102 as applied to the spouses and minor children of Corporation employees. Under proposed §3201.102(b), members of the Board of Directors and other Corporation officials who are in top management positions would be prohibited from incurring financial obligations with an institution over which the Corporation has primary Federal supervisory authority or a subsidiary of such an institution. A deputy or an assistant to the Board of Directors or to an individual board member, a covered employee who is an assistant to such deputy or assistant, the director of a Washington office or division (other than the Division of Supervision), and a covered employee immediately subordinate to such a director would be included in the restricted class. The prohibition would not apply to credit extended through an ordinary credit card relationship due to the standardized handling and low credit amounts customary in such relationship. Under §3201.102(c), depository institutions examination staff, including all covered employees assigned to the Division of Supervision, would be prohibited from obtaining credit from an FDIC-insured State nonmember bank, the class of FDIC-insured depository institutions for which the FDIC has primary supervisory responsibility, any subsidiary of such bank, or any person employed by such bank. An exception would be carved out for an ordinary credit card relationship but, for those employees assigned to regional or field offices, the exception would be limited to credit cards offered by FDIC-insured State nonmember banks located outside the employee's region of assignment. The rule, which is substantially the same as 12 CFR 336.16(a), is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 213 which prohibits examiners from accepting credit from institutions which they have examined. Under the proposed rule, an employee would be required to file a report upon obtaining a credit card from a State nonmember bank located outside the employee's region of assignment.
