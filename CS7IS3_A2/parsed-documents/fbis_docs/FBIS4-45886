Fedorov "New Homes for Health-Care Workers"] [Text] Two new health-care facilities have opened. A modern seven-story building was constructed for Municipal Polyclinic 129, which serves residents of the former Bauman district. It is equipped with the latest in medical technology, including ultrasound diagnostic and hydrotherapy equipment and a wonderful stomatological and dental clinic. Since the old building still houses a trauma center, a "steering" committee, and a number of other amenities, Polyclinic 129 can be characterized as a modern medical facility. Muscovites received another gift in the form of a modern Family Planning Center that has individual natal rooms as well as suites where happy mothers can stay with their newborns. It also boasts a natal unit with the latest word in intensive-care equipment. No other natal center in Moscow has one. The Family Planning Center was built in just a year by the Turkish company Enka, which donated its services.
