The scale of issuing state treasury bonds this year is markedly larger than last year, while the period arranged for their issuance is markedly shorter than last year. In the past two months, with the support from the broad masses of the people, issuance of state treasury bonds made satisfactory progress, and many localities saw people competing to buy state treasury bonds. The issuance of state treasury bonds is a good thing which benefits the country and the people, and the issuance of state treasury bonds this year is a big issue which has a bearing on reform, development, and overall stability. In particular, it is of great significance to strengthening macroregulation and control, checking inflation, and ensuring the construction of key projects. Apart from using market methods to strengthen sales, the relevant departments have also adopted many preferential policies and conditions toward the issuance of state treasury bonds to enable investors enjoy benefits; as a result, state treasury bonds have become an important means for the masses to preserve and increase the value of the money in their hands. Therefore, this year's issuance of state treasury bonds has won the enthusiastic support and response of various social quarters in the whole country. Judged from the issuance situation in the last two months, most buyers of state treasury bonds are individuals from the masses, and this shows that the real foundation of the national debt market rests on the broad masses of people. Since this year, the national economy has continued to maintain a good development trend, various reforms have proceeded normally, and the financial and revenue situations are very good, and this has provided a relatively good macro environment for the work of issuing state treasury bonds. This year, governments of various levels have attached great importance to the work of issuing state treasury bonds, and they have organized efforts and exercised leadership effectively; the financial departments of various levels, banks, and relevant organs established the concept of the overall situation, coordinated efforts among themselves, and earnestly organized propaganda and provided many convenient services to the people as they promoted state treasury bonds; and propaganda departments gave active support by launching propaganda, and this was also an important factor contributing to our success. At present, there are only a few days left to the deadline for the issuance of two-year state treasury bonds, and it is only one month to the deadline for the issuance of the three-year bonds. Relevant departments in various localities must make persistent efforts and continue to do solid work in sales and service. Although the plan to issue two-year state treasury bonds has been accomplished ahead of schedule, relevant departments in various localities must continue to meet the needs of units and the masses who want to buy state treasury bonds and continue to run the business of "using the old to change for the new." Because the work of issuing two-year bonds will soon end, purchasing power will change course to the three-year state treasury bonds, therefore, the relevant banks must still adopt effective measures and do a good job in propaganda and service to allow units and the masses to further understand the preferential conditions of the three-year bonds, as well as the function of buying state treasury bonds as a means to preserve and increase the value of their savings. Financial departments at various levels and securities agencies should create conditions for active participation in and assistance to the work of promoting the three-year state treasury bonds, and, through flexible and convenient sales service, meet the need of various social quarters who want to buy state treasury bonds. Through common efforts, this year's plan for the issuance of state treasury bonds will surely be accomplished on schedule.
