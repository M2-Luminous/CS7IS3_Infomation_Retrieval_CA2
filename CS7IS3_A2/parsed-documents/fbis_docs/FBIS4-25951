Such an assessment can apply to both the general political and economic situations and the process of reform and opening initiated by the CPC leadership. The economic construction and in-depth reform are now under way. The 1988 policy of suspending construction projects and rectifying economic order will never be introduced again. The only way out is to restrain this "tiger which has left its den" so that it behaves well. China has got into a crucial position with regard to its diplomacy and its domestic political situation which will either "do China good or harm and determine the CPC's future." The CPC leaders are now applying themselves to working out a suitable strategy to deal with the situation in an attempt to provide stable internal and external environments to enable economic growth to follow a steady upward course. A CPC leader said: Last year witnessed rapid economic growth and great achievements but we should be aware that there are still some difficulties and problems, the main one being too great an amount of investment in fixed assets. Deng Xiaoping has said too rapid economic growth will get us into trouble. The economic growth rate must be appropriate but China's current economic growth rate is too high despite the macrocontrol. There has never before been such a precedent in the world. Some senior CPC leaders recently said that they are most afraid of "three major difficulties" which have led to the precarious situation I have mentioned. The three major difficulties are said to be as follows: "One, excessive capital construction and excessive money supply resulting in inflation; two, the central government has actually relaxed its grip on the shopping basket project and, if we cannot keep the project going, how can ordinary people bear the burden brought about by price increases in nonstaple food? and three, the reform is at a crucial stage and new reform measures must be put into effect but some problems will crop up in the process of reform." Clearly the fact that these three problems have become entangled makes it more difficult to straighten things out. Two Major Principles for Reform and Opening The problems which call for immediate solution are how to carry out unified government decrees, how to achieve concerted action, and how to coordinate the demands and plans of the various central departments and localities for stepping up their own development while promoting reform and opening up. Each usually has its reasons for development, makes its own analysis of the situation, and has its own strengths and special needs. Deng's speech, made during his south China tour, which calls for rapid development, also makes it all the more difficult to achieve full communication between the higher and lower levels and to persuade every unit to keep in step with the central authorities. The CPC policy decisionmaking body has set out, after study, two principles for reform and opening up: First, the reform policy must be in the interests of the majority and second, the reform policy must take into account the tolerance of the majority. The first principle means any reform policy must be beneficial to the majority instead of causing them losses. Though it is impossible for a reform policy to bring a benefit or the same benefit to everyone, it must bring a benefit to the majority. The second principle means the reform policy must be acceptable to the majority. If the policy is unacceptable to the majority, it must not be put into effect because it will certainly meet with a rebuff if it is. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji Calls for Thinking of Danger in Times of Peace Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said: Historical experience has told us we must take actual conditions into account in deciding which reform policies should be introduced first and which ones later and how the reform should be accelerated. The present situation is: First, leaders of the central authorities must keep a cool head and value the historical experience. Second, our present conditions are different from those in 1988. We have put many more reform policies into practice and the people have much greater tolerance. Third, it should be admitted that leaders of a number of localities are prepared for, cherish a hope for, and have demanded deepened and accelerated reform. If all of us can make a concerted effort to crack several hard nuts, we will take an important step forward toward the market economy. However, there are a fair number of problems calling for attention, some of which are even fairly serious and can only be solved with difficulty. For instance, the problem of large and medium state-owned enterprises changing their operating mechanism; the problem of helping many workers gain subsistence; the problem of arousing the peasants' enthusiasm for production; the problem of providing outlets for surplus rural labor; the problem of promoting ideological and cultural progress; the problem of fostering a healthy citizenry; and the problem of maintaining social order. There are also quite a few additional concerns. Thus, we must think of danger in peacetime and must not relax our vigilance in the face of the excellent situation. We must be aware of the existing problems and do our work in a meticulous and sound way. The CPC leadership has really achieved remarkable results in this respect. All unauthorized construction projects, development zones, and stock and futures markets have been closed down. The malpractice of arbitrarily increasing the prices of agricultural, sideline, native, and special products, which easily trigger buying sprees; the various means of raising funds; the setting up of renamed companies; the official racketeering; and smuggling activities were all held in check. The macrocontrol from top to bottom and government decrees were carried out more smoothly than before. Improvements were also made in the tax reform, slowing down economic growth, improving the economic efficiency of state firms, and adjusting investment volume. Stabilizing the Situation and Solving Contradictions When meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir in Beijing in mid-May, CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin especially mentioned the "4 June" incident, stressing that the original verdict of the incident remains unchanged and that a bad thing has been changed into a good thing, namely, the development and stability over the last few years. Jiang, who was personally elevated by Deng as the core of the third generation of the central leadership and who has been in this position for five years, was duty-bound to reiterate Deng's line and major policy decisions to clarify various rumors and misunderstandings. The factors and the three major problems mentioned above have resulted in more social contradictions and destabilizing factors on the mainland such as unemployment in urban and rural areas, the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural prices, price increases, unauthorized charges, white slips as IOU's, debt chains, the big gap between the rich and the poor, disparity in income, social disorder, the splitting up of different social groups, conflicts of interest, controversies, corruption, and unhealthy tendencies in society. However, the CPC leadership has stated with certainty that some destabilizing factors are unavoidable but they will not result in a great turmoil. Uphold the Six Musts and Nevers Principle and Stick to the Main Theme However, the CPC has spared no efforts to bring the situation under control. They have seen to it that the media pay a guiding role and that propaganda and ideological work is subject to and serves the central task, namely, economic development. Ideological work must be subject to economic and political needs. While ideological education cannot solve all problems, it can achieve something. If the authorities make sure that the media plays a good guiding role, it is possible to solve contradictions, undo puzzles, coordinate relations, allay resentment and, thus, create a united, stable, and harmonious society. The CPC has also advanced a "six must's and six never's" principle for the media to follow, namely: One, they must be helpful and never make trouble; two, must stick to the main theme and never "make noises"; three, must take social results into account and never forget all moral honor at the sight of profits; four, must abide by propaganda discipline and never have their own way; five, must "concentrate on the central task" and never "disperse their strength"; and six, must make every effort to carry out the party's policies to the letter and never blow success out of proportion. Again, the CPC authorities have also taken measures to strengthen market control, check price jumps, crack down on speculators. In the meantime, they have continued to improve all facets of public security, check corruption, promote education and strengthen school management, resettle unemployed workers, and energetically support poor areas in the countryside with a view to alleviating contradictions and nipping evil in the bud. Focus on Key Points and Never Surpass Three Economic Targets The CPC leadership is gratified by the economic situation and the results of reform in the first four months of this year. The fiscal, tax, and financial reforms have proceeded normally without a major hitch. The "trend of increasing prices" once seen in the market has been brought under control and prices declined notably in April. The difficulties in agricultural development such as bottlenecks in energy and communications, which present great restrictions on economic growth, and excessive investment, however, remain unsolved. The CPC authorities stressed the need not to surpass the economic targets set by Premier Li Peng in his government work report: One, economic growth rate is to be kept at 9 percent; two, fixed assets investment kept at 1,300 billion yuan; and three, the general index of national retail prices kept within 10 percent. According to these targets, industrial growth is only allowed to hit 11 percent or below. However, China's industrial growth rate in the first quarter was 18 percent and in quite a few areas enterprises are still competing with each other for more and larger projects and greater speed. The 1994 growth rate of fixed assets investment is to be kept at 9 percent but the investment made by state departments and enterprises rose by more than 40 percent during the first quarter and the retail prices in large and medium cities are likely to soar at any moment. Zhu Rongji said: The task of solving major contradictions and problems remains tough. The problems of excessive construction are still there. If this situation continues, it will be harmful to various localities and the whole country. He demanded that various localities and departments think and act in compliance with the central government's major policy decisions, strengthening and improving macrocontrol and taking decisive and effective measures to solve the problem concerning fixed assets investment. A considerable amount of self-provided funds have now exceeded the limit set by the regulations on the sources of self-provided funds, so it is necessary to strictly define and codify the sources of funds. Approval must be obtained before borrowing money abroad and sufficient funds must be provided for the key projects. Four Major Measures for Promoting Agricultural Production According to a source, sufficient funds and human and material resources have been sent to the construction sites of over 100 state key projects and about 1,000 key construction projects. The construction of the following projects is being speeded up in quality: The irrigation works at the Three Gorges and at Xiaolandi on the Huang He; the harnessing of the Huai He and Tai Hu; the Beijing-Jiujiang, Baoji-Zhongwei, Houma-Yueshan, Nanning-Kunming, Hangzhou-Zhuzhou, and other key rail lines; key port projects in Dalian and Shanghai; fiber-optic cables linking Beijing with Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, and Guangzhou and linking Qinghai with Lanzhou and Urumqi; and large coal mines and hydraulic and thermal power plants in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia. The technical transformation in six old major industrial cities, including Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Dalian and Chongqing is being accelerated. The state has decided to inject an additional 15 billion yuan into the six cities to accelerate the adjustment of the industrial product mix, increase their competitiveness, and keep up their strength for further growth. In setting up a modern enterprise system, the central government has decided to proceed from reinvigorating individual enterprises to enlivening all state enterprise; from granting preferential policies to introducing new systems; from carrying out enterprise reform to pressing ahead with the whole project of establishing a socialist market economy; from allowing no state enterprises to go bankrupt to allowing only the best to survive; and from discussing principles and directions to exploring specific measures. More resolute measures favoring agricultural development will be taken. First, increasing investment in agriculture and rural economic development projects; second, increasing the purchasing prices of grain and cotton when new grain goes on sale this year; third, improving the special system for stockpiling reserves; and fourth, setting up the noncommercial agricultural development bank. Expand Relations with Foreign Countries To Increase Influence With "Asia fever" on the rise in the world, China's development has become all the more spectacular. Jiang Zemin said: "China needs the world for its development and vice versa. A stable, developed, and strong China will not make any threats against other countries; rather, it will make greater contributions to peace and development in the world including the Asia-Pacific region." Over the last few years, the CPC has achieved great results in carrying out Deng Xiaoping's omnidirectional diplomacy. In particular, it succeeded in foiling the economic sanctions jointly imposed by seven major countries and thus enabled China to take an active part in international affairs again. China has also increased official contacts, economic cooperation, and cultural exchanges with other countries. Statistics show China has established diplomatic relations with 158 countries to date. Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said: China's relations with neighboring countries have been consolidated in the process of development and the PRC has cemented optimum good-neighborly relations with surrounding countries since its founding. China has strengthened its solidarity and cooperation with the large numbers of developing countries through mutual support and has improved and expanded its cooperative relations on a mutually beneficial basis through dialogues on an equal footing. Since last year, seven members of the CPC Central Committee Standing Committee and other senior party, government, and military leaders have visited many countries and regions around the world to carry out diplomatic activities. State leaders or important political figures from: Major Western countries, including the United States; surrounding and other Asian countries; European and African countries; and Australia have also come to China for a visit. The military has also made much headway in opening itself to the outside world and in establishing ties with its counterparts in foreign countries. Over the last few years the military has received military delegations from over 40 countries and has sent 120 delegations to foreign countries, comprising 1,300 people including the defense minister, the chief of general staff, and high-ranking military officers. The military also exchanged warship visits with foreign countries. Early this year, General Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited Thailand and Indonesia to increase mutual understanding and friendship with ASEAN countries, thus opening a new chapter in China's military diplomacy. Great Achievements in Foreign Trade China has made the most conspicuous achievements in expanding foreign trade and economic relations. These achievements are also unprecedented ones since the CPC gave up the policies of closing itself to international intercourse and self-reliance. Over the last 15 years, China has approved 174,000 foreign-funded projects with the actual use of foreign funds standing at $60 billion. Last year China approved 83,000 foreign-funded projects, up 70 percent from the previous year's figure, with the actual introduction of foreign funds amounting to $25.8 billion, up 130 percent from the previous year's corresponding figure. The five special economic zones, the 14 open coastal cities, the 30 economic and technological development zones, the 13 bonded areas, the New Pudong District in Shanghai, the coastal economic development zones, the capitals of 18 provinces and autonomous regions in the interior, and the 13 cities, counties, and towns along the border, have formed an initial pattern of comprehensive opening up. Last year, China's foreign trade volume hit $195.7 billion, 8.5 times that of 1978, and its trade volume jumped from 32d to 11th place in the table showing each country's trade volume. According to a commentary in the NEW YORK TIMES, from now until the end of this century, China will spend about $560 billion on capital construction. If American businessmen can get one percent of the contracts, this will give hundreds of thousands of jobs to American people. Some people have tried to revoke China's MFN trading status for human rights reasons but this would be "an error of the times" because it would amount to the United States pointing a gun to its own head while announcing that it was going to press the trigger. No Rush in Promoting Democracy The CPC stressed the need to take the initiative in dealing with the human rights issue. China has taken an active part in the publication of the "White Paper on the Human Rights Issue" and in the International Conference on Human Rights held by the United States in Vienna last year, acting as vice chairman of the conference, tabling many proposals to promote global economic cooperation and protect the ecological environment, and endorsing the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action. When visiting northern European countries, Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, said China respects the international community's universal principle on human rights and agrees to the conduct of international dialogues on human rights. This is the first time a core member of the CPC leadership has made such a statement. In the meantime, Li said it is necessary to take into account specific conditions in various countries in applying the universal principle on human rights. China opposes interference in other countries' internal affairs and hopes that various countries will respect each other, increase understanding, agree to disagree, and make progress together. The CPC's diplomatic strategy is based exactly on Deng Xiaoping's instructions: "Two conditions are essential to a successful modernization drive: First, favorable internal conditions, meaning that we must persist in current reform and opening China to the outside world and maintain political stability and unity; second, favorable international conditions, meaning lasting global peace." Deng maintained that China must practice democracy finally but it will not work if we act in haste.
