At a news conference that took place today he told journalists about the expanded session of the collegium of the Ministry of Economics, which has been held. At the collegium, new economic programs were presented that had been drawn up by creative collectives under the leadership of academician Stanislav Shatalin, Yevgeniy Saburov, director of the Center of Information and Social Technologies under the Russian Government, as well as the joint program of Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the Committee for the State Duma's Economic Policy, and Dmitriy Lvov, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Shatalin's program will moreover be presented to the deputies of the State Duma on 10 February. Shokhin thinks that the government should pursue a policy of state control over the prices of monopolists in some sectors of industry. According to the minister, such monopolists as the power generating engineers and the railmen have already started to have an effect on the economy as a whole by raising production tariffs. This is something that the government cannot properly reconcile itself to. Besides this, Shokhin spoke out in favor of reforms in society being socially oriented. In this connection, he noted, some kind of alarm indicators should be worked out that set the maximum admissible state of the economy and, in particular, of the social sphere, the bounds of which one should not overstep. Otherwise the government will lose its control over the economy, he stressed. Shokhin criticized a number of provisions presented in the new economic programs. These were, for example, the striving to freeze the ruble exchange rate, as well as Shatalin's proposal that inflation should be lowered by freezing prices for three to five months. However, Shokhin upheld the proposal that it was necessary for the government to work out more stringent measures for the making of payments and computations with regard to producers. Shokhin mentioned -- as one of the main results of today's discussion -- the mutual desire of all those taking part to form an authoritative commission that would collect the ideas of the government and society's economic elite. The economics minister thinks that quotas may be abolished in the second quarter. This is explained, he added, by the fact that Russian prices are already comparable with world prices in many cases. Shatalin, who took part in the meeting, noted that people were by no means unanimous on all points at the collegium. Those taking part in the discussion, he noted, expressed various points of view on such issues as the pursuing of a social policy, a system of state price regulation, as well as a tax policy.
