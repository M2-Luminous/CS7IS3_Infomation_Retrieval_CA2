In 1993 the total sum of taxes, including the special fund represented 11-12 percent of the national gross product. In 1991, it represented 38 percent; in 1994 it is planned to represent 15 percent-16 percent. The incomes in state budget in 1993 exceeded the expected amount by 4.3 percent. Referring to the big difference between the consumption basket and salaries, she said the budget was calculated taking into the account that the average salary represents 15 lei and that it will gradually rise afterwards each three months. Statistics for November show the average salary represented 63.4 lei for a state apparatus employee, 58.7 lei for transport employee, 84.2 lei for industry employee and 35.5 lei for agroindustrial employee. The minister of finance pleads for improving the remuneration system. "We have to avoid the disbalance between 20 lei at some enterprises and 200 lei at others; this difference has nothing to do with productivity of labour. Perhaps we shall have to reduce the level of remuneration to 25 lei minimum salaries; this system is applied in Japan, Switzerland etc." Claudia Melnic, the only woman in Sangheli cabinet, states: "It is difficult for a woman to stand a 16-18 hour work. I hope the new Parliament appoints a man in this post," concludes the minister of finance.
