FBIS4-2782 "drchi071_n_94028" FBIS-CHI-94-071 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Economic & Agricultural `Green Certificate' Training for Farmers Begins `Green Certificate' Training for Farmers Begins OW0804135594 Beijing XINHUA in English 1315 GMT 8 Apr 94 OW0804135594 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- China launched a green certificate training project today in an ambitious drive to educate millions of its farmers in applied technical theories and expertise in agriculture. The project, set in motion after the approval of the State Council, is designed to incorporate scientific and technological advances with China's agricultural development. "The implementation of the project is in line with establishing a socialist market system in rural China and promoting a high-yield, high-quality and high-efficiency agriculture," said Deputy Agriculture Minister Zhang Yanxi. "It is an undertaking that will be beneficial to the country and the people, to our generation and future generations," he said at a press conference today. The green certificate was referred to as a proof of a farmer's knowledge, expertise and other necessary qualifications for a certain technical job in agriculture. It will normally take two years of successful completion of theoretical as well as practical study in a certain subject before a farmer can be awarded a green certificate, issued by the Agriculture Ministry. But for some specialties, such as plantation and husbandry, the study period will be longer. China has a 430-million-strong rural labor force, out of a total of 900 million rural population. Farmers' poor education in science and technology is regarded as a major obstacle to the development of China's agricultural productivity. The booming of the rural economy calls for a new generation of farmers, better equipped with scientific knowledge and technical expertise, thus necessitating vocational technical training for farmers who have already undergone secondary or high school studies. Initial work for the farmers' green certificate training program began as early as 1990, with experimentation being carried out in 362 counties in 29 provinces and municipalities across China. So far the number of trainees has totalled more than 300,000, over 80,000 of whom have obtained green certificates, according to the Agriculture Ministry. Under the project, about 2 million farmers will be trained to be qualified for the green certificates during the 1990-1995 period. By 2000, an estimated 8 million to 10 million trainees are to become green certificate holders -- which means one for every 20 households in rural China. The green certificate system covers sectors such as plantation, agricultural machinery, management of rural cooperative economy and rural environmental protection. The green certificate holders will be in a better position for contracts and loans, technical instruction, agricultural information and necessary government support. At present less than 40 percent of China's agricultural research results in agriculture can be applied and popularized in the vast countryside. The government has vowed to raise the ratio to 60 percent by the turn of this century. This makes the green certificate system even more meaningful because those trained are expected to bridge the gap between researchers and millions of farmers, Zhang said.
