Expressing its surprise, the UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers] Executive Board is threatening to take action. In the fourth and last point made in a statement released yesterday, UGTA Secretary-General Benhamouda did not mince words: "The UGTA will use all the means in its possession, undertake all legal actions, and take all steps it considers necessary to defend the rights and interests of the workers and their families." His rather harsh statement notes with "surprise" that "the recent increases...have plunged the workers and the public into confusion and worry, all the more since they were announced...just after the national secretariat's meeting with the head of the government," a meeting at which the national secretariat expressed "the union organization's opposition to the preceding decisions to raise the price of certain products, notably diesel oil, the negative consequences of which are inevitable in many sectors of the economy, especially transportation and agriculture." Asserting that it "was not informed at any time or in any way of the successive increases ordered by the government, much less involved in them," the UGTA questions "the real timeliness and significance of the price-raising measures announced the day after the demonstration that was held on 22 March 1994 to protest terrorism and violence and demand the defense of Algeria, whose unity and existence are being threatened by forces hostile to our people." The anger of the union officials is also expressed by the UGTA's National Federation of Public Works and Hydraulics (FNBTPH), which a few days ago held a meeting enlarged to include officials of the union councils in firms in that sector. The communique adopted at the conclusion of that open meeting expresses "surprise" and "calls on the government to reverse its decisions, which do not serve the interests of the country or the citizens." The measures that have been adopted are not the only ones being challenged. Union officials also question the way in which the government went about adopting and announcing them. The UGTA's top official expresses surprise that the measures were announced immediately after the central union's "informal" meeting with the government while also pointing out very clearly that the UGTA had nothing to do with the decisions that were reached. In other words, and this is the meaning of the message, the UGTA did not back the increases, as the timing of the announcement might lead one to think. For its part, the FNBTPH remarks ironically that public opinion was informed not through official channels but through "our respectable television."
