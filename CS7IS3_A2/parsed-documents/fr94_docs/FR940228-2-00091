FR940228-2-00091 FR940228-2-00058 [Release No. 34&hyph;33642; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;17] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating To Initiation of On-Floor Orders in a Stock by Floor Professionals Who Have a Listed Option Position in That Stock February 18, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on March 14, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''` or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change Exchange Rule 96 currently prohibits a member registered as a Competitive Trader 1 or Registered Competitive Market Maker (``RCMM'') 2 from initiating, while on the Floor of the Exchange, the purchase or sale, for his own account or his member organization's account, of any stock in which he has an option position, or in which he knows his firm has an option position. Rule 96 currently applies to all options, including those traded on a national securities exchange (``listed options''). The proposed rule change would remove the prohibition in Rule 96 as to listed options. 1 A Competitive Trader is a NYSE member who is authorized to initiate proprietary transactions on the Floor of the Exchange but who is not registered as a specialist, odd-lot dealer or Registered Competitive Market Maker. See NYSE Rules 111 & 112(e). Competitive Traders exist pursuant to, and must comply with the requirements of, Section 11(a)(1)(G) of the Act. See also SEC Rule 11a1&hyph;1(T). In addition, the NYSE requires that 75 percent of a Competitive Trader's monthly transactions must be stabilizing transactions under the tick-test. See NYSE Rule 112(d). 2 A RCMM is a NYSE member who is authorized to initiate proprietary transactions on the Floor of the Exchange. See NYSE Rule 107. RCMMs are not subject to the same tick-test as Competitive Traders; however, they must comply with a complex series of rules about the price at which they can trade and the size of those trades. Id. Unlike Competitive Traders, RCMMs have an affirmative obligation to maintain a fair and orderly market. See NYSE Rule 109(B)(4). II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose Rule 96 was adopted in the mid-1930's after extensive investigations and public hearings by the Commission concerning manipulative practices and ``pool'' operations involving the use of options. At present, Rule 96 prohibits a member registered as a Competitive Trader or RCMM from initiating, while on the Floor, the purchase or sale, for his own account or his member organization's account, of any stock in which he has an option position, or in which he knows his firm has an option position. Rule 96 does not prohibit a Competitive Trader or RCMM from trading in options; rather, the rule simply provides that such members may not initiate a proprietary trade in a stock on the Floor where they have an option position in the stock. Rule 96 currently applies to all options, including those traded over-the-counter (``OTC options``) and listed options. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to remove the prohibition in Rule 96 as to listed options. Thus, under the proposed rule change, a Competitive Trader or RCMM would be permitted to initiate a proprietary purchase or sale of stock on the Floor where he has a listed option position in that stock, but not where he has an OTC option position in that stock. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is appropriate for three reasons: (1) By removing a restraint on members' initiating transactions on the Floor, the proposed rule change can be expected to add to the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market. (2) Listed options are substantially different from the OTC options which Rule 96 was originally intended to regulate, and any regulatory concerns that might arise as to listed options can be addressed by monitoring and surveillance of revised Rule 96. (3) The proposed rule change will remove a competitive barrier to fair competition, since no other professionals are subject to comparable restrictions.
