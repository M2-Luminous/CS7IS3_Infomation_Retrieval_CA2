Negotiators picked up the talks on the insurance sector, which both sides have said is nearest to resolution, with the American side hinting at compromise. "I gather there's an atmosphere of optimism that we are going to move forward," a U.S. official said of the insurance talks that are to run through Thursday in Tokyo. "The U.S. is going to be more flexible but we're not going to throw everything overboard," said the official who asked not to be named. The American negotiators are sticking to their basic positions but be more open to Japanese suggestions, he said. But Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii has indicated Tokyo has no new offers and both sides were cautious on the immediate prospects. A Japanese official said Wednesday's talks would likely just reconfirm progress made before the bilateral trade "framework" talks ruptured in February over how to gauge progress in opening Japanese markets. Another Japanese official said he did not expect to flesh out Tokyo's proposal to institute an insurance broker system, a key U.S. demand, as a major newspaper reported Wednesday. The U.S. official said, "we'll just have to see how things go in this first round -- whether we move forward or just get stuck." Asked if both sides could wrap up an agreement on insurance in two days, lead U.S. negotiator Ira Wolf, assistant trade representative for Japan and China, smiled and said, "we'll see." The Japanese team is headed by Eisuke Sakakibara, deputy chief of the International Finance Bureau at the Finance Ministry. The trade framework talks broke down Feb. 11, when then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton could not agree on the "objective criteria" called for in the framework accord signed last July. But both sides say the insurance sector -- unlike the other priority areas of government procurement and automobiles and car parts -- are less likely to revert to bickering over whether U.S. demands amount to "numerical targets." Indeed, the U.S. is urging Japan to go slow in opening the foreign-dominated "third sector" of insurance that includes accident, nursing care and disease coverage. A U.S. diplomat said in Tokyo recently that there are problems applying objective market access criteria to heavily regulated areas such as insurance. And a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official said the U.S. agrees such yardsticks are not appropriate for the sector. The two countries are to resume the auto and parts talks Thursday in Washington and the talks on Japanese Government procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications Friday in Tokyo.
