POSCO-huls, an affiliate of Pohang Iron and Steel Co., Lucky-Goldstar Group's Siltron and Poongsan Precision are gearing up to develop silicone wafers and semiconductor lead frames in preparation for mass production of 16 Megabyte Dynamic Random Access (DRAM) memory chips from the second half of the year. POSCO-huls is poised to step up production of its eight-inch wafers to reach annual capacity of 35 million square inches by year-end and 60 million square inches by next year to meet the demand for 16 M-DRAM chips. Predicting the mainstay of semiconductor production will shift to 16 M-DRAM next year from 4 M-DRAM, the company will change its wafer production ratio of 4 M-DRAM and 16 M-DRAM to 4:6 from the current 6:4. Siltron, which concentrates on six-inch wafers making up 4 M-DRAM chips, will make 40 million square inches of eight-inch wafers by late this year so as to localize 90 percent of the material, which is currently more than 50-percent dependent on imports. Poongsan Precision, which succeeded in developing a super-thin lead frame enveloping ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit), will install stamping facilities to mass produce lead frames for 16 M-DRAM chips by the end of this year. Dongbu Steel is reportedly preparing to make polycrystalline silicone from next year since it is ready to begin manufacturing its main material, trichloro-silica.
