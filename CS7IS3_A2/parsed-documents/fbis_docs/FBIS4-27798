Since Prime Minister Hosokawa resigned a half month ago, there have been a series of events such as the nomination of new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to succeed him, the secession of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition regime, and then the formation of a minority ruling coalition cabinet. Gradually, the people in the spectators' seats are beginning to raise boos at this slapstick play. Yet I would like to advise the spectators not to take their eyes off the "reality" now unfolding under their noses. This is because the slapstick play, when viewed from a different angle, may unexpectedly remind them of Wagner's opera The Ring of the Nibelung whose performance takes as long as four days. For example, in this drama Ichiro Ozawa, the strongman and secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], was made an out-and-out villain, and when the SDPJ at last "exhausted its stock of patience" (SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama) and seceded from the government, the party headquarters reportedly received a flood of encouraging calls saying that "I feel refreshed for the first time in a long while." However, with the secession as an impetus, there has burst forth all at once the "political change in June theory"--a view that a no-confidence motion against the cabinet will be presented by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ and that through its passage, the Lower House will be dissolved. What on earth does this theory mean? First, it is clear among others that the "parallel combination formula coupling the small electoral district system with proportional representation," which was approved in the former Hosokawa cabinet, will not be ready for use in June because rezoning is not to be finalized by then, thereby leaving no option but to carry out the general election under the present midsize constituency system. However, what matters here is not simply the use of such a temporary expedient. Let us suppose that lawmakers are elected by winning the people's trust anew under the present medium-size constituency system. Will they ever try to complete the "parallel combination formula" which has been neglected and left unfinished since before the house dissolution? In Nagata-cho people are now openly expressing "the view that the parallel combination formula will have the same fate as the green card [tax identification card]." That is, in the Yasuhiro Nakasone cabinet era, a green card system bill was enacted into law, but it was never enforced and repealed in the face of strong opposition within the LDP. Those people are saying that the "parallel combination formula" will have the same fate. "Political reform" has reached the present stage at length through five years of effort under three regimes--if we begin counting from the Toshiki Kaifu cabinet. It is clear that a heinous scenario designed to bring this achievement to nothing at a stroke has been drawn up by a group aspiring for the return of the "1955 order" [the party system realized in 1955] on the initiative of the LDP and the SDPJ. [passage omitted on Wagner's aforementioned opera and the dramatic end of the Weimar Constitution through Hitler's emergence] What will come next if we leave this "slapstick drama"--filled with insincerity and betrayal and being performed recklessly in total disregard of the people--to take its own course? It is feared that someday these three dramas [the current Japanese political situation, Wagner's opera, and the end of the Weimar Constitution], transcending their different time and space frames, might overlap one another, proving that they have the same catastrophe. Who can guarantee that such a day will never come? The possibility of a joint struggle by the LDP and the SDPJ under a "strategy seeking parliamentary dissolution [and the general election] on the basis of the medium-size constituency" is getting stronger as days go by, although SDPJ Chairman Murayama is hotly denying it. Apart from what he has in mind politically, Rengo [National Confederation of Trade Unions] Chairman Akira Yamagishi, who has actively wrestled with political reform, makes the following remarks: "The SDPJ is saying that it is not bound to items agreed on regarding the coalition government. When occasion demands, it might put forward a no-confidence motion against the cabinet." He has thus begun expressing eagerly the view that it is possible to hold a general election under the medium-size constituency system. Some in the LDP are already predicting the results of the election to be held under the current medium-size constituency. It is said that, according to the predicted election returns, the LDP is certain to secure the current 220 seats and the SDPJ and Shinseito will gain 10 to 20 seats, while the Japan New Party [JNP] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] will suffer a decrease. To be sure, as LDP President Yohei Kono says, former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's individual scandal related to the Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm poses a problem. As SDPJ Chairman Murayama says, the position of "monopolizing politics by the force of numbers" should not be taken lightly. Such a position was symbolized in the formation of "Kaishin" [Innovation], a new parliamentary group, which was forcibly carried out by Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa and others in the current "slapstick drama." However, a far more serious concern is the actual situation marked by "political retrogression" in which the sloppy old structural attributes--which may be linked to the revival of the "1955 order" through the LDP-SDPJ tie-up--have burst forth at a stroke. The Weimar system's collapse was not caused only by the appearance of Hitler. It is pointed out that the largest problem was the posture of intellectuals and others belonging to the political elite who evaded assuming the governing responsibility by solely avoiding "power" or by trying to stand "against power." The SDPJ Diet members are even showing a look of relief because they have returned to their original position as a perpetual opposition where it only has to raise a voice of opposition. When the Hata minority coalition government was inaugurated, LDP President Yohei Kono said: "The coalition government virtually collapsed. It failed in the game of power, and we will not extend a helping hand. A failure is a failure, and we will make a strong protest against the failure." Is there really no problem in such a clumsy manner? [1 May 94 Evening Edition p 1] [Text] Commenting on Jiyuto [Liberal Party] Chairman Koji Kakizawa, who got the post of foreign minister only 10 days after he bolted from the LDP, LDP President Yohei Kono spoke viciously as follows: "He is a man who criticized the coalition government just one month ago at a plenary session of the Diet as an LDP delegate. What is he thinking of the criticism he leveled thus far? I would like to hear his answer to this question." He said this because it was only 7 March that Mr. Kakizawa, in his lower house interpellation, denounced the coalition severely, asking, "How about dissolving the coalition and turning over power to the LDP?" On the same issue, former LDP Secretary General Keizo Obuchi (chairman of the Obuchi faction) made the following cynical remarks: "I will not criticize. It is because they are the kind of people who will return again when the LDP captures power." There is a "difference of temperature in the languages" used by the two. This difference cannot be brushed off as simply the outcome of two different positions--the position of a party president who has to tie up the party in a bundle and the post of a faction chief who is rather carefree. It would have been better if Mr. Kono had not responded and passed the matter with silence. It appears that Mr. Kono does not have a favorable impression of Prime Minister Hata either. Regarding Mr. Hata, who supported the no-confidence motion against the Miyazawa cabinet when a political change took place in the summer of last year, Mr. Kono reportedly says repeatedly that "the person who had served even as finance minister in the Miyazawa cabinet betrayed Prime Minister Miyazawa before his eyes." Mr. Kono stressed a position of confrontation with the new government, saying: "We will not extend a helping hand. A failure is a failure, and we will make a strong protest against the failure." When he said this, I think that his mind was overshadowed by his personal feelings, was it not? Commenting on Mr. Kono's capacity as a leader, former LDP Executive Council Chairman Raizo Matsuno once said: "In hunting wild boars, we need a beater; however, if a man who is supposed to draw a bow plays the role of the beater, we will never get any game." Mr. Kono's seriousness is valuable, but he is hung up on minor details and very suspicious and harbors a grudge against any act of betrayal in the past. With such a character, he would be unable to work as a leader in such turbulent times. This is because he cannot compete favorably with Mr. Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito who has the clear view that "the politics of the era of coalition and alliance is the work of seizing power by obtaining the number of persons required, regardless of their being a little strange or betrayers." At a press conference he held after his inauguration, new Prime Minister Hata, who was compelled to start a minority ruling coalition government due to the SDPJ's secession, touching on the LDP, said that "I would like to ask for cooperation in the policy field." Mr. Kono probably thought that Mr. Hata "sure does take a lot for granted." However, the question is not simply how the ordinary people feel; the seriousness of the situation has been assuming far greater proportions. For example, the new Hata government is now faced with "tax system reform" whose centerpiece is a consumption tax hike. As for this reform, there is utterly no prospect of its legislation even if its bill gets finalized within the ruling camp by June. The Hata government aims to reopen the Japan-U.S. new economic consultations by the time when the summit meeting of advanced countries (the Naples summit) are held in July. However, the U.S. side is insisting on the "continuation of a large tax reduction" as a prerequisite, and rough sailing is inevitable with regard to the talks. In addition, concerning North Korea's nuclear development issue to which Prime Minister Hata and his followers attach the utmost importance, there is no assurance that the Japanese Government can respond swiftly if the situation makes a sudden move toward sanctions by the United Nations. Tax system reform and the North Korean nuclear development issue are questions related exceedingly to the "sovereignty of our state." The deadlock into which the new government fell is not the kind of problem that we can dispose of by simply charging Mr. Ozawa that the deadlock is totally the "natural consequence of misdeeds" stemming from his thoughtlessness. We see herein the irresponsibility of Mr. Ozawa, who plunged the situation straight into confusion without giving deep thought to what will happen if the new parliamentary group "Kaishin" is formed with the SDPJ excluded. However, to put it the other way around, we can note the same irresponsibility by Mr. Kono. What we see here is a lack of "ruling ability and ruling responsibility." The tragedy of Japan at present is the fact that the two major opposition parties called the LDP and the SDPJ, which take pride in their influences as the first and second parties by comparison, are both fallen into a state devoid of "ruling ability and responsibility." Former Chancellor Schmidt who was the leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] once made the following remarks to the SDPJ on the basis of his experiences: 1) the SPD which shifted to a "realistic policy line" in 1959 "acquired compromising techniques" through "coalition" with the then ruling party Christian Democratic Union; 2) "a step-by-step response for the recognition of the actual status is necessary as an immediate measure in carrying out reform"; and 3) "we must learn the profound art of the international power game between the U.S. and Soviet superpowers." The SDPJ achieved "coalition"; however, without learning from Mr. Schmidt's advice, it seceded from the coalition government after eight months. The inside of the SDPJ is overflowing with smiling faces from the refreshing feeling that the party has been released from the "eight-month-long hardship" and "has returned to the seat of opposition." From what has the party escaped? Mr. Masayoshi Takemura (leader of Sakigake [Harbinger]), who left the cabinet a little earlier, expressed his desire to unite all forces within the LDP which are dovish and opposed to constitutional amendments, claiming that he has the "same views" with Mr. Kiichi Miyazawa, Mr. Masaharu Gotoda, and Mr. Kono on the Constitution and the nation. It is needless to say that he gave yells to the SDPJ's secession from the government. The political situation has shifted its axis from the "LDP versus non-LDP" to the "Ichiro Ozawa versus non-Ozawa." However, what on earth is it that is being concealed under the anti-Ozawa banner which asserts that "insincere and high-handed political methods" (party president Kono) and "the fascist way of doing things" (Chairman Tomiichi Murayama) are intolerable? Following the end of the ideological confrontation, groups within the SDPJ such as the citizens' faction and the left-leaning group, trendy leftists, and the faction for pacifism and constitutional defense are forming a congeries of families like a stagnant pool of drifters across the existing political parties. Shaping a large "cold water mass" devoid of the ruling responsibility, they are now going to strike roots in the ground prior to the nation's important decision-making which concerns Japan's survival... with their own "lack of ability to become responsible authorities" concealed.... [2 May 94 Evening Edition p 1] [Text] Commenting on former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka about the time when he was wielding his power as the kingmaker, former Justice Minister Osamu Inaba once told: "Pushkin said that the people who are led by an uncultured politician are unfortunate." If Mr. Inaba were still alive, he would express the same feeling about Shinseito strongman Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, Mr. Tanaka's onetime favorite disciple, who uttered wild words that "it makes no matter which woman one goes to bed with" when the SDPJ stood against the formation of the new parliamentary group "Kaishin." Among ongoing criticisms against Ozawa are "insincere and high-handed political methods," "a straightforward way of thinking devoid of prudence and consideration for the outcome," "the way he does things is bold, but his political technique is immature, resulting in a continuation of failures," and "a lack of grace due to a contempt for women." Each of them is generally right. Yet they are still insufficient to depict the whole image (the reason for existence) of the unique personality of "Ichiro Ozawa," who has appeared at a huge turning point like our present era. Former Deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru, called the "foster parent" of the politician Ichiro Ozawa, used the following expression in describing his own exquisite political skill (quintessence): "It should be used in such a way that when you look like your are beating, you are in fact rubbing, and when you look like you are rubbing, you are indeed beating." This method was crystalized into an "adjustment-oriented careful politics" of former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, a sworn friend of Mr. Kanemaru's. In retrospect, the method represented the Tanaka faction's traditional family art originating in Mr. Tanaka. Then, why has a mutant species or a heterogeneous "devil" like Mr. Ozawa appeared in the chain of people connected with the Tanaka lineage. In the midst of the effort to choose former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's successor, Mr. Ozawa told with a touch of excitement: "The tide of the times cannot be checked. It is flowing faster than I expect." What Mr. Ozawa calls "the tide of the times" is a major prerequisite to turning Japan into "an ordinary nation." The tide means the great political restructuring involving the LDP. Mr. Ozawa was probably excited by the self-awareness that he would have to "lead the tide of the times." Such an "obsession with an idea" is a valuable thing for a political leader at a turning point in history; however, it is also accompanied with a danger in case the political leader mishandles the situation. Nevertheless, I would like to pay attention to Mr. Ozawa's "obsession with an idea" because I can use it as a "coordinate axis" in studying the politician "Ichiro Ozawa" in this article. It is because, when viewed from this angle, "a continuation of failures and the immaturity of political technique" as noted in the Ozawa criticisms may not have great significance for Mr. Ozawa. I say this on the ground that, if necessary for the attainment of the ultimate goal, Mr. Ozawa would possibly opt for "a continuation of failures" rather than for "small achievements." In this sense, Mr. Ozawa's "political immaturity" resembles the "immaturity" peculiar to fundamentalism. This immaturity is also common to fundamentalist Shoin Yoshida who switched the course of a historic turnabout toward the Meiji Restoration. What is interesting about Mr. Ozawa's apparent "fundamentalism" is that it thoroughly pits the image of "a president-type (top-down) leader"--as once advocated by former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone--against the image of "an adjustment-oriented (bottom-up) leader," which was in line with Japan's political principle and upheld by Shin Kanemaru and Noboru Takeshita. This "Japanese political principle versus American rationalism" diagram is a characteristic of all policies and ideals envisaged in Mr. Ozawa's "ordinary nation" theory. That is, fundamental portions of a prescription for realizing the ordinary nation, in fact, overlap the arguments by American rationalists or fundamentalists who are engaged in Japan bashing. The secrets of the politician Ichiro Ozawa's "strongness" lie in his possession by the spirit of rationalism identified with American fundamentalism. Therefore, as long as the United States tenaciously asks Japan to "open its market" and "abolish collusive politics " (finance ministry-led politics), Mr. Ozawa's tenacity for reforming the present status will remain unchanged. Moreover, the reason why Mr. Ozawa can revive each time despite "a continuation of failures" is that international frictions symbolically shown between Japan and the United States constitute an incessant source of energy supply to the type of "fundamentalism" seen in Ichiro Ozawa. However, Mr. Ozawa being viewed as a "fundamentalist" is, of course, not simply because he speaks for European and U.S. rationalism as past modernists did. It is also because he is concealing in his inmost heart the desire to "surpass" rationalism sooner or later. This is why Washington does not stop keeping a vigilant eye on Mr. Ozawa. Among Japanese politicians, no one will perceive with a greater sense of strain than Mr. Ichiro Ozawa the great changes in international politics since the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the Gulf war, whether they are favorable or unfavorable changes. Concerning such political methods by Mr. Ozawa, Former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura (leader of Sakigake) criticizes that "he is a hard-boiled man and does things too hastily." Then, what is Mr. Takemura's view of the times? Mr. Takemura called Mr. Ozawa the advocate of "national rights theory," while calling himself the advocate of "civil rights theory." In a recent television program, there was a scene in which political scientist Masataka Takasaka severely reproved Mr. Takemura for this comparison, saying that "you should not make an ambiguous comparison by using historic conceptions." Mr. Takasaka, perhaps, felt like asking Mr. Takemura if he could understand mental confusions Yukichi Fukuzawa underwent when he had to move from the position of "civil rights theory" to that of "national rights theory" in the face of the Sino-Japanese War. The two ideas should not be grasped merely as static, mutually opposing ones; instead, politicians should live together with the touch-and-go strains created between the two ideas. By so doing, politicians will see the birth of their realism and their idealist reality. The North Korean nuclear and missile development issue and the improvement of Japan's system for emergency are important test cases in which Japanese politicians--a little crazed from the long peacetime--can outgrow their former selves and become true political realists. It is not the "ideas smacking of Ichiro Ozawa" that is dangerous. Dangerous are the politicians who well never be able to possess dynamism with which to live amid strained relations between "national rights" and "civil rights"--though this inability is characteristic of factions calling for the defense of the Constitution and postwar pacifist groups. What is worse, such politicians are squatting across the LDP and the SDPJ.
