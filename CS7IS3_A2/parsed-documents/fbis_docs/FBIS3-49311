Bosnian Serbs have measured how much they can yield at the next round of peace talks on the future of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina scheduled for January 18 in Geneva, and that they "do not want a compromise when the statehood of the Serb republic is in question or its unification with other Serb lands," Karadzic said in a statement to Radio Studio S of the Serb republic. Although Bosnian Serbs and Croats had secured Bosnian Moslems the required third of Bosnia-Herzegovina at the latest round of talks in Geneva and Brussels last month, Moslems again rejected the peace accord on Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three ethnic republics, saying they were not satisfied with the "quality" of the land. Regarding the forthcoming Geneva talks, Karadzic said that he hoped they would be successful and also indicated that "enemies of Serbs are not devoted to peace and are not serious in the talks." "The Austro-German bloc wants the war to continue and are constantly encouraging the Moslems to demand a unitary Bosnia, while the rest of Europe is against this," Karadzic said. Commenting some statements to the effect that the United Nations protection force (?would withdraw) from Bosnia, Karadzic assessed this as a kind of pressure on the Moslem side. The international community actually wants to warn Moslems that the withdrawal of the peace-keepers would leave them all alone to face the Christian majority, which they could not bear, he said. Speaking about the NATO summit scheduled for January 10 and 11 in Brussels, Karadzic said that he expected new threats and pressures on the Serb side, although experience acquired so far indicates that methods of pressure, only on Serbs, can achieve nothing. "The Atlantic treaty has been left without its business and its rival--the Warsaw Pact, and it is now trying to justify the funds of its tax-payers and its existence," Karadzic said. "Such behaviour is very dangerous for us, since they see us as a great threat to European security. NATO must justify the large costs of the military-industrial complex which is behind it," Karadzic said.
