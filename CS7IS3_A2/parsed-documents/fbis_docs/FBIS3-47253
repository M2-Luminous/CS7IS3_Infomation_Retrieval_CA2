The plan, formulated about a month later than in previous years because of a cabinet reshuffle affecting the economic planning minister and other ministers with economic portfolios in December, puts stress on developing the rural economy and putting vigor into the private sector. In a conspicuous departure from past practice, the government left its forecast of macroeconomic indicators such as growth and inflation rates out of the plan. Instead, the plan contains forecasts of such indicators by the Korea Development Institute, the Bank of Korea and private research institutes that put average growth at 6 percent to 7 percent, inflation at 6 percent and the current-account surplus at anywhere from 1 billion to 2 billion U.S. dollars. The government does have its own forecasts, but did not include them in the plan to avoid criticism if the forecasts turn out to be wrong. But this creates the impression that the government is shirking its responsibility. If the plan included the government's macroeconomic goals, the government would then feel impelled to drive the economy to achieve the goals regardless of how unreasonable such a drive may be, as it did in the past, Economic Planning Board (EPB) officials say. But without the government goals, the business community has no way of knowing exactly what the government is aiming at in its economic management plan. An EPB official says the government wants 7-percent growth and 6-percent inflation in this year, but farm market opening as a result of the Uruguay Round trade talks has caused the government to put stress on rural development programs. These programs combine with others for boosting the private sector, expanding infrastructure and balancing development of the country to give the impression that the economic management plan for 1994 focuses more on growth than on stability. Chang Song-u, the EPB planning officer in charge of the plan, says that the plan's macroeconomic emphasis is on stability and its microeconomic emphasis is on programs to maximize business activities of the private sector. To stabilize prices, the government will control the total money supply on a stable basis and restrain earlier implementation of public works projects. To increase industry's international competitiveness in the severe trade war expected as a result of the Uruguay Round trade accord, the North American free trade agreement and the European economic area, the plan envisages five programs -- agricultural restructuring, deregulation for a higher spirit of enterprise in the private sector, expansion of infrastructure, increased adaptation to trends of globalization through market opening and price stabilization. The rural development programs include both government and private investment for developing rural areas into a complex of primary, secondary and tertiary industries, and for this the government will in July begin raising 1.5 trillion won a year by establishing a new tax for several years. Deregulation will include the privatization of state-run enterprises and the opening of the public works market to private capital. For price stabilization, prices of rice and 29 other daily necessities will be kept from rising more than 4 percent, on average, in the coming year, while prices of 140 monopoly and oligopoly items will be placed under strict controls. The economy, which bottomed out last year, looks bright in the new year. Increasing international competitiveness through substantial growth is the task facing the government's economic team, headed by Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok. Also pressing on the team are price stabilization and industrial peace, because without these two industry can hardly compete well on the world market.
