Meanwhile, a terrorist offensive hit Lima with various fires and two bomb attacks. Five terrorists died during a confrontation with the Army at a jungle town in Tarma Province, Peru's central region, at midnight on 12 March. An Army spokesman said the clash occurred when a column of 25 subversives tried to take over the town of Culebron but was repelled by a military detachment based in the area. One woman died when a bomb exploded in front of a high-ranking Navy officer's residence in Lima's San Isidro District. The bomb destroyed the building's front and damaged the house of journalist and former Education Minister Patricio Rickets. Police said four individuals were wounded during the attack, adding that one person is in serious condition. The terrorist also set afire two supermarkets, a shopping center, and a large store located in the residential districts of Jesus Maria, Miraflores, San Borja, and San Isidro. In order to carry out their attacks the terrorists entered the shops during working hours and "sowed" fire bombs with timing devices inside the buildings. According to police, the bombs exploded almost simultaneously the night of 13 March. The most spectacular fire occurred at the SAGA [local department store chain that serves as a representative for Sears products] shop's main offices in San Isidro, where a military force that guards Lima's financial center is based. The fire, however, only affected the shop's second floor. The shop owners said the center will reopen this week. The most spectacular bomb attack occurred in Santa Clara, on the outskirts of Lima, where terrorists detonated a car bomb that destroyed the local police station's coffee shop and left many people slightly injured. The explosion also affected some 20 houses and a medical center near the police station. Police think the extremist group Red Path [Sendero Rojo], a Shining Path dissident group, is responsible for the attacks. The Red Path rejects peace talks between the imprisoned Shining Path leadership and the government. The dissident Maoists prefer incendiary attacks because the risk to them is minimal, a police spokesman said. The Red Path claimed responsibility for two other incendiary attacks last month. One of the attacks was against the Army-owned "Metro" supermarket, and the other was against the El Callao naval base where Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman is serving his life sentence. The same group also claimed responsibility for a car bomb that seriously damaged the Air Force General Barracks on 8 February.
