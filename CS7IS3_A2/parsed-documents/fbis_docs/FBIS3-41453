When it gave up last October dumping liquid radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan, the Russian side counted on foreign assistance, specifically that of Japan, in building a storage for this waste in the Far East. However, so far Russia has not been rendered such assistance. For this reason, the issue of dumping radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan is left open. According to the ministry official, Japan did not restrict its initiative by offering Russia one tanker only. The other day, two more tankers have been offered, which are to be examined by Russian experts in near future.
