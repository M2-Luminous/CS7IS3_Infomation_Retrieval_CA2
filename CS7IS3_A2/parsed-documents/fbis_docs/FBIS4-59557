Bin-Husaynun said the YSP leadership welcomes any call or mediation by His Majesty King Husayn to halt the current bloodshed in Yemen. He praised the sincere Jordanian role represented by King Husayn's continuing personal efforts to spare blood, heal the rift, and maintain Yemeni unity, as well as his majesty's continuous call on brothers to apply logic in solving their differences. He said that Jordan, represented by His Majesty King Husayn, and Oman represented by His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, exerted great efforts to resolve the Yemeni crisis, which resulted in the signing of the pledge and accord document in Amman on 10 Ramadan. He added: The current events would not have happened if the other party had implemented the document, to which we adhere and which addresses all aspects of the crisis. Bin-Husaynun accused President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih of obstructing the implementation of the document, especially after he felt that its implementation would greatly curtail his powers, and said he began the Abyan battle only one day after the document was signed, when all Yemeni parties were still in Amman. He said the president ordered the al-'Amaliqah Brigade forces to start the battle, which was followed by other battles that resulted in the destruction of some brigades of the Yemeni Armed Forces in the south. He stressed that the YSP is a unionist party and will continue to be so. He said it was the YSP that achieved unity and handed power over to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. He denied reports that neighboring states are helping the YSP in the Yemeni crisis and said these are excuses made by others. He indicated that the coming days will reveal those who support the unity and those who oppose it. He stressed that guns cannot solve any problem and voiced optimism that logic will replace force as a means to protect the citizens and Armed Forces from destruction and eventually preserve the unity of the homeland. Bin-Husaynun said the discovery of oil or the existence of oil reserves in the south is not the cause of the crisis and war. The causes, he said, lie in political differences and contradictions. He said oil was discovered in both the north and south before unity and it is not the property of one person, but all the Yemeni people. He denied that Yemeni territory has been leased to Saudi Arabia and said there are border issues that can be solved through dialogue. He said a Yemeni-Saudi committee is in charge of this. Asked about the legitimacy of the decisions made by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the Yemeni House of Representatives to depose Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, and the oil minister, Bin-Husaynun said these decisions were stupid, illegal, and will not solve the problem. He said the one who declares war on his people can have no legitimacy and that all President Salih's decrees are illegitimate. Asked about President Salih's refusal to halt the fighting, Bin-Husaynun said that this is unusual in society whether on the Arab or international level. This refusal was condemned by more than 30 states during the inauguration of Nelson Mandela in South Africa recently. The Yemeni minister denied the presence of troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih near Aden. He said what 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani said in this regard is not true because fighting is now taking place on axes more than 120 km from Aden. He added: The southern town of al-Dali', which reportedly fell to the hands of the northern forces, is still in our hands. Moreover, our forces are in control of Bab el Mandeb. He said battles are currently taking place in the Abyan Governorate and that there were no battles in the Zinjibar and Ja'ar areas during the past two days. Responding to a question, Bin-Husaynun said the YSP rejects the principle of separation as an alternative to war and as a solution to the crisis because the party principles are based on the unity of Yemen. He denied that Arab forces are fighting with the northern forces, stressing that elements from some Arab states with only political affiliations were captured. Concluding, Bin-Husaynun stressed that the current crisis is not a personal one between the president and his deputy, but is due to basic differences over Yemeni issues such as authority, security, and economic and social development. Bin-Husaynun said he will visit other Arab states following his visit to Jordan, including Saudi Arabia, for the same purpose.
