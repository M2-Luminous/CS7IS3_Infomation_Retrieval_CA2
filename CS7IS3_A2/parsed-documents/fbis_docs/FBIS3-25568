Reacting to the UN Security Council's plan to reduce the UN peacekeeping forces in Mozambique, Teodato Hunguana noted that the UN contingent is in this country to carry out a mission which will be over when the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM, have started operating. Teodato Hunguana said that to withdraw or reduce those forces before their mission is over could have negative consequences for this country. In turn, Jeronimo Malagueta, Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] political affairs officer, says that Renamo is not against the United Nations reducing its contingent, as long as this occurs simultaneously with the arrival of a UN police contingent.
