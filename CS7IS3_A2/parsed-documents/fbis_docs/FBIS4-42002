The President Spent Yesterday at Work in the Moscow Region"] [Text] B. Yeltsin's schedule began in the morning with a visit to Lyuberetskiy Rayon. "It isn't working out right," he joked during a conversation with the journalists accompanying him. "I have been to Tula, to Amur Oblast, I have been to the south and the north as well, but I rarely get to visit the Moscow region..." As Boris Nikolayevich explained, he has several aims during his tour of Moscow Oblast. The first is to visit the Soyuz Science-and-Production Association in Lyuberetskiy Rayon, which is one of the flagships of the country's defense industry. In the afternoon the president was due to have meetings with rural workers in Ramenskiy Rayon. "I want to talk to people and find out what their thoughts and concerns are," B. Yeltsin said. In the morning the president's helicopter touched down at the city of Dzerzhinskiy. The science-and-production association there, which was created in 1947 to develop compound solid fuels for strategic missiles, operational-tactical missiles, and anti-air missiles, ballistite propellant for the artillery, and so forth (it would take a full page to carry on listing the association's "merits"), has a mighty scientific and technical potential. Under the conversion program the association is presently developing and producing synthetic diamonds and tools based on them, industrial explosives, aerosol fire extinguishers, medicinal preparations, and much other "peacetime output." Civilian output now represents 70 percent of the association's total volume. Unfortunately, even a "firm" as powerful as this cannot boast of stability because in the tough conditions of the reforms its process of becoming established is fraught with considerable difficulties. The scientific nucleus at Soyuz consists of dozens of doctors and candidates of sciences but its "think tank" also requires renewal and support today. For example, half a billion rubles are needed for the training of scientific staff while the upkeep of the test and experiment base will cost the budget 5.4 billion. It emerged that Boris Nikolayevich's interest extends not just to the specific concerns worrying the Soyuz collective. The leaders of defense enterprises in the Moscow Oblast also came here, to Dzerzhinskiy, yesterday. "I hope that from their example I will gain a better feel for the defense sector's problems and understand what has to be done," the President stressed. Boris Nikolayevich was asked the following question: In his opinion, how is the process of stabilization in the country progressing? "All the signs are there that the economy is recovering," was his answer. "The first is that for five months now the inflation rate has been running at 8-9 percent, and yet it had been as high as 26 percent! Secondly, in June the rise in prices did not exceed 5.5 percent whereas in the past two years that indicator was never less than 10 percent. Finally, the slump in industrial production stopped in June. All these preconditions inspire the hope that the economy is getting back to an even keel. We believe that by the end of the year we will reach a civilized level of inflation -- 5-6 percent. "The political situation in society is stabilizing," the president added. "The Treaty on [Social] Accord is working and life has become more peaceful. Support the Edict on the fight against crime!" After a conference with the defense workers (held behind closed doors) B. Yeltsin paid a lightning visit to the Nikolo-Ugreshskiy monastery, which is next door to the Soyuz Science-and-Production Association.
