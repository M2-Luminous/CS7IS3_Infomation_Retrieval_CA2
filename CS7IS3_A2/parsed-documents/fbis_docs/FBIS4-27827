Commenting on this MINJU CHOSON today says this is intended to evade the international criticism of their concealment of plutonium and mislead international opinion which is opposed to Japan's moves to arm itself with nuclear weapons and become a military power. The analyst says: As for the "three non-nuclear principles" peddled by the Japanese authorities, they are a peace veil which became useless long ago. While advertising the "principles", Japan has connived at the entry of nuclear-armed U.S. warships and warplanes into Japan and left the Japanese territory to the United States as its nuclear base. Lurking behind their support to the indefinite extension of the NPT is the clumsy trick to save themselves from the tough spot today when their advertisement of "uprightness" in the nuclear issue has turned out to be a sheer lie with the exposure of hidden plutonium. It must not go unnoticed that the Japanese authorities and reactionaries are working to enact a wartime law to cope with an "event of contingency on the Korean peninsula" by molding the public opinion that the fictitious "nuclear threat" from the DPRK poses a grave menace to Japan's "security". The Japanese authorities and reactionaries must stop their evil doing to harm the North over the non-existent "nuclear issue" and open to the world the data related to their nuclear issue and immediately stop nuclear armament, instead of advocating denuclearization only in words.
