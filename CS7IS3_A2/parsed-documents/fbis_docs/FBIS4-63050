In the minister's view, his sector did well last year -- the decline in sea, river, road, and air transportation was 28 percent against the overall slump of 35 percent in the national economy as a whole. Mr. Yefimov thought it necessary to emphasize that "transport workers are not freeloaders" -- in 1993 transport companies received 300 billion rubles [R] in subsidies, but paid around R750 billion to the budget. In 1994, the sector is scheduled to receive another R1.4 trillion, only to pay R3.5 trillion to the budget. The minister voiced his hope that once the budget is approved, "funds required for the sector's functioning and development will be forthcoming in a more orderly fashion." Mr. Yefimov pointed out that in 1993 transport workers not only kept traffic routes in working condition, but also took efforts to "lay the groundwork for future achievements." For instance, the ministry plans to present to the Federal Assembly a number of bills aimed at improving the legal framework of transportation. In addition, the government will receive a program tentatively entitled "Russian Roads." Regarding problems currently facing Russian transport, Mr. Yefimov pointed to the overall decline in cargo and passenger traffic. He voiced his regret that enterprises producing transport facilities are in dire financial straits and cannot replace Russia's means of transport in the requisite amounts, but the ministry is trying to solve the problem by attracting investment from large commercial businesses.
