Karakousis] [Text] The government is gearing up to issue Greek Telecommunications Organization (OTE) shares. Following several months of inactivity, it is now hastening the process, apparently under the pressure of the uncertainties surrounding the implementation of the budget. At a large meeting presided over by Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister Andonis Livanis with the participation of Minister of Finance Papadhopoulos, Minister of Transportation I. Kharalambous, and other government officials it was decided that the stock floatation bill will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies as soon as possible in April. The Livanis presence at the meeting underlines the prime minister's interest in the issue of OTE stock. The bill is being elaborated by the Ministry of National Economy; according to available information, it is envisioned that up to 30 percent of OTE shares will be sold to private investors through the stock market. The government's goal is to secure the sale of the first package of OTE shares until next September to enhance government revenue in next fall's critical period, when budgetary pressures will be at their highest. It is now clear that part of the income from the sale of shares will be devoted to enhancing revenue and not be used in its entirety to fulfill the needs of the OTE's investment program, as the government initially announced. In general, the interest of foreign investors in the OTE remains strong and the ministry of national economy is being "besieged" by potential investors.
