Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference, however, that it is unclear whether Hosokawa will have talks with the coalition leaders. Hosokawa reiterated his hope for an early cabinet reshuffle, saying he will make up his mind in a day or two on whether to make changes. He told a House of Representatives panel on political reform, that the government has time to change the nearly seven-month-old cabinet as it has overcome its most difficult tasks -- political reform and completing the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. Koken Nosaka, chairman of the Social Democratic Party's [SDP] Diet Affairs Committee, told a news conference his party is opposed to an immediate cabinet shake-up. "We believe now is not an appropriate time," he said. He also said it is better to wait until after the Diet approves the fiscal 1994 state budget, expected in early may. Hosokawa is considering drastically shaking up the cabinet and his planned reshuffle is expected to center on removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura from that key post. Hosokawa formed the cabinet last August to carry out political reforms, and he apparently thinks the cabinet will have accomplished its purpose when amendments to the political reform legislation are approved by the Diet on Thursday or Friday, the sources said. The legislation was enacted in January. Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida, who is also director general of the Management and Coordination Agency, said he is opposed to the meetings between Hosokawa and the other coalition leaders, which the sources said could take place as early as Tuesday. Ishida said the prime minister has the right under the Constitution to make changes in his cabinet. Tsutomu Hata, head of Shinseito, one of the seven coalition parties, said in a lecture to a group of SDP Diet members that he opposes a "drastic cabinet reshuffle," which he said would trigger political confusion. Despite his opposition to a large-scale shake- up, he backs the removal of Takemura from his post. Hata said he understands moves to remove Takemura from his present post, adding that a party head assuming the post of chief cabinet secretary has a difficulty in helping a prime minister as a close aide in the coalition government. Takemura heads Sakigake, a coalition party with close ties with Hosokawa's Japan New Party. Hata, who is also deputy prime minister and foreign minister, said party leaders do not necessarily share the prime minister's views, as they belong to different parties. For his part, Hata flatly denied he will assume the post of chief cabinet secretary. The coalition parties have split over Hosokawa's reshuffle plan, with SDP, the Democratic Socialist Party and Sakigake opposed to dumping Takemura, while Shinseito and Komeito support the plan. Meanwhile, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama reiterated his opposition to an immediate cabinet reshuffle, saying Diet passage of the national budget for fiscal 1994 beginning April 1 should be the top priority. "It is necessary to have the budget passed through the Diet as quickly as possible,'' he told a news conference. He said Hosokawa ''should restrain himself and avoid a cabinet shake-up at this time." Murayama said he will reiterate his opposition to an early cabinet reshuffle when he meets with Hosokawa later Tuesday. The premier has yet to ask for a meeting, he added. The SDP chief predicted Hosokawa will eventually have to give up his plan for an immediate reshuffle. He said a cabinet shake-up should wait until after the budget program wins Diet approval. Asked what he would do if asked to join a new cabinet, Murayama said he has not given serious thought to such a possibility, and that "I haven't heard any such proposal at all."
