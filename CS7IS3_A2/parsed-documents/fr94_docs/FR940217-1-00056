FR940217-1-00056 FR940217-1-00013 Issue 8: Many individuals opposed listing of the salamander on the grounds that listing would undermine the success of the Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Plan (BCCP). Response: The BCCP currently proposes to acquire land in the Barton Creek watershed, which will provide some benefits to the salamander by preserving the natural integrity of the landscape and positively contributing to water quality in Barton Creek and Barton Springs. The BCCP participants are currently working toward providing additional water quality protection for the Barton Springs salamander, including retrofitting of existing developments with non-point-source pollution control structures and protecting the aquifer and Barton Springs from catastrophic pollution events (see discussion in Factor D). Issue 9: Some commenters expressed concern regarding economic impacts of listing the salamander and stated that economic impacts should be considered. Response: Under section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act, the listing process must be based solely on the best scientific information available, and economic considerations are not applicable. The legislative history of the Act clearly states the intent of Congress to ``ensure'' that listing decisions are ``based solely upon biological criteria and to prevent non-biological considerations from affecting such decisions'' (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 97&hyph;835 for the 1982 amendments). Because the Service is specifically precluded from considering economic impacts in the listing process, the Service has not addressed such impacts in proposing to list this species. Issue 10: The Service received one comment letter requesting that the Barton Springs salamander be emergency listed. Response: In accordance with section 4(b)(7) of the Act, a species may be listed as threatened or endangered on an emergency basis if a significant risk to the well-being of the species is identified. Although the Service has determined that multiple threats to the salamander exist (see discussion in ``Summary of Factors'' section), the Service is not able to justify an emergency determination since these threats are not of such an immediate nature that the delay during the period between this proposed rule and any final rule might pose a significant risk to the well-being of the species. Issue 11: A few commenters questioned the validity of the information and findings presented in several reports prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) (including Slade et al. 1985 and 1986, Veenhuis and Slade 1990). Response: The Service has reviewed the USGS reports used in preparation of this rule and has determined that the data were gathered and analyzed in accordance with sound scientific principles. The Service accepts these reports as valid and relevant scientific information and accepts their findings. Issue 12: A few individuals cited a 1922 report stating that elevated levels of fecal coliform bacteria have been documented at Barton Springs since 1922 (T.U. Taylor, Austin City Water Survey, in litt. , 1922).
