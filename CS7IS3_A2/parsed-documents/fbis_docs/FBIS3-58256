In this way, the French Field Forces, comprising the Mechanized Armored Corps (CBM) and the Rapid Response Corps (FAR), would eventually have an extra division. After stressing that, in his view, "an Army of 225,000 troops would be an absolute minimum," Mr. Leotard stated that, as things stood, there were two possible solutions for Army troop numbers by 1997. From 1990 to 1993, numbers had fallen from 288,500 to 241,400 (enlisted soldiers and conscripts), a drop of some 16.4 percent. The so-called Joxe plan, which has still not been officially repealed, provided for this figure to fall to 225,000 by 1997. Mr. Leotard explained to members of the military council that the options would be proposed by the government in due course in the framework of the new military planing law for 1995-2000, which will be put before Parliament in the spring of 1994. The defense minister said: "One initial solution consists in reducing Army troop numbers to 225,000 or 230,000, divided over eight specific divisions providing the required range of abilities. This would just be sufficient to prevent and manage current short-term crises. The other solution in adapting the Army would be to adopt the size and structures existing in 1994, i.e., 240,000 soldiers in nine divisions." Mr. Leotard went on to state: "The conclusions drawn from the work done in the framework of the Defense white paper and the future military planning law will lead to a final decision being made on this issue." This is the first time the defense minister has mentioned the possibility that the Joxe plan, which originally catered for the constitution of eight divisions, might no longer be acceptable. He thus echoed the claims made by the Army, whose General Staff had carried out studies -- which until now had remained relatively discreet -- in favor of the creation of a new division for the French field forces.
