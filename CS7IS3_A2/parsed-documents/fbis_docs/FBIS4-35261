He said that all employees and diplomats have entered their offices and have resumed their duties after an understanding was reached with the former ambassador, 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghaylan, to allow them to enter. Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghaylan, a northerner who supports the Yemeni Socialist Party of the south, had shut the embassy doors last Wednesday and prevented the staff from entering to protest Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah's decision to dismiss him and appoint the charge d'affaires, a northerner, to run the embassy's affairs. 'Abd-al-Malik Sa'id said in a statement to MENA that the monthly allowances of Yemeni students studying in Cairo were disbursed today. These allowances were supposed to be disbursed last week. In addition, consular services are being provided for the Yemeni community in Egypt. He added that former Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil Ghaylan is still at his home, which is located above the embassy. The new permanent representative to the Arab League, Ambassador Luqman, today is also operating from his office at the embassy without any problems.
