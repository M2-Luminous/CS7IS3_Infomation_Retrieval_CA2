With the president's approval, the Defense Ministry is scheduled to announce its regular personnel changes at the end of this week or early next week. The government plans to remove private organizations in the military through the personnel changes this month, but no details were available. A senior government official said, "Defense Minister Yi briefed President Kim on the changes, but I have no information on personnel management concerning the generals and field grade officers who were members of 'Hana-hoe.'" Hana-hoe was a private Army organization that counted former Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u among its members. Another senior official said, "The overall feeling in the Army is that the personnel changes involving the Hana-hoe generals have not gone far enough. Most Army officers hope that all the Hana-hoe generals will be discharged or relieved of important posts."
