During a news conference, Belmont said his decision is a result of "a deep reflection that leads me as a Peruvian to follow my conscience." He said: "There is no way back, the speculations are over. I will run as an independent, without alliances with any groups." Belmont referred to Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori who, according to all political observers, will run for a reelection and whom Belmont has described as "promoting the division, not the unity of the Peruvian people." Belmont is complying with a second term as Lima mayor after being reelected last January. He said he has not yet begun his campaign and that he will totally engage in a campaign "once the game rules are clear." "No matter what the polls, Congress, or the media say, Belmont will run in the elections," said Belmont, founder and leader of Obras political movement. Last month, he announced he would not run although some sectors considered him a probable candidate. The Lima mayor became one of the harshest critics of President Fujimori after the government passed a law cutting municipal income which, according to Belmont, prevents him from implementing more than a dozen works he considers essential for Lima. Opposition members considered the law seeks to neutralize Belmont's capability of action as mayor and to prevent him from carrying out works that would allow him to gain support for a probable presidential campaign. Cusco Mayor Luis Caceres has also announced his candidacy for the presidency. According to the polls, former United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar is Fujimori's strongest contender if he decides to run. Perez de Cuellar has said it is too early to decide.
