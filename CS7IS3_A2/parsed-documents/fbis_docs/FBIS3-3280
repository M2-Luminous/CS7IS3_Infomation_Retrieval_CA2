He said mainland-funded companies were partly to blame for speculation in the property market. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office's think-tank would soon look into the problem and study ways of maintaining the territory's economic dynamism, said Mr Lu. Speaking to a group of Hong Kong deputies to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at a closed-door session, Mr Lu said main land-funded firms would be stopped from participating in property speculation. He was quoted as saying "quite a number" of mainland-funded firms in the territory had been speculating and insisted that was not good for Hong Kong. Mr Lu said it was unfair to other investors because mainland-funded companies were using state funds to make profits. "They can push up the prices of property without having to bear any responsibility," he said. In a separate meeting with a group of Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress, Mr Lu said the level of property prices had gone beyond what ordinary residents could bear. "Many people cannot afford to buy their own flats. This is a big problem. It hinges upon people's livelihood. It hinges on whether Hong Kong will be able to maintain its status as an international financial centre." He said what had made Hong Kong tick over the past decades was its low production costs, luring foreign investors. It was reported yesterday the international firm, Unisys, is to shift its regional centre from Hong Kong to Singapore because of high costs in the territory. "This is a big problem," he said. Mr Lu conceded there were various factors behind the surge in property prices. But he said the Government had the responsibility to solve the problem. "If the problem remains unresolved, it will affect the post-1997 government and create a major burden on it." Mr Lu said the PWC's economic sub-group would soon form a team to study the property market. "We will give suggestions to the British side. It's a matter for them as to whether to accept it. We will also listen to people from all walks of life on effective ways to deal with the problem. We will do as much as we can." A Hong Kong deputy to the CPPCC, Ho Sai-chu accused some property developers of hoarding land in order to seek more profits. Mr Ho, a construction company boss, said although 36,000 flats had been completed last year, only about 28,000 had been put on the market.
