Japan has to present its macroeconomic `numerical targets' as reference indices that are not pledged to the United States." So said Isamu Miyazaki, chairman of the board of directors of the Daiwa Research Institute. What macroeconomic numerical targets means is how much Japan as a whole intends to reduce its trade surplus, not the import targets of individual items. "To increase import volume, expansion of domestic demand is indispensable. If the contents of measures to expand domestic demand, including additional amount in public works projects, are decided, the target of decrease of our surplus will become visible to a certain degree." Miyazaki seemed to regret the "degeneration" during the negotiations between Japan and the United States. In the beginning, macroeconomic numerical targets were subjects of discussion, but they were unwittingly replaced by discussions limited to microeconomics, winding up with the term "numerical target" alone having risen to the fore. Miyazaki is also opposed to setting import targets for individual items because it may lead to managed trade. He proposes that Japan return to the original point by saying, "It is ridiculous to deny numerical targets outright. It must once more recall why the negotiations between the two countries started in the first place. Was it not intended to trim Japan's trade surplus?" It Is Unwise To Leave Negotiations Broken Off Chief researcher Masaru Takagi of the Fuji Research Institute agrees with what Mr. Miyazaki insists and said, "The five-year target of reduction in trade surplus should be set at around 2 percent of the surplus ratio against GDP [gross domestic product]. Since it stood at approximately 3.6 percent in 1992, his insistence is to cut it about in half. He added, "President Clinton's reference to a `trade war' looked like intimidation, but it is bad for Japan to engage in serious quarrels with the United States. Although the numerical targets were rejected as managed trade, they are in macroeconomic terms the same as `economic prospects,' the growth rate the government predicts. As a matter of fact, the figure 2 percent against GDP mentioned by Takagi is quite close to the figure U.S. officials mentioned publicly in the beginning. What these two men insisted on amounts to an opinion in support of so-called "cooperation with the United States," based on the realities of the situation. They seem to belong, however, to a minority among economists. At the end of January when the Japan-U.S. negotiations drew closer to an end, a group of Japanese, mostly economists, made public a joint appeal to the effect that "Japan should resolutely refuse numerical targets." Prof. Kazuo Ueda of Tokyo University, one of the proponents, criticized the setting up of macroeconomic numerical targets saying, "The trade surplus originates, theoretically, from monetary lending and borrowing between countries. If that imbalance becomes an issue, such a ridiculous situation will take place that no more lending and borrowing will be allowed." Those on the majority side, however, do not think it right to support the breakoff of negotiations. Prof. Ueda insists that now is the time for Japan to declare to the world as well as to the United States that differences in domestic and foreign prices should be reduced to the levels of advanced nations. To achieve this, easing of restrictions and more opening of markets are necessary. When they are carried out, it is expected that trade surpluses will be reduced in the end and more than anything else consumers will benefit. "Of course it will be accompanied by pain to domestic forces that try to protect vested rights and interests. Prime Minister Hosokawa, who held on to his refusal of numerical targets, seems to have taken a step toward the point of no return." As a countermeasure to the refusal of numerical targets, Assistant Prof. Heizo Takenaka of the Keio University, points to the shrinking of the price difference at home and abroad. He said, "To cut the difference in prices, restrictions should be lifted. If the share of U.S. products still does not increase, then the blame rests with U.S. enterprises." `Important Commitment' From the President Meanwhile, Prof. Iwao Nakatani of Hitotsubashi University said a drastic symbolic policy is necessary in addition to the easing of restrictions. He added, "Why do you not take a kind of affirmative action to remedy discrimination toward enterprises with foreign capital? For the foreign-capital affiliated enterprises, Japan should take a daring stance of seriously dealing with the matter of opening its markets by exempting taxes and the like." However, there is an entirely different opinion, such as the following: Prof. Tsuneo Iida at the International Japan Culture Studies Center says "the government is better not to take any action from a strategic or tactical point of view." It is Prof. Iida's view that the government, as a rule, should not intervene in economic affairs in the face of the current situation. "In a broad sense, now is the time when the U.S.-style industrial civilization of the 20th century has come to a deadend. It is wrong to think that the domestic recession, for example, can be remedied by measures taken by the government." In Japan, many people assume the current economic negotiations to be a de facto failure, but Prof. Yoshihiro Tsurumi of the City University of New York has a different view -- "Prime Minister Hosokawa has wrestled an important pledge from President Clinton." Prof. Tsurumi, who is an old acquaintance of Prime Minister Hosokawa, and is said to be periodically writing or faxing advice to him on economic policies, points out: At a news conference after the summit, the President made remarks to the effect "I am not asking for something like the semiconductor agreement" and "objective criteria will not be used as a means of sanctions against Japan." "In other words, he apparently made clear remarks that `numerical targets that equate to predetermined-share methods' will not be employed, contrary to the Japanese interpretation. Japan should not overlook this statement. It should immediately call for a resumption of negotiations to confirm the presidential statements." Thus he advises that the best way is to work out new measures for easing restrictions by holding in check those in the U.S. Government who favor applying sanctions against Japan.
