[Begin correspondent Nermine Elikhanbeyli recording] After having received many warnings, Azerbaijan has finally faced the facts. Turkmenistan stopped the natural gas supply to our Republic because it wasn't paid for. An Azerbaijani delegation visited Turkmenistan and concluded an interstate agreement in February this year envisaging the supply of 3 billion cubic meters of gas for 1994. During the first quarter of the year, some $50 million of natural gas was supplied. According to a clearing agreement, in exchange for the gas, our Republic was supposed to send tools used in the oil industry, fuel, cooling equipment condensers, and other products. But Azerbaijan failed to fulfill its obligation. The state firm Azerigas reported that because the Republic's Council of Ministers has adopted no relevant decision, the firm is unable to obtain credit and the needed goods. The Council of Ministers Finance Department reported that a relevant draft bill is being prepared and will be submitted for the approval of the prime minister in the coming days. We must realize that we must unfailingly abide by agreements if we want to be seen among the ranks of the respectable states. We want to note another aspect of this problem. In Baku alone, industry owes 2 billion manats and households 9 million manats to Azerigas. Failure to pay for the used gas is compounding this problem. We would also like to highlight another factor: With its 60-million population, neighboring Turkey uses only 6 to 8 billion cubic meters of gas per year, whereas Azerbaijan's 7 million residents use between 12-14 billion cubic meters of gas. Apparently, no one can compete with our wastefulness. [end recording]
