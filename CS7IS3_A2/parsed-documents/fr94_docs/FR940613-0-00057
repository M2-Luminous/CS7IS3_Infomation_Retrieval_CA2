FR940613-0-00057 FR940613-0-00015 For purposes of establishing a cargo-carrying length subject to the freeze provisions of the ISTEA, a determination must be made as to the unit lengths comprising combination vehicles authorized by State statute or regulation and in actual operation on a regular or periodic basis on or before June 1, 1991. Re-examination of all submitted material and docket comments resulted in the 110-foot length. OREGON LENGTH OF THE CARGO-CARRYING UNITS: The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) commented that overall length requirements for three trailing unit combinations have a significant impact on public safety and must be retained. The ODOT also said that the length of tractors in combination with three trailing units is not a uniform 10 feet long but can range from 9 to 14 feet. The freeze does not affect the authority of the ODOT to enforce an overall length limit on triple-trailer combinations. However, it does limit the overall length of the cargo-carrying units to what was authorized and in use on or before June 1, 1991. Although the comment does not specifically indicate that 9-foot-long tractors were in use with ``Triples'' on or before June 1, 1991, we assume that was the intent. Therefore, appendix C has been changed to correct the cargo-carrying length of three trailing unit combinations from 95 to 96 feet. OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS: VEHICLE: The CRASH commented that ORS 818.150(5) provides that any towed vehicles in a combination must be equipped with safety chains or cables to prevent the towbar from dropping to the ground in the event the coupling fails. The chains or cables must have sufficient strength to control the towed vehicle in the event the coupling device fails and must be attached with no more slack than necessary to permit proper turning. However, this requirement does not apply to a fifth-wheel coupling if the upper and lower halves of the fifth wheel must be manually released before they can be separated. Appendix C has been amended accordingly. ROUTES: The ODOT indicated that there is no direct relationship between approved routes for three trailing unit combinations and the NN highways. The connection is that the freeze applies only on NN highways. Consequently, truck tractor and three trailing unit combinations may not operate with more than 96 feet of cargo-carrying length on routes shown in appendix C. The State is free to regulate the use of triple-trailer combinations as it sees fit on other highways. OTHER COMMENTS: The CRASH also indicated that officials who issue permits may require the applicant to furnish public liability and property damage insurance and establish that the permit vehicle will stay on the right side of the centerline at all times. We do not regard these conditions to be the type which must be published in appendix C since the State has discretion whether or not to apply them. The ODOT asked for a definition of terms and vehicles used in FHWA rulemakings but did not cite any specific items that should be defined. We are unaware of any items that should be defined or that could be defined without affording interested persons the opportunity to comment on the proposed definitions. SOUTH DAKOTA OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS: VEHICLE: The CRASH said that provisions relating to public liability insurance, the amount of offtracking allowed and the entering of the dimensions used to calculate the offtracking on the permit form should be included in appendix C. We concur, and appendix C has been modified accordingly. OTHER COMMENTS: The State said that the maximum weight limit for ``Rocky Mountain Doubles'' is not ``129K'' as shown on the table at 58 FR 11465&hyph;11466 of the SNPRM but is the ``Uncapped Federal Bridge Formula.'' For LCV's the maximum allowable weight is capped at what was allowed and in actual operation on June 1, 1991. Based on the information submitted by the State, a ``Turnpike Double,'' which must also comply with the Federal Bridge formula, is limited to a maximum of 129,000 pounds. The recategorization of the vehicles subject to the LCV freeze has adopted the 129,000-pound value for the ``Turnpike Double'' as the maximum for a truck tractor and two trailing units. The State showed the length of the road tractor-trailer-trailer combination as 80 feet. However, this is the overall length. When the length determination in the SNPRM is used, the cargo-carrying length is the overall length minus 10 feet for the length of the tractor. Therefore, the cargo-carrying length of this combination is shown in appendix C as 70 feet. The State asked for certain additions and deletions to appendix C. The recategorization of the vehicles subject to the LCV freeze accounted for most of the changes suggested by the State. The descriptions for South Dakota, which now appear in appendix C, take into account the comments made by the State. UTAH OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS: VEHICLE: The CRASH said that Utah Regulations for Legal and Permitted Vehicles, sections 400.2(8), (12), and (14) pertaining to sway of multiple-trailer vehicles, following distance, and insurance requirements, respectively, should be reflected in appendix C. We concur, and appendix C has been amended accordingly. ROUTES: The State clarified the basis for delineating vehicles allowed to operate on divided or nondivided highways from overall length to length of cargo-carrying units. This reformatting did not change the lengths allowed, but simply re-stated the lengths to match the language of the ISTEA. LEGAL CITATIONS: The State also corrected the legal citation for truck tractor and two trailing unit combinations and indicated that those for ``Triples'' should be the same. These changes have been made.
