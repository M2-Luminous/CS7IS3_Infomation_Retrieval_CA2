"I hope the meetings with Peres will bring about a breakthrough in the negotiations," said the PLO chairman. Asked by the YEDI'OT AHARONOT correspondent whether he is close to a decision on signing the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, 'Arafat responded: "The decision is not only mine. There is another side, too." Asked for his assessment on the effects of Basil al-Asad's death on the Israeli-Syrian negotiations, 'Arafat answered: "I do not know. I personally lament the death of Basil. I knew him when he was still a boy, when al-Asad was a major in the Syrian Air Force. I deeply regret his death." 'Arafat was asked whether Syria is heading for a separate agreement. His answer: "Al-Asad took care to convene the Arab leaders prior to departing for Geneva in order to receive their blessing. This is the way to practice politics!" 'Arafat said there are still four issues under discussion between Israel and the PLO. 'Arafat's aides -- Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, Akram Haniyah, and Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] -- sounded a little more optimistic. Haniyah said the first meeting with Peres increased his optimism regarding the chances for an agreement. 'Abd-Rabbuh said: "God willing."
