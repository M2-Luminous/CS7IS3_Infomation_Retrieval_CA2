Speaking after the end of a session at which the tribunal's judges adopted the court's procedural code, Claude Jorda told AFP he and his 11 colleagues had reached a compromise over trying alleged war criminals in their absence, admissable under French but not under English law. "We have taken the French concept to its limits, which has allowed us to establish a procedure which, while not judging the accused in absentia, will allow us to make public the charge against him," Jorda said. The code, a mixture of procedural systems from across the world, is scheduled for publication in mid-March. The judge added that international arrest warrants issued by the tribunal would also be published, so that any accused refusing to attend would be unable to plead his innocence before any other body. Under the tribunal's new code, evidence on charges against an absent defendant will be presented at public hearings, whose proceedings will be passed verbatim to the United Nations Security Council and the country believed to be sheltering the accused. Jorda said some alleged war criminals were being sheltered in "completely civilised countries," but refused to specify which. Commenting on press reports criticising the court since its inauguration last November under UN auspices for inaction and lack of real authority, Jorda said the tribunal "wanted to do better than Nuremberg," the site of the war crimes trials of leading Nazis. That court "was accused of implementing hasty procedures and was above all a court of victors." He added: "We needed a procedural code, without with there would be neither prosecutor nor tribunal. That is the least that we owe victims and accused." "In respect of the mandate given us by the UN Security Council, we have got as far as we could after starting off with nothing...less than three months ago." The tribunal's new clerk, Theo van Boven, said he was confident that trials could get under way before the end of the year. Its next session takes place from April 25 to May 13. In the interim its draft budget is expected to be approved by the UN, said a statement from the tribunal.
