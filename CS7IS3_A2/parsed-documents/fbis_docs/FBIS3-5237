This official said that some people hold that the Security Law should be abolished and the pertinent articles be absorbed into criminal law. However, the criminal law stipulates that the act of espionage must be committed between nations. Therefore, the article in the Security Law that defines North Korea as an antistate organization, not as a state, cannot be absorbed into the criminal law.
