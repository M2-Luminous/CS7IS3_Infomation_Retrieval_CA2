The following is a live relay by Reporter Jose Miguel Alfaro from Government House: [Alfaro] President Frei's decision to summon General Rodolfo Stange to suggest his retirement from the Carabineros was the main issue discussed by Frei during today's cabinet meeting. We have the following report on this issue: During the two-hour cabinet meeting the president informed his immediate advisers about the arguments he raised before the Carabineros director general. Victor Manuel Rebolledo, minister general secretary of the government, explained that President Frei is not arguing about petty issues, but defending basic moral issues. [Begin Rebolledo recording] What the government and the president have specified is that although General Stange has not been indicted and no sentence has been issued, the fact that he is being questioned virtually morally incapacitates him from adequately fulfilling his duties as Carabineros director general. Consequently, the Carabineros are impeded from properly fulfilling those duties established by the Constitution and the laws, and which all Chilean citizens expect to be fulfilled. [end recording] Rebolledo said there is tension between the government and Gen. Stange, but not an institutional crisis. [passage omitted]
