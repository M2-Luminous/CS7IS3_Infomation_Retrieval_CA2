Speaking at the launch of the UK Government's "Response to Rio" documents, Mr Gummer said: "Do we have to wait until disaster overwhelms us before we make the radical changes necessary to protect our world for future generations? That is the vital challenge of sustainable development. If we act now there is much that can be saved which will otherwise disappear forever. Yet we cannot allow our proper concern to blind us to mankind's need to change and develop. A society which does not grow is one which cannot satisfy some of our basic human needs. Economic development is just as important a concept as environmental protection, and we must find ways of achieving both together.'' Mr Gummer outlined two new initiatives designed to stimulate lifestyle change. He said: "In addition to the Panel which the Prime Minister announced today, I propose to set up a UK Round Table on Sustainable Development. This Round Table will bring together representatives of the main sectors and groups to discuss major issues of sustainable development with Government Ministers. And we must not forget the key part to be played by individuals in developing a more sustainable world. The Government will stimulate a new citizen's environment initiative to encourage the growth of interest in these issues, with full consultation with voluntary bodies, local authorities, churches and other community groups". Mr Gummer went on to outline the three plans launched by the Prime Minister today as a result of commitments he made at Rio. He Said: "'Sustainable Development: The UK Strategy' sets out, by environmental resource and by economic sector, our position today and projections of where we might be in twenty years on current policies. It looks at the principles of sustainable development, at the problems and opportunities which we face in the UK and internationally, and at the processes we have, or which we could develop, for implementing these principles and for monitoring progress.'' "With the publication of 'Climate Change: A UK Strategy', Britain is giving a lead in showing what can and must be done to tackle the threat of global warming. The Climate Change Convention places a number of obligations on countries. Chief among these for developed countries is to take measures aimed at returning emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2000. I believe Britain is the first country in the world to demonstrate under the Convention how it will do this for each of the main greenhouse gases.'' "The programme also looks ahead beyond 2000 and sets out some of the longer term options for action that may need to be considered in the light of the emerging scientific evidence and the further development of the Convention. New and difficult choices, affecting every one of us, may have to be made if we are to avoid the risk of altering the climate of our planet in ways which could have serious implications for future generations.'' "This is the first time that a UK Government has produced a document drawing together programmes and targets for the conservation of wildlife and habitats. The publication of 'Biodiversity: The UK Action Plan' demonstrates our commitment to the Biodiversity Convention. The central tenet of the Convention is that action must be taken to halt the world wide loss of animal and plant species and genetic resources.'' "To accelerate progress, we will set up a Steering Group, with representatives from central and local government, agencies, collections, academic bodies and other non-governmental organisations. This Steering Group will oversee the development of a range of targets for biodiversity. The UK has a real contribution to make to the richness of the world's wildlife; this Action Plan sets out a strategy for the next 20 years, challenging us to take action now to enable our children and future generations to enjoy the countryside and landscapes which are the natural heritage of this country.'' "We need a sense of urgency as well as a realisation of the need for global involvement. Urgency because time is running out. And global involvement because without it the efforts of individual nations will be undermined by those who refuse to shoulder their proper burdens. The United Kingdom is determined to make sustainable development the touchstone of its policies. We recognise that this means a change of attitudes throughout the nation. That change cannot be achieved overnight, but that gives no grounds for defeatism -- it should instead act as a spur to action. These documents are only the beginning. Year by year we shall need to revise and refine our policies so that our economy can grown in a way which does not cheat on our children." Notes for Editors The Prime Minister made a commitment on his return from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED or the Earth Summit) held in Rio in June 1992 that the UK would prepare a national plan on sustainable development by the end of 1993 and submit a report to the new UN Commission on Sustainable Development. The other EC and G7 countries subsequently made a similar commitment. These commitment follow on from Agenda 21, the action programme agreed at UNCED, which called for national sustainable development strategies to be adopted and for reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 to be made to the new UN Commission on Sustainable Development. The most widely accepted definition of sustainable development is that given in the report of the 1987 World Commission on Environment and Development (the "Bruntland" report): "Humanity has the ability to make development sustainable - development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." The Strategy contains an examination of environmental media and resources, both now and projected forwards over 20 years on current policies (air, atmosphere, water, land, soil, minerals, wildlife and population); a consideration of economic development and sustainability (including transport, agriculture, energy, business, waste development and construction, and leisure); and a discussion on putting sustainability into practice (ways in which different sectors of society can contribute to achieving sustainable development, including fundamental instruments such as science and research, the planning system, and the three new measures for encouraging participation and discussion on sustainable development). The Strategy follows a year of consultation between central government Departments, local authorities, businesses, voluntary groups, academics, scientists and the general public in the UK. This has included: -- a seminar in Oxford in March 1993, with over 100 attendees of whom around 70 were from outside central government; -- a wide range of meetings between government officials from a number of Departments and representatives of other organisations; -- a consultation paper issued in July 1993 and sent to over 6,000 groups and individuals, to which more than 500 responses were received.
