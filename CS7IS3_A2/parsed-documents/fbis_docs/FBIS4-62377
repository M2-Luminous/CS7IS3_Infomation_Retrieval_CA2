Our newspaper's editorial office has received a large number of letters in which our readers basically pose the following questions: When will the Russian Federation Government be able to redeem the interest-free consumer goods bonds (against automobiles, television sets, refrigerators, etc.) purchased by citizens in 1990? The period for redeeming the bonds ran out in 1993, and over this period the invested money has become devalued and confidence in the government has been falling. Will deposits made in Savings Bank accounts before the beginning of price liberalization be indexed, and if so, when? Letter to Editorial Office Like the editorial office of your newspaper, the Russian Federation Government receives quite a few letters in which Russian citizens ask questions about the fate of the 1990 state targeted interest-free loan bonds for consumer goods. In 1990 the USSR Government issued bonds equal in value to the price of the corresponding consumer goods. It was envisaged that these bonds would be redeemed during 1993 by releasing the consumer goods -- cars, motorcycles with sidecars, color television sets, compact tractors, videorecorders, two- and three-compartment refrigerators, microwave ovens, "Zig-Zag" sewing machines, "Vyatka-Avtomat" washing machines, and personal computers. Russian citizens acquired 3,654,000 bonds for various types of commodities, including 143,700 for cars. With conditions of strict state regulation of production and distribution of output (in accordance with quotas and stocks under a system of fixed prices), and taking into consideration the prospects for further growth in output of consumer goods in high demand, honoring the pledges the government had undertaken was feasible. With the transition to a new system of economic management (without state orders for the production and delivery to the consumer market of cars and cultural, consumer, and household goods) and the actual absence of a number of goods prevented the pledges being honored in 1993. For example, when 30,000 compact tractors were due in 1993 only 7,000 of them were produced, likewise the figures for videorecorders were 588,000 and 268,000 respectively. Apart from this, centralized deliveries of certain types of goods from former union republics stopped (like, for example, "Tavriya" automobiles from Ukraine and "Minsk" refrigerators from Belorussia [Belarus]), for which bonds had also been issued. The Russian Federation Government is preparing a package of documents which would allow a resolution of the problem by redeeming all types of state goods bonds with a partial indexation of their face value based on the federal budget's actual potential. Specifically, the Russian Federation Government adopted 16 April 1994 Decree No. 344 "On State Goods Bonds," in accordance with which the Finance Ministry will redeem holders' 1990 targeted interest-free loan bonds for domestically produced consumer goods (apart from for cars) in accordance with present consumer prices, and for cars at 60 percent of their price. It will also pay off liabilities in respect of pledges to suppliers of agricultural output from the 1991 harvest. All these measures will be taken between 15 June 1994 and 1 June 1995 using the federal budget's assets. In the draft 1994 budget 2 trillion rubles have been set aside to redeem bonds. That is, despite all the difficulties, the government has found an opportunity to repay its debt to the citizens of Russia. The second set of questions concerns the indexation of people's deposits in the Russian Savings Bank. This is an important though fairly complex problem. Clearly, everyone understands well that to instantly restore the deposits' value might lead to an abrupt boosting of inflationary processes. Moreover, the state does not today have at its disposal the necessary financial resources to index all the deposits realistically. In connection with this, one possible way of resolving the problem is to transfer state property, state enterprises' shares, and land to the depositors. But time is needed to identify the items of state property, part of whose value could be transferred to offset the depositors' losses, and to establish the conditions and time scales for their transfer, that is, it is impossible to carry out full and immediate indexation at the moment. But the government is resolving these questions too. In accordance with the Russian Federation Government's plan for immediate action, which was confirmed by Russian Federation Government Decree No. 192 of 9 March 1994, the Russian Ministry of Finance, the Russian State Committee for the Management of State Property, the Russian Ministry of Economics, and the Russian Ministry of Social Protection of the Population have been entrusted with the task of preparing the necessary normative acts on these questions in May of this year.
