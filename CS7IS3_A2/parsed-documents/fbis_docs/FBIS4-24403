Chang Hsiao-yen, chairman of Taiwan's cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, told a delegation of Hong Kong journalists last week that Beijing was behind the government's decision to reclaim the village where many Kuomintang soldiers have lived since the communists took over the mainland in 1949. He said Taiwan was dissatisfied with compensation made by the British Hong Kong Government for those forced out of their homes. "I believe Beijing has given very heavy pressure to the Hong Kong Government," said Mr Chang, a son of former Taiwan strongman and president Chiang Ching-kuo and grandson of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. He said Beijing would not tolerate a sea of Taiwan's national flags flying on the territory after 1997. However, he said Taiwan would not retreat from Hong Kong after 1997 despite its reversion to mainland rule. Mr Chiang vowed to continue Taiwan's presence. "To think that the government is retreating from Hong Kong is absolutely wrong," he said. "Instead, we are considering expanding and strengthening our presence and our services to our compatriots there but we should make some changes in our approach to business." Mr Chiang said the Taiwan Government would not make any changes to its policy towards Hong Kong after 1997 and would continue its economic, trade, cultural, and educational exchanges with the territory. "We will not make changes to any of our policies concerning relations with Hong Kong and we will spare no effort to continue to assist the territory to maintain the present conditions after Beijing's takeover," he said. Mr Chiang said freedom and democracy were two of the most important and basic elements that the territory should be allowed to preserve, adding that that was the ruling Kuomintang's basic policy towards Hong Kong. However, Hong Kong affairs would be under the jurisdiction of another cabinet-level ministry instead of under Mr Chiang's commission after 1997.
