The men, mostly former soldiers of the South African Defense Force or former members of Koevoet [Crowbar; Namibia police counterinsurgency unit], returned to South Africa at the beginning of this year when they found they were not only supposed to train Angolan soldiers, but also fight against UNITA. The operation in Angola is believed to be under the command of former members of the Civil Cooperation Bureau [CCB]. Executive Outcomes is alleged to be hiring former South African soldiers under the pretext of training soldiers in Angola and guarding the oil refineries. They receive salaries of between 7,300 and 14,000 rands, paid in U.S. dollars. Eben Barlow, Nico Palm, and Lafras Luitingh are among the people running Executive Outcomes. Mr. Barlow is the director, and Mr. Palm is the financial manager. Mr. Luitingh, former CCB member, was the "handler" of Mr. Ferdi Barnard, a former CCB member accused of having killed human rights activist, David Webster. Reliable sources have disclosed to BEELD that the men employed by Executive Outcomes heard at the beginning of January that they had to fight against UNITA as well. A group of about 20 refused to carry out the instruction and were sent back to South Africa. Another group was also sent back about three weeks later because they had also refused. It is also alleged they were told that they would be "eliminated in a natural manner" should they talk about what is going on in Angola. A Namibian newspaper reports that UNITA itself had said that it had shot dead 12 South African mercenaries. One of them was Lieutenant Steyn Marais, who had grown up in Namibia and served five years in the South African Defense Force's reconnaissance commando.
