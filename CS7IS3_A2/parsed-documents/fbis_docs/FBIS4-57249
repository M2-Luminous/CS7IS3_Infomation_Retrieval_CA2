FBIS4-57249 "drlat094_o_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 Colombia Failed Assassination of Santander Governor Reported Failed Assassination of Santander Governor Reported PA1505133094 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1737 GMT 14 May 94 PA1505133094 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Army has revealed that it found at least five remote-controlled bombs, which guerrillas planned to set off today on the helicopter of Santander Department Governor Juan Carlos Duarte. According to the military report, the bombs had been planted by the rebels on the runway at the terminal area of Malaga, located some 370 km from Santa Fe de Bogota. Governor Duarte and his entourage were scheduled to land in Malaga. According to Army sources, after the bombs were detected in Malaga, authorities decided to divert Duarte's plane. The source added that five suspects were captured in connection with this failed action. The Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board [CNGSB], made up of 12,000 combatants, is engaged in an offensive to hinder the 29 May presidential elections. As a result, the incident in Malaga has not been ruled out to be associated with the sabotage campaign by the CNGSB. The report indicates that the Army of National Liberation -- a CNGSB group -- operates in the Garcia Rovira area, where the attempt against Duarte was planned. Duarte, who was preparing to inaugurate various social welfare projects in the area, said that despite the failed attempt, he will continue touring the department. Santander is among the most unstable departments nationwide. According to the source, the Army arrested four guerrillas and seized weapons and political propaganda in Antioquia Department during operations to guarantee normal elections on 29 May. Two years ago, the CNGSB chose not to participate in peace negotiations held by the government of President Cesar Gaviria in Tlaxcala, Mexico because of disagreements on the agenda to be discussed.
