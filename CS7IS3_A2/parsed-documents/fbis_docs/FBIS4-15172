As we have already reported, in most of the districts not even a miserly 25 percent of voters went to the polling stations 20 March. Matters were saved by the servicemen, whom A. Sobchak had first deprived of electoral rights and then later granted again. He used his own authority to extend the elections by a further 24 hours. The soldiers and cadets were led in orderly fashion to the ballot boxes but.... A few days later the city electoral commission announced the figures: How many voters were on the lists and how many had gone to vote. It emerged that in approximately half the districts slightly more than 25 percent of citizens had turned out and consequently the second round of voting would be held here. Meticulous journalists nonetheless did a recount -- and did not get 25 percent. A day later the city electoral commission produced different, "improved," figures. Then 10 electoral blocs, movements, and parties issued a joint statement demanding that the elections be considered invalid. Incidentally, the elections were "valid" almost exclusively in districts where members of the "Democratic Unity" bloc (a pseudonym of "Russia's Choice") were running and it was they who came out ahead. The city prosecutor's office meanwhile lodged a protest at the results and Mayor A. Sobchak admitted on television that the elections were invalid but... immediately scheduled the second round of voting for 3 April. The city awaited with interest the decision of the city court, to which the city prosecutor's office had appealed, demanding that A. Sobchak's directive on extending the elections be repealed. The case seemed clear: The mayor had no right to extend the elections since the Russian president had authorized him to scheduled just one single day for them. In turn the mayor's side asserted: If he issued the statute on elections himself then he can make any amendments to it. The mayor's lawyers avoided the question of whether these amendments might contradict the president's edict. The court decided they could. And it rejected the prosecutor's office's claim. The prosecutor's office lodged an appeal with the Russian Supreme Court. Meanwhile the start of the second act had been announced. But a turnout of 25 percent at the polling stations was by no means compulsory 3 April. As the newspaper NEVSKOYE VREMYA wittily noted, in theory just one person could go to the polls, that would be enough. It cited interesting statistics from which it emerged that the overwhelming majority of St. Petersburg's population was quite unable to support the present authorities. Thus the St. Petersburg authorities have done everything to ensure that the results of the elections, given a more serious attitude toward them on the part of the law enforcement organs, can be annuled at any moment.
