The public deficits, foreign deficits, and inflation that have been accumulating for years ended up surfacing in a foreign exchange crisis...and devaluation of the Turkish lira, resignation of the Central Bank president, and the rapid rise of bank interest. Is the crisis temporary? What will the effects of it be, and what measures should be taken because of the crisis? We asked for answers to these questions from Prof Dr Salih Neftci, who drew up a draft stabilization package for TUSIAD [Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen's Association] two years ago, and former DPT [State Planning Organization] Under Secretary Yildirim Akturk, who was on the team that applied the 24 January measures. Both offered prescriptions that differed from others by their "radical" approaches. Neftci said that, first of all, it would be impossible for the economy's own balances to pull it out of the current impasse. He stressed that a stabilization package is definitely required and that timing of the package is more important than content. Prof Dr Salih Neftci's views follow: --It is too early as yet for a stabilization package. For Turkey to accept a painful prescription it will be necessary for the crisis to deepen and for inflation to reach three digits. The crisis will deepen within one and a half to two years. Any stabilization package whose implementation would be attempted up until this time would inevitably fail. --Stabilization packages are a price that all segments of society have to pay. Today everybody is saying, "Okay, a stabilization package is absolutely necessary." Everyone throws the ball into someone else's court when it comes to shouldering the cost. Which means that no one wants to make the sacrifice yet for a stabilization package. --All of the stabilization packages on the agenda at the moment are similar. However, it is necessary that this stabilization package concept not be allowed to degenerate. Stabilization packages have to be radical in content. When the crisis hits bottom there may be a question of 300,000 public employees being left jobless, provided they are given compensation. There may be a midnight decision to shut down a bunch of KIT's [State Economic Enterprises]. All segments of society must be prepared for this kind of decision. --An important feature of stabilization packages is that society must have confidence in the people who head up this matter. Bearing in mind that the decisions they make will not take effect in the short term, all must recognize that the prescription cannot go forward without confidence in those who will be implementing it. --Attention must be paid to another very important point in moving so rapidly towards the stabilization-package stage. It is necessary to prevent the great losses that the government could cause, in foreign loans in particular. If Turkey could not honor its foreign exchange obligations, a credibility crisis would occur in which no stabilization package could alleviate the burden of this economy. Akturk's "painful prescription," meanwhile, contains the following measures: --Turkey has reached the point of an impasse under the influence of mistaken policies that have been pursued since 1988. Military spending went up. Black holes were created. You get lost if you get into a black hole. Yet the governments were positive in order to appear fashionable. --This tableau created an ever-worsening illness. The tumor grew rapidly. The scalpel is the only remedy. It cannot be done without the knife. It cannot be done with drugs. We have to cut the tumor out to eradicate it. --The state, employers, workers, farmers, and business must sit down together now and work out a compromise. --Goals must be discussed, starting with inflation. Agreement must be reached on reducing inflation step by step to 45 percent the first year, 35 percent the second year, 20 percent the third year. --The state must set a goal of 50 percent interest on borrowing. Price increases in commodities must be at this rate also. The need for government borrowing must be reduced. Price increases are the way to do this. The rate must be reduced from 20 percent to 12 percent. --As regards taxes, a system like advance taxation is necessary. Tax collection should be turned over to the private sector to increase tax revenues. Bonded financial consultants are capable of doing this. --The most important element is wage-related. Wages and productivity must be linked. The message must be given that wages will decline in businesses that suffer losses. Urgent reduction of cadres is necessary. Only required employees must remain. --Some of the KIT's must be closed. Severance pay for personnel working at the KIT's up for sale, such as Sumer Bank, should be converted to shares, and employees should become partners in these businesses. --Politicians cannot achieve this alone. The police regime must be given up. It is necessary for everyone to sacrifice. A solid determination is necessary. This can be resolved only by an above-party compromise. It does not seem possible for this government to take stabilization measures, at least until the local elections. --The country will be saved if after the elections we get an extraordinary government able to assume political responsibility and if a workable cadre is formed that will last for a year. Otherwise, inflation will reach three digits within a year, and Turkey will have serious payment difficulties.
