This is an excerpt of the formal protest note: It textually reads: According to the results of the preliminary investigations conducted by the appropriate organizations, it has been established that once the aircraft illegally entered Colombian territory, its crew began stopping and detaining Colombian nationals, mistreating them, and taking away their belongings. This is a violation of international and internal norms protecting the sovereignty and integrity of states and private property. After the incidents mentioned above, the Colombian nationals who were being held were forced to board the helicopter that later crashed, injuring some of them. The formal protest note adds: The Colombian Government, in condemning these incidents, is attentively awaiting the results of the investigation. It hopes the results will enable authorities to determine who was responsible, as well as to impose severe punishment on those responsible in order to avoid situations in the future that could tarnish the existing atmosphere of understanding between our peoples and governments. Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin will turn over to the Venezuelan Government the protest on the violation of Colombian airspace and territory following the incident with the Venezuelan National Guard helicopter, which crashed in the Puerto Rico area in Arauca Department. The foreign minister asked authorities to investigate and punish those found responsible for abuses committed against peasants in the region. Even though the diplomatic language was one of mutual praise and the incident was played down, Colombia gave the Venezuelan authorities the evidence gathered by the Prosecutor General's Office and the Defense Ministry. Meanwhile, Venezuelan Defense Minister Radames Munoz said the incident was due to mechanical problems with the helicopter and added that Colombian sovereignty was not violated and peasants were not mistreated. Finally, there was a border commission meeting in Caracas. Members reviewed the report drafted by Deputy Pompeyo Marquez in which it was revealed that along the 2,000-km border there are more than 70 areas where conflicts have occurred.
