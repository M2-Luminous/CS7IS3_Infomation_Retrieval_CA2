Mr. Salim has four days to negotiate with political forces on the dispatching of about 200 OAU soldiers. The deployment of the pan-African military mission was requested by the Burundi Government after the failure of the military coup attempt last October. The first elements of the OAU mission arrived last month but the force charged with the protection of the government and the reestablishing of trust has yet to be set up. Violent demonstrations were organized recently in the Burundi capital, Bujumbura, against the deployment of foreign troops.
