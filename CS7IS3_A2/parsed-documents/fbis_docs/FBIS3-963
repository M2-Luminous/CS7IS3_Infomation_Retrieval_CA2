UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim told reporters that the rebel movement no longer considered power sharing central to the issue of the talks. He said that UNITA did not want to gamble everything away by insisting on a few ministerial positions which the government were not prepared to give. The most important issue, he said, from UNITA's point of view, were guarantees that the opposition would be able to participate freely in the country's politics. [passage omitted]
