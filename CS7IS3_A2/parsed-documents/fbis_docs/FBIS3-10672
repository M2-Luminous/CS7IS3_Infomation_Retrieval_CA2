Very well-informed military sources made this announcement because no official information is available at the ministry. The estimated budget reductions are as follows: Army: 17 percent, which is equivalent to approximately 3 billion bolivares; Navy: 11 percent, which is equivalent to about 700 million bolivares; Venezuelan Air Force: 7 percent, which is equivalent to 400 million bolivares; and Armed Forces of National Cooperation: 16 percent, which is equivalent to about 2.4 billion bolivares. Reports indicate that Rear Admiral Panayotis Francis Sanchez was the officer tasked with making the estimated reductions, but it was not explained why, in certain cases, the reductions were higher than the recommended 10 percent. There is hope the figures will be reduced somewhat due to the ongoing war against narcoguerrillas, Colombian brigands, and Brazilian gold prospectors on the Brazilian- Colombian border, especially when the National Armed Forces is being urged to comply with its duties of providing protection and security in areas that are so far away that they are nearly inaccessible and where millions are spent in fuel flying and navigating for hours. This reduction will affect the four components of the military forces. It will supposedly affect their operation as little as possible and funds for gasoline, food, supplies, and preventive and operational maintenance programs will be left untouched. Reports indicate there are no plans for acquisitions this year. There is no indication whether allocations to buy artwork, pay bonuses and representational expenses, remodel offices, maintain and remodel the "El Cielo" ministerial residence and the main residences and summer residences of the general commanders, and pay the salaries of household personnel at these residences will be reduced or eliminated. There is also no indication whether there will be reductions in allocations for military health, especially when military hospitals throughout the country are facing problems of scarcity and private medical care is so expensive. No explanation was given on whether the reduction will affect the execution of the main maintenance contract for missile frigates hulls, which was approved and signed by the Navy, Congefan [National Armed Forces Comptroller General's Office], and the national Attorney General's Office. It is possible the National Guard [GN] will be the most affected because the "secret funds," which are mostly used to cover salaries and to partly pay for intelligence work, were reduced. Therefore, some GN training schools will be closed to avoid expenses because there will not be enough funds to pay for new salaries. It is hoped the GN budget reduction will be reconsidered and reduced to at least one fourth of what was proposed so as not to affect the GN training.
