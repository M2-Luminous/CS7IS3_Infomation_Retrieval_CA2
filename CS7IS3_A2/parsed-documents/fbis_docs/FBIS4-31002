The leaders of the coalition say the Constitution was violated when on May 13 parliament rejected the structural changes in the government moved by the prime minister, and the latter did not tender his resignation. Following a regular meeting of the leadership of the ex-communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), Doncho Konakchiev MP said he could not rule out the possibility of the Socialists moving a no-confidence vote in the cabinet. "It all depends on the cabinet's performance and meeting of commitments," he said. "For the SDS it is beyond doubt the Lyuben Berov cabinet's staying in office violates constitutional order," SDS leader Filip Dimitrov told a press conference following a regular meeting of the SDS leadership. "The SDS decided to stand out against the attempt to trample on the Constitution and keep the government in power," he said. He said the coalition decided there was no reason for maintaining the status quo. The SDS MP's will not take part in plenary sittings. Dimitrov, however, said the faction will enter the debating chamber in new cases of violation of the Constitution. Asked if the SDS will take part in the passage of bankruptcy and scheme-of-arrangement laws, Dimitrov said decisions will be made for each individual case. The coalition will expand extraparliamentary activities, and calls rallies on the Persin Island (on the Danube) on June 4 and in Sofia on June 7. Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva today had a telephone conversation on parliament's legislative work. According to Chief BSP Press Officer Klara Marinova, the prime minister guaranteed he would personally take part in parliamentary debates on amendments to the Privatization Act, a BSP priority. According to Konakchiev, BSP will urge parliament to discuss probable changes in the Constitution and a new election law before its summer recess. SDS leader Dimitrov said changes in the Constitution were a complex issue.
