Market dealers said they had anticipated the surge as the Bank of Japan was seen buying the dollar actively to stem its plunge against the yen in the reporting month. The foreign reserves include convertible foreign currencies, gold and international monetary fund special drawing rights. The official, as usual, declined to comment on details and reasons for the change in the foreign reserves. Market experts closely follow fluctuations in foreign reserves as evidence of intervention by the Bank of Japan. Dealers said the central bank bought billions of dollars in February to stop the yen's rise, boosted by speculation over U.S. comments tolerating a stronger yen after the February 11 failure of the Japan-U.S. "framework" trade talks. The ministry official said the dollar started the month at 108.00 yen and ended at 104.30 yen, ranging from 101.90 yen posted on February 15 to 109.16 yen marked on February 7. Japan remained the world's largest holder of foreign reserves for the fourth month in a row, amassing 95.6 billion dollars as of December, the most recent comparable figures with other nations. Taiwan came in second with 84.5 billion dollars as of November. In December, Germany posted 82.5 billion dollars, the United States 74.9 billion dollars and Spain 41.8 billion dollars, the official said.
