Approval of this proposed change does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Removal of the Amendment 50 and SER operating limits for Unit 1 does not provide a mechanism which could result in a new or different kind of accident. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture event would be expected in a SG in which the IPC has been applied. ComEd has implemented a maximum leakage rate limit of 150 gallons per day (gpd) through any one SG to help preclude the potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The RG 1.121 criterion for establishing operational leakage rate limits that require plant shutdown are based upon leak-before-break considerations to detect a free span crack before potential tube rupture during faulted plant conditions. The 150 gpd limit will provide for leakage detection and plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that is associated with the longest permissible free span crack length. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operation due to the proximity of the TSP to the tube and the potential exists for the crevice to become uncovered during MSLB conditions, the leakage from the maximum permissible crack must preclude tube burst at MSLB conditions. Thus, the 105 gpd limit provides for plant shutdown prior to reaching critical crack lengths for MSLB conditions. As SG tube integrity will continue to be maintained upon approval of this amendment request through inservice inspection and primary-to-secondary leakage monitoring, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated is not created. 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Braidwood Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 imposed a 100 calendar days with T hot greater than 500 ○F operating limit on Unit 1. This limitation was a consequence of the amount of MSLB leakage predicted in Braidwood Station's April 30, 1994, submittal. These predictions were made using the Log-Logistic method of draft NUREG 1477, with the Dose Equivalent Iodine-131 limit of Specification 3.4.8 reduced from 1.0 μCi/gm to 0.35 μCi/gm. However, WCAP 14046, docketed June 10, 1994, as required by Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal, has shown using the EPRI Leakrate Correlation that projected EOC&hyph;5 MSLB leakage is 3.1 gpm which is less than the allowable limit of 9.1 gpm for Braidwood Unit 1. This analysis is discussed in detail in WCAP&hyph;14046. Thus the Unit 1 operating limit imposed by Amendment 50 on the basis of MSLB leakage is no longer required. In addition to the 100 day, leakage based limit, the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC) Safety Evaluation Report (SER), issued May 7, 1994, in support of Braidwood Station's Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 discusses a 4.6 month (138 day) limit derived from a deterministic assessment of SG tube burst probability. To address the issue of tube burst for full cycle operation Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal provided a probabilistic risk assessment which is restated below. As part of ComEd's evaluation of the operability of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5, a risk evaluation was completed. The objective of this evaluation was to compare core damage frequency, with containment bypass, with and without the interim plugging criteria applied at Braidwood 1. ComEd has evaluated the impact of operation using the proposed interim plugging criteria against the results of insights from the draft Braidwood IPE. Braidwood Station is scheduled to docket its IPE June 30, 1994. Byron Station's IPE was docketed April 20, 1994. The SG sections of these documents are identical. While the Braidwood IPE is not in its final form, it is believed that the quantification in hand is sufficiently robust to allow a validation assessment of the impact of such operation. The ComEd evaluation parallels that described in the NRC Staff's SER for Palo Verde Unit 2 dated August 19, 1993. The values calculated in WCAP&hyph;14046, for BOC 5 and EOC 5 using 0.6 POD were used to develop a cycle average burst probability. Another BOC 5 burst probability assuming a POD of 0.6 for indications less than 3 volts and 1.0 for indications greater than 3 volts was used to evaluate the impact of POD on core damage frequency. The total Braidwood core damage frequency is estimated to be 2.74E&hyph;5 per reactor year with a total contribution from containment bypass sequences of 2.9E&hyph;8 per reactor year in the current IPE. Operation with the alternate repair criteria with a variable POD is expected to increase the MSLB with containment bypass sequence frequency contribution by a factor of only 10%. An upper bound increase of a factor of two is derived when the fixed POD of 0.6 is employed in the calculation. Neither increase is significant from a risk perspective. The reason for a reduced core damage frequency with a higher POD is that large voltage indications have a high assurance of being identified and removed from service during inspection. Therefore, the calculation of burst probability during MSLB changes because of differences in the assumed distribution of indications left in service at BOC. The EOC burst probability also changes because the growth distribution is added to the new BOC distribution of indications. The result of this change is a significant reduction in burst probability during MSLB. Therefore, the operation of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5 for a complete 18 month fuel cycle with the application of the one volt IPC does not significantly increase the core damage frequency even with the conservative assumption of a POD of 0.6 and application of the full growth rate distribution observed during Cycle 4.
