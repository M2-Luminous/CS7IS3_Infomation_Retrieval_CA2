[passage omitted] At the ceremony, Sr. Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the SLORC and commander of the Defense Services, acted as a chairman while Lieutenant Colonel Pe Nyein, director general of the Office of the SLORC, acted as master of ceremonies. [passage omitted] Continuing, he said the Ministry of Progress of Border Areas and National Races and Development Affairs was founded, and this ministry was given the sole responsibility to implement the development activities. The separate ministry was founded because the government has a genuine goodwill for the rapid development of our people. We are carrying out these development activities because we want the people in the remote areas to be like us. These development activities are being implemented with this objective. We are in a position to implement these activities, and some people understand about this. That is why the armed organizations are joining us. At the same time, there are some armed organizations who have yet to understand our efforts. That is why we, with genuine goodwill, are inviting these remaining groups at the present by making the utmost efforts. However, we have a problem because the fixed political belief still prevails among our national races and the armed organizations. That is, the enemy still sticks to the old political idea that its enemy is weak or there is a withering of strength within its enemy, and it can exploit politically and militarily when its enemy makes a proposal for negotiations and for making peace. We honestly invited them, but they still continue to hold on to the old political idea by thinking that we are facing crises and problems, and they can establish political and military exploitation; they ignored the development of their own country, and they are trying to exploit the situation to benefit their own party or organization. They do not understand. That is why we are patiently inviting certain organizations. For instance, we are still inviting the KNU [Karen National Union] and Mon. We are inviting them with good intentions and goodwill. We are doing so not because we do not have enough strength. We are doing it to stop the bloodshed and killing among the national races. Our country obtained independence more than 40 years ago. What is going to be the position of our people in the present situation? Although our country is rich, we are poor due to the lack of peace and unity. If our country is peaceful, and all of us work together, then our people will become prosperous, and our country will become a peaceful and modern state because of the wealth of our country. We have been fighting for about 40 years. We are all national brothers. Enough is enough. One should see the mistakes by now. One should see the right things by now. One should consider the country. We should work for the development of our country. It is time to repay the historical debt owed the country because one should understand by now that even though there were chances for our country to become rich, it was left undeveloped because of the killings and fighting. By understanding this, one should say to oneself that we owe the country and will repay the historical debt by working toward the establishment of peaceful and modern state. However, some do not have this kind of goodwill. [passage omitted] The ceremony ended at 1000.
