The historic decision, announced by Supreme Court President Roberto Yepes Boscan, paves the way for a regular trial against Perez, twice president of Venezuela and former Socialist International vice president, for embezzlement, presumably committed at the beginning of his second administration in February 1989. In an unexpected move, Perez went to the Supreme Court "to obey the law" with former Interior Minister Izaguirre. Former Presidency Secretariat Minister Figueredo is either in the United States or in the UK, according to his lawyers. The former president, who is 71, said upon arriving at the Supreme Court that the order was a "political decision." On 20 May 1993, the Supreme Court separated Perez from the presidency to begin a "pretrial of merits" for the same case in a judicial action that is unprecedented in modern Venezuelan history. The former president was arrested by the Judicial Technical Police and will be held in El Junquito Jail outside Caracas. Perez's detention marks another political landmark as he was elected president on a wave of popularity in 1974 and 1989 and portrayed himself as a charismatic leader with Third World connections, heading various international forums for South-South cooperation.
