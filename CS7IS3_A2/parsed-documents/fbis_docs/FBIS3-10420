However, he said that would not suffice to resolve the crisis. It is therefore necessary to reinforce the sanctions against the country. Furthermore, Ambassador Merimee says that a new draft resolution aimed at reinforcing the embargo was referred to the UN Security Council and that this draft resolution, which includes personal sanctions against the military, will become effective between now and next week. [Begin Merimee recording] Finally, we have a draft resolution that [words indistinct], which establishes personal sanctions [words indistinct]. There must be a government. But that would certainly not be sufficient to bring the situation to normal. This is why the council has decided to go into action. [end recording] It should be noted that a draft resolution providing for reinforcement of the international sanctions against Haiti was referred to the UN Security Council on 4 March by the group called Friends of Haiti. This draft resolution provides for a total commercial embargo except for food products and medicines, a ban on noncommercial flights to and from Haiti, and restrictions on travel abroad by the Haitian military and their close relatives. Those measures will reportedly add further to the oil and arms embargo that has been in effect. Except for the clauses relating to travel restrictions, they will reportedly be implemented immediately; the new sanctions will reportedly come into effect 15 days after the adoption of the resolution. If this text is accepted, it will be the first time the United Nations has imposed a total commercial embargo on Haiti. We recall that, in an article by Robert Novak and published on 2 March, THE WASHINGTON POST wrote that the effects of the embargo on Haiti are devastating and irreversible.
