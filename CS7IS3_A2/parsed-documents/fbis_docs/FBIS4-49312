Wu Jianmin made those remarks when answering a relevant question raised by a reporter. When asked by a reporter if China is worried about the United States' partial abolition of MFN treatment, involving -- for example -- sanctions against state-owned enterprises, Wu Jianmin reiterated that the awarding of the MFN status to each other by China and the United States is a reciprocal, mutually beneficial arrangement and a basis for normal trade interaction between the two countries. He pointed out: "Any move made by the U.S. side to sabotage this basis will cause serious consequences."
