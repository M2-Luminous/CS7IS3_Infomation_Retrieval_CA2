What Russian Parliamentarians Observing Conduct of Ukrainian Elections Saw"] [Text] The work of the first session of the new Ukrainian Supreme Council, which has just been formed has started in Kiev. Over 500 international observers monitored the conduct of the early elections that took place. They represented the United Nations, the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly, the Council of Europe, the European Parliament, NATO, other organizations, and individual countries. Our compatriots were also among them. A Russian delegation of eight deputies from various factions and the same number of State Duma experts observed the conduct of the Ukrainian Supreme Council elections. It was headed by Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Committee for CIS Affairs and Ties With Compatriots. The Russian parliamentarians worked in Kiev, Donetsk, Kharkov, Simferopol, Odessa, Lvov, and Uzhgorod. Our observers did not discover any serious violations capable of influencing the outcome of the elections and about which the Russian and world communities should have been warned. For them it was not such an important task to keep an eye on the ballot boxes. The Russian parliamentarians' aim was to get the feel of the Ukrainian political situation and, based on the experience gained, dealings with voters, and conversations with state and political leaders with diverse views, to help the State Duma establish a line of conduct and recommend a particular political course in Russian-Ukrainian relations. One of the Russian parliamentarians' main conclusions was that the Ukrainian elections did not take place in conditions of an acute socioeconomic crisis, which is so painfully familiar to us. Accordingly, both the first and second rounds of voting were won by candidates whose platforms were based on severe criticism of the old nomenklatura-bureaucratic regime and on promises to conduct a resolute struggle against social injustice and corruption in power structures in order to improve the people's lives and punish the guilty in the country's present grave situation; on promises to get away from the extremes of the epoch of fighting for sovereignty and absolute independence and to restore and strengthen trade and economic relations with Russia and the CIS as a whole. A characteristic feature of the elections that were held was that both rounds of voting, like the recent Russian elections, showed the complete groundlessness of apparently irrefutable predictions and easily destroyed the myths being persistently inculcated into people's consciousness. The main result and the first surprise to lovers of predictions was that the first round of elections was valid everywhere. While the second round provided the necessary number of people's deputies (this is precisely what they are still called in Ukraine). Of the 450 seats in parliament 338 have been filled, which by law enables it to start full-scale work. The 112 vacant seats will be filled after repeat elections, which are due to take place in two months. Voters turned out and dispelled the myth of the Ukrainian people's absolute passivity. To the surprise of many and even to the confusion of some, three-fourths of the country's citizens expressed their attitude to the candidates. As early as the first round yet another prediction -- about the clear domination of voters' centrist sentiments -- was dispelled. Centrist reformers, as in Russia recently, definitely did not achieve their expected success. Although Leonid Kuchma, Vladimir Lanovoy, and Sergey Golovatyy, their leaders from the interregional bloc for reforms, won convincingly in the first round, this was exclusively through their very high personal ratings. After all, even Stepan Khmara, the odious national-radical and leader of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party (he is being called the Ukrainian Zhirinovskiy), also won easily in the first round. Petr Simonenko and Aleksandr Moroz, leaders of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, also won outright. In general, contrary to all forecasts (the analogy with our elections again comes to mind) left-wing forces achieved undoubted success. Moreover, their lead over the other parties is very substantial. Thus, around half of the 338 elected deputies consider themselves to be independent, that is to say nonparty. Of the remainder, the Communists obtained 86 seats and their allies -- the Socialist Party and the Peasant Party -- another 32 seats. Next comes the "Ukraina" bloc of national-democratic parties, dominated by Rukh, and after that the placemen of ruling structures or the "parties of power," as they are called, and only then the centrists and radical-nationalists. Yet another myth was shattered. Prior to the start of the election race the local press marked down the "government parties" (several of them under various names) as supposed favorites and themselves maintained this myth. But now, having suffered an obvious lack of success, their leaders are stating that it is not a defeat but a retreat to previously prepared positions. Observers believe that this is simply an attempt to "make the best of a bad situation." At the same time the definite successes of highly extreme forces in the western oblasts are sounding the warning bells. Thus, UNA-UNSD (Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense) have gotten three of their leaders into parliament. Generally the rivalry among among a multitude of right-wing nationalist organizations and movement was won by the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists. It obtained a total of 23 seats. Admittedly it is still premature to make a final count. The percentage of "independent" deputies is too great. It cannot be ruled out that many of them will change their political orientation inside parliament. A more precise disposition of political forces can be determined only some time after the Supreme Council has started its work, when deputies' factions will be formed finally. It should not be forgotten that in the initial stages of the election campaign most candidates called themselves "independent" and it was only later, sensing that "one man does not make an army," that many of them took seats on a party platform of some kind. Not for nothing do most observers claim that, despite the absence of voting according to party lists, what took place in Ukraine was a multiparty election under a majority system. Incidentally, members of 39 registered parties and associations with an extremely diverse spectrum of convictions and platforms started the election marathon. Still, our observers have no doubt that the vector of public sentiments in Ukraine is obviously moving in a pro-Russian direction. This is not a speculative claim; the fact was confirmed beyond doubt by a Ukrainian national poll. Russia's position must be aimed at strengthening ties with Ukraine, but without harming its national and state dignity, on the basis of mutual respect and advantage.
