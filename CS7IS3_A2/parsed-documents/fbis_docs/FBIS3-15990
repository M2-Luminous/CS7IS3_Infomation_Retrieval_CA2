The campaign began earlier this year when ruling faction member Benas Rupeika alleged that the minister has relatives in some private timber export companies, which are granted considerable privileges compared to state-run timber exporters. Rupeika said there was no "adequate" reaction to his suppositions from the president and the premier. The situation at the Ministry of Forestry and its branches was investigated by the State Control Department, which found a number of violations in state timber trade. 40 signatures are enough to include a vote of no confidence in the parliament's agenda. But observers suppose that Kovalcikas will resign before his case is discussed in parliament. The minister earlier said he does not intend to give up his post and suspected attempts to defame him.
