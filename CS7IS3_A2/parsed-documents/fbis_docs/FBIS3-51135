The Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), the only labor movement on the island, pointed out in a press note that the process will take place in two stages and conclude with grass-roots meetings at labor centers. In the first stage more than 400,000 labor leaders will contribute their ideas and prepare for assemblies with union members, to which deputies of the National Assembly of the People's Government will be invited. Parliament did an initial analysis of internal finances on 28 December when it was officially revealed that the fiscal deficit will reach 4.2 billion pesos -- which is equivalent to the same figure in dollars based on the official exchange rate -- and that there is a 10-billion-peso excess in circulating currency. On that occasion the Legislative Branch did not adopt measures to tackle this situation, but the members agreed on the need to solve this delicate problem without resorting to neoliberal-type measures that involve high social costs. The CTC announcement coincided with an editorial in the weekly TRABAJADORES, mouthpiece of the labor union, that strongly attacks the formality of the Cuban labor movement. We can no longer bear, without growing impatient, the ritualistic and repetitive language of those who incessantly issue general slogans but fail to even touch the specific and objective reality that should be the basis for their actions, the publication underscored. It also urged the labor unions to participate in all political battles, to "assume an offensive stand everywhere," and to censure indolence and negligence, lack of control over costs and expenditures, and unpunished deviation of resources. These are among the things that the publication condemned, considering them to be "signs of capitulation." The weekly warned that the outcome of "the country's current epic" ... "compromises not only the fatherland's fate but also the workers' existence, decorum, dignity, and power." In this regard, the publication urged them to contribute solutions and to adopt measures, some of which, if finally approved, might not be popular -- reduction of payroll, elimination of certain gratuities, and elimination of certain subsidies within an economic system that is described as paternalistic. Labor unions in the capital city analyzed the issue for the first time over the weekend and agreed to focus their efforts on cost reduction and on obtaining higher net revenues. As for the rationalization of surplus employees, CTC Secretary General Pedro Ross pointed out that this process is based on convincing arguments and reasons, not on decrees. Ross said that there is a need to work with much prudence and to confront arbitrary actions. He added that labor union efforts with regard to the workers -- who are guaranteed a 60 percent subsidy on their salaries -- will include the organization, attention, and defense of their rights. In December, Parliament announced that special sessions would be held to discuss the country's financial situation following a broad analysis of the nation's social bases. At noon today Legislative Branch President Ricardo Alarcon said on a radio program that "the people will be the key player of these actions," but he did not give details on the date of the upcoming parliament meeting.
