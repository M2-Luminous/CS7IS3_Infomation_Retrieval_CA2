[0040 GMT] explosion at Budapest's Parliament. The two Dutch university students stopped by the police near the spot before the explosion had been at an international computer science conference, which had ended late at night. The students decided to do some sightseeing. At around 22.40, they wanted to take closer photos of the Parliament columns, so they climbed the fence. That was when police noticed them and asked for their passports. They were finally allowed to go. On Sunday [12 June], they were taken in by police to be questioned about what they had seen on Friday night. They have been released, having said they did not see anything related to the explosion. Police are conducting a major investigation. Latest analysis suggests the bomb was not detonated remotely, but by a factory-made timing device, so is unlikely to be the work of an amateur.
