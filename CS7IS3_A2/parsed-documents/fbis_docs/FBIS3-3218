Of these proposals, 63 were made by NPC delegations and the rest by deputies jointly. Various NPC special committees have prepared reports on how to handle these proposals and will submit their reports to the presidium of the current NPC session for deliberation. An official of the bill-handling group said that the bills cover a wide range of areas, with their focus on the economy. A considerable number of these bills deal with economic legislation, the official said. Bills calling for the enactment of a number of new laws, such as a futures trading law, an arbitration law, a credit law, a real estate law and a mineral resources law, have been included in the five-year legislation plan of the current NPC Standing Committee. He said that deputies also submitted many bills on the formulation of new economic laws on debt, mortgage and construction as well as a law against the reaping of staggering profits. Some bills stress the need to intensify the central bank's functions of exercising macro-economic controls. In their bills, many deputies said that measures to narrow the gap between developed eastern China and underdeveloped western China should be incorporated into a legal system for the establishment of a market economy. Moreover, they called for the enactment of a new economic law on how to assist underdeveloped areas in speeding up economic growth there, the official said. He said that many bills emphasize the importance of strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and protecting farmers' initiative. Several bills propose the enactment of a new law governing investment in agriculture, and the implementation of measures to curb price rises for farming-related manufactured goods, and to stabilize grain prices and narrow the difference between prices of farm products and manufactured goods, he said. The bills also call for the formulation of a new law concerning grain trade, another law on agriculture environmental protection and still another regarding the development of township-run enterprises, as well as the implementation of measures to tighten control over the use of resources and strictly protect farmland. Many other bills call for the enactment of new laws and revision of existing ones in order to maintain social stability, the official said. Deputies agreed that the building of a clean and honest government is closely related to the maintenance of social stability, he said. To this end, they called for the formulation of a new law to punish civil servants violating discipline, another law on compensation for parties involved in misjudged cases, and general rules governing law-enforcers. He said that many bills call for the revision of regulations on penalizing violators of public order, the enactment of an anti-narcotics law and the revision of existing laws to severely punish children abductors. Some bills call for the enactment of a new law concerning safety in production, a minimum wages law, a law on promoting employment, a law on pension insurance and a law on protecting aged people. Many deputies also called for the formulation of a new law to supervise the implementation of existing laws in an effort to facilitate the establishment of a socialist market economy. The official said that many bills deal with the promotion of ideological and cultural progress. For example, some deputies called for the enactment of a new law to manage the cultural market, another on higher education and still another on education input. Others proposed revising the compulsory education law. He said that some bills involve national defense and the protection of servicemen. The bill-handling group had also received 1,200 proposals made by deputies, he said.
