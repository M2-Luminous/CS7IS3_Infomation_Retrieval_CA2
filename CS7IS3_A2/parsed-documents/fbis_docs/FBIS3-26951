The Chinese team leader of the Joint Liason Group, Guo Fengmin, says Beijing has studied the fourth financial package but it needs to discuss the remaining problems with the Hong Kong Government. The latest package implies that the government will inject equity worth about 60,000 million dollars into the project. However, Mr Guo refused to say whether the problems relate to the size of the government's equity injection. He added that the Sino-British Airport Committee would discuss the land to be granted along the airport rail link and he hoped that the committee could meet soon.
