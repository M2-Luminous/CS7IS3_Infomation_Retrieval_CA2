The leaders of the "Russian All-National Union," the National Salvation Front, the Russian Communist Workers Party, and "Working Moscow," had coordinated their plans in terms of the time and place of mass actions of "protest against the 21 September-4 October 1993 coup d'etat." The demonstrations were meant to be timed to coincide with the opening of the State Duma, starting Sunday with a rally on Free Russia Square outside the White House. Then on Tuesday and Wednesday the plan was to picket the approaches to the Kremlin, conduct a mass rally on Lubyanka Square in the evening, and organize a procession of thousands through the city's main streets. As was announced 5 January at a City Hall meeting with representatives of the action's organizers, the Moscow government has made an area near the Russian White House available for a rally of up to 1,000 participants on 9 January. A mass rally cannot possibly be held 11 January on Lubyanka Square because of the inevitable disruptions and interruptions in the work of city transportation during the rush hour. "Sakharovskaya Ploshchadka" (No. 1) at Luzhniki is being made available instead. There will be no pickets outside the Kremlin or large processions along streets in downtown Moscow. Instead, 100 pickets may appear at the high-rise State Duma building on Novyy Arbat between 0900 and 1900 on 12 January.
