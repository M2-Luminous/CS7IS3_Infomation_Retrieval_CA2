Financial institutions affiliated with agricultural cooperatives are saddled with bad loans provided to housing loan companies. Admitting the existence of the secret arrangement, a senior Finance Ministry officials said two bureau chiefs of the ministry and the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry exchanged a memorandum in February 1993 promising that the central bank would extend necessary loans to the governmental Norinchukin Bank. In return, agricultural cooperative-affiliated financial institutions under the umbrella of Norinchukin Bank agreed to lower or exempt interest on their loans to housing loan companies. The financial institutions had been reluctant to take such action in view of its impact on their business. The bureau chiefs made the secret deal in the process of drawing up a relief package for Nippon Housing Loan Co., the nation's largest housing loan company, which has been ridden with large nonperforming loans. The deal was not announced at that time. The memo agreed to provide reductions and exemptions of loan interest to help the farm cooperative-affiliated financial institutions, the sources said. Such institutions provided 5.5 trillion yen in loans to the seven housing loan companies, accounting for about 40 percent of the total amount of borrowings of the housing loan companies. The memo said the BOJ would provide necessary loans to Norinchukin Bank because it was feared interest reductions and exemptions for housing loan companies could negatively affect farm cooperative-affiliated financial institutions. The seven housing loan companies -- Nippon Housing Loan Co., Japan Housing Loan Inc., Jyuso Inc., Diichi Housing Loan Co., Housing Loan Service Co., Sogo Jukin Co. and Chigin-Seihio Housing Loan Co -- are suffering due to bad loans worth 13.6 trillion yen to realtors.
