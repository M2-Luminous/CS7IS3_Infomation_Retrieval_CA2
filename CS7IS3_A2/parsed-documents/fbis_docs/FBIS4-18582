Draft legislation is to be tabled in parliament in the coming days, said Papathemelis, and will propose the establishment of powerful elite divisions in every department of the force--public order, security, traffic and consumer protection. The new system will be introduced as a pilot scheme next month in Athens, Thessaloniki and one regional town. Papathemelis said a national exam would be set for applicants seeking entrance to ordinary and officer police training schools. Under the new proposals, police staff-management relations will be brought in line with the rest of the civil service. Transfers will only be allowed to take place once every year. If the bill is passed without significant amendments, Papathemelis said negotiations would begin with union leaders to allow police officers union representation.
