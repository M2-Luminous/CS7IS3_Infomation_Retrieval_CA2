FR940325-2-00202 FR940325-2-00093 9. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to these standards. 10. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Directors/Trustees of the Funds with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the Directors/Trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Directors/Trustees. 11. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, service fees, sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The shareholder reports of such Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to the classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. If applicants provide information for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices, information for classes of shares will be provided separately. 12. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC approval, authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to 12b&hyph;1 Plans or shareholder servicing plans in reliance on the exemptive order. 13. Any automatic conversion of shares of one class into shares of another class will occur on the basis of the relative net asset values of the shares of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee in the aggregate to which they were subject prior to the conversion. 14. If a Fund implements any amendment to its 12b&hyph;1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by a class of shares subject to the plan (``Subject Shares''), existing shares of another class that would otherwise convert into Subject Shares (``Converting Shares'') will stop converting into Subject Shares unless the holders of the Converting Shares, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The Directors/Trustees of the Funds shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Converting Shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Subject Shares''), identical in all material respects to Subject Shares as they existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Subject Shares if such holders of Converting Shares do not approve such proposal and such proposal is approved by the holders of the Subject Shares and such material increase occurs. If deemed advisable by the Directors/Trustees of the Funds to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Converting Shares for a new class (``New Converting Shares''), identical to existing Converting Shares in all material respects except that New Converting Shares will convert into New Subject Shares. New Subject Shares or New Converting Shares may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the Directors/Trustees of the Funds reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Subject Shares or New Converting Shares shall be borne solely by the Advisers and the Distributor. Converting Shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Subject Shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Subject Shares plan and the relationship of such plan to the Converting Shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. 15. In the case of Funds adopting shareholder servicing plans, such plans will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders will not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 16. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act (Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988)), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
