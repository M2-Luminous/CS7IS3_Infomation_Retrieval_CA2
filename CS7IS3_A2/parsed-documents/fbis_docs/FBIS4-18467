"From today we are no longer going to the League or anywhere else. We do not betray trust. We will wait for the president of the republic to make a pronouncement", Berlusconi told journalists at his villa at Arcore near Milan, wiping out tomorrow's scheduled meeting between delegations of the League and Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement. Berlusconi said that if Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, at the end of his consultations with the forces that won the election, decided to give a Forza Italia member the job of forming a government, "the day after you would have a government programme, a team, and without any further consultation, we would go straight to parliament." "If that does not happen," he added, "let there be another election to complete the clean-up." According to the Italian constitution, the president has discretionary powers in deciding who should try to form a government. On this occasion, the three right-wing leaders -- Berlusconi, Bossi, and National Alliance secretary Gianfranco Fini -- were immediately seen as the victors, and talks began between the first two after Bossi appeared to tone down initially hostile remarks against the media magnate as premier and "the reactionary right" in government. Berlusconi persevered in talks with the League despite Bossi's broadsides against his alleged conflict of interests, the counter- proposal of League Lower House whip Roberto Maroni as premier, the announcement that the League leader will this week start separate talks with other parties, and Bossi's no-show for a key meeting on Friday [1 April]. Bossi's opposition to Berlusconi's lead role -- seen by some as bargaining to ensure the League's federalist platform is enacted -- culminated yesterday in his description of the media magnate as "a threat for democracy". Against this background, an SWG poll indicated that one in four League voters want Berlusconi as premier: 38 percent, just behind the 40 percent of National Alliance voters who said they wanted Berlusconi to lead the government. The poll, to be published Sunday [10 April] by Catholic weekly FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA, gave the following premier preferences for all those who voted the Freedom Front (Forza Italia + League) in the north, and the Good Government Front (Forza Italia + National Alliance) in the rest of the country: Berlusconi 43.5 percent, 27.7 percent Fini, 9.1 percent Maroni, 8.9 percent Bossi, and 5.3 percent former Italian president Francesco Cossiga, an ex-Christian Democrat seen by some as a possible right-wing peacemaker. Fini even edged out Berlusconi among young voters (18-34). Italian futures in London fell sharply immediately after Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi announced he was freezing all negotiations with his election allies, Northern League and National Alliance, indicating that talks aimed at forging a government coalition had reached a stalemate. Ten-year futures on the London computerized market, the only one still open, fell 70 cents to 112.50 lire from 113.20 lire a few minutes earlier. Berlusconi, who spoke for almost an hour without once mentioning Bossi, called the League's stance "a betrayal". "I think what is happening is scandalous", he said in reference to Bossi's announced decision to start talking to defeated centrist and left-wing forces (although the two prospective bargainers, electoral reform leader Mario Segni's Pact for Italy and the moderate intellectuals of Democratic Alliance, by this evening had received no formal invitation to Bossi's table). "Enough of this duplicity, these old tricks of the old politics," he said, stressing Italy's "urgent need" for a government to take Italy out of this "emergency phase". "We must feel responsibility for the mandate we have received from the electorate... If there is a betrayal, there would be only one response from me and from Forza Italia: go back to the polls to complete the clean-up". Stressing that he had never "put myself forward" as a candidate for the premiership, Berlusconi made it plain that "we have no fear of going back to the country". "It's time to put an end to the electorate being treated like goods to be bought or sold," he said. Lowering his tone slightly in response, Bossi repeated concerns about Berlusconi's alleged "autocratic" leanings but was optimistic that "in the end, we'll probably manage to make a government". His first comment on Berlusconi's decision was "it's rather odd, I think his nerves are frayed. Instead of responding on the grounds of the platform, he put all the accent on the fact that he's boss. We have said clearly that giving the mandate to Berlusconi would be like giving it to an autocrat because he does not have a political force behind him that can mediate." "In the end, we'll probably manage to make a government, but it must be clear that there is a great change," said Bossi, who has attacked Berlusconi as strongly as the left for alleged links with the "old regime". "People can see that Berlusconi broke off the talks over the fact that he wants to be boss. If, with all the problems this state has he thinks the main one is getting the premiership, then we weren't wrong to think that a `virtual reality' party means moving towards autocracy. We now have to save the general principles of democracy." "I think Berlusconi lost his temper, a typical reaction in those who are used to getting everything at once. But now he has the people to face up to, a most powerful force." "We are very determined, because we know how important it is for the country to break with the party-ocracy, or the mingling of business and politics." Earlier, Bossi had unveiled the new definition of the media magnate he said he was preparing for the League rank-and-file's Sunday meeting at their historic rallying-site at Pontida north of Milan: "Berluskaiser." He repeated the view that Berlusconi was "dangerous" because he had a "non-party" behind him -- a contention angrily denied by Forza Italia clubs, who claimed the spontaneous, grass-roots nature of the movement -- and expressed "no worries" about the prospect of League defections to Berlusconi. In a statement tonight, League whip Maroni -- Bossi's proposal for the premiership -- said that yesterday's appeal by Berlusconi to Leaguers to "keep faith" with the electorate should not be seen as an attempt to woo them into Forza Italia, but merely a reminder "not to make a government with the left -- something we never intended to do anyway". He echoed other Leaguers in expressing backing for Bossi's tactics "to extract the maximum possible" on the federalism front, while saying that the necessary "deep change" to the Constitution required "the widest possible involvement of other political forces." League Senate whip Francesco Speroni accused Berlusconi of "throwing a tantrum" so as to "get out of giving us an answer on federalism tomorrow," while League academic and apostle of the Swiss-style cantonisation of Italy, Gianfranco Miglio, expressed the view that "sooner or later, Berlusconi will come looking for us." National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini -- who had earlier, after a phone conversation with Berlusconi, reiterated the neo-fascists' line that "there can be no federalism unless Italy becomes a presidential republic," with the regions maintaining a "residual" role vis-a-vis central government -- said that Berlusconi's move "will help clear things up regarding Bossi, who was tabling talks on the government or about federalism, you couldn't tell which." "Berlusconi was right to have had enough of it: how could he keep talking to someone who went back on his word every day," he said. "The trick Bossi was trying on didn't work; he broke the eggs without making the omelette. Now he has to make up his mind what he wants to do when he grows up." In Fini's view the current political situation threw up three alternatives: a government between Forza Italia, the League, National Alliance, and Forza Italia's close allies in the (smaller ex-Christian Democrat) Democratic Christian Centre (CCD) and other small conservative forces; a government between the left, the (larger ex-Christian Democrat) People's Party, Segni's Pact, and the League; and a new round of elections. In the event of the third hypothesis, he said that "we would certainly be Berlusconi allies, but not Bossi," whom he said "was elected in Milan with the help of Forza Italia" and in another ballot "would end up like Segni, with a handful of seats." CCD leader Francesco D'Onofrio said that "Bossi's behaviour may mean one of two things: challenging the government majority up to a breaking point, which may come; or seeking an alternative majority, something that does not concern us." Franco Rocchetta, the League federal president who has incurred grass-roots wrath by criticising Bossi in the past, outlined the possibility of a "constituent government" drafting clear conflict-of-interest laws that might enable Berlusconi to take over the helm "in six months time, say." Another of the more moderate voices in the League, Milan Mayor Marco Formentini, said the issue of Berlusconi's premiership was secondary to the priorities of federalism and neo-liberalism, "to take Italy's state, economy and finance closer to the European Union." Rocchetta predicted that President Scalfaro will give Berlusconi an exploratory mandate, voicing the hope that this will lead to the formation of a government comprising "all the forces in the Freedom Front" to draft "strict laws that will enable a businessman to take on government responsibilities without shadowy areas remaining". He said that at the same time MPs "from all political forces, international jurists and the presidents of the regions" should form "a sort of third Chamber" to draw up Italy's new federalist constitution. Berlusconi meanwhile made clear that Forza Italia had never agreed to "constitutional federalism" as a condition for its electoral pact with the League, and had yet to receive a well-defined project from the League. He said Forza Italia's position had always been "crystal-clear and correct" in negotiating "fiscal federalism with the League and administrative decentralisation with the National Alliance." Berlusconi said he was in favour of setting up a committee of "ten wise men" to study the problem, but indicated that any recommendation they make must be submitted to the popular will by referendum. Berlusconi denied a newspaper report that he had "offered Bossi a deal to run the country for twenty years" (a reference to the duration of Mussolini's fascist regime), saying: "I never said anything of the sort. What I did say was that a deal on those programmes could bring ten years of prosperity to Italy. Why turn something noble into something ignoble, I ask." Raffaele Costa, leader of the small Centre Union (another Berlusconi ally) said he had spoken to Bossi and Berlusconi before the latter's announcement and had "got the impression that, albeit with certain conditions and despite appearances, the government coalition could get off the ground -- and soon too". He voiced the hope that Bossi would "accept an invitation to concentrate on the brass tacks of government programmes, rather than other assessments". Influential new right commentator Giuliano Ferrara -- a firebrand speaker from a regular slot on the Berlusconi channels -- said that "Bossi is doing what he's good at, playing with fire, but past experience has shown he is often the first to reach for the extinguisher". The (former Communist) Left Democrat party's No.2, Massimo D'Alema said the right-wing rift showed that Berlusconi had "deceived" the Italian people in "pretending" that his twin electoral pacts were based on an "accord to govern Italy, while it wasn't true". "Before talking about a new election the country is entitled to see if its vote produces a government. If they aren't able, the initiative should be passed to others. This is not the only majority possible in this parliament," he said on RAI-1 evening news. Interim People's Party leader Rosa Russo Jervolino issued a statement saying that "in a difficult and delicate moment, coherence and clarity must be the unavoidable characteristics of political action."
