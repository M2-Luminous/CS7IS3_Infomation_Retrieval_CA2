Fifteen political parties and organizations of Peru including the Socialist Revolutionary Party, the Communist Party and the National Association for the Study of the Chuche Idea of Peru released a joint statement on March 9 supporting the DPRK's just stand for a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The statement urged the United States to rescind the unreasonable preconditions and honestly implement the agreed steps of simultaneous action and denounced Japan and the South Korean authorities for stepping up their program of nuclear arms development, while balking the DPRK-U.S. talks for a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The Communist Party of Colombia issued a statement on March 8 strongly demanding that the United States fully implement the just steps of simultaneous action which oblige both the DPRK and the United States to do what they should. The Nigeria-DPRK Friendship Association in a statement March 10 said that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was an offspring of the Korean policy of the U.S. for isolating and stifling the DPRK. It stressed that if the issue was to be solved, the DPRK and the United States must successfully hold the third round of the talks on the principle of equality, impartiality and respect for sovereignty. The Nepalese paper CHALPAL March 6 said that no matter could be resolved by pressure and threat and that the basic way of solving the Korean question including the nuclear issue was dialogue and talks as insisted by the DPRK. Chairman of the Guyanese National Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea of Comrade Kim Il-song Robert Williams and former Chairman of the Nationalist Socialist Party of Syria in Lebanon David Baz released statements on March 8 urging the United States to promptly stop such despicable act as reversing its promise, setting preconditions again in the solution of the nuclear issue.
