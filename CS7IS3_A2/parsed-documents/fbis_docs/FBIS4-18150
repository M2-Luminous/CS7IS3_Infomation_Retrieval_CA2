I take advantage of your kindness today. Your first visit to Bulgaria is soon expected. What are your feelings in anticipating your Sofia visit? [Ciller] Apart from a short period in the recent past, relations between Turkey and Bulgaria have always been good. If you consider the list of current mutual visits between officials of both countries, you cannot fail to notice the intensity of our mutual relations. I can confidently claim that relations between Turkey and Bulgaria have achieved a remarkable level. Turkey attaches great importance to friendship, good neighborly relations, and cooperation with the Republic of Bulgaria. We are convinced that the good, friendly relations between the two countries are not only contributing to peace in the Balkans, but in Europe as a whole. [Bochukov] How could the remnants of past distrust and mutual suspicions between Turkey and Bulgaria be eliminated, according to you? [Ciller] I think that the problem deserves a very careful and objective examination. I would like to stress that our relations with Bulgaria have entered a new stage, leaving behind the past. On the Turkish side there is no hesitation whatsoever to normalize our relations with Bulgaria. I also would like to remind you that, following 1989, our mutual relations were promptly promoted to the highest level. We are actively working for an atmosphere of mutual confidence and security between Turkey and Bulgaria. We signed the Sofia and Edirne documents, whose contents are by far exceeding the Vienna document of 1992, which once more confirms Turkey's good will toward Bulgaria and our sincere wish to intensify mutual confidence and cooperation between our two countries. Turkey has also withdrawn military units from our common border with Bulgaria. Turkey supported Bulgaria's efforts to join the European political and military structures. This clearly shows that no distrust and suspicions whatsoever exist on our side. [Bochukov] Do you admit that not all people who profess the Islamic faith in Bulgaria are ethnic Turks? [Ciller] From the first moment of its establishment, the Republic of Turkey has wholeheartedly supported a foreign policy based on the principles of common sense. In accordance with such principles, we are willing to establish good neighborly and friendly relations with all countries, to develop relations and cooperation in all spheres in the peoples' interests, to respect mutual independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, to refrain from interfering in other countries' domestic affairs, to consolidate peace and understanding. These are only a few of the principles that we are observing. The aforementioned principles are also applied in our Balkan relations. "Human relations" exist between Turkey and the region. We have Turkish minorities living in Balkan states. Numerous Turkish citizens have emigrated from the Balkans to Turkey. We regard the Turkish minorities as a bridge between Turkey and the country in which they are living as loyal citizens. I would like to remind you that Christian Turkish minorities also exist. [Bochukov] Do you see any other solution than the force of arms regarding settling your government's problem with the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK]? [Ciller] The PKK is a terrorist organization aimed at dividing Turkey on an ethnic basis. Like every other government in the world, the Turkish Government is trying to restrain the terrorist activities of this organization with its own legal security forces. This fact is confirmed by the mass assassinations of women, children, and old people who are Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin. Our government is involved in a democratization process and in the defense of human rights. The right of living in freedom is one of the fundamental human rights. The violence of the PKK shall be eradicated by the joint efforts of all our citizens, those of Kurdish origin included. [Bochukov] How do you see the future development of bilateral economic and trade relations between our two countries? [Ciller] We consider the economic and trade relations between Turkey and Bulgaria as very promising. There is no doubt that a well balanced economic cooperation between the two countries would be of mutual interest. Hence, we should work for its development. The present level of our mutual trade does not reflect the real potential of our countries. I am convinced that much more could and should be done. In this respect I would like to stress that the number of Turkish-Bulgarian joint ventures has attained 279. Naturally, they could be more. Our government is doing everything to encourage Turkish businessmen and investors to work with Bulgaria. We are soon expecting to sign an agreement in this field. Undoubtedly, this will be to the advantage of Turkish and Bulgarian businessmen alike, providing an opportunity for mutual investments. We are currently working on an agreement to eliminate double taxation. Accepting that regional cooperation is a step toward European integration, the Balkan countries should develop their trade and economic relations. Proceeding in this direction, both Turkey and Bulgaria could obtain opportunities for larger markets. A similar idea was at the basis of the project to establish a Black Sea economic cooperation zone. [Bochukov] Which economic spheres are the most interesting for Bulgarian-Turkish cooperation? [Ciller] Considerable structural changes were recently introduced in Turkey. We have good opportunities for cooperation with Bulgaria in all spheres that your country prefers, and particularly related to infrastructure and building projects in third countries.
