FR941202-1-00050 FR941202-1-00010 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION Board of Contract Appeals 48 CFR Part 6101 Rules of Procedure of the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals AGENCY: Board of Contract Appeals, General Services Administration. ACTION: Proposed rule; Request for comments. SUMMARY: This document contains revisions to the rules of procedure of the GSA Board of Contract Appeals (Board), which will govern all proceedings before the Board. The revisions are intended to implement certain provisions of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;355) (FASA or Act) which have amended the Brooks Automatic Data Processing Act, under which the Board hears and decides protests of procurements involving automatic data processing (ADP) equipment, and the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, under which the Board hears and decides contract disputes. The revisions are intended to conform the Board's rules of procedure to the amendments made to its two jurisdictional statutes. The Board intends to issue final, revised rules after considering all comments on the proposed revisions. DATES: Comments must be submitted by January 31, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments concerning these proposed rules may be mailed to GSA Board of Contract Appeals, 18th & F Streets NW., Washington, DC 20405. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Wilbur T. Miller, Chief Counsel, GSA Board of Contract Appeals, (202) 501&hyph;0891. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Regulatory Flexibility Act The General Services Administration certifies that these revisions will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). B. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed revisions do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or the collection of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. C. Background The Brooks Automatic Data Processing Act (40 U.S.C. 759(f)) provides that protests involving ADP procurements may be filed with the Board. That Act also provides that the Board is to adopt and issue rules and procedures necessary for the expeditious resolution of such protests. In addition, the Administrator of General Services has delegated to the Board the authority to adopt and issue rules necessary for the resolution of contract disputes under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601&hyph;613). The proposed rules have been approved by majority vote of the Board's members. D. Effective Dates Pursuant to Sections 10001 and 10002 of the FASA, the Board proposes to make the final revised rules, as well as sections 1432&hyph;1434, 1436&hyph;1438, and 2351(c)&hyph;(d) of the Act, applicable to all proceedings filed on or after a date to be specified in the final rules. Section 1435 of the Act shall be applicable to cost applications where the underlying protest is filed on or after such date. The date specified in the final rules shall be at least thirty days after the publication of such rules.
