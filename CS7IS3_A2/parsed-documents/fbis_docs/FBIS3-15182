Podkolzin, commander of Russian Federation Airborne Troops, by Colonel Aleksandr Oliynik; place and date not given: "Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin: Our Peacemakers in Bosnia Were Welcomed With Bread and Salt. Airborne Troops' Commander Answers Questions From KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent"] [Text] [Oliynik] Yevgeniy Nikolayevich, Russia's initiative, thanks to which the threat of a new escalation of the war in the Balkans because of the NATO ultimatum has been averted, is today being called none other than a "diplomatic triumph for the Russians." But when did you yourself learn of it? For literally until recently the opposite viewpoint prevailed, did it not, in our political leadership and in the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense -- not to send our "blue helmets" into the Bosnian meat grinder on any pretext? [Podkolzin] Yes, indeed, until very recently both the president of Russia and the minister of defense were doing all they could to oppose -- I will not fight shy of this word -- the use of our "blue helmets" within the framework of the UN peacemaking forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although, as we know, there had been quite a few calls for this both from the United Nations and from Washington and other Western countries. In my view the decisive factor which influenced our policy on the Bosnian crisis was not only the tough NATO ultimatum, which, incidentally, was announced without consultation with Russia -- a permanent member of the UN Security Council -- but the fact that the proposed airstrike not only would not have brought nearer the peaceful settlement of the crisis but, on the contrary, would have led to a new escalation of the war in the Balkans and to numerous human casualties. [Oliynik] It is appropriate here to recall also the history of World War II in the Balkans. A total of 20 divisions -- 8 German and 12 Italian -- got stuck in the Bosnian mountains in an attempt to crush the Yugoslav partisans' resistance. Tito's army not only held out but also triumphed.... [Podkolzin] Exactly. The Balkans are not Iraq, and strong-arm methods, as the facts show, do not work here. Before playing at war we should think about the consequences of military operations for the Balkans and for Europe as a whole. As for my own participation in carrying out our initiative, I learned of it from a personal conversation with Army General Pavel Grachev which I had at 1300 hours 18 February. The minister of defense reported that the Russian president had decided, in line with an accord with Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to transfer to Sarajevo part (400 men) of our UN battalion stationed in Serb Krajina. In order to coordinate operations, on the morning of 19 February I flew out to Belgrade and then to Sarajevo together with Vitaliy Churkin, the president's special representative, and with officers of the Airborne Troops. Incidentally, owing to bad weather Belgrade was not receiving flights (visibility was down to zero), and yet our pilots managed to land the aircraft after circling five times. [Oliynik] We know from television broadcasts and the press how enthusiastically the population of Bosnia welcomed the column of Russian paratroopers. But I guess this march of almost 500 km through the mountains was not easy, was it? [Podkolzin] Of course, this rapid relocation cost the soldiers and officers a great effort. For we had not only to prepare hardware for the march but also to select the men: The contracts of the majority of the paratroopers end in April, and they were to have returned home. Then the order came to set out for Sarajevo. They must be given their due -- no one was frightened by the dangers. At exactly the designated time -- 1800 hours 20 February -- our armored group headed by Colonel Viktor Vorobyev arrived in the Sarajevo region. Moreover, it was a mixed column -- in the space of 18 hours 21 armored personnel carriers and 40 Ural trucks negotiated six passes on the 500-km route and went through a snowstorm, across unfamiliar terrain. You can understand our paratroopers' feelings when, contrary to expectations, they were greeted with songs, bread and salt.... Incidentally, our column was given an enthusiastic welcome not only by Serbs but also by Muslims, but this did not embarrass the Muslim leaders, who voiced their displeasure at this. [Oliynik] Won't our "blue helmets" find themselves in the role of a live target at Sarajevo? For, in the event of new clashes between the warring sides, they will hardly be stopped by the blue UN color of the Russian paratroopers' uniform. In addition, direct provocations cannot be ruled out either.... [Podkolzin] This is the most complex and difficult question today. Our paratroopers have taken up positions near Trebevic and Vraca, from where the Serbs have withdrawn their heavy arms, and also around Sarajevo Airport. They find themselves at a bullet's distance, as it were, from both warring sides -- Muslims and Serbs. Let us be frank -- in the event of a large-scale conflict it will not, of course, be possible to avoid casualties. At the same time Britain's General Rose, commander of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with whom I met twice, assured me that he is taking all measures for the safety of the contingent of "blue helmets," including the Russians. To this end a reinforcement has now arrived in the Sarajevo region from the Scandinavian, Jordanian, and Slovak battalions stationed in Croatia, as well as two British battalions from Central Bosnia. To this it should be added that the leaders of the Bosnians and the Serbs assured me and the command of the UN forces in Bosnia that they would no longer permit large-scale combat operations in the Sarajevo region.... [Oliynik] What can you say about the duration of our paratroopers' stay in the Sarajevo region? [Podkolzin] It would be better to ask the politicians about this, and not just our politicians. Too much hatred has built up in the Balkans during the two-year period of bloodshed, and there have been too many casualties to be able to speak of the sides' rapid reconciliation. But I am certain of one thing: The Bosnian crisis must be resolved by political means alone. If we are speaking of the immediate future of our paratroopers in this region, it is known that, in accordance with the Russian president's decision and with the agreement of the Federation Council, an additional troop contingent of 300 men is setting out for Bosnia-Herzegovina to participate in the peacemaking mission as part of the UN forces. As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already reported, incidentally, our second battalion of "blue helmets" will be stationed there. We have also put a proposal to the UN Secretariat to increase the number of our officers on the staff of the commander of the UN forces in Yugoslavia, which is in Zagreb, and on the Sarajevo-based staff of the UN forces. [Oliynik] Having recovered from its shock at the galvanization of Russian policy in the Balkans, the West has now started saying that, since the NATO ultimatum has taken effect, it would not be a bad thing to apply it in other parts of Bosnia too. What is your view? [Podkolzin] I am afraid our paratroopers would not suffice for all the "hot spots" in Bosnia. I am joking, of course, but seriously, the "policy of ultimatums" can hardly be applied -- on 21 February the Balkans and maybe also the whole of Europe were on the brink of war. We know too well that many wars need only a spark to ignite them but are far harder to end. [Oliynik] Incidentally, where were you at 0100 hours 21 February? [Podkolzin] Despite the fact that our delegation had been informed that there would be no bombing strikes, I well knew as a military man that the NATO war machine had been set in motion and that the most irremediable eventuality might occur. At the moment the ultimatum expired (this was 0300 hours, local time, 21 February) I was on the territory of the hospitable Ukrainian UN battalion. Everyone was anxious, and -- I will not hide the fact -- when the ultimatum ran out, together with the Ukrainian officers (for the majority were serving in our troops only yesterday) we raised our glasses to the Russian paratroopers who had won a victory in Bosnia without a war. Who knows, it was, maybe, thanks to our mobility that all of Europe woke up that February morning without a war....
