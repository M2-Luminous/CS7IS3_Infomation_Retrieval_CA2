The real negotiations have not yet begun. Let us listen to the positions of the two parties. First, Carlos Camargo of the COB: [Begin Camargo recording] The COB has made a national proposal, and has been patiently waiting, without putting on any pressure, in the hope that the government would reply in a positive manner. This is an attitude that shows the willingness of the COB to talk. We did not implement measures first, and them submit the COB proposal. I would also like to point out before the public that in the case of La Paz, where regrettable events took place this afternoon, there was no provocation from the workers. The provocation came from the government, the police, and the Armed Forces. [end recording] Let us listen now to the government representative, Human Development Minister Enrique Ipina: [Begin Ipina recording] The government does not accept, and will not accept, the formal resumption of talks if there is no constructive and positive spirit for lifting the coercive measures. We reiterate the terms of our letter of 24 April, and expect from the COB, the lifting of all coercive measures without exception, as an essential condition, as absolutely necessary, for contributing to social peace and demonstrating to the world that Bolivians can understand each other without threats of any kind. We believe, we are convinced, that we need the lifting of all coercive measures, without exception, as a prior condition. [end recording]
