The statement reads: Statement by the Korea Antinuclear Peace Committee. The entire nation and the world's peace-loving people are strongly protesting and denouncing the maneuvers of the rulers of the U.S. imperialist and South Korea to introduce Patriot missiles. In particular, South Korean students and youths, and people from all walks of life are courageously waging anti-America, antiwar, and antinuclear struggles day after day shouting the slogans "We protest with our lives the deployment of Patriot missiles which intensifies tension on the Korean peninsula" and "Yankee go home." This shows South Korean people's firm will that they would never tolerate the maneuver to introduce Patriot missiles. This is also a genuine, just, patriotic struggle to prevent the risk of the approaching reality of a nuclear war, and defend the country's peace and safety. As has been exposed, the introduction of new missiles in South Korea is one of the premeditated aggressive arms build-up maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and South Korean war maniac elements to make a preemptive attack on our Republic. The Patriots missiles being deployed to South Korea are the most advanced, highly dangerous, war devices [chonjaeng sudan] which can strike any place and object depending on the type of warheads installed. Branding the Patriot missile deployment maneuver of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets as a total breach of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and the North-South joint declaration on denuclearization, which were intended to peacefully resolve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula, the Korea Antinuclear Peace Committee resolutely denounces the undisguised military provocation aimed at unleashing at any cost, another war -- a thermonuclear war in Korea. The introduction of Patriot missiles that were constantly rejected in many regions of the world is an inevitable product of the despicable flunkyist and treacherous policy pursued by the Kim Yong-sam group, which has turned South Korea into an exhibition ground for new and old U.S. weapons and into an arms market. Following the collapse of the Cold-War system and the break in the balance of power in the international arena, the monopoly companies of the U.S. defense industry have faced difficulties in selling weapons. Representing the interests of monopolies, the Pentagon and the U.S. Administration are trying every means to develop markets that stockpile various war equipment, including already-produced mass destructive weapons by putting pressure on the so-called allies and puppets under their subjugation. Kim Yong-sam the treacherous traitor, who has emerged as a vanguard in carrying out the U.S. aggressive policy, already vowed loyalty to his master during his U.S. junket at the end of last year and promised to fill the stomachs of U.S. agricultural capitalists and defense companies by opening the weapons market along with the rice market. The Kim Yong-sam group unilaterally broke up the working contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South which had been arranged with so much effort and, later, openly incited a war fever, spreading a rumor about someone's scheme to provoke a war against the South, and made public even an aggressive war plan dubbed "new operation plan No. 5027" against the North which had been secret. All this was motivated by its despicable purpose of finding a legal pretext for the massive shipment of U.S.-made destructive weapons to South Korea, thus furthering the interests of the United States, its master. Not satisfied with selling out the rice market on which the lives of South Korean farmers depend, the traitor Kim Yong-sam gave out South Korea as a market for U.S.-made weapons, thus showing that the rascals are treacherous traitors worse than the five traitors of Ulsa. It has become clear to everybody that as long as treachery exists with the traitor Kim Yong-sam in power in South Korea, the nation's interests cannot be defended and our nation cannot avoid a nuclear war calamity. South Korean youths, students, and people must invigorate the anti-America, antiwar, antinuclear and antigovernment struggle to oust the Kim Yong-sam group from power and establish an independent and democratic government to block and thwart the introduction of the Patriot missile by the U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique. History shows how tragic the end is for traitors who run counter to the general trend. If the United States and the South Korean puppets ignore the aspiration of the times and the demand of the nation and steadily reinforce the aggression forces to finally start the fire of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula, the provokers will never get off safe. The U.S. and South Korean rulers must clearly see the strong spirit and iron will of the our people, who never pardon those who infringe upon the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of the country, promptly stop the aggressive arms buildup including the deployment of Patriot missiles and discontinue the reckless war provocation moves at once. [Dated] 19 April, 1994, Pyongyang.
