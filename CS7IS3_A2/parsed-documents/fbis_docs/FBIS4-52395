Why are you so particular about Asia? [Ogura] Speaking of Asian diplomacy, there is a serious misunderstanding in Japanese society: To say "no" to the United States means nationalism, and nationalism leads to militarism. Such an outdated syllogism goes unchallenged. The reason is that the development of Asian diplomacy had been possible only within a harsh international situation called a showdown between the East and the West. However, the framework of the Cold War has definitely collapsed and there is a need for building a new coordinated axis. My idea is that there is no need for Japan to follow the Asian policies of Europe and the United States; there is no need for Japan to assume that its Asian policies should be identical to those of Europe and the United States from the very beginning, even if its resultant policies happen to be identical to theirs. [Miura] There is a view in Europe and the United States that Asia is a threat. [Ogura] The view that Asia is a threat has existed for a long time. That view was politically meaningless when Asia was powerless. Now, however, it is whispered about that the economic development of Asia is a political threat. The view that Asia is a threat is a self-centered way of thinking in Europe and the United States that the center of the world exists outside Asia. Europe and the United States should, instead, ask the question: Asia occupies an important part in the world; what is the problem in Asia in the world context? Moreover, Asia tends to be silent about itself, which in a way inflames an Asia-threat theory. Japan is said to be faceless, but Asia is more faceless than Japan. The international community should take Asia as a positive entity and both should work hand in hand, and Asia also should be aware of its responsibility commensurate to its power. [Miura] What is the significance of Vietnam in relation to Asian diplomacy? [Ogura] Vietnam is typical of Asia. The annual national income is extremely low, averaging $200 to $300 per person. Vietnam embodies a poor Asia. But its literacy is 85 to 90 percent. Vietnam also has an aspect of an industrious East Asia, as shown by an old woman street vendor reading a communist party paper. Moreover, Vietnam fell victim to the invasion of foreign countries in its history. At the same time, it was an invader of its neighboring counties. The promotion of Japan's diplomacy with Vietnam having such various aspects can be a touchstone of Japan's new Asian diplomacy. [Miura] If Japan tries to pursue a diplomacy of its own, does it not lead to a collision with the United States? [Ogura] Vietnam regards its diplomacy with the United States pragmatically, and it will not take a hard line toward the United States. Its relationship with the United States will rather be determined by U.S. domestic politics and its Asian diplomacy. Although it may take time, the relationship between the United States and Vietnam will improve. Even if the relationship between the United States and Vietnam goes wrong, the relationship between Japan and Vietnam will not become difficult. [Miura] Will there be Japan-U.S. friction concerning the Vietnamese market in the future? [Ogura] I would have preferred that Japan and the United States strike at each other violently in a trade war. The thing is, although there is a Vietnamese boom in Japan, it has not made any investment in Vietnam actually. Japanese businesses are cautious; they consider Vietnam's infrastructure and legislation to still be inadequate. Furthermore, Japanese businesses have already established their world strategy, and even if a new element called Vietnam is proposed, it does not fit into their strategy. It will take some time before Japanese enterprises go into business in Vietnam. Meanwhile, the United States will move briskly once it sets its mind on business, because the United States has past business experience in the former South Vietnam era. I am worried that Vietnam may express its dissatisfaction at Japan's inactivity despite its professed Vietnamese boom. [Miura] What kind of role can Japan play in Vietnam? [Ogura] Japan's cooperation with third countries is promising. Although it has money, taking Japanese products there will be costly due to the stronger yen. It will work better if Japan provides funds and leave them to the care of third countries. Concerning Vietnam, the United States and France have plenty of know-how historically. [Miura] What is your view on the future possibility of Vietnam? [Ogura] Human resources are said to be Vietnam's strong point. Speaking of human resources, Vietnam's neighbor, China, has human resources of more than 1 billion. From the standpoint of a business strategy, the question is which human resources are superior in quality. After all, the important point is stability and union within Vietnam. It depends whether reform policy can be promoted in a manner not contradictory to stability and union within Vietnam.
