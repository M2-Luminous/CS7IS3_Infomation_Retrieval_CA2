Gu Jinchi said: The letters and complaints work is an important work through which we can listen to the voice of the masses, rely on the masses, and maintain close ties with the masses. The masses can not only reflect their opinions and demands through the letters and complaints channels but also exercise supervision on cadres and party members and provide good opinions for the party and the government. Letters and complaints departments should serve as good advisers to the party and the government, strengthen the letters and complaints work at the grass-roots level, and make grass-roots levels more capable of solving problems on the spot. Letters and complaints departments at all levels should pay attention to studying the new situation in reform and do an even better job to ensure smooth progress in reform. In addition, Gu Jinchi demanded that leading comrades at all levels wholeheartedly support the work of letters and complaints departments and create conditions for them to do their work well.
