Although an economy cannot be taken over from one day to the next, the broad-coalition government has presented its policy statement as a way out of a crisis into which society had been led by the Meciar government. Former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar regards the Moravcik Cabinet's philosophy of economic reform as an irreparable historical error. According to the former prime minister, Slovakia will not be able to cope with a third change in economic reform. He warns against the treacherous form of privatization [envisaged by the present government] and voices apprehensions about the development of democracy in Slovakia. [Urbanova] How do you evaluate the concept of the provisional government's policy statement? [Meciar] The policy statement is full of contradictions. Its contents do not express a cohesive philosophy of development; it is more or less a descriptive document. Given the term of office that the government has ahead of itself, the statement should literally have had the form of a schedule. It should have been subdivided into days and assignments that need to be resolved in every period of time. I assess the concept of the policy statement negatively. The building of the state and the building of the state administration have come to a halt. The policy statement does not address these issues at all. It envisages the third change of economic reform in Slovakia. Slovakia cannot cope with that. It cannot start anew for the third time in 14 months. Our concept of economic development and the revenue part of the budget was based on the philosophy of recovery. The provisional government's concept is based on the philosophy of restrictions. To survive, it will transfer to the state budget more than 5 billion korunas' worth of resources from the National Property Fund initially designated for structural changes in the economy. The crisis in society will deepen, but it will not be resolved. A change in the perception of social relations is making itself felt. The principle of egalitarianism and down-leveling is appearing in many respects, and the development of social policy is again acquiring a consumer character, in lieu of a balanced and differentiated interest [sentence as published]. Those who worked hard in the mines or steel mills for 20 years and those who stole and were in prison for 20 years will be equally well off in their retirement. The merit principle will be erased. [Urbanova] Privatization will represent a key aspect [of the new government's policy]. To what extent has the new government deflected from the path on which you embarked? [Meciar] The concept of the new government contains a treacherously hidden change of the whole process of privatization. Outwardly, the concept appears to be very liberal because they want to offer up to 50 percent of state-owned property to the citizens. In reality, however, the citizens will be robbed. A huge capital surplus will be created on the market so the value of the property will drop steeply. When this happens, the citizens will accept the offer to sell their shares, but at considerably lower prices than the value the shares would have a few years later. Two effects are being pursued in this way. The actual execution of ownership rights will be concentrated in the hands of [investment] funds and not in the hands of holders of investment coupons. And these shares will be quickly bought up, also with respect to the funds' holders. Our government's effort to create a strong middle and capital-owning class in Slovakia will be slowed down or indefinitely postponed. The function of the National Property Fund in relation to the budget will change, as well, because privatization revenue will no longer represent a supplementary source of budget revenue. Essentially, property will be given away. Whereas we have been criticized for selling some things cheaply (but someone always had to pay for it), now there will not be any payment at all. The reasoning behind this is that the Christian Democrats have a relatively strong position in investment funds, and they therefore suppose that, with their help, they will get hold of the economy more quickly. [Urbanova] The policy statement is the product of an agreement arrived at by members of a broad coalition. Is this an indication that even political entities as diverse as those that constitute the government can reach a consensus? [Meciar] The right-left or, if you want, left-right coalition has worked out a mechanism of negotiations that does not permit any dynamism of development. Everything is being halted and indefinitely postponed on which the government entities do not have identical programs. It is apparent that the importance of the Hungarian political parties, which hold the balance of power, is growing. The Moravcik government is thus compelled to make concessions to them and is therefore afraid of making public all of the agreements it has concluded with them. One of the agreements is to recall Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the parliament, in late April and to replace him with Peter Weiss. There have already been coalition talks on this issue. At every step, democracy is being violated. The moral crisis in society is being deepened by efforts to seize power without regard for the democratic principles and by the growing scandals surrounding the president. Not all of them have been made public. [Urbanova] Some of your deputies claim that the provisional government's policy statement copies, for the most part, your own policy statement.... [Meciar] Rhetorically it does. They quote many parts from our own program but, because these parts are isolated, they say nothing. The minister of education's rhetoric, for example, is not bad, but he has no money to implement it. Even though they have adopted elements from our program, these elements are not connected by any underlying philosophy and do not represent an economically substantiated whole. The entire philosophy of economic reform represented by [Deputy Prime Minister] Mrs. Schmognerova and others is a historically irreparable error. The citizen will have to pay a social and political price for it, but entrepreneurs, too, who could have constituted a real and competitive social class, will have to bear the consequences. [Urbanova] What is your view of the crusade against REPUBLIKA? [Meciar] I protest against the steps being taken against REPUBLIKA and TA SR, and against the planned changes in television and radio. We never did anything like this. This is no longer a question of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia but one of whether we will be a democratic state. If the idea of parliamentarianism, the right of citizens to express their views in a referendum, and the right to express one's views freely are ignored, it is impossible to keep silent.
