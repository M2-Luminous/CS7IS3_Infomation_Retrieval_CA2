FR941020-2-00045 FR941020-2-00032 _Notify each laboratory accredited by the organization within 10 days of our withdrawal of recognition of the organization's deeming authority; _Provide us with inspection schedules, as requested, for the purpose of conducting onsite validation inspections; _Provide us, the State survey agency or other HCFA agent with any facility-specific data that includes, but is not limited to, PT results that constitute unsuccessful participation in an approved PT program and notification of the adverse actions or corrective actions imposed by the accreditation organization as a result of unsuccessful PT participation; _Provide us with written notification at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of any proposed changes in its requirements; and _Make available, on a reasonable basis, any laboratory's PT results upon the request by any person, with such explanatory information needed to assist in the interpretation of the results. Laboratories that are accredited by an accreditation organization must: •Authorize the organization to release to HCFA all records and information required by HCFA as required at §493.501; •Permit inspections as required by the CLIA regulations at 42 CFR part 493, subpart Q; •Obtain a certificate of accreditation as required by §493.61; and •Pay the applicable fees as required by §§493.638 and 493.645. B. Evaluation of ASHI as an Accreditation Organization Under CLIA ASHI has formally applied for approval as an accreditation organization under CLIA. We have evaluated the ASHI application to determine equivalency with our implementing and enforcement regulations, and the deeming/exemption requirements of the CLIA rules. We also verified the organization's assurance that it requires the laboratories it accredits to be, and that the organization is, in compliance with the following subparts of 42 CFR part 493 as explained below: Subpart E_Accreditation by a Private, Nonprofit Accreditation Organization or Exemption Under an Approved State Laboratory Program ASHI has submitted, for the specialty of histocompatibility, a comparison of individual accreditation and condition level requirements, a description of its inspection process, PT monitoring process, and its data management and analysis system, a listing of the size, composition, education and experience of its inspection teams, its investigative and complaint response procedures, its notification agreements with HCFA, its removal or withdrawal of laboratory accreditation procedures, its current list of accredited laboratories, and its announced and unannounced inspection process. We have determined that ASHI has complied with the general requirements under §493.501, the applicable parts of §493.506, and the CLIA requirements for approval as an accreditation organization under various subparts of part 493. Subpart H_Participation in Proficiency Testing for Laboratories Performing Tests of Moderate or High Complexity, or Both ASHI's requirements for PT are more stringent than those of CLIA. All of ASHI's accredited laboratories are required to participate in a cell exchange or PT program for all tests. CLIA, however, does not require laboratories that perform histocompatibility testing to participate in an HHS-approved PT program. We have determined that ASHI currently imposes, and will continue to impose, action upon its accredited laboratories that are unsuccessful in a cell exchange or PT performance.
