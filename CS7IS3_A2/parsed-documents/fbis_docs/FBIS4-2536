FBIS4-2536 "drchi070_n_94010" FBIS-CHI-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Economic & Agricultural Oil Industry Official Interviewed on Reserves Oil Industry Official Interviewed on Reserves HK1104002694 Beijing CHINA DAILY (BUSINESS WEEKLY) in English 10-16 Apr 94 p 8 HK1104002694 Beijing CHINA DAILY (BUSINESS WEEKLY) English BFN [By staff reporter Chang Weimin: "Search for Oil Will Be Intensified"] [Text] China is to beef up prospecting for new reserves of crude oil in its eastern part, where major oilfields are concentrated. The efforts are expected to verify enough reserves to make up for declining production in old oilfields. Fields in the eastern part produce some 124 million tons of oil a year. In addition, five oil-bearing areas are to be developed in the next three years and are expected to yield at least 10 million tons of oil annually. Due to decades of exploitation, production at some old oilfields has slumped over the past three years. New technology will be used to recover more oil from old fields and to develop heavy and super-heavy oil. Measures for that purpose were outlined at what was billed as a "historic" conference held late last month by the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC). A senior official from CNPC's Production and Development Department last week said the measures have raised the confidence of Chinese. In an interview with Business Weekly, the official, who declined to be identified said the five oil-bearing areas will be part of a "second battlefield" to launch major maneuvers by the energy industry. The areas include the Liangjiang district of the Songliao Basin, a block covering parts of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu, and the shallow waters of the continental shelf in the Bohai Bay. If successful, the measures will ensure that annual oil production in the eastern part remains above 124 million tons in the next seven years. Last year onshore oilfields produced 139 million tons of oil. China has expertise in enhancing the recovery of oil from old fields, but the official said major efforts are necessary to perfect the expertise and to develop new technology. The official spoke highly of last month's conference, saying it was rare that nearly all senior officials and experts engaged in onshore oil production attended the week-long conference. The official reiterated the importance of stabilizing production in the eastern part as a precaution in case big discoveries are not made soon in the Tarim, Turpan-Hami and Junggar basins in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The three basins are expected to be the core of oil production in the next century. Some Chinese are wondering why the country, which lacks enough energy for an economy of 1.18 billion people, does not buy more oil from overseas when prices are only about $13 a barrel. Instead, high-ranking officials and oil industry professionals seem to have worked out various plans for drawing every drop of oil out of the ground. Officials from different sources have ruled out raising oil imports because the country lacks the foreign currency to pay for it. China's imports of oil have been on the rise over the past several years and this year will be equal to exports. But next year the country is likely to become a net importer of oil. Experts predict demand for crude oil will exceed planned production. China imported 15 million tons of oil in 1993, compared with 19.31 million in 1992. Last year oil exports were 19 million tons, 1.7 million less than in 1992.
