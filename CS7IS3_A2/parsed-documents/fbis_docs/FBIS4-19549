Berlusconi Did Not Manage To'"] [Text] [D'Alema] The political operation attempted by [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, namely that of latching on to the Center, did not succeed. At most, they managed to secure a few votes under the table. Our task now is to strive to create a broad opposition in parliament, not limited to the forces on the Left. In this sense, voting for Spadolini was a positive choice. [D'Alema ends] Thus the PDS' [Democratic Party of the Left] outgoing speaker, who now prefers to simply call himself the Gallipoli deputy, commented on the two-day session which led to the election of the two parliamentary speakers nominated by the majority. [Di Mauro] Deputy D'Alema, do you believe that the majority obtained for Scognamiglio's nomination may result in a political majority being formed in the next few days? [D'Alema] Clearly the election of the Senate speaker, who was elected by a majority of one, does not solve the problem of achieving a political majority in the Senate, although this does not detract from the result itself. The majority forces are still confronted with the problem of winning the votes that they may require each time. However, the basic political question is that of an agreement with the Italian Popular Party [PPI]. [Di Mauro] But [outgoing Interior Minister] Mancino clearly said "no" to Berlusconi's proposal. [D'Alema] Precisely. It do not think that we are dealing with a very likely possibility, but in any case this reveals a political orientation or, in any case, an intention. I would say that the majority has obtained the result that it was aiming at. It was easier in the Chamber of Deputies, and more difficult in the Senate. Yesterday morning I heard [National Alliance leader] Fini quoting the figures: Obviously he knew whom he had contacted. This means that the Second Republic is, from its outset, marred by the worst characteristics of the first: arrogance and callousness, in short, the worst side of Craxism. It is no mere coincidence that Scognamiglio was, together with De Michelis, the co-author of a book called "Governing Italy in the Year 2000." He collaborated with Altissimo [former Liberal Party Secretary]. We are faced with the same political-intellectual caste, or at least a closely related one, which found its shock troops in the Right. The fact that they constitute the same political caste does not mean that they are pursuing the same policies. [Di Mauro] Is a tug of war between the majority and the opposition now likely? [D'Alema] The problem is not a tug of war. Disagreement is only natural in the dialectics between majority and opposition. What is serious, however, is the fact of monopolizing the guarantee functions. While appointing a man who had "super partes" [standing above the contending parties] characteristics, the majority could have sought a dialogue with the opposition forces. What authority does [Chamber of Deputies speaker] Irene Pivetti have to say that parliament must set its hands to amending the Constitution? This is not her task. [Di Mauro] In a majority-based parliament, the opposition's role will change. In what ways? [D'Alema] A majority-based parliament does not mean that the opposition's control role is reduced to zero. Usually, in bipolar systems this role is highlighted. In Britain, the speaker of the House of Commons is a Labor Party member. Here associationism has been mistaken for the need to safeguard the "super partes" [standing above the contending parties] role of the speakers. A test of strength has been attempted with a view to forming a governing majority. The way in which the problem was tackled is apparent from the fact that recourse to new elections was being proposed should their candidates not be elected. A rather disturbing fact. It is right for a majority to want to be self- sufficient for the purpose of governing the country, but it cannot be self-sufficient for the purpose of changing the rules of the game. Having said this, I do not think that too much importance should be given to a result which stems from the general election results. [Di Mauro] On his first day as a deputy, Berlusconi said: Spending so many hours here is giving me an itch. Why is this? Is he allergic to procedures? [D'Alema] I do not know what Berlusconi may have said. Allergy to democratic rules and procedures, however, is nothing new. Craxi went as far as calling parliament a "cattle pen." [Di Mauro] The test of strength over the house speakers seems to foreshadow a rather more important confrontation over the amendment of the Constitution. The majority people are always speaking of a minority that will have the right to express its opinion but not to cause any disruption, almost as if they never need to concern themselves in the future with the control exercised by the opposition. [D'Alema] We must defend the rules of the game without, however, renouncing the reformist approach which we adopted during the election campaign. The question is: what rules of the game? It must be taken into account that this is a parliament, a constituted body, not a constituent assembly. It can make amendments, but it cannot redraft the Constitution. I am not convinced by that mixture of uninominalism and presidentialism which is being mentioned. The quality of the reforms is also part of the problem. However, we must be clear that the arrogance and would-be self-sufficiency characterizing the majority's attitude must not lead us to adopt a conservative line. I repeat: We must develop the reformist approach which we advocated in the election campaign, in the course of which we did not repropose the "status quo." [Di Mauro] Is there not also an element of novelty in the way that the new majority is presenting itself? [D'Alema] They emphasize novelty, whereas in fact they are continuing the old politics. The novelty lies in their arrogance and their claim to be self-sufficient. Continuity lies in the lotting process. They have apportioned the first positions, and they are preparing to share out everything else within a coalition made up of new parties -- but the logic is the old one.
