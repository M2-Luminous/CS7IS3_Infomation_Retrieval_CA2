The concern admits, however, that a difficult situation has shaped up at the Bilibino station. It is caused by the delay in payment of wages to the personnel since December last year. In one of its reports to the concern, the nuclear station's leaders say that the families of many specialists are on the brink of starvation. The spokesman said, however, that the station continues operating as usual and strikes at nuclear power engineering industry are banned by Russian law. The concern will hand over 500 Mn rubles Tuesday to the station workers. However, the sum is only enough to pay wages for December. The spokesman said that at all Russian nuclear power stations the wages have not been paid since January. The Bilibino station is a station of local importance and supplies energy for the Bilibino-Chaunskiy mining center.
