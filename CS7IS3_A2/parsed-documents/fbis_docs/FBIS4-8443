Havel explained to them that the post-communist countries of Europe were rather "impatient" to be admitted because in view of recent historical experience they currently felt "in the air" politically, economically and in issues of security. They "have a different perception", Spacek said. The delegation also met representatives of the Czech parliamentary foreign committee and discussed the transformation process underway in the Czech Republic as well as the creation of a Europe-wide security system, committee chairman Jiri Payne told journalists. Czech deputies acquainted NAA Chairman Loic Bouvard with some "concepts of the future of European security", Payne said. Payne told CTK that remnants of the old bipolar logic had still to be overcome. "The world isn't so straightforward and black and white these days," he said. "There are also other possibilities." Bouvard and NAA Secretary-General Peter Corterier started a three-day visit to the Czech Republic on Sunday. On Wednesday they are due to fly on to Slovakia. Bouvard also met parliamentary groups of political parties today. Marek Benda, chairman of the Christian Democratic Party's (KDS) deputies, said Bouvard and the deputies had agreed that NATO was a "symbol of the protection of certain democratic and other traditions of Europe". Deputies had also expressed the wish that integration into Western structures should proceed "much more quickly", he said. The NAA strives to increase cooperation among the member states of NATO. Founded in 1955, it meets twice a year in the presence of NATO representatives.
