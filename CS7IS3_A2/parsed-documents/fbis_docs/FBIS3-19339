In a statement, the ministry said the decision had been taken overnight after strong lobbying by France. "The (EU) Commission in Brussels will this morning ratify the political accord reached overnight which will extend for two months the arrangements put in place at France's request." "The French Government intervened vigorously to demand that the Commission review its decision to suspend the system of minimum import prices," the statement said, quoting Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech. On Tuesday in Brussels, a spokesman for the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said the system would not be extended as there were no data showing that the market is destabilized at present by cheap fish imports. The spokesman added however that if such data were forthcoming, the commission "is prepared to re-establish the minimum prices." The prices had been decided on last February 4 and expire March 15. They are aimed at protecting EU fishermen against excessively cheap imports. Minimum import prices had been set for fish last year as well, from February to December. France asked the commission to extend the minimum prices last week. French fishermen have staged demonstrations, sometimes violent, to protest against low-cost imports from non-EU countries that drive down prices of French fish. The ministry added in its statement Wednesday that: "Our firmness has paid off. The European Union now has two months to take a serious look at the difficulties in the fishing sector."
