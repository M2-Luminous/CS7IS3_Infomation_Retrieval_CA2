Anne Osvet reports. [Osvet] During the Baltic prime ministers' meeting in Tallinn today the foundations were laid, among other things, for yet another cooperation body. I asked for more clarification from Alar Olljum, deputy chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Ministry. [Begin Olljum recording] As of today, the Baltic Council of Ministers has been set up. [passage omitted] The agreement which was signed today by the prime ministers of the Baltic states is to regulate cooperation between the newly formed Baltic Council of Ministers and the Baltic Assembly. This has been a firm desire, with Baltic parliamentary deputies, who were (?promoting) it already last fall when a scheduled Baltic Assembly meeting took place here in Tallinn. It was again repeated in Jurmala in Latvia [words indistinct]. The prime ministers are to decide the directions for the actual cooperation but I think that (?it will be what was discussed before), with economic cooperation and cooperation on security matters forming the most important (?spheres). Added to this will be energy problems, border issues [words indistinct]; we will, for example, begin talks with Latvia on the sea border. [end recording]
