FR940816-2-00089 FR940816-2-00069 Revocation of Registration; Stephen A. Richards, D.D.S. On March 11, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Stephen A. Richards, D.D.S., of Sterling, Colorado. The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Richards' DEA Certificate of Registration, BR2567266, and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). On March 14, 1994, the Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. Richards' registered location by registered mail and was returned to DEA unclaimed, with no forwarding address. The Order to Show Cause was then mailed to Dr. Richards' last known address on July 25, 1994, and was also returned unclaimed. Subsequent repeated attempts by DEA to contact Dr. Richards have been unsuccessful. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Richards has waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57, the Deputy Administrator enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based on the investigative file. The Deputy Administrator finds that on July 20, 1990, Dr. Richards' dental license was summarily suspended by the Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners (Board), based in part upon his unsatisfactory care of several patients. In October 1990, Dr. Richards entered into a Stipulation and Order with the Board in which he agreed that his license would remain suspended for a total of five months (July 20, 1990 to December 24, 1990); that his license would be reissued on or after December 24, 1990, subject to the completion of certain terms and conditions; and that upon resumption of his dental practice, Dr. Richards was to be placed on probation. However, Dr. Richards failed to reactivate his state dental license following its suspension, and as a result, his license to practice dentistry in the State of Colorado remained suspended. In February 1993, Dr. Richards was called before the Board for a disciplinary hearing. The administrative law judge that presided over the hearing found, among other things, that Dr. Richards practiced dentistry at a number of locations for over two years when his dental license was suspended. As a result, on May 6, 1993, the administrative law judge recommended to the Board that Dr. Richards' dental license be revoked. On July 21, 1993, the Board voted to accept the administrative law judge's recommendation, and revoked Dr. Richards' dental license. The Deputy Administrator finds that as of July 21, 1993, Dr. Richards' license to practice dentistry in the State of Colorado has been revoked, and as a result, he is not authorized to handle controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld. See James H. Nickens, M.D. , 57 FR 59847 (1992); Elliott Monroe, M.D. , 57 FR 23246 (1992); Boby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919 (1988). Based on the foregoing, it is clear that Dr. Richards' DEA Certificate of Registration must be revoked. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BR2567266, previously issued to Stephen A. Richards, D.D.S., be, and it hereby is, revoked and that any pending applications for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective August 16, 1994. Dated: August 10, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20032 Filed 8&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
