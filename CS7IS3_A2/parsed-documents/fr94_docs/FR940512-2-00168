FR940512-2-00168 FR940512-2-00078 In FY 1994, approximately two-thirds of the current Basic Center grantees (those whose grant periods expire in FY 1995 or FY 1996) will be awarded noncompetitive continuation funds. The remaining grantees (those whose grant periods expire in FY 1994) will have the opportunity to compete for new grant awards by submitting new competitive applications. All other eligible youth-serving agencies not holding current awards may also apply for these new competitive funds. (2) Transitional Living Program Grants. Part B, section 321 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended, authorizes grants to establish and operate transitional living projects for homeless youth. This program is structured to help older, homeless youth achieve self-sufficiency and avoid long-term dependency on social services. Transitional living projects provide shelter, skills training, and support services to homeless youth ages 16 through 21 for a continuous period not exceeding 18 months. A competition for new-start TLP awards was held in the summer of 1993 (in the last quarter of FY 1993) and successful applicants were awarded a total of $5,966,650 in FY 1994 funds, beginning on October 1, 1993 (the first quarter of FY 1994). The remaining FY 1994 program funds will be awarded in the form of continuations to ongoing grants. This announcement solicits applications for new Transitional Living Program grant awards to be supported with FY 1995 funds, subject to the appropriation of these funds by Congress. Project periods for these new awards will begin when FY 1995 funds are appropriated and made available to ACYF, but in no case will they begin prior to October 1, 1994. By soliciting applications and making funding decisions during 1994, we will enable current grantees not eligible for FY 1994 continuation funds to compete for new grants to be funded early in FY 1995 and to continue their existing projects with a minimal disruption of services, if successful in the competition. Part III, section C of this publication announces the anticipated availability of funds for these FY 1995 grants, and includes the minimum requirements that applicants must address in their grant proposals. b. National Communications System. Part C, section 331 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended, mandates support for a national communications system to assist runaway and homeless youth in communicating with their families and with service providers. In FY 1991, a three-year grant was awarded to the National Runaway Switchboard, Inc., in Chicago, Illinois, to operate the system. This grant expired in FY 1994. An announcement soliciting grant applications to operate the system for five years was published in the Federal Register on December 27, 1993. c. Program Support. (1) Training and Technical Assistance Grants.
