Services to be provided to FmHA and the borrower by a closing agent in connection with the transaction vary depending whether a title insurance policy, or title opinion are being furnished. The closing agent is expected to perform these services without unnecessary delay. Delay in providing services without justification may be grounds for not approving the closing agent in future cases. (b) Initial responsibility of approval official. The approval official will furnish the closing agent with Form FmHA 1927&hyph;4, ``Transmittal of Title Information,'' all the information and documents called for therein (including waivers, easements, and FmHA forms), and any information not contained in this subpart regarding FmHA policies and procedures applicable to the type of transaction involved. (c) Ordering title services. The approval official will notify the borrower and seller, if applicable, that an attorney or title company must be employed to examine the title and perform other services in connection with the closing of the transaction. Application for title examination or insurance will be made by the borrower to an attorney or title company. Application for mortgage title insurance will be on a form which has been approved by the approval official. The mortgagee policy will be for at least the amount of the loan. The United States of America will be named as the mortgagee insured. Attorney services may be requested in the form of FmHA Guide Letter No. 1927&hyph;B&hyph;1 (available in any FmHA office). (d) Use of title opinion. If a title opinion will be issued, a title examination will include searches of the records, or certificates from the clerks of the appropriate State courts, Federal Bankruptcy courts and United States district courts, for the period determined necessary by local custom, to issue a title opinion. A Form FmHA 1927&hyph;9, ``Preliminary Title Opinion,'' Form FmHA 1927&hyph;10, ``Final Title Opinion,'' or a certificate of title will be issued to the approval official. If either form is not legally sufficient in a particular state, an OGC approved state form will be used. The closing agent will determine: (1) The legal description and all owner(s) of record of the real property, (2) Whether there are any outstanding mortgages, liens, judgments or pending suits in Federal or State courts (as disclosed by a lis pendens or other similar notice of a pending lawsuit), and advise the approval official and borrower of the nature and legal effect of outstanding interests or exceptions such as liens, encumbrances, leases, easements, covenants, conditions, restrictuions, reservations, and rights relating to mineral, oil, gas, geothermal, timber and water rights (including the presence or absence of the right of entry by holder of such rights), prior sales of part of the property judgments, probate proceedings or pending court actions affecting the real property or other outstanding exceptions or interests to assist in determining: (i) Whether the outstanding interests or exceptions affect the value of the property or its operation, and (ii) Which exceptions must be corrected in order for the borrower(s) to obtain good and marketable title of record in accordance with prevailing title examination standards, and for FmHA to obtain a valid lien of the required priority. (3) Whether there are outstanding Federal or State tax claims (including taxes which under state law may become a lien superior to a previously attaching mortgage lien), (4) Whether outstanding judgments of record, bankruptcy, insolvency, or probate proceedings involving any part of the property, whether already owned by the borrower, or to be acquired by assumption or with loan funds, or involving the borrower or the seller exist, (5) If a water right is to be included in the security for the loan. The closing agent must attach a full legal description of the water right, (6) If wetlands easements or other conservation easements have been placed on the property, (7) If there are any liens or recorded claims which would prevent FmHA from obtaining an enforceable mortgage lien of the required priority on the security property, and
