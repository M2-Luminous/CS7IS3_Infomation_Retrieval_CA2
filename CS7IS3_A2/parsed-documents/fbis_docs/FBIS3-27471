He stressed that we should conscientiously understand the situation, grasp favorable opportunities, exert great efforts to attend to the local foreign affairs work, promote the opening of the municipality to the outside world, and quicken the development of Tianjin's economy. In his speech, Gao Dezhan first extended regards to the comrades who have diligently been working on the foreign affairs front. He said: The work relating to foreign affairs is of extreme importance and influences the overall situation. We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the sixth national meeting of foreign affairs office directors, further strengthen the local foreign affairs work in the new year, promote the opening of the municipality to all directions, promote economic development, and ensure the smooth progress of work relating to foreign economic relations and trade. He pointed out: At present, Tianjin has further expanded the scale of opening to the outside world, improved the investment environment, and quickened the pace of using foreign capital. Therefore, the comrades engaged in the work relating to foreign affairs must undertake important duties. This year, we should extensively expand the scale of opening to all directions; expand contacts with foreign countries; make foreign friends extensively; strengthen external propaganda; improve the investment environment; attract increasingly more foreign businessmen, personages of banking circles, and entrepreneurs to come to Tianjin to invest, conduct cooperation, make trips, and pay visits; introduce international human, material, and financial resources to Tianjin; and promote the acceleration of Tianjin's economy. Gao Dezhan pointed out: We should pay high attention to foreign affairs work and strive to create a new situation in Tianjin's foreign affairs work. The local foreign affairs work is an important component part of the whole country's overall foreign affairs work. The leaders at various levels and all departments should further improve the understanding about foreign affairs, pay high attention to the foreign affairs work, and strive to achieve local foreign affairs work in the new situation. He stressed: The foreign affairs departments should persistently take economic construction as a key link. Simultaneously, the foreign affairs work has its own special features and tasks. We should grasp foreign affairs policies, strengthen macroeconomic management, and serve the expansion of opening up and economic development. While related to foreign economic relations and trade, foreign affairs work is also different. Both supplement and promote each other. We should unite with all forces, form cohesive power, and achieve foreign affairs work. In doing foreign affairs work, we should pioneer new ways of thinking, suit the demands of the situation of reform and opening up, and make new breakthroughs in the new year. Gao Dezhan urged: We should strengthen the macroeconomic management of foreign affairs work and exercise centralized and unified leadership over foreign affairs work. Different departments should assume different responsibilities and make concerted efforts to bring their functions into better play. We should realistically strengthen the foreign affairs work and ensure the smooth progress of foreign contacts. It is necessary to further strengthen the construction of foreign affairs workers contingents, strengthen training and education, and comprehensively upgrade the quality of contingents. We should strictly conduct education on the discipline governing foreign affairs, foster a good image of foreign affairs cadres, achieve the foreign affairs work, and make contributions to further expanding the opening of Tianjin to the outside world and developing the economy. In his speech, Ye Disheng, vice mayor of the municipality, delineated expectations on foreign affairs work departments in the municipality. Geng Jianhua, chairman of the foreign affairs office of the municipal government, relayed the guidelines of the national meeting of foreign affairs office directors, summed up the 1993 foreign affairs work, and arranged the work tasks for 1994.
