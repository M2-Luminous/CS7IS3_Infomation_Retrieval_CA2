Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic supported the stance, explaining that the parliament would not probably be capable of discussing a bill on changes in the organization of local and state administration. The local elections are scheduled to take place in the autumn. President Michal Kovac pointed out that no essential progress in the reform of state administration had been made since the past local elections held in 1990, when the system of national committees was abolished. ZMOS Chairman Michal Sykora, delivering a report on the ZMOS activity, stressed the need to ratify the European Charter of local administration. He added the previous government could not ratify it because of legislation differences. But the parliament has recommended to the new government to prepare necessary documents for the ratification of the Charter which has been signed by the three other Visegrad Four countries -- the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
