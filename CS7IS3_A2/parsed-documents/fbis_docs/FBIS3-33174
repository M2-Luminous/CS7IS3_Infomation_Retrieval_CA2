As of 1 October 1994, every immigrant requesting political asylum in the United States will be charged $130. A corollary to that measure is that any person requesting political asylum will not be granted a work permit in the United States for six months following the date the petition was filed. Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] officials report that 364,000 requests have accumulated with 10,000 new requests being received each month. The aforementioned measures are expected to help expedite processing. At this time there are only 150 people who process political asylum and residency requests, thus the decisionmaking process takes an unusually long time to complete. There are plans to hire more personnel to allow the INS to reduce the number of unprocessed requests to a normal level. That seems perfectly normal and logical. But there are other considerations. Not all immigrants to the United States are unwanted, and political refugee status is granted to some with extraordinary ease. One example is those Cubans who dare cross the Florida channel in dilapidated sea vessels and by the most unusual and risky methods. This a politically oriented measure that is part of a crusade to wage a negative propaganda campaign against Cuba, a country that has adopted a social and political regime not to the U.S. Government's liking. The intention is to present these people as politically persecuted individuals who have escaped alleged repression in their respective countries. In those cases, after the newly arrived immigrants have made statements against their governments, political refugee status is granted swiftly in accordance with laws and dispositions in existence since the early days of the Cuban revolution. These Cuban immigrants are not the real targets of the recent measure to charge $130 for each political asylum request. There are mechanisms in the [word indistinct] community such as the relatives of the emigres or the counterrevolutionary organizations that can provide the money. The real issue is that there are hundreds maybe thousands of other immigrants who claim to have been persecuted in their countries in order to take advantage of the same benefits accorded the Cubans. Among those immigrants who risk their lives to travel under pathetic conditions to the United States -- also aboard fragile sea vessels -- we can mention the Haitians, who flee repression and famine in their country in search of a better future in the United States. These displaced persons have two monumental stumbling blocks that prevent them from being admitted to the northern colossus. The first is that they are black, and the other is that they are extremely poor with very little education. Such traits make them unwanted in affluent North American society, where there are already too many blacks who are unemployed, destitute, and discriminated against. It is very unlikely that a Haitian fugitive will be able to pay the $130 fee, much less be able to wait the established six month period to receive a permit that will allow them to work in the great northern country. The same can be said of the numerous Mexican and other Third World immigrants who seek to travel to the United States for economic reasons. Isn't the real intention behind the unusual tax quite clear?
