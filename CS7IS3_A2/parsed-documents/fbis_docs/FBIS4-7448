The leadership of the Serbian republic told the British diplomats that peace should first be established and territory demarcated in the area of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, then political talks could be initiated on the Croatian-Muslim Federation and the Serbian republic's position regarding this newly established state. Here is what Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the Srpska republic, told our correspondent Dragan Colovic on his expectations of the talks with U.S. President Clinton's special envoy Charles Redman, scheduled for tomorrow [31 March]: [Begin recording] [Koljevic] Well, we expect a further concretization of the talks initiated by the British, therefore, we expect the beginning of discussions on the demarcation and the beginning of discussions about those urgent measures that need to be taken in order to establish and strengthen peace. I believe that it was Mr. Akashi who said that peace was on glass legs; that is accurately stated; peace should move on from those glass legs to a more stable basis, a more stable material than glass. We shall discuss this with Mr. Redman and, of course, we shall also discuss the possibilities of the preliminary framework for the demarcation with the newly established federation. [Colovic] Will issues pertaining to relations between the Serbian republic and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also be included in the talks? [Koljevic] Well, most probably. It depends on what kind of concept is proposed for a link between the Srpska republic and this newly established federation, that is, there are various ways in which the Srpska republic can achieve its independence and sovereignty, and, of course, realize its natural links with Yugoslavia. I say natural, because it is quite normal and the international community is aware that the links between the Srpska republic and Yugoslavia are far more natural than the links currently burdened by antagonism. [sentence as heard] Of course, time will show that this antagonism can be overcome, but links with our brothers in Yugoslavia can only grow stronger. Therefore, we are primarily going to see what would be the internationally desirable sequence of measures that would not be in contradiction with out strategic interests. [end recording]
