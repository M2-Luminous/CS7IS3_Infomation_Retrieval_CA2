FR940523-2-00068 FR940523-2-00040 According to the investigators, prior to stimulation, seven of the nine patients with Sjogren's syndrome were considered to have slight amounts of moisture present, and the remaining two patients had ``no moisture'' present. Following stimulation, all nine patients reported subjective impressions of increased salivation as compared with prestimulation conditions. Clinical assessment was in agreement with the subjective patient evaluations. Weiss et al.7 reported that the electronic device stimulates residual salivary tissue in the oral and pharyngeal regions, producing increased salivation. In 1988, Steller et al.3 conducted a study of electrical stimulation of salivary flow in patients with biopsy-proven Sjogren's syndrome. The response to an electrical stimulus applied to the tongue and hard palate was observed in a randomized, double-blind, 4-week study of 29 subjects with xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. To be eligible to participate in the study, subjects had to have an unstimulated whole (total gland secretions) salivary flow rate of less than 0.2 g/min. Patients were randomly assigned to active or placebo devices, which they used for 3 minutes, three times a day for 4 weeks. Response to stimulation was assessed as whole saliva flow rates, which were measured at weeks 0, 2, and 4, both before and after stimulation with the device. According to the investigators, there were no statistically significant differences between changes in prestimulation whole saliva flow rates or differences between the net changes in mean whole saliva flow rate (poststimulation minus prestimulation flow) of the active and placebo groups at each visit. The investigators did find the changes in mean poststimulation whole saliva flow rates between subjects using active and placebo devices from weeks 0 to 4 of the study to be statistically significant. However, analysis of the results showed that the mean increase in the poststimulation flow rate of the active device group (13 subjects) was due mainly to the responses of three subjects who showed marked increases in their whole saliva flow rates during the study. The investigators noted that the initial salivary flow rates of these subjects were the highest in that group, and their labial salivary gland focus scores were among the lowest. The investigators concluded that some Sjogren's syndrome patients with residual salivary flow show significant responses to electrical stimulation, but others with low or absent whole saliva flow rates do not respond. During the 4-week study period no change in the appearance of the oral mucosa was observed at the site of electrode placement, and no marked changes or patterns of variation in subjects' pulse and blood pressure were observed before or after the device was used. Discussion Xerostomia is a complaint of elderly individuals, particularly women.6 Decreases in both quantity of saliva as well as composition cause a multitude of problems. In a healthy mouth, copious saliva containing essential electrolytes, glycoproteins, and antimicrobial enzymes continually lubricates and protects the oral mucosa, thus cleaning the mouth, regulating acidity, maintaining the integrity of the teeth, and destroying bacteria. Currently, xerostomia is managed on the basis of subjective symptoms, evidence of reduction in salivary flow, and complications that result from dry mouth. To alleviate some of the problems resulting from salivary dysfunction, pharmacologic sialagogues such as pilocarpine and pyridostigmine as well as sialagogues that include sugarless chewing gum, mints, or candy are prescribed in order to stimulate more salivary flow.18 Sialagogues are effective only if salivary gland function is present. The preliminary investigation by Weiss et al.7 in 1986 demonstrated that a probe providing electrical stimulation applied to the tongue and hard palate of patients with xerostomia presumed secondary of Sjogren's syndrome produces a salivary response. The salivary response was obtained in the nine patients following a single session of one to three electrical stimulations of 3 minutes each. As a preliminary investigation, this study did not include a control group or any quantitative assessment of salivary response, duration of response, or long-term assessment of efficacy. Moreover, seven of the nine patients tested exhibited residual saliva production prior to treatment and may have been exhibiting a tactile response to the probe. The only other published report determining whether an electrical stimulus applied to the tongue and hard palate could stimulate salivary flow in subjects with xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome is the randomized, double-blind, 4-week study reported by Steller et al. in 1988.3 The results of this short-term study indicate that some Sjogren's patients with residual salivary flow in an unstimulated state (<0.11&hyph;0.20 g/2 min) show a significant response to electrical stimulation, but others with low (less than 0.11 g/2 min) or absent whole saliva rates do not respond or respond to a clinically insignificant degree. Only 3 of 13 patients using the active device showed a significant response (about 0.6&hyph;1.0 g/2 min) in salivary production when compared with the responses of the placebo group. The whole saliva flow rates of the remaining 10 subjects in the active group remained below 0.25 g/2 min throughout the study and were not of the order of magnitude necessary to indicate a significant salivary response. Whole saliva flow rates of 10 subjects in the placebo group remained below 0.20 g/2 min throughout the study. It appears that additional studies with larger patient populations are needed to define specific degrees of salivary function or dysfunction that would respond to electrical stimulation. These studies could help to determine whether a single salivary response to electro-stimulation or some other test such as lip biopsy focus score should be used to help identify those patients who may benefit from the technique.
