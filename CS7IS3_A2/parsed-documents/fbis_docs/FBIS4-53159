QANTAS and the Australian Aviation College have won a $9 million contract to train 60 pilots -- a deal being sponsored by Australia's overseas aid organization, AIDAB [Australian International Development Assistance Bureau]. Len Novak reports: [Begin Novak recording] It is the first time any aviation course will be undertaken for Vietnam by Australians. The Adelaide-based Australian Aviation College will train the students to airline entry; QANTAS will teach the students how to fly airliners up to Boeings and Airbuses. The first group of 20 cadets will start their training next month and together with the rest of the contingent will form the nucleus of Vietnam's new breed of pilots. The country is moving to modernize its fleet and needs qualified crew. It is expected the entire training program will be staged during the next two years, allowing a much needed boost to Australia's ailing aviation industry. [end recording]
