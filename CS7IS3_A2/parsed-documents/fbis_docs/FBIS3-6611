During his visit, he is scheduled to meet with President (and CPC General Secretary) Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and other Chinese leaders. In his talks with Li, Hosokawa is expected to reaffirm "future-oriented" relations between Japan and China. The two leaders will also deal with "bilateral ties that contribute to the international community," in talks on security in the Asia region, the Korean peninsula, disarmament, nuclear nonproliferation, weapons export control, the role of the United Nations, and environmental and drug-related issues. Needless to say, the two countries rely heavily on each other and relations with China are very important for Japan. Development of good and stable relations between Japan, China, and the United States is indispensable for the security and prosperity of the Asia- Pacific region, and for the rest of the world. Hosokawa should use his visit as an opportunity to frankly exchange opinions with Chinese leaders based on a global viewpoint to deepen and mature bilateral relations. One of the pressing issues to be discussed in Beijing will be how to cope with the suspected nuclear weapon development by the DPRK. The Japanese Government has urged China to use its influence over the DPRK to persuade that country to accept nuclear inspections. Jiang has said: "Our unchanging position is that the Korean peninsula should be nuclear free." China has promised to lend its support, saying: "We will wield our influence for a positive purpose." However, recently the DPRK again refused to open its undeclared nuclear sites to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA has said in its report that "it has not been proved that Pyongyang has not been developing nuclear weapons," thus the nuclear suspicion has not yet been dispelled. We hope that Hosokawa will again urge China to persuade the DPRK during his visit. Meanwhile, Asian nations are becoming increasingly concerned about China's growing defense outlays. In China's fiscal 1994 budget plan, 22.4 percent are allocated to defense expenses. The Chinese Government has repeatedly told Japan that it has no intention of strengthening its military power. However, Beijing should realize that the fact that the defense program of superpower China is not transparent has caused concern among neighboring countries. During his visit, Hosokawa should question China's true intentions in expanding its military forces, and convey to Chinese leaders the strong concerns held by neighboring nations. He should also urge Beijing to make its defense program clearer by issuing "defense white papers." China is currently under pressure from the United States to improve its human rights record so that it can maintain its most- favored-nation trade status. Based on the understanding that respect for basic human rights is a universal value, Hosokawa should encourage China to show other countries specific measures to improve its human rights record. In recent years, trade between Japan and China has greatly increased. The trade volume reached about $38 billion last year. Japan has now become China's largest trade partner in the region, surpassing Hong Kong. Japanese investment in China has also increased. China, which is making a rapid transition to a market economy, is beset by various problems. Therefore, it has high expectations from Japan. During his visit, Hosokawa is expected to pledge Japan's support for China's reform and open-door policies. He is also expected to unveil a new aid program for China that includes the fourth yen loan plan. We hope that the prime minister will have a productive dialogue with Chinese leaders.
