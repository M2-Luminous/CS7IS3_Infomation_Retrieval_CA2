The referendum of 29 December 1991 has the force of a legal act, legally securing the cohesion and equality of all citizens of the Azerbaijani State, as a unified nation. Azerbaijani citizens and Turko-Akhyskhi (Meskheten citizens), Russians and Udi, Ukrainians and Assyrians, Belarusians and Talyshi, Budukhi and Tati, Khinalugi and Kurds, Krizi and Lezgini, Avari and Jews, Ingili and Tsakhuri and others -- all have equal rights in the land of Azerbaijan and of their own will have shown the world that they regard this country, with which their past, present and future, and all their thoughts are related, as their own common native land. History and the present day, however, attest to the fact that such harmonious agreement in the life of the multi-ethnic people of Azerbaijan is not to everyone's liking. Over the past few decades, destructive forces, both within and from without, have repeatedly tried and continue to try to sow dissension among Azerbaijan's ethnic groups, particularly to incite them against the Azerbaijani. They have partially succeeded in their attempts: one of the terrible consequences was the Karabakh problem and the never-ending chain of military-political, ethno-confessional and socio-economic collisions of domestic and foreign order connected with it. The most monstrous result is the genocide of Azerbaijani citizens and the many years of undeclared war between Armenia and the people of Azerbaijan. The main goal is to annihilate the Azerbaijani ethnic group and seize its lands, and to provoke small ethnic groups into leaving the structure of the Azerbaijani Republic. That is why we qualify the Karabakh problem thrust on Azerbaijan as part of an international conspiracy, aimed against the Islam and Turkish world and at escalation of ethnic conflicts and regional wars. The point is that Azerbaijan occupies a convenient strategic region in the Caucasus, rich in natural resources and raw material, and has a modern industrial and transport infrastructure. Realization of the plans is therefore related to the intention of creating in Azerbaijan other "Karabakhs," in which anti-Azerbaijan forces have also succeeded: some of the leaders of certain ethnic groups in Azerbaijan, heated up because of the military cordon, are demanding "independence" and "reunification" with their fellow countrymen. One of the effective responses to these attempts was the presidential edict of 16 September 1992 "On Protecting the Rights and Freedoms and on State Support of the Development of the Language and Culture of Ethnic Minorities, Small Numbers of People and Ethnic Groups Residing in the Azerbaijani Republic." An important help in putting it into effect is, in addition to the activity of official structures, the activity of cultural societies of Slavs and Udi, Russian and Tati, Lezgini and Talyshi, Kurds and Jews, and also of the National Academy of Sciences of the multi-specialty Institute of Ethnic Relations. Within the framework of the institute, a special department is at work to study small ethnic groups, and is designed to help solve the group of problems, in conjunction with analogous departments in the institutes of Literature, Linguistics, Pedagogy and Teacher Improvement, and with cultural centers and societies. At the same time, success in the sphere of an ethnic policy in many ways depends on how fully we succeed in getting the indisputable truth to each representative of the small ethnic groups: if there is discrimination against any of them, this means a similar fate, in no lesser degree, has been readied for the Azerbaijani themselves. Let us recall the years of Stalinist repressions and the totalitarian system, when Azerbaijani citizens and other Turkish-speaking peoples of the USSR were subjected to persecution on the widest scale. It was these people who were deprived of their alphabets and the better part of the intelligentsia, their territory and cultural monuments. Even in our times one can mention definite discrimination against Azerbaijani citizens, but now it is within the limits of their own state. These are the attempts of certain Azerbaijanophiles, together with the state officials from the ruling NFA [People's Front of Azerbaijan], to link the history and culture of Azerbaijan with the Turkish world from the beginning. Among these can be included the striving of others to see the sources of everything Azerbaijani stemming from the time that Islam appeared. Still others tried to link Azerbaijani citizens to everything Iranian. Directly connected to these false ideas, it seems to us, is the renaming of the Azerbaijani language in Turkish (a law of December 1992), even though not one of the peoples speaking the languages of the Turkic family hit upon this. The Uzbek speak Uzbek, Khakassia -- Khakassian, Yakut -- Yakut, Chuvashia -- Chuvashian. The list can go on. As a result, there is an imminent threat of ethnic and linguistic conflicts, leading to open confrontation on the part of the small ethnic groups. The linguistic policy is one of the most important aspects of ethnic relations, and language can become a catalyst and detonator of an interethnic collision, which is being observed even now in the Azerbaijani Republic. This is one of the reasons why the small ethnic groups of Azerbaijan "remembered" that each of them also speak in their own language, about their own "historical past." In a word, the situation has grown complicated, and is fraught with the danger that the Azerbaijani Republic will explode from within. There is, however, a possibility of avoiding cataclysms in the ethnic sphere. For this we must use the existing world experience and historical past, and draw specialists in various fields and an intelligent part of the leaders of the cultural societies of small ethnic groups into creating a state conceptual program of ethnic policy.
