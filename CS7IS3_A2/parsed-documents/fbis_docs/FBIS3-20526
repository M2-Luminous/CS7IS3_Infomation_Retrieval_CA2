This is the latest news provided for reporters by the Domestic Trade Department. Continuing to reduce materials distributed by the state command plan. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, especially the last few years, the supplies department has undergone a series of reforms, allowing many capital goods to enter the market. In the past, the number of materials allocated directly by the state command plan was as high as 256. After years of reform, the number has been reduced to 27. In 1994, the number will be further reduced to 10--steel products, timber, cement, coal, heavy oil, copper, lead, truck, electric wire and cable, and other. All products, except for the above 10, will be allowed to enter the market. Even of these 10 products, the quantity, ratio, and variety to be allocated plan will all be reduced substantially. The quantity of steel, iron, coal, and other major supplies to be allocated accounts for less than 50 percent of total such resources. The quantity of such allocation will be reduced by another 20 percent in 1994. Conscientiously strengthening the building and management of the capital goods market. The Domestic Trade Department has determined that efforts will be made to do a good job in the layout, location, and building of national and regional key capital goods wholesale markets. By the late Ninth Five-Year Plan period, we should strive to build about 10 large influential capital goods markets throughout the nation. At the same time, we should speed up the building of several new capital goods wholesale markets, do a good job in experimenting with capital goods futures market, and ensure that each and every experiment is successful. With regard various types of established capital goods markets, it is necessary to strengthen management and ensure that they are functioning properly. Currently, efforts should be made to connect the network of central and peripheral markets, and domestic and foreign market. We should stress linking the network of Beiyang (Tianjin) steel marke, expand the scope of influence, and develop the group function. Further deepening the reform of capital goods enterprises and creating conditions for establishing modern enterprise system. Next year, all capital goods enterprises must march toward the direction of establishing a modern enterprise system in accordance with the demand of "clear property rights, definite right and responsibility, separated government and enterprise, and scientific management." The Ministry of Domestic Trade is preparing to experiment with a reform in its subsidiary companies that ensure the selection of managers and the appreciation of capital. Under this experiment, all powers and responsibilities specified in the "Stipulations" will be granted to enterprises. All capital goods supply departments will do the same. At the same time, efforts should also be made to vigorously push the shareholding system and expand the scope of experiment. Next year we should try to select as many as possible high-return, strong, well-managed capital goods enterprises to carry out the reform of shareholding system and promote closed corporations where employees are shareholders so as to speed up the transformation of mechanism of capital goods enterprises. Strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control to ensure the normal operation of capital goods market. Currently, China's system is at a stage where the old is being replaced by the new and China's economic development is at the stage of rapid growth with soaring demand. Resources are relatively tight, market development is very immature, and macroeconomic regulation and control is particularly indispensable in regard to capital goods. The supply and demand situation, price level, and the direction of allocation of important capital goods needed for production and construction all require macroeconomic regulation and control. In the second half of 1993, when the capital goods market was sliding, in order to support production enterprises, state-owned capital goods enterprises procured and stored 800,000 tons of steel products, 40,000 tons of nonferrous metal, and a number of automobile, thus making positive contributions to the development of the national economy.
