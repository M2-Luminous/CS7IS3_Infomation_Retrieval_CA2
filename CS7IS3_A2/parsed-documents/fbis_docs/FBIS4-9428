The turnabout which many found quite unexpected, came to light in a statement by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev last Saturday. He described the NATO threat of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs as an adequate response at the United Nations' request. Kozyrev condemned the Serbs, using the words that would be used by Washington, Bonn, some Arab capitals or people showing open resentment towards the Serbs. Less than a day before, his view was completely different. It was then that he told reporters that the NATO decision to launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions might prompt the conflict to escalate. He said that the NATO military option was not the best solution. He added that the air strikes decision would clash even with the broadest interpretation of the U.N. resolution and could alter the character of U.N. operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The following day Kozyrev's statements were different altogether. All of a sudden, NATO air strikes were utterly in keeping with the U.N. resolution and did not change the character of U.N. operations. Political and diplomatic inconsistency had begun earlier, when Kozyrev's deputy Vitaliy Churkin at Moscow airport raised an outrageous hue and cry against the Serb side alone. He made no mention of the Moslem share of the blame, to which he had often referred in the past. Moscow analysts believe that NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions should have been announced first and then given the green light. There is a difference in views between Russia's army and political-diplomatic leadership. Defence Minister Pavel Grachev at a press conference in Moscow has said that he simply cannot unilaterally blame the Serb side for the difficult situation around Gorazde, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. "We have at our disposal complete information on the situation in this region of the former Yugoslavia," Grachev said, obviously making it clear that the information possessed by the army leadership differed from that launched daily to serve the interests of the world power wielders. Grachev qualified NATO and U.N. decision as imprudent and maintained that the air strikes should be abandoned. A sudden swerve in Russia's diplomacy is followed by a well-orchestrated campaign to bring Russia in line with the West regarding the Bosnian conflict. Analysts say that the situation now was the same as two years ago when Russia had done its best to make the imposition of the sanctions against Yugoslavia seen as absolutely justified.
