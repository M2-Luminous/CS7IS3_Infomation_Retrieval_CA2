It is to be established that the agreement on the division of output (hereinafter called the agreement) is one form of the state's treaty relations with investors -- utilizers of natural resources -- which provides for the division of extracted mineral raw materials among the contracting parties, which takes the place of the levying of taxes, dues, and duties, including customs and excise duties and other compulsory payments provided for in existing legislation (herinafter called taxes), with the exception of profits tax and payments for the right to utilize natural resources, which may be paid, by agreement among the sides, both in a cost form and in kind. 2. The parties to the agreement are: the state -- the Russian Federation in the persons of the Russian Federation Government and the organ of executive power of the component of the Russian Federation on whose territory the section of the earth is located, or the organs authorized by them; the investor -- the legal person, including a foreign one, or the group of indicated legal persons, with or without the creation of a new legal person in accordance with Russian Federation legislation. 3.

The right to utilize natural resources on the terms of the agreement is granted to the investor according to the procedure provided for in Russian Federation legislation and is endowed with a license. When the investor is a group of legal persons without the creation of a new legal person, a license may be issued to one of these legal persons, with the license noting that he acts on behalf of this group. 5. The agreement defines the terms for the use of the section of the earth and also includes special points which establish the procedure for: defining that part of the extracted mineral raw materials, including the maximum part, which is transferred to the investor's ownership to compensate him for his production expenses; dividing the extracted mineral raw materials between the state and the investor, with the exception of payments for the right to utilize natural resources and that part of the extracted mineral raw materials transferred to the investor's ownership to compensate him for his production expenses; handing over to the state that part of the mineral raw materials that belongs to him under the terms of the agreement; levying the profits tax and payments for the right to utilize natural resources. 6.

The profits tax and the payment levied for the right to utilize natural resources are distributed in accordance with existing legislation and are entered in the appropriate budgets. 7. The mineral raw materials passing to the investor's ownership under the terms of the agreement may be exported from the Russian Federation by him according to the procedure defined for exports of output of his own production. At the same time, the agreement lays down long-term export quotas for such raw materials for enterprises, which do not have the right to export output of their own production outside the Russian Federation without a license. 8.

If during the agreement's period of validity Russian Federation legislative acts establish norms tha worsen the commercial results of the investor's activity within the framework of the agreement, changes are made to it to ensure that the investor gets the commercial results,which could have been secured if the legislative norms operating at the time the agreement was concluded had been applied. The procedure for making the aforesaid changes is defined in the agreement. 12.
