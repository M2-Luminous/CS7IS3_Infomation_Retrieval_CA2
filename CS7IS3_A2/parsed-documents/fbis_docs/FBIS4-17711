FBIS4-17711 "drsov082_v_94006" FBIS-SOV-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 Lithuania Brazauskas, Walesa Address Parliament Brazauskas, Walesa Address Parliament WS2604175894 Tallinn BNS in English 1339 GMT 26 Apr 94 WS2604175894 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Vilnius, Apr 26, BNS -- History should be left to historians, and more attention should be paid to regional cooperation and human rights, Polish President Lech Walesa said addressing the Lithuanian parliament Tuesday [26 April]. Walesa and Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas made speeches in the parliament after they signed an agreement on friendship and cooperation. Walesa said Lithuania and Poland have a common history, which must be studied well in order to avoid mistakes in the future. The Polish president said the two countries must not passively observe the changes in Europe and around the world, but should actively participate in the stabilization process that goes on in Eastern and Central Europe. Walesa said relations within the Visegrad group (Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic) and cooperation between the three Baltic states serve as examples for developing stronger regional cooperation. He said Poland, as a Visegrad country and Lithuania's neighbor, seeks to develop cooperation in the entire region, including Germany, Russia and Scandinavian countries. Walesa noted that membership in the European Union is a common goal of both Lithuania and Poland. He said "Poland is a natural ally of the Baltic states" on the road to a unified Europe. "An expanded NATO bloc should be a guarantee of stability in this part of Europe," the Polish president said, and added that Poland and Lithuania are concerned about the extreme militarization of the Kaliningrad region. Walesa called the signed Lithuanian-Polish accord an achievement of democracy, and noted that democracy means equal rights to all, including national minorities. He expressed hope that the Lithuanian parliament will manage to guarantee equal rights to Lithuania's Poles. In Walesa's words, Poland is pleased with the activities of its Lithuanian minority, especially the self- government and agricultural achievements in the predominantly Lithuanian-populated Punsk region. In conclusion, Walesa said he is certain that an agreement between the Polish Eagle and the Lithuanian Vytis (the state emblems) will become "a foundation of a home for Poles and Lithuanians." Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas, who spoke after Walesa, proposed to hold a summit of Visegrad and Baltic leaders. Brazauskas said Poland and Lithuania, which are the biggest Visegrad and Baltic states, could stimulate a dialog between the two regions on all levels. A free trade agreement between the Baltics and Visegrad countries would be a step in this direction, he said. "I think Vilnius and Warsaw could join efforts to arrange a meeting between Visegrad and Baltic leaders this or early next year." During a summit in March, the presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said their countries will seek to expand cooperation on the North-Baltic-Visegrad axis. Discussing pan-European political processes, Brazauskas pointed out certain aspects of relations with Russia. He said Poland and Lithuania, which have borders with the Kaliningrad region, are especially interested in a successful development of democratic reforms both in the region and in Russia in general. "The Russian Federation could essentially contribute to security and stability in the area by gradually transforming the region from a military stronghold into a zone of active international business." Brazauskas expressed regret that a free trade agreement between Lithuania and Russia is blocked and that "a commercial-economic agreement does not come into force because of Russia's positions. Such a policy is neither positive nor having prospects, and it does not stimulate stability in Europe." Commenting on the Lithuanian-Polish friendship and cooperation agreement, Brazauskas said "Lithuania achieved its most important goals but did not violate any of its essential and vital interests. A clever compromise was reached." Brazauskas noted, however, that "Lithuania does not give up its principled position that Vilnius and the Vilnius region were a part of Poland before the war only by fact, but not lawfully."
