It created, on the initiative of the European Union, an arbitration commission. It invited all involved parties to conclude a peace agreement on the occasion of sundry conferences. It implemented a humanitarian aid process in order to alleviate the suffering of civilian populations. Under a UN mandate, it has sent to the region troops which amount to some 30,000 men. France has played a pivotal role in this action, especially from a military standpoint, since it is today the country with the most soldiers in the region. However, it must now be acknowledged that all these efforts failed to achieve the intended results, that the fighting goes on, and that none of the parties involved appear ready to agree to a peaceful settlement. In such a context, it is up to the international community to face up to its responsibilities. It must keep working toward a peace agreement by calling on all the belligerents to make the necessary concessions. This is possible if the international community acts in a consistent and closely coordinated manner. Furthermore, all steps likely to ensure a better protection of the populations must be implemented. Accordingly, it was decided at the last NATO summit to ensure that UN forces in Srebrenica are relieved and that Tuzla airport is opened for humanitarian aid purposes. It is time for this decision to be implemented, including through military means if need be. To this end, the United Nations must deploy the necessary means without delay. However, sustainable peace can only be achieved if the international community, spearheaded by the European Union, acts consistently with a view to convincing the warring parties that they must come to an agreement. The necessary talks within the European Union will take place this week.
