But what is an infant just born to the light of day to eat? This is a very urgent question in the Ukrainian capital. A young mom inquired at one of the children's polyclinics in Kiev: ``Doctor, please give me a prescription for some baby food. I can't find any, and he isn't breast feeding....'' A joke? Unfortunately, no. Mothers of newborn infants have started turning to doctors as a last resort. A Kitchen Where They Don't Make Anything I went to the nearest children's dairy kitchen which, according to the idea, was supposed to provide assistance to mothers and children first. They looked at me like I had just fallen from the Moon: ``We don't make anything at all for newborn infants, but we do make some things for older children starting to eat solid food.'' What is an unfortunate mom to feed an infant being raised on formula--that's 70 percent of the infants in the city, by the way? As it turns out there are two solutions to our situation. The first is to go to the market and buy imported baby food there. But given an impoverished existence, far from every mother can allow herself to do this. You have to put out 1,500-2,000 karbovantsy in coupons for a package of formula. For some mothers this is a month's wages. The second option is left to them--going to the dairy store. After standing a couple of hours in line, such a mother would buy milk, dilute it, and give it to the youngster. If the child is a little older, she would prepare a gruel of some sort. But this is hardly what a youngster needs for normal development, just so that its legs would grow strong. ``Yes, that's the way it is,'' was the confirmation I got to my conclusions at the Main Territorial Medical Association under the state administration. ``We are seriously troubled by this issue, and we've been trying to do something about it for a long time....'' In our city there are 28,000 youngsters up to 1 year old. Nutrition support is catastrophic. Given an annual demand for dry adapted--that is, prepared according to all of the rules--formulas of 705 tonnes, the trade system hasn't sold anything for the last year and a half. The absence of such food products forces parents to feed their youngsters whatever they can. And this raises morbidity and mortality. Could it be the older youngsters are in a better position? If only that were true: Given a daily demand of 450,000 baby food portions, five times less is actually prepared for them. And what can you ask those 13 dairy kitchens (for the entire population of 3 million) to do? Their output is low, they are primitive, with manual labor dominating. How can there be any discussion of quantity and quality of food products? And it is impossible to reequip them: All of them are set up in residential buildings, and you're not going to start filling them with industrial equipment. So who can you count on? On the city's dairy industry? Yes, it does produce sterilized milk in 200 gm packages. But this is only 1.8 tonnes, as compared to a daily demand of 7. The city is feeling an acute shortage of juices and of strained fruits and vegetables. The demand for them is 15-20 percent satisfied. The assortment is extremely limited. With our life today being as difficult as it is, there are many needs to be met. In the opinion of some officials there are problems of even greater importance, and so this one--baby food--is relegated to the back burner. There's also the psychological set that somehow we'll squeak by with the help of a kind uncle. Yes, kind foreign uncles organizing humanitarian aid can be found. The city received a hundred tons of food for youngsters. It was immediately distributed among the rayons. However, this is but a drop in the ocean. And the spring is extremely unreliable--today it's flowing, but tomorrow it may dry up. No, we need to resolutely seek and find our own domestic sources. The Legacy--24 Decrees This problem didn't of course come up just today, or even yesterday. It is a legacy of former times. The former Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee and Ukrainian Council of Ministers adopted 24 decrees on this issue in the last few years. To what end? The Khorol and Balta baby food plants existing today in Poltava and Odessa oblasts have stopped putting out the products children need. It would have been nice to organize production of the popular baby food Vitalakt in Kiev, but beginning this year it will no longer be produced. Ukrainian scientists and specialists in baby food have created other food products. Samples have been tested, and all of the requirements on goods of this kind have been observed--homogeneity, sterilized raw materials, preservation of nutritional value, modern preparation procedures. And all of this has been gathering dust on archive shelves for years on end. Is an enterprise that would accept responsibility for placing the developments of scientists into production, one which would work for the good of the children, really not to be found in a city of 3 million? And what about the farmers? If they wanted to, of course they could find the needed raw materials. Baby food is not a public health problem. Nonetheless, the Main Territorial Medical Association of the state administration is energetically trying to get something going. S. Osipenko, a pediatrician by trade who knows her business well and the director of the association's department for safeguarding maternity and childhood, showed me a thick file of correspondence with higher and other bodies of administration. Medical workers have done more than just provide warnings of the disastrous situation--they offered and continue to offer specific proposals that take the difficulties of the current economic situation in Ukraine into account. The first proposal is, let us say, the minimum program: appropriating the needed amount of hard currency to the city for the purchase of baby food abroad. Sima Ivanovna Osipenko showed me samples of such products. One is made by a Polish company--Bebiko. The mother places a few spoonsful of the package contents in water, and a minute later she can feed her infant. Or there's strained corn produced by an Israeli company--tasty, nourishing, and extremely easy to manufacture. It would be good to buy such things. But they are expensive, and beyond the means of many mothers. Subsidies are necessary. This is what the Main Territorial Medical Association took to the city's state administration. But we also need to think about the maximum program--we can't buy food products abroad forever, we need to learn how to produce them ourselves. To finally surmount the disastrous situation, medical specialists propose, as a beginning, accelerating construction of a specialized shop at City Dairy No 4 in Minskiy Rayon, and a baby food factory-kitchen in Troyeshchina-Vygurovshchina producing 40,000 portions per shift. But why has the health service been working alone on this problem all of these years? Why is the trade department, which could make a certain contribution to eliminating the shortage if it so desired, sitting on the sidelines? Interested departments were convened at the offices of the state administration's department of food, trade and the consumer market in order to discuss this problem, and to finally come up with specific ways of solving it. Trade workers from the state-run company Kiyev were invited to the conference. The question of purchasing imported baby foods was thoroughly discussed. The Kiyev firm was directed to implement the proposal--in particular, to make contact with foreign firms and make the best deal. And so, what happened? A considerable amount of time has passed, but things still haven't gotten off the ground. There remains the maximum program--organizing our own production. Specialists unanimously agreed that this question has to be resolved at the state level. If we are unable to do so, we will be faced by a universal increase in the morbidity and mortality of young children, including infants up to a year old, and steady worsening of the demographic situation. Are we really going to let things slide until even more women decide not to have any children at all?
