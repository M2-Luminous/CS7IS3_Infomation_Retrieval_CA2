FBIS4-59551 "drnes094_c_94003" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 Egypt Musa on Peace Talks, Yemen Crisis Musa on Peace Talks, Yemen Crisis NC1305193094 London MBC Television in Arabic 1730 GMT 13 May 94 NC1305193094 London MBC Television Arabic BFN [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa by Nasir Farghali in London; date not given; from the "Face to Face" program -- recorded] [Text] [Farghali] The incident that is still on the minds of the Arab public since all of us watched the signing of the Cairo agreement on 4 May took place on the stage of the Conference Hall in Cairo. Can you tell us what happened, since you were a principal player in it? [Musa] We were not involved in what happened on the day of the signing. It was between Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and Yitzhaq Rabin. It concerned clarification about some matters related to the maps of Jericho and Gaza, specifically Jericho. The size agreed on was not final. In other words, the agreement on it was not as it had been decided on early that morning after a long night of discussions that continued in President Mubarak's office until 0300. We agreed that there would be a letter recording that the size was not final and that negotiations would continue to define the size of the Jericho area. That letter was not appended to the map. Abu-'Ammar hesitated when he was about to sign until he saw the letter and then he signed. [Farghali] Coincidentally, I was covering the event for MBC on that day. We all saw Abu-'Ammar write something down. [Musa] He was referring to the letter. [Farghali] What happened when you withdrew from the stage for some minutes? [Musa] Abu-'Ammar wanted to see the letter. President Mubarak also wanted to see it. We wanted to be sure that the letter existed. When we ascertained this, Abu-'Ammar returned to sign. It was not a question of whether Abu-'Ammar wanted to sign or not. We wanted to see the letter. The discussions ended at 0300 and we were all tired and could have missed something. This is why we all wanted to be sure before Abu-'Ammar signed. When I say we all, I mean Palestine and Egypt. We wanted to be sure that this letter existed. [Farghali] Among the Palestinians there are reservations about and fears from the peace process and from what is happening on the Palestinian-Israeli track. I believe that Egypt has a major responsibility here because it has been its fate to play this great role. [Musa] The fears will remain. We understand this because we, too, had some fears during the Camp David talks. We asked ourselves: Will the Israeli side fulfill its commitments? Will the issue end as we want? Will we retrieve all the territories when there are talks about stages? The important thing is how Abu-'Ammar and the Palestinians manage their own affairs and tackle the problems that will arise. There will be many problems, but there is no other way. The issue now is the quick retrieval of the land. The problem of Israeli settlements will become less the quicker we are in retrieving the land. Had the Palestinian side worked with us when we were having the Camp David negotiations with Israel, it would have most certainly reached a better agreement. Why? Because the number of settlements and settlers was much less then. Instead of dealing with 120,000 settlers, the Palestinian side would have dealt with 8,000 settlers and with 10 or a small number of settlements instead of 180. That exacerbated the situation. The more we waited, the more Palestinian lands were lost. The Palestinians have now started on the right track, namely that of obtaining the land and starting to build an entity and a Palestinian authority with its own identity and a large measure of independence. Of course, all of us on the Arab side should realize that the Oslo agreement on Gaza and Jericho first--which was signed in Washington and on which negotiations continued until its document of implementation was signed in Cairo--is the first step. The Palestinian state has not been established. The right to self-determination has not been exercised yet. The Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied territories has not been done yet. Self-rule in all the occupied territories has not been achieved yet. These are the facts and there is no need for oneupmanship or criticism. Why? Because we, and specifically the Palestinians, are not starting from zero but from below zero. For the Palestinians, what is needed are not slogans, shouts, or oneupmanship. Whoever has more to give than Abu-'Ammar, let him come forward and show us. Let him say: I can bring you such and such things. I say very frankly that we believe that criticism for its own sake and hoping that the 21st or 22nd Century might bring a solution are shallow words. Do what you can do. Take your land. Achieve the first Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories occupied after 1967. The more we stay without improving the situation, the more lands are lost. Oneupmanship and too much talk do not bring any results. [Farghali] We opened this subject because, as you know, many people do not have the full picture. You certainly clarified some very important matters for us. It is being said, for instance, that the Egyptian leadership is putting pressure on Abu-'Ammar personally to sign.... [Musa, interrupting] There is absolutely no Egyptian pressure. We fully realize the delicate nature of this stage as well as Arab sensitivities. What Egypt is doing is to help the Palestinians, as I have already told you. Take the example you mentioned regarding the signing ceremony on the stage. President Mubarak's concern, like that of president 'Arafat, was to be sure that a letter really existed. So there was no reproach or blame on our part. Our feeling was: Well, he is right. Let him be sure about every point before he signs. The Palestinian side is the weak side in the negotiations, because as I told you they started from below zero. The Israeli side is stronger because it has the land, the power, and several international circles backing it. The Egyptian role sought to give adequate strength to the Palestinians to be stronger against the Israelis. There were several points that on many occasions we said we could not accept and would reject, even if the Palestinians accepted them. Why? Because there are certain issues that we can never waive. We support the Palestinians in regaining their land. We do not push the Palestinians to make a specific decision. Absolutely not. The decision rests with Abu-'Ammar, the PLO Central Committee, and the Palestinian leadership. If they ask for our opinion, we give it to them, and it is not binding. If our assistance is requested, we assist. If we are not asked to give our opinion or if our assistance is not requested, we do not interfere. [Farghali] In view of the current Palestinian circumstances you have mentioned, the Egyptian role becomes inevitable. However, things are different on the Syrian track. What is the nature of or prospects for the Egyptian role along that track? [Musa] As you said, The Syrian issue or track is different. This is because there are more markers on this track than on the Palestinian track. For instance, there are Syrian international borders that can never be ignored. The same applies to Lebanon, which is a separate track. The Egyptian role here proceeds from the same policy and philosophy governing the subject. If our help is requested, we are ready to give it. If our opinion is sought, we are ready to give it. But Egypt does not volunteer to get involved in any of the Arab-Israeli negotiations unless the parties themselves ask us to help. [Farghali] You will give a lecture here in London on the Middle East and regional policies. Many people wonder what is really being negotiated on the Syrian track. As you have stated, the international borders are known and there are several signals from Israel that the Golan will be returned to Syria. The problem of the settlements on the Golan is not as complicated as it is in other occupied Arab territories. But some say that the negotiations are actually about the situation in that area after a certain Israeli-Syrian settlement is reached. Is this true? [Musa] No, it is not. What is happening is negotiations about the withdrawal, the future relations between Syria and Israel, and the security measures. That is all. [Farghali] Do you foresee progress on the Israeli-Lebanese track? [Musa] The Israeli-Lebanese track is very clear. Even under the Likud government the former prime minister declared that Israel has no territorial designs on Lebanon. Moreover, UN Security Council Resolution 425 is clear regarding the subject of withdrawal, in addition to other UN resolutions on the Middle East. The issue between Israel and Lebanon is not over territory but over how to achieve joint or mutual security and avert military clashes in southern Lebanon. There are certain political conditions in the region that link the Lebanese track to the Syrian track. However, it is clear to all that the Lebanese track is independent in all its aspects. [Farghali] Another crisis has surfaced recently, namely the Yemeni crisis. You have repeatedly explained Egypt's stance on this situation. Egypt has always had a historic role in Yemen. How is Egypt dealing with the current crisis? [Musa] Our efforts are based on mediation and calming matters between the two sides. Yesterday President Mubarak received the Yemeni foreign minister. Before that he received envoys from the two sides in Yemen. We want to make it clear that the current military operations between the south and the north have opened the gates of hell. In other words, matters will not end well. Unity must be based on dialogue. Up to this moment the two sides have not spoken about secession. Unity must be maintained. Even if there are differences, there are ways to settle them. This is what we are trying to explain. An Egyptian envoy went to Yemen and stayed several days there to study the situation and attempt to calm matters. Many efforts were intended to support the unity but resulted in supporting a clash between the two sides and in the loss of confidence between many officials in the north and the south. All this has made the situation in Yemen very serious, which requires constant and effective intervention. This is what we are doing as best we can. That is why we asked for a meeting of the Arab League. We said the Arab League should not remain indifferent to this dispute. We said the subject must be discussed by the Arab League. The subject was discussed by the Arab League; the meeting has been suspended but has not ended. The problem in Yemen will affect the Arab world from both a geographic and a political point of view. The final say is for the Yemeni people. It is not for us or for anyone else to impose unity or secession. They united, they must preserve this unity. Anything that deepens the secession, causes bloodshed, and creates loss of confidence is a bad indication for Yemen and the Yemenis. We hope they will succeed in establishing a quick dialogue and in turning this page that has spawned clashes, bloodshed, and martyrs on both sides. This is one country. They are, after all, Arabs. No side can claim victory over the other side because this is not victory. Ultimately, matters will not end like this. [Farghali] It is said that Egypt wanted to dispatch forces to help disengage the warring forces in Yemen. [Musa] No, no. This is not true. What happened is that one of the ideas proposed was that if there was any need for Arab, not Egyptian, peacekeeping forces the matter could have been considered by the Arab League. But the issue depends on Arab League approval and the acceptance of Yemen. However, the current circumstances are not suitable for that. [Farghali] Egyptian troops have taken part in the UN missions in Somalia and Bosnia. Do you think this role will be promoted, particularly since the United Nations is headed by Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali? Will this role expand. How does the Egyptian leadership view this role? [Musa] This is all contingent on the UN Security Council's resolutions and not on the secretary general or his nationality. It depends on two matters. If the Security Council decides to send UN troops to disputed areas, it will contact many countries, and perhaps all countries. The Security Council will ask them: Do you wish to participate in this work? It also depends on the state's decision whether to participate. We participated in Mozambique, Western Sahara, Burundi, Somalia, Bosnia, and Cambodia. We did not only send troops but observers. Some of our involvement was done on the request from the United Nations and the appeal from the Organization of African Unity. Our decision to participate in the peacekeeping process was basically made for African considerations. However, there are two factors governing the participation of troops. There is the UN Security Council decision to establish a peacekeeping process in certain areas. This is usually followed by UN contacts with all the member states to ask whether they wish to participate in this process. It is also our decision whether to participate or not. We refused to participate in certain areas. We did participate in Somalia and Bosnia because these are extremely important issues. We decided to do so because this was incumbent upon us to participate in sending troops. [Farghali] Western countries are facing problems in providing troops that are requested by the United Nations to implement its resolutions. Sending U.S. troops to Bosnia might take time and require negotiations. Perhaps this issue will never be solved. It seems that the Egyptian participation is almost guaranteed and will be relied upon by the UN secretary general. [Musa] The Egyptian participation is more relied upon than guaranteed. This is because the issue depends on the Security Council decision and the decision of the state whether to send troops. As I said, we focus on Africa more than any other place. But the issue of Bosnia is important as far as we are concerned. Hence, the Egyptian force was sent right from the start. But there are other countries that have troops in Bosnia and other places. Turkey, for example, has troops in Bosnia and other areas as well. There are also small countries that participate in peacekeeping processes. We will participate and we will help Butrus-Butrus Ghali in this matter. We will help and will continue to participate in the peacekeeping process. [Farghali] What about the Egyptian moves concerning ties with the Arab Gulf states and the security strategy in the region within the context of the new world order? What is the nature of the Egyptian moves? [Musa] The pan-Arab security issue is under discussion. I prefer not to elaborate on it now because it is a complex issue linked with many political circumstances and developments in the region. Therefore, talking about this issue in a minute or two would harm it. Please accept my apology. However, I would like to tell you that this issue is extremely important and was included in the Arab League agenda on Egypt's request in September 1991. [Farghali] Thank you, Your Excellency. [Musa] You are welcome.
