During a tour of inspection of east China's Shandong Province from May 19 to 26, Rong said that the establishment of a market economy has afforded an excellent opportunity for such enterprises to develop themselves. The enterprises have strengths in personnel, technology and equipment, he said, noting that some have set an example for others to follow in displaying these advantages fully. He expressed the belief that workers and staff of such enterprises will certainly brace up and work even harder to invigorate their enterprises. Local officials told the vice president that during the first four months of 1994, output value of major state-owned enterprises all over Shandong Province shot up 15 percent over the same period in 1993. Profits and taxes generated by such enterprises jumped 20 percent during that period. "Reform is essential to the invigoration of major state-owned enterprises," Rong told local officials. Specifically, such enterprises must introduce a modern enterprise system and a market-oriented operational mechanism by carrying out reforms in employment, personnel and income distribution, he noted. The leader also stressed the need to arouse the initiative of workers and staff, develop and manufacture quality and marketable products and pursue a diverse economy as a way to provide jobs to surplus workers. He called for efforts to promote scientific and technological progress. He did so while visiting the Jinan Motorcycle Plant, the Qilu Petrochemical Corporation, the North Star Wristwatch Factory and seven other companies in seven cities, as well as two economic and technological development zones in the cities of Yantai and Weihai. "When possible, major enterprises should set up their own research institutes," he said, adding that practice will make it possible to speed up the upgrading of products and improve their competitiveness. According to the vice president, the import of funds and technology, especially high and new technology, is a good way to retool major state-owned companies in China. Rong Yiren also asked such companies to make full use of domestic scientific and technological findings.
