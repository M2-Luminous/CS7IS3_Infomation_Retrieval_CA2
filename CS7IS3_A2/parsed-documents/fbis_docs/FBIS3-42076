Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said no decision has been made on deployment of the anti-missile missiles in Korea, though negotiations are under way between the two countries. "I understand that the U.S. Government has not yet made a final decision on whether the U.S. forces in Korea should be equipped with Patriot missiles," he said. "I think the missiles will be deployed after Seoul and Washington reach agreement on the number of missiles and the date of deployment, considering any possible developments in the situation related to North Korea's nuclear weapons program." Washington has not pressured Seoul to buy U.S. weapons, the official said, commenting on local press reports that the Pentagon has asked Korea to buy airborne self-protection jammers for the Korean fighter program. A letter reportedly sent by U.S. Defense Secretary-nominee William J. Perry to Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae asking Korea to buy jammers for the Korean Air Force's F-16 fighters was not meant to apply pressure, but to advise that production of the jammers has been suspended due to problems with the weapon, he said. Only some of the 120 F-16 fighters Korea is to import will be equipped with the existing model of jammers and the rest with a modified new model, he said, adding that the United States has not given up the airborne self-protection jammer project despite suspending production. "Nobody knows at the moment whether North Korea will allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its nuclear facilities," the official said, "and the government does not want the North Korean nuclear issue to go to the UN Security Council and thus to heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula." "There is no discord between Seoul and Washington over the North Korean nuclear issue and the two governments are maintaining close cooperation." The opposition Democratic Party is angry about the U.S. Government's reported pressure on Korea to buy the jammers. In a statement issued on Friday, party spokesman Pak Chi-won said, "I feel indignation at U.S. Defense Secretary-nominee William Perry's pressure for Korea to buy defective radar jammers through channels outside the usual ones in weapons trade between the two countries. The government should make public this pressure and seek a new diplomatic approach toward the United States, defying such pressure." Perry's letter to Defense Minister Yi will damage the two nations' traditional friendship, he said, urging the U.S. Government to reflect on whether the letter is tantamount to regarding Korea as a disposal site for defective weapons. Washington should "apologize for the letter," he added.
