FBIS3-46937 "dreas003__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-003-A Document Type:Daily Report 5 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Finance, Foreign Ministries Battling Over ODA OW0501070594 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 9 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0501070594 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Finance Ministry made it clear on 31 December that it would lower the growth rate of the Official Development Assistance (ODA) in the general account of the 1994 budget from the 1993 level of 6.5 percent to 3 percent on grounds of the tight fiscal situation. The Finance Ministry is maintaining that it would be possible to keep the ODA at a high level in U.S. dollar terms due to the appreciation of the yen. The Foreign Ministry, however, is contending that it is necessary to increase the ODA by more than 5 percent in order for Japan to make clear its attitude toward international contributions. Hence, the two ministries are expected to wage a fierce battle over 4 percent. [sentence as published] The government, in the 5th ODA Medium-Term Plan (from 1993 to 1997) set in June 1993, announced its commitment to a total of $70-70.5 billion in the ODA over five years. It is necessary to continue to raise the ODA by 7 percent every year in dollar terms to fulfill the commitment. In late August last year, the foreign minister asked for 1,098.4 billion yen for the ODA in its preliminary budget request for the fiscal 1994 and the amount was up 8.3 percent from that of a year earlier. In response, the finance minister plans to curb the ODA's growth at 3 percent, claiming that: 1) we have no choice but to keep the ODA's growth in check; and 2) it is possible to maintain the ODA at a high level thanks to the drastic appreciation of the yen. The Finance Ministry is also asserting that the country's "ODA is the world's greatest in absolute terms, and the ODA needs to shift its priority from quantity to quality," (according to the Budget Bureau). The ministry plans to study the possibility of increasing the amount of technical assistance it gives after concluding that to help developing countries develop their industries, the ODA must focus on the development of human resources rather than on one-time grant aid. Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry is saying that given the appreciated yen, sluggish growth in the ODA is inevitable. However, the ministry is strongly arguing that it is necessary to raise the ODA by 5 percent in order for Japan to make clear its posture toward international contributions. Hence, coordination of views between the two ministries is likely to run into problems.
