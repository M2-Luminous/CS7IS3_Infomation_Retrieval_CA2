Our correspondent reports. Cuanza Sul Provincial Governor Ramos da Cruz has described the situation as very delicate and said UNITA has two objectives -- to economically destabilize every area in the province and subsequently to occupy them. [Begin Cruz recording] The military situation in the province is very delicate. UNITA has exerted pressure on almost every district in the province in an attempt to destabilize and occupy them. It plans to fully destabilize the coastal region so that it can use Cuanza Sul Province as a launching pad to carry out attacks on Angola's northern provinces, particularly Luanda. [end recording] Ramos da Cruz said there is an urgent and imperative need for the government to organize its entire defensive perimeter. [Begin Cruz recording] During 1994 the government should continue to organize its entire defensive perimeter, improve administrative work, create minimum living conditions for our people, and try to begin a counteroffensive so that we can gradually regain control of the entire province and thus achieve our main objective -- to stabilize Cuanza Sul Province and make it one of the provinces where the government has complete territorial administration.
