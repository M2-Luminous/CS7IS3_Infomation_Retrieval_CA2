FR940324-1-00069 FR940324-1-00021 The Secretary does not believe it would be helpful to the borrower or in the interests of the taxpayer if the borrower's monthly payment amount is dramatically increased in the later stages of the maximum repayment period to accommodate payments that are too small in earlier years. The proposed regulations prohibit a lender from establishing a graduated repayment plan that schedules any single installment to be greater than three times the amount of any other scheduled installment. Under an income-sensitive repayment schedule, the borrower's payment amount is adjusted at least annually. Given the fact that some borrowers may experience wide fluctuations in their income from year-to-year, a strict adherence to the ``three times'' rule in the case of an annual adjustment to a borrower's income-sensitive repayment schedule would not always permit the intention of a true income-sensitive schedule to be achieved. However, the Secretary encourages lenders, whenever feasible, to attempt to establish a borrower's income-sensitive repayment amount within the ``three times'' rule. To implement these requirements, the proposed regulations would permit a lender to grant forbearance (which does not count against the maximum 10-year repayment period) under 34 CFR 682.211 for a period up to 3 years if the effect of an income-sensitive repayment schedule causes the extension of the maximum repayment term of the loan. Finally, the Secretary proposes that a fixed-amount repayment schedule be used if a borrower fails to indicate a choice of repayment schedules, or fails to maintain eligibility for an income-sensitive repayment schedule. The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need an additional 20,000 hours to comply with the statutory requirement that income-sensitive repayment schedules be offered to most borrowers. The income documentation required from borrowers (the borrower's most recent Federal income tax return if one had been filed within six months prior to the date it is requested by the lender, and evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income) is needed to obtain verifiable data to accurately determine the amount of the borrower's installment payment. Section 682.210‚ê£Deferment The proposed regulations implement the requirements of section 428(b)(1)(M)(iii) of the HEA. During the negotiations, a point of contention was the requirements a borrower must meet to qualify for an economic hardship deferment. In developing criteria to be used by lenders when granting an economic hardship deferment to a borrower based on the borrower's income and debt-to-income ratio, as required by section 435(o)(2) of the HEA, the Secretary believes that borrowers should be required to provide documentation of income. The Secretary therefore proposes that lenders obtain at least a copy of the borrower's most recent Federal income tax return if one had been filed within six months prior to the date it is requested, and evidence showing the amount of the borrower's most recent monthly disposable income. In addition, the Secretary does not believe it would be helpful to the borrower or in the interests of the taxpayer if a borrower who has the means to repay the loan does not do so. Therefore, the Secretary proposes an income limitation on a borrower who requests an economic hardship deferment based on income and debt-to-income ratio. The Secretary believes the income cap in the proposed regulations_no more than four times the minimum wage or four times the poverty line for a family of two_is reasonable. The public, at the regional meetings in September, and through its negotiators, did not agree on the definition of ``debt'' or the precise ratio to be used when comparing debt to income. In the Secretary's view, it would not be appropriate to include all debts that a borrower owed in developing the debt-to-income ratio. In a related section of the HEA (section 437A(c)) that evaluates a borrower's debt-to-income ratio to determine if a borrower has a high risk of defaulting on a loan, only the borrower's FFEL Program debts are considered. Therefore, the Secretary believes that for the purpose of establishing the borrower's eligibility for an economic hardship deferment, a similar evaluation should be used. The proposed regulations reflect the Secretary's belief that the calculation of ``debt'' for this purpose should include only the monthly amount due on the borrower's non-defaulted education loans that were obtained through a program administered by any agency of the Federal government. Given the ease with which borrowers can remove a default status from an FFEL Program loan through a guaranty agency's loan rehabilitation program, a conscientious borrower with a defaulted FFEL Program loan is not likely to be harmed by this restriction solely because of the defaulted loan.
