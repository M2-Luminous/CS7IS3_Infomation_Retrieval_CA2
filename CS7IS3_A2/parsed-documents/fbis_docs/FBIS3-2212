He believes that the central authorities will accept this proposal. Yesterday, when interviewed by this reporter by long-distance telephone call, Yuan Zheng said that the Guangdong Provincial Land Administration recently submitted a proposal to the State Council, asking that when the central departments concerned formulate concrete rules for the imposition of value-added land taxes, consideration should be given to the following five factors: First, interest rates of credit funds, including those for investment, will continue to change; second, inflation will increase construction costs; third, there should be compensation for the risks that exist in long-term real estate investment; fourth, the state should encourage and support real estate development projects in some localities; and fifth, the recovery of taxes. Therefore, Guangdong is firmly opposed to the imposition of value-added land taxes on contracts being signed before 1 January 1994 if developments and investments specified by such contracts have not been started yet. Guangdong also hoped that taxes imposed on real estate contracts signed before the enforcement of the tax would be levied according to the provisions specified in the contracts. He added: The imposition of value-added land taxes is aimed at restraining real estate speculation rather than harming the interests of real property developers. However, after the central authorities announced the imposition of value-added land taxes on 1 January, some overseas investors who had planned to start real estate investment projects in Guangdong gave up their investment plans. In order to protect the interests of the real developers, the relevant departments in Guangdong proposed to the central authorities that first-time development projects should be exempt from value-added land tax and that it should only be imposed on second-hand transactions. At present, Shenzhen City exempts first-time development projects from value-added taxes; on the other hand, it imposes a 40 to 100 percent tax on profits earned on real estate transactions. Although Shenzhen's tax rates may be a bit too high, the practice is close to the taxation arrangements made by the central authorities. Yuan Zheng said: At present, land administrative departments in many provinces are submitting proposals on the imposition of value-added land taxes to the State Council, and the contents of the proposals are basically similar to Guangdong's. The relevant department of the State Council is now studying various proposals from the provinces and foreign investors. It is believed that the central authorities will accept these proposals and will soon promulgate concrete rules on the implementation of the new tax regulations, because the imposition of value-added land taxes is not aimed at checking normal real estate development. However, Guangdong still hopes that greater decision-making powers will be given to the local government. When talking about Guangdong's land development measures this year, Yuan Zheng said: This year, Guangdong Province will control the gross quantity of land development. The area of land approved for development will be reduced by 10 percent from last year's level, because too many development projects were approved in the last few years and it will take time for the market to digest the supply. In addition, the province will successively launch a lot of large-scale construction projects, which will need large areas of land in the future. Therefore, all cities in Guangdong will reduce the quantity of land approved for development this year. This year, Guangdong will also exercise taxation management over real estate transactions and conduct property rights registration more effectively. The province is now revising its regulations on land transfers. At the same time, collective land management in rural areas will also be strengthened. Relevant measures in this regard are also being drafted, and the contents include the scope of management and compensation standards for land requisitions. It is expected that the regulations will be submitted to this year's provincial people's congress session for deliberation and adoption. In addition, this year, Guangdong Province will also further strengthen land management in all localities. The provincial land administration will announce the invalidity of some land-use approvals made by local governments without authorization or in violation of established rules and will investigate and affix responsibility for such events. If it is found that any local government approved too much development of too much land, the provincial land administration will deduct their land-use quotas next year. Yuan Zheng said that in the aspect of land development, Guangdong will stress the development of Zhuhai's western district, Yangjiang's Hailin Island, Huizhou's Daya Bay, and other new cities. In order to encourage foreign companies to invest, Guangdong will continue to provide favorable taxation terms and will not impose restrictions on property sales outside the mainland.
