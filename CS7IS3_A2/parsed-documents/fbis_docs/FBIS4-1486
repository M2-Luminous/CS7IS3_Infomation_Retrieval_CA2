FBIS4-1486 "drafr083_cs94010" FBIS-AFR-94-083-S Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA ANC, IFP Trade Charges of Election Irregularities ANC, IFP Trade Charges of Election Irregularities ANC Statement on Natal Voting Process MB2804192094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1833 GMT 28 Apr 94 MB2804192094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Service on 28 April] [Text] As we enter the third day of the first ever democratic elections in our country, the ANC welcomes the massive enthusiasm shown by the people of KwaZulu/Natal as well as other parts of the country, despite the logistical problems experienced. In this regard we appreciate efforts which have resulted in the voting, proceeding well in many areas in Natal. Areas where voting has succeeded, are only those where the SAP [South African Police] has provided security. We have along with other parties, made concrete recommendations to the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] to help resolve these logistical problems. Further, we are encouraged by the relatively peaceful way in which the election has unfolded -- in a province recently plagued by intense violence. We urge our people to use this last day of voting to ensure that everyone entitled to do so cast his/her vote. However, we wish to put it on record that the ANC has received extensive reports of violations of the electoral laws, regulations and code of conduct in some parts of the province of KwaZulu/Natal. We are filing with the Independent Electoral Commission a detailed complaint of a series of such violations by the Inkatha Freedom Party and its supporters. This is particularly rife in parts of northern Natal and the Midlands. A list of such incidents is attached to this statement. Evidence at hand already indicate the following violations, among others: - Removal of ballot boxes from polling stations by IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] supporters; - Transfer of IEC voting material to "pirate polling stations" run by supporters of the IFP; - Threats against IEC officers and expulsion of ANC party agents from polling stations; and - Lack of secrecy in polling booths where voters are coerced into voting for the IFP. These problems are in the main a consequence of inadequate security at these polling stations -- because either the KwaZulu Police [KZP] is the only security force present or there are no security forces at all. In the main the areas where violations are extensive, the security is exclusively provided by the KZP. This matter has been raised with the law and order sub-council, and we have been assured that steps are being taken to correct the situation. We urge the IEC and the security forces to take immediate action to restore the integrity of the electoral process in these parts of Natal. The ANC is confident that the IEC will resolve these problems in accordance with the relevant statues, thus inspiring confidence in the electoral process in this province. [Dated] 28 April 1994
