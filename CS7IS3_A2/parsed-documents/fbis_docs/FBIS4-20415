The infrastructural facilities for automation in the financial circles have been increase in number. Right now, more than 150 sets of large- and medium-sized computers, over all 5,000 small- and super-microcomputers, nearly 70,000 sets of multi-user and single-user microcomputers, over 1,500 sets of computer-aided peripheral equipment have been installed for the use by various departments in China's financial circles. With the rapid development of China's economy, the status and role of the financial circles have become more and more important, and there is higher demand for modernization. One of the important aspects is the use of electronic equipment. The strategic plan for to achieve automation in China's financial circles is as follows: preparations should be made during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, and the foundation laid during the Seventh Five-Year Plan. The scale for automation should be expanded during the Eighth Five-Year Plan, while the process of automation be completed during the Ninth Five-Year Plan. On the basis of this plan, China's financial circles have done a great deal of work. In addition to modernizing the equipment, a telecommunications network is gradually being built. The People's Bank of China is responsible to build the special-purpose satellite telecommunications network. It has already completed a main satellite earth station and 138 urban ground stations. In 1992 alone, the inter-bank system had used this network to handle more than 1.1 million transactions, totaling almost 1.2 trillion yuan. Remarkable achievements have also been made in the development of software for automation in the financial circles. A large number of software packages have been developed and used for the nationwide electronic inter-banking system, the city-wide system for check and fund clearing, the system for accounting transactions, the system for handling saving accounts, the city-wide interbank system for automatic deposits and withdrawal, the nationwide inter-bank system for reconciliation of statements of account, the system for handling various statements and reports and the interbank ATM processing system. As a component part of China's modern payment system, the nationwide automation system for offering stock price quotations is under construction. The center and all its branches of the system will be a part of the special-purpose satellite telecommunications network of the financial circles to automatically offer stock quotations and deliveries and handle account clearances on the stock market. In addition, modern automated service centers in the financial circles are being added. The number of such automated service centers has reached 25,000, accounting for more than 20 percent of the total number of service centers. Meanwhile, the number of credit cards issued by various banks has exceeded three million. Interbank ATM automatic deposits and withdrawal services are available in scores of cities. Various banks have also handled payroll and savings accounts on behalf of various government organizations and enterprises, collect utility bills and work as a part of the POS system [point of sales system]. China's automation system in the financial circles has already yielded tremendous social and economic results, accelerated the circulation of funds, helped the central bank strengthen its macro-control and improved the services of the banking industry. Within the ten years from the present moment to the beginning of the 21st Century, China will establish an up-to-date magnificent system of payments. In the next three years, it is necessary to complete the nationwide main network of satellite telecommunications, the regional networks connecting all the major cities in the economically developed areas along the Chang Jiang River and the Huang He and along the coast, and the city-wide networks. Efforts will be made to link all the systems of fund clearance at all levels throughout the nation into a major network. Meanwhile, we must set up and improve all kinds of systems concerning information exchange, fund transactions and price quotations on stocks and bonds, inter-bank loans and foreign exchange control; gradually put these systems to effective use; and raise the overall efficiency of the automation system in the financial circles.
