The imperial way of thinking in spheres of influence must not happen again. It would destroy trust in the possibility of establishing a new type of cooperation in Europe. The Baltic was and will be one of the areas in Europe that are particularly sensitive to the major shifts of our times. Here lies a crucial test for the new principles of peaceful coexistence, as laid down in the great CSCE documents of Helsinki and Paris. The Baltic will be the touchstone of a future European security structure. Germany was among the first countries to resume diplomatic relations with the independent Baltic republics. Since then, there have been numerous meetings of ministers. Federal President von Weizsaecker visited all three countries last year. In continuation of this trustful dialogue, I have invited the foreign ministers of the three Baltic states to come to Bonn on 9 March 1994. Together with the Scandinavian countries, Germany has various historic and cultural links with the Baltic states. Many German families have their roots there. Cultural lives in Germany and the Baltic are closely related historically. This creates deep emotional links. The cities of Riga and Tallinn reflect the tradition, cosmopolitan feel, and prosperity of the Hanseatic League. Vilnius is characterized by the cultural wealth of the Middle Ages. For three centuries, the Hanse linked the merchants in the centers at the Baltic and the North Sea; it dominated the trade routes and brought about a lively exchange of laws, ways of life, and artistic styles. In the Hanse, freedom-seeking towns came together under a loose trade alliance. It was an early successful model of all-European economic cooperation. For centuries international trade routes crossed in the Baltics. Until 1940, economic relations between West Europe and Russia mainly went via the Baltics. This European region has always had the role of mediator. And a number of things indicate that this might again be the case in the future. Among all the former Soviet Republics, the Baltic states have carried out the most impressive reforms. Estonia will probably achieve the best economic figures of all the Central and East European states this year. For a German, visiting the Baltic states brings on a feeling of familiarity. For us Germans, bringing back to life long-buried conditions is not only something that is demanded by our common sense, but also something close to our hearts. The warm reception the German cultural weeks were given in the Baltic states last autumn indicates the lively interest we have for each other. The Goethe Institute in Riga is a good framework for the growing cultural dialogue. The local Euro faculty for law, economics, and administration originated from a German idea. Partnerships between towns and an intense cooperation between the Baltic states and our north German laender show that contacts are getting closer on all levels. In the Baltic, traditions from West and East Europe, from north and south, meet. The three Baltic republics are, therefore, yardsticks for the growing together of our continent to form a unity, following decades of forced separation. Every political and economic success in the Baltic has effects going far beyond the region as such. Without stability in the Baltic, there will be no stability in Europe as a whole. The Baltic region is predestined to prove that a cosmopolitan view and cooperation are far superior to thinking in terms of hegemonic spheres of influence. A Baltic region that feels secure and gains prosperity quickly will stimulate growth in the entire Baltic Sea region. This will also promote a parallel development in neighboring Russia. By maintaining close relations with both the Baltic states and Russia, Germany will help bring about good-neighborly relations, respect, and mutual understanding in the entire region. One of the principal tasks is the quick withdrawal of the remaining Russian troops that are still stationed in Latvia and Estonia. There is no reason to delay this or make it subject to other conditions. No package deal can justify leaving one's troops on the territory of another sovereign state against its express wish. We, therefore, welcome Russia withdrawing its troops from Lithuania and indicating its willingness to pull out its troops from Latvia and Estonia by 31 August 1994 -- leaving only a small number of soldiers to continue operating the Skrunda radar station under a special agreement and for a strictly limited period of time. And these deadlines must be kept! Minorities should not be made a bone of contention but they should be a starting point for a policy of constructive neighborly relations and cooperation. Three years ago, the majority of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic states supported independence. Russians, but also Ukrainians, Belorussians, and others will have to integrate loyally into the new state structures. On the other hand, those of them who want to remain living in the Baltic states permanently, must be given the opportunity to integrate and be protected against discrimination. We welcome the willingness of the Baltic republics to include CSCE standards and recommendations by the Council of Europe in their laws! The situation of minorities, the withdrawal of troops, and the securing of the newly gained independence are particularly sensitive points for all those concerned. This sensitivity requires a high degree of caution and mutual understanding. It includes a willingness not to get stuck with individual issues but to make special efforts, if necessary. The problems that arose after the collapse of the Soviet Union demand an increase in regional, bilateral cooperation. In West Europe we have developed the concept of Euro regions. This makes use of the necessity of border areas to cooperate on the basis of equality. Germany expressly advocates full European Union [EU] membership for the Baltic states, to be achieved via a period of association. We want to help these states quickly and generously to find their rightful place in Europe. As advocates of the Baltic states, we would like to see European agreements concluded with them before the end of this year. The EU would remain incomplete without the three Baltic states becoming members -- just like the other states in Central and East Europe with which Europe agreements have been concluded. At the same time, we are using the Baltic Sea Council as an instrument of cooperation to keep the peace and create prosperity. The Baltic Sea has always been a sea that connects states instead of separating them. At the moment, Estonia chairs the Baltic Sea Council. A high degree of flexibility, an ambitious agenda, and northern pragmatism have led to enormous successes for the Baltic Sea Council. Russia's participation in this organization emphasizes the country's belonging to Europe. The Partnership for Peace offered by the NATO summit in early January has been welcomed by all Baltic states. All three states are already partners in the Western European Union's consultation forum. This way, the security of the Baltic states is increasingly linked with the security in the rest of Europe. We consider this to be part of an interlocking strategy where security will be increasingly based on cooperation. The Baltic states in particular need comprehensive security structures that are based on transparency and trust. This is why the CSCE has an important role to play there. Through its minority envoy and long-term missions of observers, it has helped defuse conflicts on minority issues in the past. The forum for cooperation in security issues offers all countries in that area a framework for future security arrangements. The Baltic region has had cultural relations with West Europe for centuries. These relations must be revived. This revival will range from language courses, to students and teacher exchange programs, and assistance with joint projects. We have to make up for decades of neglect during the time of isolation between the blocs. In 1992, German universities had 25 times more students from Ethiopia than from the three Baltic states together. We must make special efforts to achieve a greater balance in the future. I referred to this problem back in early February, when I proposed a European education initiative for the eastern part of Europe, a "Marshall Plan for the Mind." Europe is not just a geographic term, but also a cultural one! The future of the Baltic states lies with Europe!
