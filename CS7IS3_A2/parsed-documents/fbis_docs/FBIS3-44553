Freight transport volume in the first 11 months of 1993 dropped by 0.1 percent over the corresponding 1992 period, a decrease from the 0.1 percent rise in the first 10 months of the year. However, the dip is smaller than the 0.2-percent drop in the first three quarters and a 0.3-percent shrink in the first eight months, a report from the bureau said. Passenger transportation in the period, however, dropped by 11 percent, representing a bigger decrease compared with the 10.9- percent dip in the first 10 months and the 10-percent drop in the first nine months, the report said. Freight transport volume stood at 2.515 billion tons in the first 11 months. Of the total, rail freight inched up 2.2 percent to 1.43 billion tons, while truck freight fell 8.4 percent to 505 million tons. Freight by boat climbed by 2.5 percent to 579 million tons, while air freight soared 21.6 percent to 633,000 tons. Freight turnover in the January to November period--an important indicator in monitoring unit labour productivity and economic efficiency--witnessed a limited increase of 2.3 percent to 2.3 trillion ton-kilometres (One ton-kilometre is one ton of cargo transported one kilometre.) Of the total, railways reported a 2.9- percent rise to 1.08 trillion ton-kilometres, while truck freight turnover fell 16 percent to 27.766 billion ton-kilometres. Air freight turnover generated 1.569 billion ton-kilometres, up 20.2 percent, and boat freight turnover climbed 2.1 percent to 1.2 trillion ton-kilometres. Total passenger volume stood at 4.576 billion in the first 11 months, the report said.

Some 161 million people travelled by boat, down 8.1 percent, while 31.2 million people flew, up 17.6 percent.
