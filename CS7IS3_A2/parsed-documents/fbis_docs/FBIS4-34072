Vice Admiral Arancibia said military service enables youths to acquire values and principles, and helps them to understand professional training. Arancibia said of the 121,000 who registered in 1993, only 29,400 were drafted. He added that the Army and the Air Force have already reduced military service to one year, while the Navy is studying this possibility. Asked about the Argentine decision to create a professional Army, he said the Chilean Armed Forces should also study this issue. He declined to say if the Argentine decision constitutes a threat because Argentina has yet to implement this decision. Arancibia admitted, however, that a professional Army is more effective than a nonprofessional Army although it is more costly.
