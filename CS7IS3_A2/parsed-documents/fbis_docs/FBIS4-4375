Ramos on his arrival from a three-day official visit to the SRV at Ninoy Aquino International Airport -- live; passages in italics in Tagalog] [Text] Mr. Vice President; former president and Mrs. Diosdado Macapagal; Speaker Protempore of the House of Representatives Raul Daza; and the distinguished members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives; your Excellency, Archbishop Morene; the dean of the diplomatic corp.; your excellencies of the diplomatic corp.; particularly the charge of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Mr. (Hoa Phuc Chinh); co-workers in government, beloved countrymen: It's good to be back home. At the close of our three-day journey across the South China Sea to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, it is gratifying to come home with our report of mission accomplished. And I thank you for your good wishes for a successful visit, and your prayers for our safe journey home. When this administration came to office in June 1992, I set as one of our key priorities the restructuring and reorientation of our foreign relations in keeping with the changes that have taken place in our country and in the world. And central to this new thrust was the emphasis on our relations with our neighbors in Southeast Asia -- both the members and the non-members of the Association of Southeast Nations or ASEAN. My journey to Vietnam continues this effort in a new way, since this is my first visit to a Southeast Asian state that is not a member of ASEAN. For reasons of geography, history, and shared interest and concerns, Vietnam today is particularly crucial to the building of a viable structure for regional security, stability, and peace in our part of the world, a goal which intimately involves the progress and prosperity of all of the 10 nations of Southeast Asia. In the discussions and exchanges that took place during our visit, Vietnam's leaders and the Philippine delegation addressed bilateral, regional, and global issues and concerns, and these have resulted in significant agreements, new initiatives, and fresh understanding between our governments. Like our own leadership, Vietnam's top leaders -- President Le Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, and Party General Secretary Do Muoi -- attached great importance to regional stability. They seen it the breathing spell after two generations of bloody conflict with which to set their own economy on the road to self-sustaining growth. [sentence as heard] In this regard, the Vietnamese leaders expressed their government's readiness and intent to participate fully in the meeting of the forthcoming ASEAN Regional Forum in Bangkok -- a unique regional mechanism for dealing with security issues. We discussed ways to reduce tensions in East Asia, including the need to rid the entire region of nuclear arms and the threat of nuclear warfare. The conflicting claims to areas of the South China Sea are of acute concern to both our countries. We explored and exchanged ideas about new avenues for cooperation among the claimant states and the other countries of Southeast Asia, cooperative endeavors that can help to reduce tensions and build confidence in the area. On our part, I proposed that the countries involved jointly undertake a study of the possible demilitarization of the area, and of freezing all destabilizing activities in that area. I also proposed that the resources in the South China Sea Islands be considered as the common heritage of all the nations and people on its periphery. At the very least, the Vietnamese leaders and I agreed that the status quo with respect to the question of sovereignty and the status quo in regard to the strength of the military garrisons be frozen for the moment. We also agreed on the desirability of cooperative ventures in such matters as marine scientific research; air and sea borne rescue; environmental protection; and, the installation of navigational aids. These ventures would not only be beneficial in themselves, but also would help to build confidence and trust among the countries of the region. As another confidence-building measure, both sides saw merit in an exchange of visits among commanders and units stationed in the islands and atolls of the South China Sea. We shared the conviction that if the countries concerned fully explore these, as well as other friendly approaches, we can transform the South China Sea from waters of contention to an area of cooperation. I reaffirmed the Philippines' support for Vietnam's early entry into ASEAN as a full member, and our readiness to help in easing the way to Vietnam's membership. My visit illuminated the vast potential for economic cooperation between our two countries, and served as an occasion for the expansion of trade and other forms of economic interaction between us. Vietnam and the Philippines stand at similar, though not identical, points in their quest for modernization. Both countries see their development as anchored on their ties to other countries and the global economy. And both are today in the midst of restructuring and reform on a very intensive basis. Our delegation briefed the Vietnamese leaders on our Philippines 2000 Program, which, among other things seeks to open our economy to free market forces, and improve our global competitiveness. In turn, Vietnam's leaders explained to us the workings of Doi Moi, which is their own economic renovation and adjustment program, and which has brought Vietnam high growth rates during the past three years. We agreed on specific measures to fulfill the great potential of our economic relationship. Our trade ministers signed a trade protocol that pinpoints the products that can be profitably traded between our two countries. For a similar purpose, we opened an office of the Philippine International Trading Company, or PITC in Ho Chi Minh City. Several joint venture agreements were signed between several top businessmen in our delegation and Vietnamese enterprises -- undertakings that will in themselves benefit both economies while opening the way to expanded economic activities with multiplied effects to us both. It is estimated that such business agreements could increase our bilateral trade by at least $150 million in the near future. To promote the tourism industry, which both countries consider as extremely important to their development programs and people-to-people exchanges, our foreign ministers signed a tourism agreement and a cultural agreement which provide the framework for intensive cooperation in these areas. The Vietnamese leaders expressed Vietnam's interest in receiving training from the Philippines in a wide range of disciplines -- from banking and management, to economics and accounting; from aquaculture and agricultural research, to the English language. We shall explore ways in which to translate into reality our willingness to cooperate with Vietnam in this regard. The improved economic situation in Vietnam has considerably brightened the prospects for the orderly repatriation of some 3,100 Vietnamese asylum seekers still remaining in the Philippines who have been denied resettlement in third countries. The Vietnamese leaders assured us of their utmost cooperation in encouraging the return of their people to Vietnam and reintegrating them harmoniously into Vietnamese society. We also agreed to strengthen the relationship between our two Armed Forces through the exchange of visits between senior defense officials and military officers; study tours by defense and military students; and, the opening of slots in the Philippine Military Academy to Vietnamese cadets. Finally, and as bottom line, we established a joint commission to deal comprehensively with the whole range of our relationship, and to nurture its steady expansion for mutual benefit and support. In both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, we met with the Filipino expatriates working in Vietnam as professionals and technicians, and who are helping to build that country. I brought them greetings from our beloved Philippines and urged them to learn as much as they can from that great country that is their temporary home. Our country can be proud of all of them. Ladies and gentlemen, in assessing the significance of this visit in the light of our national concerns and our national interest, we must look beyond its immediate economic benefits. Although we can confidently foresee such benefits in the near future. We must also see this visit as the building of an enduring bridge to the Vietnamese people, thus contributing to the edifice of stability, peace, and prosperity that both our nations and our neighbors in ASEAN are helping to construct in Southeast Asia. Both the Philippines and Vietnam have known the last of colonialism and the struggle against imperialism and foreign occupation. This fact of our national lives has strengthened our historic kinship, and makes the act of cooperation with each other a natural undertaking for both. Moreover, as countries striving for development and modernization, we have much to learn from each other. The exchange of knowledge and experience that we have begun with this visit and the close cooperation that we have pledged to promote between Vietnam and the Philippines promise to bring incalculable benefits to both our people and beyond our bilateral partnership. The forging of strong bonds between us will surely enhance the stability and progress of our Asia Pacific Region. This certainly is the Philippines' intention and the perceived intention of Vietnam and her leaders. In the final analysis, this is the lasting significance of our visit to Vietnam -- the agreements that we have forged are in every way important for raising the level of our political and economic collaboration. But even more significant are the understandings that we have received as partners in making our way in the world, and in reinforcing peace and stability in our region. We return today to our beloved Philippines confident that we have significantly advanced the interest of our nation and contributed to the welfare of our region. We thank the good Lord for keeping the Philippines united and secure, and in the spirit of the Lenten Season, we continue to pray for our people's welfare and progress. Thank you to all of you. Long live the Philippines.
