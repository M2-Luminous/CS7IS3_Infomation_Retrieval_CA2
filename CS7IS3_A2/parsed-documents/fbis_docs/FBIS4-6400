Nobuo Matsunaga, the Japanese Government's representative for external economic affairs, said in a speech in Tokyo that Japan should avoid reaching agreement under the threat of trade sanctions, as in the case of a mobile phone trade agreement last month. Matsunaga, a former Japanese ambassador to the U.S., met U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Washington earlier this month in an effort to break an impasse in the so-called bilateral framework talks. Matsunaga said Kantor told him there will be no chance of improving bilateral economic relations unless Japan takes measures, such as tax cuts, to maintain economic growth led by domestic demand. Matsunaga said a new Japanese Government has to hammer out tax and other pump-priming measures by June before the summit of the Group of Seven industrial nations in July in Naples, where the new Japanese prime minister will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton. But Matsunaga expressed concern that things will not go smoothly because the new government would first be required to deal with the overdue fiscal 1994 budget. The new Tokyo government is expected to be inaugurated as early as Thursday following Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's announcement April 8 that he would step down over shady financial deals involving his office.
