Upon his arrival, Han was briefed by Kim Sam-hun, Seoul's ambassador in charge of nuclear affairs, on the results of three-way talks on Saturday among South Korea, the United States and Japan on the imposition of sanctions against Pyongyang. Han will hold separate meetings with Security Council President Salim Bin Mohammed al-Khussaiby and the U.N. ambassadors of the five permanent council members to convey the South Korean Government position that sanctions are inevitable at this stage and to persuade them to endorse a sanctions resolution, sources here said. The South Korean foreign minister will also meet with Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs, Monday afternoon when Gallucci comes to New York to speak at the Asia Society, they said. Han and Gallucci will discuss their governments' positions on sanctions and coordinate their future strategy in pushing ahead with sanctions at the Security Council. The council is likely to take up the sanctions issue early this week on the basis of a proposal made by South Korea, the United States and Japan. The proposal will be made into a draft resolution after consultations with the four other standing council members -- Britain, China, Russia and France -- before finally being presented at a Security Council meeting. Seoul, Washington and Tokyo have already reached complete agreement on the timing and intensity of sanctions, according to the sources, who expect a draft resolution to be completed by early this week. Minister Han, who stopped off in London on Saturday on his way to New York, had telephone talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd on cooperating at the Security Council on the North Korean nuclear issue. Han also briefed Christopher and Hurd, who were having bilateral talks in London, on the results of President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Russia. Han separated from the presidential entourage just before its departure from Moscow to Uzbekistan on President Kim's instruction to fly to go to New York for talks with U.N. officials prior to U.N. Security Council's discussion of sanctions to be imposed on North Korea.
