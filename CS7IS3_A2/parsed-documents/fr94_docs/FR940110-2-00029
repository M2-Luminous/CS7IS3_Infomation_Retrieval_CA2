Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on December 29, 1983, as amended, by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. That directive directs you to prohibit entry of certain cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products, produced or manufactured in Romania for which the Government of Romania has not issued an appropriate visa. The Government of Romania has notified the United States Government that instead of the ``Ministry of Commerce and Tourism_Department of Foreign Trade,'' officials of the ``Ministry of Commerce_Department of Foreign Trade'' will sign and issue visas for textile products exported from Romania. Effective on February 1, 1994, you are directed to amend further the directive dated December 29, 1983 to provide for the use of the new visa stamp to accompany shipments of textile products, produced or manufactured in Romania and exported from Romania on and after February 1, 1994. From February 1, 1994 through March 2, 1994, visas from either will be accepted. After March 2, 1994, only visas issued by the ``Ministry of Commerce_Department of Foreign Trade'' will be accepted. A facsimile of the new visa stamp is enclosed with this letter. Shipments entered or withdrawn from warehouse according to this directive which are not accompanied by an appropriate export visa shall be denied entry and a new visa must be obtained. The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that this action falls within the foreign affairs exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). Sincerely, Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;515 Filed 1&hyph;7&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DR&hyph;F
