A total of 51.2 per cent of respondents said that the forthcoming visit by the Russian president to Georgia will have a positive impact on the improvement of relations between the two countries, having age-old historical, economic and humanitarian ties. Only 37.6 per cent of respondents were skeptical about the future of Russo-Georgian relations, while 4.7 per cent expect Russo-Georgian relations to worsen.
