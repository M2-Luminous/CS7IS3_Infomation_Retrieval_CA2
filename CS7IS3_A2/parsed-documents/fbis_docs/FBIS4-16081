The point was made by a personal envoy of the Russian president, Boris Pastukhov, when he returned to Moscow from Tbilisi on Wednesday. In Tbilisi he was received by the Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze. The two sides discussed the settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. Pastukhov told Interfax that the main thing at the present stage is to guarantee a lasting ceasefire and the beginning of the return of refugees because otherwise it is impossible to resolve other problems. The diplomat said that unfortunately the probability of the resumption of hostilities in Abkhazia is still great. He admitted that there are armed groups in the conflict zone from Russia but not representing Russia as well as from several other countries. Speaking of the need to send a peace-keeping force to the conflict zone Pastukhov said Moscow would never oppose the deployment of peace-keepers, if the UN Security Council passed an appropriate decision. In his opinion there can be different options, but in any case a peace-keeping operation requires considerable spending. "It is impossible to uphold peace with bayonets, fundamental agreements are necessary to prevent the resumption of hostilities and they must be observed", Pastukhov emphasized.
