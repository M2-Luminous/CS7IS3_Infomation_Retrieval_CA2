The Serbs' failure to abide by the Gorazde accord could torpedo the resumption of peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina, obervers warned. "There is no change in the deployment inside the three-kilometre (two-mile) total exclusion zone," UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said Monday, referring to a UN-declared exclusion zone around the valley town, which is populated mostly by Moslems, including thousands of refugees from Serb "ethnic cleansing" of nearby villages. "It is a disappointment that the Bosnian Serb army did not react to the agreement," Major Annink said. Under the agreement signed Saturday between Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the commander of UN troops in Bosnia, and Bosnian Serb military leader Manojlo Milovanovic, the Serbs were to redeploy the 150 men outside the exclusion zone by 6:00 p.m. (1600 GMT) Sunday. The Serbs also pledged to guarantee the UNPROFOR freedom of movement within a 20-kilometre (12-mile) heavy weapons exclusion zone around Gorazde. Annink said the Serbs told UN military observers that they would not be granted freedom of movement within the exclusion zone until 570 Serbs were allowed to leave the town and the mainly Moslem Bosnian army withdrew from a hill overlooking Gorazde. He said the overall situation in Gorazde was stable Sunday with Bosnian Serb and Bosnian army troop movements reported northwest of the town.
