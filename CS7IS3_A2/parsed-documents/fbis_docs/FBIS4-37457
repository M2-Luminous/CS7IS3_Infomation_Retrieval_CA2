That is why the prime minister decided to put himself in charge of the small team negotiating with Ramon's Ram faction in the Histadrut, together with 'Uzi Bar'am and Hayim Haberfeld. According to the same source, Rabin feels that by evacuating the Gaza Strip -- which in practice is not in our hands despite the erroneous "autonomy" title -- he has won the most points he can gain in public support on that issue -- and he must now slow down on peace if he does not want to lose the "points" he has won. "Rabin is starting to tire of the exhausting negotiations with the PLO and has decided at this stage to hold up the process until the situation in Jericho and Gaza stabilizes. Rabin's current agenda is devoted to dealing with issues like the Histadrut and its sick fund; the economic situation; the cost-of-living index; housing, and other social issues." According to the same source, Rabin apparently fears that poor handling of those issues will lose the next elections for Labor even if he can point to political successes, therefore his day is mainly devoted to social issues. The Prime Minister's Office feels that due to 'Arafat's pronouncements, public support for an ongoing political move, including the transfer of all the areas of Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip to the Palestinians, is much lower than for leaving the Gaza Strip, which most Israelis, even those identified with the right wing, supported.
