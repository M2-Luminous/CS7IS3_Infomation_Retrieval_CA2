FR940630-2-00125 FR940630-2-00097 If a hearing is requested by Mr. Clark or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Order should be sustained. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 (c)(2)(i), Mr. Clark, or any other person adversely affected by this Order may, in addition to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error. In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or request for hearing shall not stay the immediate effectiveness of this order. VI In addition to issuance of this Order, the Commission requires further information from Mr. Clark in order to determine whether the Commission can have reasonable assurance that in the future, should Mr. Clark perform licensed activities under any other NRC license, Mr. Clark will conduct any NRC licensed activity in accordance with NRC requirements, and whether enforcement action is warranted against Mr. Clark, individually. Accordingly, pursuant to section 161c, 161o, 182, and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.204 and 10 CFR 30.32(b), you are hereby required to submit to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, within 30 days of the date of this Order and Demand for Information, a statement in writing, under oath or affirmation, of: 1. Why the NRC should have confidence that you will comply with NRC requirements in the event that you perform licensed activities under another NRC license. 2. Why, in light of the facts set forth above, the NRC should not issue an Order to you prohibiting you from engaging in NRC-licensed activities. This information is needed in light of the deliberate violations of Commission requirements. Copies of the response to this Demand for Information also shall be sent to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King of Prussia, PA 19406. After reviewing your response, the NRC will determine whether further action is necessary to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 21st day of June 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Hugh L. Thompson, Jr., Deputy Executive Director for Nuclear Materials Safety, Safeguards, and Operations Support.
