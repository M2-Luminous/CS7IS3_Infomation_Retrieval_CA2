FR940902-0-00052 FR940902-0-00010 Section 627.435 provides generic cost principles applicable to the JTPA program in paragraphs (a) through (d) and provides specific treatment for selected items of cost in paragraphs (e) through (h). A few commenters stated that the Department should adopt the Circulars for cost principles, thereby replacing this section. Section 164(a)(2) of the Act requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations establishing uniform cost principles substantially equivalent to those generally applicable to recipients of Federal grant funds. The generic cost principles in this section are intended to be substantially the same as the provisions of Attachment A of the OMB Circulars that contain cost principles and should generally be interpreted the same as the Circulars. The Department has chosen not to simply adopt the Circulars because they contain some restrictive requirements in areas where the Department thinks that recipients and subrecipients should retain operational flexibility. A number of commenters recommended that the prohibition on the shifting of funds in §627.435(c) should be changed to clarify that it does not cover accounting errors. The Department agrees with this comment and language is added to limit this prohibition to costs ``allocable'' to another Federal grant, program, or category. Adjustments should be made for costs inappropriately charged because of accounting errors or misclassification so that the costs ultimately charged to a cost objective are those properly allocable to that objective. A few commenters requested revision of the prohibition on contributions to contingency reserves at §627.435(e)(6), particularly that they should be allowable if such contributions are not made with Federal funds. The language on contingency reserves is not changed since only those costs charged to the JTPA program are regulated by this section and it does not extend to non-JTPA funds. Amended §627.435(f) provides additional guidance on legal costs. A number of commenters recommended changes in this area, with most commenters opposed to the specific prohibition on the allowability of costs for appeals to an Administrative Law Judge. Several commenters suggested that the Department should review the Conference Report language on this issue. A few commenters requested more specificity on legal expenses, particularly settlement costs. In response to the comments received on the specific prohibition on the allowability of legal costs for appeals to an Administrative Law Judge, the Department has reviewed the Conference Report (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 102&hyph;811, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 137 (1992)) and engaged in further dialogue on this subject. The discussion in section 221 of the Conference Report pertained to title IV special programs for Migrants and Seasonal Farmworkers and the Department does not view that language as carrying through to the other titles of JTPA. The Department is also aware that some Federal agencies are permitting the costs of appeals to an ALJ as an allowable grant cost. The Department notes that, unlike the process of the Department of Health and Human Services that is referred to in the Conference Report, there are several opportunities for informal resolution of disputes prior to the issuance of the Department of Labor grant officer's final determination. In addition, if the grant officer's decision is found, upon appeal, to be substantially in error, there may be an opportunity for a grantee to recover its legal costs under the provisions of the Equal Access to Justice Act. Congress, in passing the Equal Access to Justice Act, has set forth the conditions under which it is appropriate for parties in contested administrative proceedings to recover their costs from the federal government. The rule that is adopted in these regulations maintains those conditions. Finally, it is the Department's position that, absent any specific statutory direction, Federal taxpayers should not bear the costs of both sides of a matter appealed to an ALJ. To do so may increase the incidence of such costs and provides no incentive for assuring that only matters of substantive merit are appealed. With regard to the language on settlement costs, paragraph (f)(1) of this section is changed to clarify that settlement costs are allowable to the extent that the costs included in the settlement would have been allowable if charged to the JTPA program at the time they were incurred, e.g., if the settlement costs are for back pay then the provisions of §627.435(e)(2) would control the allowability of the settlement costs. Section 627.435(h) of the interim final rule basically continued the language on construction costs that has existed since the inception of JTPA. However, a few commenters recommended changes to this paragraph including that construction costs for alterations, maintenance, and repairs should be allowable and that there is now a conflict with amended §627.210(a)(3) concerning physical accessibility, as required by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The Department agrees with these comments and the language on construction costs is eliminated. The effect of this change is to allow construction costs to the extent that such costs are necessary and allocable to JTPA. Paragraph (h) of the final rule now contains language on contributions to a reserve for self-insurance, as discussed above in the discussion of §627.415(c), Insurance. Governor's Guidelines on Allowable Costs Section 627.435(i) requires the Governor to prescribe and implement guidelines on allowable costs not otherwise treated in §627.435 and contains a listing of selected items of costs in paragraph (i) for which the Governor's allowable cost guidelines must, at a minimum, prescribe treatment. Many commenters responded to the provisions of this subsection. Most of them saw it as a requirement for Governors to set actual amounts for salaries and other commonly incurred JTPA costs and opposed this subsection. One commenter recommended that the Department should clarify the intent of this provision and a few commenters asked whether the requirements of the regulation would be met if the OMB Circulars on cost principles were adopted. This provision is not basically different from the requirement, in existence since the beginning of JTPA in 1983, that ``[t]he Governor shall issue guidelines on allowable costs for *␣*␣*.'' Such guidelines should set parameters and guidance, rather than actual amounts. The Department's intent is simply to ensure that the Governor's guidelines cover at least the items included in the list, since issues have been raised on each of these items during the past 10 years of JTPA. Recognizing that SDA's retain some flexibility, within the Governor's guidelines, to establish amounts for allowable costs such as personnel compensation and travel, the final rule is changed by replacing the words ``and amounts'' with ``or the extent of allowability.'' In addition, since other sections of the final rule now provide guidelines on item No. 11, the extent of allowability for supportive services costs and payments to participants, that item is removed from the list in this section of the final rule.
