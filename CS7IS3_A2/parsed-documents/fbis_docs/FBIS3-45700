In an interview with XINHUA Tuesday [11 January], vice chairman of Belarus' Council of Ministers Sergey Stepanovich Ling said that the country's ongoing economic reforms are irreversible. Moreover, he emphasized, Belarus has laid a "primary legislative foundation" to guarantee the continuation of its reforms. Twenty bills related to reforms in the economic structure and the ownership system, including laws on privatization and land ownership, were adopted last year. In 1994, the government will take a series of measures, including the issuance of privatization bonds three months ahead of schedule, to push the reforms forward. But he ruled out the possibility of adopting such radical reform policies as "shock therapy." The state "will control the pace of reforms" "to ensure their effective continuation," he stressed. The vice chairman pointed out that Belarus will pursue a "gradual and cautious" reform policy. The former Soviet republic will study China's excellent experiences in its reform to avoid making mistakes in its own reform, he added. Belarus' advanced industrial equipment and technology and the good qualifications of its workers will help lead the country out of the current economic plight, he said. Belarus, which has to import over 90 percent of the energy and raw materials it needs, has met with great difficulty since Russia and other former Soviet republics raised prices for energy and raw material exports. Belarus witnessed a monthly inflation rate of up to 30 percent and an unemployment rate of 1.2 percent last year. Many factories have stopped production. During the privatization drive, more than 200 state-owned enterprises have been privatized so far and reforms have begun in finance, commerce and agriculture.
