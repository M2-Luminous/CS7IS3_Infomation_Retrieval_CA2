"The ten newly-opened exchanges are becoming a mainstay of Shanghai's economic development," a municipal official said. The exchanges involved the fields of securities, metals, coal, farm production materials and equipment, chemicals, grain and edible oil, motor vehicles, building materials and technology. Opened since 1990, the markets expanded their operations quickly to other parts of the country, with the total transactions reaching 1,000 billion yuan-worth in 1993. A survey shows that Shanghai's gross domestic product last year went up by 14 percent. More than 90 percent of the 60 million tons of important materials including metals, fuel oil and coal, which it consumed last year, were supplied by the new markets. Through the local securities market, 92 enterprises in the city have issued stocks to the public. Linking itself with the international and domestic markets, the Shanghai metals exchange succeeded in reining in price hikes last year. According to the official, as most prices on the ten exchanges are constant, these markets are playing an influential role in regulating production and operation of many enterprises in the country and leading them toward the international market. The official disclosed that Shanghai is preparing to open nationwide exchanges for foreign currency and gold. With these markets playing a greater role in the allocation of resources and hooking up with the international market, economists here agree, Shanghai's economy will continue to develop at a rapid and healthy pace.
