Chinese sources said such cases usually took one or two days for a verdict to be given. Gao, 50, was detained in October as she prepared to leave to take up a fellowship at the Columbia University Journalism School in the United States. Neither the Intermediate People's Court nor the Higher People's Court in Beijing could be contacted yesterday. Nor was there any notice on Gao's trial posted outside the court yesterday. Gao's husband, Zhao Yuankang, would not comment and it is thought he did not attend yesterday. It is understood that Gao was accused of having obtained a copy of a speech, considered to be top secret, given by the president and military head, Jiang Zemin, early last year. For a conviction involving such a document, she could face a jail term of 10 years or more, sources said. It is understood she might also be charged with leaking other confidential documents to jingwai [outside the borders] organisations -- a reference to Hong Kong and Taiwan, rather than overseas groups in general. Gao had been a contributor to Hong Kong publications including the pro-China THE MIRROR monthly. However, its publisher, Xu Simin, has said he had no idea whether his magazine articles had led to her arrest. Last month, Ming Pao reporter Xi Yang was convicted and jailed for 12 years for "spying and stealing state financial secrets".
