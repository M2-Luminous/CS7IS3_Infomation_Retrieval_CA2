The sources said that the 7th Corps of the Moslem force, in charge of central Bosnia-Herzegovina, had issued this order so that the blame for the possible downing of NATO planes, with a strong media campaign, could be pinned on the Bosnian Serb army and their ground positions punished. This would not be the first time that Moslem forces down NATO aircraft. In June last year, Moslems downed an Italian transport plane, the sources said, adding that world media had given little coverage to the incident although it had been proved, so that the Moslem leadership still relied on this support.
