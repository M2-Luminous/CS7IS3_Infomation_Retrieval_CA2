As agreed at joint economic cooperation talks held last month, Mexico now requires that tourists submit a traveler's card available at tourism bureaus, airports and on planes instead of papers that previously had to be purchased at the Mexican mission in Seoul. Businessmen who stay 90 days or less can enter Mexico without visas. The measure is part of bilateral efforts to boost people exchanges and corporate activities, especially on Seoul's part, to build better relations with the member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
