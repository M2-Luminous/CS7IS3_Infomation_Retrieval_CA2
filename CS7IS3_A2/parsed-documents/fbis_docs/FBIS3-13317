The meeting will discuss the troubled Kismaayo region. The port of Kismaayo is contested by two warlords, General Mohamed Hersi and Colonel Omar Jays, the main ally of south Mogadishu's strongman, General Mohamed Farah Aidid. Morgan is the son-in-law of deposed Mohamed Siad Barre. The meeting comes amid fears that the departure at the end of this month of United States and other peacekeeping troops from Somalia will lead to renewed civil war, with Kismaayo as one of the main danger zones. In a related development, efforts by KTN to find out the fate of a Kenyan attached to the UN Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM], John Wanjohi, who was kidnapped in Mogadishu, were fruitless. Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they had unsuccessfully tried to get information from the UNOSOM office. Wanjohi and a New Zealander, Wayne Hargreaves, were reportedly seized from their vehicles in Mogadishu yesterday.
