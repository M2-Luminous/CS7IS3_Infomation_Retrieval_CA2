The decision to go or stay would have to be made, but not in the immediate future, REUTERS quotes him as saying in the central Bosnian town of Vitez. "It will have to be a very substantial weighing up process." Western allies face a tough decision whether to stay in Bosnia saving lives and getting aid through, or to pull out, leaving a risk of greater savagery, said Hurd after inspecting the British troops near Vitez.
