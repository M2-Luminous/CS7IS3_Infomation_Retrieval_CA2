A low-cost desulphurization facility will be constructed beginning in FY94. The project is intended to provide environmental technologies to China and for Japan to accumulate technologies for using coal with high levels of sulfur content. The testing will be conducted at Unit No 12, Taiyuan Power Plant No 1, with an output of 300,000 kilowatts, located in Taiyuan, Shanxi.
