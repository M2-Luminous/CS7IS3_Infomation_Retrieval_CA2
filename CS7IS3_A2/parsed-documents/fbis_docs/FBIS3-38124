It must be ensured that borders do not come down for criminals while they remain in place for the prosecuting authorities, says a program of action drafted by Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther for the period of the German EU presidency in the second half of 1994. WELT AM SONNTAG adds that according to Kanther, cross-border crime, which is increasingly being organized on an international basis, must be combated more effectively, and illegal immigration in the European region -- and especially in Germany -- must be halted. The interior minister told the paper that he wants to ensure "an improvement in cooperation between all the security authorities." The German Government also wants to step up the expansion of "Europol" in The Hague and ensure that the European police organization is "fully operational" by October 1994. According to information from the news agency DDP/ADN, the Europol organization will take up work officially on 16 February. Narcotics agents from the 12 EU states based in The Hague will then cooperate in order to better organize the combating of internationally active drug gangs and other serious cross-border international crime. [passage omitted] Cooperation between the German and Polish border police will also be the focus of talks tomorrow between Kanther and his Polish counterpart Andrzej Milczanowski. The talks in Warsaw will also center on police cooperation, the Federal Interior Ministry announced in Bonn today.
