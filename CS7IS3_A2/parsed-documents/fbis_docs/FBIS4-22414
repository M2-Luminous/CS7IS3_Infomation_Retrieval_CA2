"Once again, we are getting signals that the interests of the rural people are being ignored. The latest example of that is the fact that the finance ministry has not allocated any money to the agricultural ministry for paying social stipends to students at agricultural-technical schools," Ivar Raag said. "If the government does not, in the near future, pass measures aimed at protecting rural residents and guaranteeing them a stable life, EMKE will join the opposition," Ivar Raig said. Ivar Raig also said that agriculture minister Jaan Leetsar is ready to resign, in case the faction joins the opposition. At the same time it would be difficult for the faction to recall reform minister Liia H�anni who has made a great contribution to speeding up reform, according to Raig. He also said that the faction is trying to find a political reason for recalling the agricultural minister only. EMKE also discussed, once again, the possibility of forming its own faction in Riigikogu. During the year-end government crisis EMKE announced that it will not join the opposition for three months. "Soon, there will be no other alternative for expressing our political identity than forming our own faction, like the liberals did," Raig said. He said though that there was no hurry for forming a faction, because EMKE will be short one delegate, and that forming a faction could not take place until April or May. Raig noted that the rural population is the biggest loser in reform politics, and that new ground is being gained for solving the differences in the political views of rural factions, which fosters hope for a bigger representation for the rural population in the new Riigikogu. The central council of the faction authorized the board to intensify negotiations with the Farmers' Council, the Rural League and the League of Lawful Owners regarding the formation of a possible election alliance. EMKE is also seeking substantive reform of the government, and wants the Ministry of Agriculture to be changed into the Ministry of Rural Economy, which would include specialists dealing with the production of Land, Forest and Fishing Offices, now reporting to the Ministry of Environment. Reform minister Liia H�anni said that the government has agreed to the EMKE proposal for carrying out a substantive reform of government and its structures, but this has been held up by the law for organizing the government. "Right now, unnecessary tensions and discussions are being generated that can put the government to a test, internally," H�anni said. She added that it is necessary to work out a more specific structure for ministries and district governments. H�anni mentioned that since the government coalition had found no common positions on protecting the domestic market and on the income policies of agriculture, even at the time the coalition agreement was reached, EMKE has found itself at odds with the rest of the government coalition. She thinks, however, that any juxtaposition of rural residents against their urban counterparts should be avoided. About her possible resignation, H�anni said that whenever the issue of EMKE's joining the opposition comes up, she will make up her mind. So far, she has not had to face that issue.
