FR941206-1-00088 FR941206-1-00007 VII. Other Considerations In addition to establishing emission limits and work practice standards for the industry, several members of the Committee were also interested in establishing a mechanism for tracking the impact of the standards on emissions of HAP and other pollutants, collecting information on technologies being used to meet the standards, and providing a forum for dissemination of information on evolving technologies. The Committee members felt that it was important to verify the proposed standards were achieving the reductions in emissions and hazards that were expected and to provide information on the technologies and substances being used to achieve those reductions. Because the emission limits for finishing materials can be met through substitution of non-HAP VOC's for HAP, and some non-HAP's can be as hazardous as the listed HAP's, they felt it was important to track emissions of other pollutants from the industry to ensure that materials of equal or greater toxicity were not being substituted for HAP, and that appropriate action would be taken if this should occur. Throughout the regulatory negotiation, there was discussion of new, lower emitting (both VOC and HAP) technologies that are reportedly on the threshold of demonstration. The Committee members felt that as these technologies are demonstrated, the information should be made available to the public. After some discussion among Committee members concerning the logistics of collecting and disseminating the information, the Committee decided that the preamble to the NESHAP should call for a trends report. The report would be developed by the industry. The report would be made available to the EPA, who would disseminate it to all interested parties. In compiling a trends report, the Committee agreed that industry will survey a sample of the industry that is determined to be representative of the entire industry. This industry-collected data will initially establish a baseline for this report and will, in subsequent years, be used to determine whether there have been increases and/or decreases in overall industry use of VHAP's and VOC's, and will include data on increases and/or decreases in the use of individual VHAP's or VOC's. Individual facility or company data would be collected and assembled by industry sources. As the individual data submissions will reflect confidential business practices and/or trade secrets, such individual submissions are prohibited from public disclosure except pursuant to court order or other legal requirement. This agreement to compile a trends report begins with the report submitted for the baseline year, 1994, which industry will compile and submit to the Agency in 1995. Reports thereafter will be compiled every 2 years, beginning with a trends report for 1996. This agreement to submit a trends report will terminate 1 year after EPA is required to complete the review of this standard prescribed by 42 U.S.C. section 7412(f)(2), which mandates EPA to review NESHAP for residual risk. In addition to the above data, the Committee agreed that the trends report would include a brief discussion of technologies being used by the industry to reduce emissions, and a discussion of evolving technologies including new finishing materials, adhesives, and improved application equipment. This discussion would not be an attempt to explain the emission trends, but rather it would be an independent review from industry experts on new technologies that are coming into increased use or that may be developing. The Committee also recommended a working group be formed from interested Committee members to provide further input on the details of the scope of the report. VIII. Administrative Requirements A. Public Hearing A public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss the proposed standards in accordance with section 307(d)(5) of the Clean Air Act. Persons wishing to make an oral presentation on the proposed standards for wood furniture manufacturing should contact the EPA at the address given in the ADDRESSES section of this preamble. Oral presentations will be limited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a written statement before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing. Written statements should be addressed to the Air Docket Section address given in the ADDRESSES section of this preamble and should refer to Docket No. A&hyph;93&hyph;10.
