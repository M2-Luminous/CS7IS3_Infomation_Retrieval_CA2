FR941006-1-00117 FR941006-1-00016 The types of products ingested were described as iron tablets, iron pills, prenatal vitamins, vitamins for anemia, multivitamins, and children's vitamins. Children's vitamins were the most numerous and were involved in 56 percent (45/80) of the cases, followed by prenatal vitamins in 23 percent (18/80). Sixty percent (48/80) of the iron products were nonprescription items, and 25 percent (20/80) were prescription items. (The remainder were not described.) The average number of tablets ingested by the children was about 20 tablets, and the greatest number was 80 tablets. One child was taken to the emergency room as a precaution, but it was discovered that the child had not actually swallowed any tablets. The iron potency of the product was documented only in 13 case reports and in those, it ranged from 15 to 65 mg. Most of the iron products (80 percent, 64/80) were reportedly packaged in CRP, whereas 10 percent (8/80) of the products were reportedly not packaged in CRP. In the remainder of the cases, the iron products were in packages with lost lids, the product had been removed from the original container, or no details were reported. The victims opened the CRP in 45 percent (36/80) of the cases. In 16 percent (13/80) of the cases, the victim was able to open the CRP because the lid was not secured tightly, whether by intent or accidentally, by an adult. A family member such as a sibling, cousin, or mother opened the CRP in 18 percent (15/80) of the incidents, allowing the victim access to the iron product. Elevated iron serum levels were reported in 18 percent (14/80) of the reports, and normal levels were reported in 3 of the cases. However, most of the cases (79 percent, 63/80) did not report test results for serum iron. Eighty-six percent (69/80) of the cases were treated and released from the hospital, while 14 percent (11/80) were admitted to the hospital. Symptoms, or lack of symptoms, were reported for 34 of the 80 children. The symptoms included diarrhea, vomiting, and lethargy. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common, vomiting occurred 18 times, diarrhea occurred 8 times, and 2 children suffered both vomiting and diarrhea. Fever and constipation were reported only for the 3-month old victim. Cramps, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, hyperactivity, and profuse sweating were other symptoms that were documented only once each. A combination of at least two symptoms were documented for eight children. Two of the pediatric iron poisoning incidents, including one fatality, occurred after an adult removed several dosage units from their original container and stored them in nonchild- resistant containers, as follows: (1) ``The aunt took the prenatal vitamin pills out of their original container and placed them in a tin can that was half full of pennies.'' (Ref. 22, case report No. 23.) (2) ``For reasons as yet unknown, she (the mother) took them from the original container believed to be equipped with a child- resistant closure, and put them in a container that was not equipped with a child-resistant closure, possibly a vitamin bottle.'' (Ref. 21, case report No. 21.) D. Response to the Epidemic 1. Petitions Submitted to FDA FDA has received three citizen petitions requesting that the agency take various actions concerning labeling, packaging, and formulation for iron-containing products. One of the petitions suggested that the agency undertake efforts to educate the public about the danger of pediatric iron poisoning. The petitions were submitted by the American Association of Poison Control Centers (the AAPCC petition) (Docket No. 91P&hyph;0186/CP1) (Ref. 12); the Attorneys General of 34 States, Commonwealths, and Territories (the AG petition) (Docket No. 93P&hyph;0306/CP1) (Ref. 13); and the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (the NDMA petition) (Docket No. 93P&hyph;0306/CP2) (Ref. 23). The principal issues in these petitions are summarized in Table 7 and discussed in this section.
