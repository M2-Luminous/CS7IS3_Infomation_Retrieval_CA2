The letter, also forwarded to TANJUG, says that by writing the article in the US embassy's newsletter, Madeleine Albright -- the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations -- had "abused the hospitality of the Serbian people and overstepped the norms of diplomatic conduct" because she called on "all countries to help the war crimes tribunal." The text implies that "the Ovcara mass grave near Vukovar contains evidence about Serbian crimes against the Croats -- something the European civilization of the 20th Century ought to be ashamed of."
