Its basis was the mis-matched set of expectations of the two countries, the so-called "world's largest democracies." India, which had a "special relationship" with the Soviet Union, after its collapse sought to establish similar relationship with the United States. However, all that the United States wanted was a subservient "poor relative" in the Indian Ocean region. For this reason, even while the United States invested in India's economic future, it has made it clear that it is not willing to see India complicate the world's power balance by becoming a power like China. India could, if it wanted to, become a Germany or a Japan, whose foreign and security policies would be aligned to, or guided by Washington, all in the interests of global stability and peace. So the primary effort of the United States in India in the past one year has been on the proliferation front. Additional countries acquiring nuclear weapons are the "joker in the pack"(as THE ECONOMIST describes it) that are liable to upset the present international card game. One pincer of this policy is to delay and halt any addition to India's technological capabilities that can assist in the making of long-range missiles. This was the background to the American demand on the Russians to block the technology transfer component of the cryogenic motor deal, as well as the autumn demarche to halt the deployment of missiles. (This, notwithstanding that Pakistan has deployed short range missiles on the Indian border for the past two years and Indian deployments are at least a year away!) The second and more dangerous leg of this policy is to use Indian difficulties in Kashmir to compel India to freeze and roll back its nuclear weapons options--essentially enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements to place all its nuclear facilities under safeguards and declare all stocks of fissile material. So in a kind of an international "Mutt and Jeff" show, Pakistan is encouraged to threaten India with nuclear war, and India is told how dangerous things are and that it must co-operate to end the threat to regional and world peace. For that reason, Pakistan's role in facilitating and aiding terrorist activity in India are ignored. The tone and tenor of recent remarks indicate that while the Americans do not recognise India as a "problem" state as they did in the 1970s or early 1980s, they do not see it as requiring any high-level attention either. No American President has visited India since Mr Jimmy Carter, nor for that matter, has any secretary of state come in the past decade. There does not seem to be any plans for any visits in the near future either. The Americans have managed without an ambassador to India. Of the three high-level meetings that Mr S.S. Ray managed in Washington, two were with the vice-president, Mr Al Gore, whose task was to push the reluctant Indians to commit forces in Somalia. The third was with the secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, on the eve of his visit to India in November in the wake of the Robin Raphel imbroglio. There is a love-hate relationship between India and the United States. But the reality is that all the loving and hating is done by India. For its part, the United States scarcely notices India. As long as India remains poor or militarily weak, this situation will remain unaltered. India being a democracy or an "open" society does not count for much; most American policy-makers would take objection to America being placed in the same slot with India on these two counts. Their reference is all right as long as it is confined to provide the rhetorical flourish to joint statements and declarations. It is against this background that one has to understand the strange state of Indo-American relations today. At the political level, relations between the two countries have never been so good. The end of the Soviet Union has eliminated all suspicions in America about India's geopolitical perspectives. Likewise, official India believes that all is well and that the continuing dialogue between the two countries has persuaded America to come around to India's long-held views on disarmament. America finds it difficult to deal with the third world, especially non-white nations in a framework of equality that the international system demands, in form if not in content. So there are problems in assigning a place to India. A major share of the problem lies in India itself. It has not decided what it wants to be and so it does not seem to be moving anywhere. It has not built up military power and, thus, not quite sought great power status, yet it is not quite willing to renounce it. Poverty and persisting misgovernance make mockery of its claim to be taken seriously as a great nation. Under Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, it is attempting to achieve this through another path--that of economic growth. The loudest applause is coming from America. America appears to be bullish about India's economic prospects and companies like Coca Cola, IBM, and a host of others have made the United States the leading investor in India, just as it makes it India's largest trading partner. Were relations to be confined to the economy or commerce, there would not be much of a problem. With India signing the GATT treaty, even the remaining ones have been more or less resolved. The real difficulties, however, arise from America's perceived role for itself as the only superpower. The contradictions in America's positions come through its advocacy of a test ban even though it has carried out the highest number of nuclear test explosions, or its call for India and other countries to desist from producing fissile materials for nuclear weapons, while the United States itself is acquiring some 500 tonnes of the stuff from the erstwhile Soviet Union. The biggest stumbling block, however, appears to be America's political and cultural perceptions of India. Instead of being more understanding of India's efforts to construct a nation on the basis of modern nationalism, a liberal democracy without regard to caste, creed or colour, the United States, in the name of human rights, seems to want to encourage sub-national forces who proclaim the right to nationhood on the basis of religion or ethnicity. From these strategic misunderstandings arise the seemingly minor yet damaging, difficulties over Kashmir, Punjab, or the cryogenic engines.
