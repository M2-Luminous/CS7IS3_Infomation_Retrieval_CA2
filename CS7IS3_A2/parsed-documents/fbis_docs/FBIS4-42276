It has been reported that General Ahmet Corekci, deputy chief of the General Staff, has issued an order on behalf of Gen. Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, suspending the acquisition of the wireless communication systems because they do not meet the needs of the Armed Forces. Consequently, the military forces have rejected the systems, which are manufactured by the British Marconi Firm and its Turkish partners, Cihan Electronics Company and Elit Electronics Firm, in accordance with the contract they signed in 1990. The Armed Forces acquired 919 communication systems under the project, which will cost 4.8 trillion Turkish lira. However, considering the problems in the systems, Gen. Corekci, acting on behalf of Gen. Gures, suspended the acquisition of the units until further notice on 16 December 1993. The military sources and the officials of the Undersecretariat for the Defense Industry [UDI] have said that the acquisition of the systems has not yet been resumed and that talks are being held on the Armed Forces' problems. They also expressed the hope that the talks will yield results in a short time. Gen. Corekci's order described the problems in the communication systems as follows: "The 400-watt and 100-watt systems, which were installed in the facilities of the Ankara Regional Communications Unit Command, were observed to affect each other on various frequencies. Communications were distorted by interference. "The tests that were later carried out to clarify the problem confirmed that the communication systems installed in the same facilities affected each other. Meanwhile, it was established that changing frequencies in the systems caused problems. "Although the list of technical specifications and the contract for the manufacturing of the systems do not contain provisions indicating that the units may be installed and used close to each other, the operation of the HF/SSB wireless communication systems by the military requires it. "It is believed that the manufacturing firm should consider that principle in manufacturing its systems. In view of that, the manufacturing firm should make the necessary modifications without any additional charge as soon as possible. Otherwise, the firm will be regarded as violating the principles of goodwill." Gen. Corekci's order, which was conveyed to the UDI, listed the measures that should be taken to meet the needs as follows: ``1. Every necessary arrangement must be made to prevent the wireless communication systems from affecting each other and to resolve the problems related to frequency changes. ``2. The acquisition procedures for the systems, which have been tested and stored in depots, will not be finalized until the existing problems are resolved. ``3. Furthermore, acquisition tests and the final acquisition of the systems will be suspended until the manufacturing firm's modifications are approved by the Armed Forces. ``4. The modifications to eliminate the problems must not change the performance of the systems. ``5. The military units will continue to use the wireless communication systems, which are already on the Armed Forces' inventory. However, the manufacturing firm will make the necessary modifications in them as soon as the work on resolving the problems is concluded.''
