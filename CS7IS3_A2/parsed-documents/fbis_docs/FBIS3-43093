It was determined that because of the presence of carbon acceptors, the examined layers exhibit hole conductivity. As the precipitation temperature is increased, a gradual improvement is observed of the layers' quality, accompanied by a lower concentration of holes and their increased mobility. The high degree of purity and the film quality, grown at T=600�C, is confirmed by the results of the analysis of the photoluminescence exiton band spectrum. A comparison was also made of the layers' characteristic obtained with GaAs and Ge substrates in a single technological process. It was demonstrated that the properties of the GaAs/Ge layers significantly differ from the properties of the homo-epitaxial layers. Figures 5, references 11: 1 Russian, 10 Western
