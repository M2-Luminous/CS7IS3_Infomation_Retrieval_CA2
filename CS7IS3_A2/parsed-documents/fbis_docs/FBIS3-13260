The tape recommends evading military service and not paying taxes as a means of opposing the government's policy. Yiftah El'azar reports: The hero of the videocassette is an imaginary character called Ron Segev, a tank brigade commander, and deals with his misgivings under the autonomy. Segev is detained by a joint patrol of the Palestinian police and the Israeli Border Police while demonstrating against Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in East Jerusalem. Segev decides to become a prisoner of conscience and inspires others to follow in his footsteps. Elyaqim Ha'etzni, head of the action committee, hopes that in real life Israelis will turn to civil revolt. [Begin Ha'etzni recording] It is a path of non-violence aimed at opposing a regime which almost clandestinely -- we call it the Oslo underground -- surprised and hoodwinked the nation, and with the help of pro-PLO votes in the Knesset, is taking the country away from the people. It is a path of nonviolence. [end recording] The cassette contains the names of right-wing intellectuals, such as Professor Yisra'el Eldad and Prof. Hilel Weiss, as well as senior military commanders in the reserves, who support the action. Among the measures recommended are dodging military reserve duty and evading the payment of taxes. Ha'etzni said it is important to learn how to carry out civil revolt in order to prevent a repetition of actions like that of Barukh Goldstein, who perpetrated the Hebron massacre.
