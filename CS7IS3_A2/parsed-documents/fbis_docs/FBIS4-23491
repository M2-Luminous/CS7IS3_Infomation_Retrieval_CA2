Former Home Affairs Minister Mr Schutte replaced Mr Bartlett, who has been appointed provincial MEC [member of executive committee] for agriculture. The congress was called to formally adopt the NP's new federal constitution and elect new office bearers. Mr Bartlett had led the NP in Natal through four-and-a-half difficult years, Mr Schutte said. "In those years he consolidated support in this province for the reform process; confirmed the principles of federalism, also to the benefit of this province; and played a major role in ensuring there was an inclusive settlement and a peaceful transition and election process." Mr Bartlett had also played a major role in fostering good relations and stability in the province, he said. The NP's greatest feat was the implementation of a new constitutional dispensation, but this was only the beginning of its mission. The party now had to make the new constitution work in the interests of all the people, and to ensure minority and group rights were respected. In KwaZulu/Natal, the NP had to ensure the provincial constitution was fair to all population groups and would ensure growth, stability and prosperity. "It is sad that it appears the spirit of a government of national unity has not yet permeated KwaZulu/Natal. Everything has taken so long to happen here," Mr Schutte said.
