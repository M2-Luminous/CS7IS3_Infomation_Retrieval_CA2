FBIS4-13814 "drnes079_l_94011" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Statement on Golan Seen Helping Christopher Statement on Golan Seen Helping Christopher TA2404114794 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 24 Apr 94 p B1 TA2404114794 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Editorial: "In the Lion's Den"] [Text] The prime minister's address at the United Kibbutz Movement [UKM] Central Committee in Ef'al on 21 April should not be seen as only an appendix to his remarks at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee earlier last week. The remark was a pointed and profound expansion of the earlier statement. Rabin chose to address the UKM of all forums for a good reason; it is tantamount to a lion's den for a person who previously said that he does not accept the extent of withdrawal on the Golan Heights as recommended by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] General Staff because it is too slight. Yitzhaq Rabin did not tell the UKM where exactly the line of withdrawal he finds acceptable in terms of Israel's security needs lies and which takes "the necessitating political reality" into account. Rabin stressed that "the government is trying with all its might to struggle against repeating the precedent set by the Likud, which opposed a compromise (in the Sinai) and eventually gave everything back." The sincerity of this promise should not be doubted, yet he believed he should make clear the limited ability of the government to hold the line: "Settlements may be removed for peace, and I am for removing settlements for the sake of peace -- which is more important for the future of the State of Israel than such or other group of settlements." Jerusalem political circles have for a long time maintained that al-Asad cannot accept the continued existence of settlements on the Golan Heights, even if the IDF totally withdraws from it. This assumption is probably based on reliable information. The above quoted remarks by the prime minister should have dispersed the remaining illusions the UKM may have entertained, and this is probably why they were made. Yitzhaq Rabin can be trusted to place the security aspect in a prominent place among his consideration, but he does not cling to the myth attributing a decisive security weight to settlements. Collective memory cultivates the stories of heroism of Deganya, Negba, and Yad Mordekhay, while discarding the stories of the evacuation of 'Atarot, Neve Ya'aqov, and Bet Ha'arava, and the loss of the 'Etzyon Bloc in 1948. Without explicitly reminding the UKM members of what happened on the Golan Heights in 1973, Rabin taught them a lesson: "Tanks on the Golan and a strong air force are the main guarantee that war with Syria would be prevented; the truth must be said." Rabin's Ef'al appearance can also be viewed as a move meant to assist the U.S. secretary of state on the eve of his Syria visit. The secretary should be equipped with evidence that Israel is willing to uproot settlements from the Golan Heights. Rabin's appearance at the UKM Central Committee was meant to encourage the U.S. mediator. The State Department's reaction indicates that this goal was achieved. The unanswered question remains, however, whether al-Asad would settle for a partial withdrawal from the Golan Heights, even if it includes the evacuation of settlements. It may well be that Rabin made the two gestures in vain, but even so, they are not unnecessary. A protest can be made against Rabin's statement that "if this year or by mid-1995 no progress is made with Syria and the Palestinians, the result might be military tension and political freeze." Such a warning might encourage al-Asad to insist on a full Israeli withdrawal. It appears, however, that Rabin believes that peace with Syria is the most solid guarantee against war with Syria, and that we should not be intimidated by the high price we might pay for the attainment of this goal. Also, there is no telling whether al-Asad would be willing to make a territorial compromise on the Golan Heights should the United States in return eliminate Syria from the list of countries which support international terrorism and drug trafficking. Much will depend on the amount of pressure the secretary of state is willing to exert while in Damascus.
