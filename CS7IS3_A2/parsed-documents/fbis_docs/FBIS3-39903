There are initiatives, meetings, and mailings all over the place. Why does one get the impression that the opponents are faring better than the supporters? [Mock] It's human nature; it is simpler to oppose something. The second point is that this phenomenon primarily occurs in medium-sized and smaller states; consider the Danes, the Irish, and the Portuguese. There is a fear that one will be swallowed up when one becomes a member of a larger entity, that one will lose one's identity, and fear can be turned into a very effective political instrument. [WIENER] The government's arguments tend to be based on the intellect, and those of the EU opponents tend to stem from the heart, from gut feeling. Should the government not rethink its approach? [Mock] There is definitely something to be said for that. I believe one must convince people by using political arguments. Economic, ecological, and financial issues play a part, but the most important question is why Austria should belong to the European Union at all. [WIENER] So, why should it? [Mock] First, it is the first practical chance for Europe to avoid national wars between participants in integration. The second argument is security. We should learn from the dramatic events in former Yugoslavia that when it comes down to it, we are alone. The third argument is that we do not want to become a second-rate country that only carries out the wishes of others without having any say in matters. [WIENER] As far as security is concerned, many Austrians fear that if their country is a member of the European Union and the Western European Union, it will be drawn into foreign conflicts that have nothing to do with Austria. [Mock] We will never be drawn into anything of the kind by the European Union. The European Union has neither decided nor can it decide if we should participate in a war, because it does not possess the authority to do so. [WIENER] Nevertheless, the population does have fears of that nature. [Mock] Well, that is what I have to explain. It cannot be done just through brochure's and posters; these media definitely do not achieve the desired result. The government and those groups that support a united Europe, from Gmuend to Leibnitz, from Bregenzerwald to Marchegg, must speak continually to citizens. [WIENER] So, would you have had the emphasis in EU advertising placed elsewhere? [Mock] Yes, I would have done so. [WIENER] So, what direction would you have chosen? [Mock] I would have opted for political talks and political arguments, and emphasized the importance of safeguarding jobs. [WIENER] The chancellor has been much criticized for his statement that Austria must join the European Union without any ifs and buts. Does this kind of "either or" policy not reduce our scope for flexibility? [Mock] One has to acknowledge that a politician is also a human being who has emotions. The fact that the chancellor supports the conditions I put forward in Brussels shows that Chancellor Vranitzky does not support an unconditional membership on our part. [WIENER] Many critics say that the government would stick its head in the sand and not discuss what would happen if the result of the EU referendum is a no? [Mock] A head-in-the-sand approach would be wrong. In that case -- as I always say -- we would not starve. However, we would be in a much more difficult situation competitively. There would be a whole list of very concrete disadvantages one could list. [WIENER] However, that is happening. [Mock] One would have to formulate that differently, the current discussion is far too polite. [WIENER] The government could counter the horror scenarios being put forward by EU opponents should Austria join the European Union with horror scenarios about what would happen if Austria does not join. [Mock] One should, without creating horror scenarios, state clearly what would happen. That is enough. Ninety percent of the domestic textile industry would collapse. That would also be the case with automotive industry supplies. Our current unemployment rate of between 3 and 4 percent, which is very good in international terms, would increase to between 5 and 7 percent. To maintain the same level, we would have to work harder generally and work harder at restructuring in particular. [WIENER] So, in the final period before the referendum, one one should describe the disadvantages very clearly. [Mock] The self-criticism that one should not formulate matters in too populist a manner is often an admission that one is unable to state things clearly and plainly. [WIENER] The supporters of EU membership also have to contend with the fact that part of the retail and wholesale trade is afraid of tough EU competition. [Mock] The basic problem is undoubtedly that the Austrians are often too fainthearted. The reality of the past few decades shows that we are better than we believe. [WIENER] There are even businessmen who are members of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] and the Economic Federation financing the opponents of EU admission. [Mock] I have never asserted that short-sightedness is restricted to the members of other parties. [WIENER] What is better for admission to the European Union -- a referendum before or after that Nationalrat elections? [Mock] That is something about which I, myself, am unsure. However, I would be inclined to prefer a referendum before the elections, because the European Union is currently very ready to accept an expansion of membership. The mood can change. [WIENER] What will happen if you lose the referendum? Would you then support another referendum, as was the case in Denmark following the Maastricht flop? [Mock] No, I would definitely not favor that, because then citizens feel they are being mocked. However, I am in favor of analyzing the mistakes that were made and those lay primarily with the government. Irrespective of that, European unification remains a fact. [WIENER] So, if things go wrong, it is not the fault of the people, but of the government? [Mock] It is primarily the fault of the government. There might also be other factors. One must be fair and admit that among the opposition there are very different views about the European Union. When the government and all the groups that want a peaceful Europe really make an effort, then we will receive the backing of the Austrians. [WIENER] Could Austria obtain more in new negotiations if the outcome were a no? [Mock] One should not have illusions that the European Union will make as substantial concessions as they made to the Danes, because we have not joined. The European Union does have a certain interest in seeing Austria join, but we would be deceiving ourselves if we thought it could not exist without us. [WIENER] Would a clear defeat for the government in the EU referendum prompt you to resign? [Mock] I will definitely not resign and I will continue to struggle for European integration. [WIENER] It is a question of the post. [Mock] I have already suffered enough defeats and not given up. One gives up if one has made a serious that will bring harm to the country or something that would have benefited the country is lost, and if one makes serious mistakes in carrying out one's duties or breaks the law. [WIENER] Regarding harm, you have always staked heavily on the federal president as a unifying figure and as someone who is a leading supporter of EU admission. Can that weapon still be used following the scandal surrounding his marriage? [Mock] I think a significant number of Austrians draw a distinction between private and political problems. The president continues to carry the same weight on this issue as before. I do, of course, realize that what a politician does is never completely private. [WIENER] The republic's top crisis manager did not perform all that splendidly in his own case. [Mock] That it was not a pleasant matter, and was not pleasant for the president too, is obvious. He also knows it has tarnished his image, but he has retained all his capacity for political action. [WIENER] Observers say this affair has not only harmed Klestil, but also the OeVP, which created Klestil, and has benefited the Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], that is, Vranitzky. [Mock] It is true it has not helped us but, at the same time, the president is not a party functionary. [WIENER] He is at least a figurehead for the OeVP. Following the breakdown of his marriage, this symbol of conservative hopes no longer quite shines in the same way as it did a few months. [Mock] Show me a politician who always shines. [WIENER] The entire OeVP is currently in anything but a strong position, it has maneuvered itself into a historical low, and has give up seeking a leading position, even if only verbally. As former party leader and honorary chairman, what way out of this situation is there? [Mock] Those responsible must give their full support to party chairman Dr. Busek, and do so when the situation is difficult, too. Second, a lot of work must be done on making what our party stands for more clear-cut, so that people know what the party wants. Over the past few years, our party also undertook reforms that carried a risk of unpopularity: the railroad reforms, the second taxation reforms, and privatization. [WIENER] Evidently, the OeVP has been unable to convince people that it is such an important reform party. [Mock] There was not enough done to present our position, to provide information. And things were expressed too diplomatically to put it mildly. The citizen wants to know where his party stands and what a politician's concrete position is. [WIENER] So, it is rather like the case of the EU propaganda. Less intellect and more from the heart, more gut feeling. [Mock] Yes, exactly, and more precise statements. [WIENER] In the case of cooperation with Haider's Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], the course you are following is rather different from that of Erhard Busek. Would an OeVP-FPOe coalition be a possibility following the next elections? [Mock] I also completely support Dr. Busek's course on this issue. What I warned against was the systematic exclusion of Dr. Haider as a quasi-Nazi. Whoever adheres to the rules of the game has a right to be accepted as a democrat whether one likes him or not. The second line of argument that I do not like is: When the liberals and the socialists cooperate, then they are reformed characters and liberals. When they work together with us, they are Nazis. [WIENER] So, is the OeVP-FPOe coalition.... [Mock] ...an option that cannot be considered at the present time, because the grand coalition has addressed important structural issues, partially solving some of them, and because it faces important tasks. [WIENER] If you suffer a major defeat in the elections, would you be in favor of the OeVP going into opposition? [Mock] Under certain circumstances, that would certainly be an option to be considered. [WIENER] The Austrians admire you for being so incredibly hard-working and disciplined. Stress can also affects one's health. How do you feel? [Mock] I feel very well today, but I will soon feel much better, because hopefully and in all probability, a positive decision will be reached in the EU negotiations. [WIENER] And that will affect your health? [Mock] It will affect my feeling of well-being. [WIENER] Would you consider remaining foreign minister under a fourth Vranitzky cabinet if called upon? [Mock] It depends on whether I feel fine. If one has not slept well for three days, is constantly rushing around the world, and things do not work out, then one naturally considers how long one should remain in the government. [WIENER] So, the decision also depends on the state of your health. [Mock] It will depend on the political situation, but also on what one can still do after 30 years in politics. [WIENER] But if it is possible, you would carry on? [Mock] If it is possible, I would.
