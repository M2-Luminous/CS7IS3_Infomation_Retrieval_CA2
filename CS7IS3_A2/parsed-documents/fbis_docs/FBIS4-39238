This is one of the most important documents in the recent package of economic edicts from the president. A number of experts believe that the edict was not signed together with six previous edicts because of strong pressure from the directors' lobby because the document proposes a realistic mechanism for removing incompetent enterprise directors from their jobs. But Sergey Belyayev, leader of the Federal Administration for Insolvency (Bankruptcy), claims that the delay in signing the edict was caused not by pressure from lobbyists, but by the need to finalize this legally important document. Under the edict, insolvent state enterprises not covered by the statute on the procedure for granting state financial support are to be sold off. They will not be subject to other forms of reorganization and will be selected by the Federal Administration for Insolvency as suitable for selling off. In an interview with IZVESTIYA, Sergey Belyayev reported that the sale of insolvent enterprises is designed to prevent the process of bankruptcy or the effective self-liquidation of certain production facilities. The term "sale of an enterprise" means the sale of its business and property, and a change in corporate ownership. Essentially, selling off insolvent state enterprises is tantamount to privatizing them. But this will not be a traditional kind of privatization from below, through a flotation, but a denationalization as a result of the enterprise being bought by a new owner. The sell-off process will automatically ensure a change in the managerial staff. And it is this more than anything that worries the traditional Soviet directors, who are strongly whipping up feelings in their labor collectives in connection with the adoption of the new edict. But if anyone will be unambiguously fired it will be the director himself. After the Federal Administration decides that an insolvent enterprise is to be sold off, the contract with its leaders will be torn up. And a new administrator, who will work within the framework of the sell-off agreement until such time as the enterprise is bought up, will be appointed by the state to replace the former director. His powers will be strictly defined by the state, and he will have no opportunity to exploit state property, as happens under the conditions of full economic management [vedeniye]. Enterprises will be sold by commercial tender. The main requirement of any purchaser will be to pay off the enterprise's debts. The nonpayment problem will thus be resolved. One other condition is the need to put in a certain minimum amount of investment. Sergey Belyayev believes that there will be people in Russia willing to buy up insolvent enterprises on these terms. In the opinion of the leader of the Federal Administration, the opportunity to buy up such enterprises will not only be an incentive for the start of a new phase of privatization, but will also be an excellent antidote to the flight of Russian capital abroad. Incidentally, foreign investors will also be able to buy enterprises.
