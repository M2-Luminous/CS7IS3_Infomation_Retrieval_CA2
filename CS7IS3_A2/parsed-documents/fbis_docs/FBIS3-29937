Joint statements were published by the Danish Workers' Party, Common Cause, the Communist Party of Denmark (Marxist-Leninist) and the Communist Party of Denmark on February 10, by the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party (Marxists) and the Left-Wing Alliance of Bulgaria on February 3 and by the People's Democratic Movement of Guyana, the Amerindian Action Movement of Guyana, the Guyana Committee for Support of Korea's Reunification and the Guyana-Korea Friendship Association on February 2. Statements were also released by the National Committee of the Workers' Party of Zaire, the Central Committee of the October 8 Revolutionary Movement of Brazil, the Asian Regional Institute of the Chuche Idea, the Nepal-Korea Friendship Association and the Union of Tanzania Workers. The statements denounced the aggressive moves of the United States in violating the sovereignty of the DPRK. They noted that the United States which is responsible for the origin of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must not try to solve the issue from the position of strength but affirmatively respond to the formula of package solution proposed by the DPRK for a fair solution to the nuclear issue in the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. Pointing out that it is a mistake to try to stifle the DPRK with strength, the statements urged the United States to act with discretion. H.G. Mahundi, police superintendent of the Ministry of Home Affairs of Tanzania, in a statement released on February 7 said that the "nuclear issue" of Korea could not be solved by a strong arm or strength and demanded that the United States correct its wrong stand, abide by the agreed points and respond to the DPRK-U.S. talks before it is too late.
