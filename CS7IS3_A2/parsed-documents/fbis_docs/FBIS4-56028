For many years there has been no money at all to modernize reconnaissance, interception, or armament. I cannot even remember when I last signed an invoice that would have given an opportunity for the tiniest modernization. [Andrassy] And probably no one else can. [Csurgay] This is true. We have seen some progress recently because we equipped six aircraft with friend-and-foe recognition systems that we developed, and we will also equip the MiG-29's with this. These MiG-29's that we received in exchange for the Russian debt were our only chance to significantly modernize our aircraft stock. At the same time, we have received 20 Albatross jet-propelled training airplanes, so we have managed to speed up our domestic training of pilots, which was started in 1993. We are planning to deploy the MiG-29 fleet from the autumn. In my view, this type of aircraft will more or less satisfy our needs until 2010. Especially if, again in exchange for the Russian state debt, we also received SZ-300 air defense missiles, which is a weapon equivalent to the famous Patriots. [passage omitted] [Andrassy] We left the Warsaw Pact, so we "do not belong anywhere" just now. Has this impaired the effectiveness of our air defense? We are not receiving anything from anywhere; at most, we can get weapons that are sold by weight. [Csurgay] We do not even get the ones sold by weight. Hungary is unable to buy any kind of new weaponry at the moment. At most we may receive something in exchange for the aforementioned debts. This is fortunate! As for belonging anywhere, my view is that, in spite of all the disadvantages, it is better if we prepare ourselves for a defense that is as efficient as possible, relying on our own resources. [Andrassy] Can this create an opportunity for us to join the developed western world? So that we know, for example, what actually happened on the AWACS planes that are in service in our airspace due to the southern crisis? [Csurgay] We are aware of the fact that they are here, we have constant contact with them. We certainly do not have the technical equipment to find out what happens on board and whether they participate in combat guidance. We have to make do with the information received from them.
