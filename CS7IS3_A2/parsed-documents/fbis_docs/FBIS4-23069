V. Kovalev, S. M Nesterov, I. A. Skorodumov; UDC 621.372.8] [Abstract] A method of determining the value of the complex propagation constant for a surface electromagnetic wave is proposed which does not require kno wledge of the electrophysical parameters of the studied material. The material studied in this article is a rectangular plane- parallel plate with a length of no less than two wavelengths and a width smaller than a wavelength. The material is placed i n a UHF field and rotated in the horizontal plane around its minor axis. The signal scattered by the material (in the form of the reflected beam pattern) is recorded. Irradiation of the material with an electromagnetic wave along its long side generates a surface wave that creates maximum reflection in near longitudinal directions. In the reflected beam pattern a distinctiv e main lobe of the surface wave appears which can be used to calculate the complex propagation constant for the material. The lobe is near parabolic, which is sufficient to determine effective scattering area values. It is much simpler to determine the complex propagation constant using this method.
