The people said that almost all of the Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia are already armed. By providing them with more arms, the Vietnamese will increase their activities, including bullying, robbing, and massacring the Cambodian people in Chhlong District. The Vietnamese men and women in the district have all along been arrogant and hostile and have acted as masters of the Cambodian land and sea and plundered Cambodian property. Nevertheless, the communist Vietnamese puppets have given them more weapons. The people said that these Vietnamese monsters are controlling and lording over almost all of the territory in Chhlong District. This is a grave threat arising from the Vietnamese and the traitorous acts committed by the communist Vietnamese puppets. Every Cambodian is furious and angry with the Vietnamese-headed Cambodians who have sold out our nation and land. Take a look at the areas in Kratie Province bordering Vietnam. Vietnamese men and women are moving in and out of Cambodia to plunder our resources and drive Cambodians off their land. They have taken a large portion of Cambodian territory. The Vietnamese have taken control of all the rubber plantations in Snuol District. They have sent Cambodian rubber for sale in Vietnam in exchange for dollars, while Cambodian workers receive nothing. They have also felled Cambodian trees and sent them to Vietnam. The people said the Cambodians cannot tolerate this traitorous act of the communist Vietnamese puppets and the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodian territory. The people in Chhlong District and elsewhere now realize that our nation will not survive under the old Vietnamese puppets who have served as out-and-out lackeys of the Vietnamese since 1979 and the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] which has followed in the footsteps of the Vietnamese puppets. Thus, the people have no other alternative but to jointly struggle to drive all Vietnamese men and women out of our Cambodian territory. Only by so doing can we defend our nation and race.
