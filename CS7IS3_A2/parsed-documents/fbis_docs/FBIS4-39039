Turkish media recently cited Gueres as saying that Russia is an even bigger threat to Turkey now than it was during the cold war. The general accused Moscow of expansionist desires in relation to the Caucasus region, Ukraine, and even the Balkan states. Such statements "fundamentally contradict the agreement reached between the Russian and Turkish higher leadership that their relations have entered a new level of friendly partnership", the spokesman said on Friday. He mentioned the many announcements made by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, and other Turkish leaders, which expressed satisfaction that Russian-Turkish relations have entered a new era and are now based on mutual interests and the spirit of cooperation. "The Russian side would like to hope that the statements made by Gueres do not reflect the point of view of Turkey's political leadership, and Russia bases its policy on the assumption that Ankara is just as interested as Moscow is in the further development of Russian-Turkish relations and multilateral cooperation", the Foreign Ministry spokesman declared.
