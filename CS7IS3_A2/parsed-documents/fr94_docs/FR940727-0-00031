FR940727-0-00031 FR940727-0-00015 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 301 [TD 8557] RIN 1545&hyph;AM64 Place for Filing Lien on Personal Property AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations regarding the place for filing a notice of tax lien against personal property. Sections 1015(s)(1) (A) and (B) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (TAMRA), amended section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a state conforming to or reenacting a federal law establishing a national filing system is not considered to have designated a second office for filing a notice of tax lien. TAMRA also amended section 6323 to provide that the filing of a notice of federal tax lien is governed solely by the Internal Revenue Code and is not subject to any other federal law that establishes a national filing system. EFFECTIVE DATE: These final regulations are effective April 21, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert A. Walker, 202&hyph;622&hyph;3209 (not a toll-free call). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background These final regulations amend the Procedure and Administration Regulations (26 CFR part 301) under section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The regulations reflect the amendment of section 6323 by sections 1015(s)(1) (A) and (B) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;647, 102 Stat. 3573) (TAMRA). The IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on April 22, 1993, (58 FR 21550) providing proposed rules under section 6323 of the Code. No public comments were received and accordingly, the final regulations are substantially identical to the proposed regulations. Certain minor stylistic changes have been made. Explanation of Provisions Sections 1015(s)(1) (A) and (B) of TAMRA amended section 6323(f) of the Code by clarifying that a state's conformance to or reenactment of a federal law establishing a national filing system for personal property does not constitute a second office for filing in that state. The existing regulations provide that if a state has designated more than one office for filing liens, the IRS must file the notice of tax lien with the clerk of the appropriate United States district court. TAMRA also clarified that the filing of notices of liens by the IRS is to be governed solely by the Code and is not subject to any other federal law establishing a national filing system.
