Kapp said at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs that the U.S. business arguments for maintaining normal and expanded economic relations with China are clear. He said that the standard arguments in favor of MFN renewal are familiar: -- Exports to China support hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs and are rapidly expanding; -- U.S. firms have large and growing investments in China that are at risk if trade relations collapse; -- Unilateral U.S. sanctions unsupported by other major trading nations will not succeed but will turn over economic opportunities to our international competitors. "The U.S.-China Business Council strongly supports the continuation of normal trade treatment for the People's Republic of China, through the renewal of China's MFN status without conditions," Kapp noted. "We will commit a policy blunder of enormous magnitude if we rupture the economic and commercial links that our two countries have worked to build over the past fifteen years," he said. "We must pursue full engagement for the long term with China," Kapp stressed.
