It would seem that the White House is seeking to restore the Americans' role in military operations abroad or otherwise strengthen the continuity of this policy, which is such a sensitive issue for the current Democratic administration, given the cases of Bosnia, Somalia, and perhaps Haiti. U.S. troops landed on the French coast of Normandy on 6 June 1944 when the forces of the former USSR had already defeated the German Empire. Military experts' opinions on this event differ broadly. Many consider the opening of the second front an action belated by at least two years, when the strategic initiative was in the hands of the Soviets, who had paid a high price in material losses and lives. Others agree that the actual prospect of a German defeat at Soviet hands and a future change in the correlation of forces was undoubtedly the factor that determined the opening of the second front. This allowed the United States, at the end of the war and without having contributed much, to actively participate in the division of the spoils and the theft of minds.
