This pamphlet, written in English and aimed at promoting the advance of foreign companies into the Japanese market, gives examples of successful operations by 20 foreign companies, including Bayerishe Motoren Werke AG. [BMW], Coca-Cola Japan Co., Ltd., Mobil Oil Corporation, and American Family Corporation. The brochure, which is entitled: "An Invitation to the Japanese Market," describes various facts such as changes in each individual company's sales as well as the factors for their success. For example, regarding BMW's success, the pamphlet cites the following factors: 1) Improvement of the implementation of a sales strategy befitting the market situation; 2) introduction of products conforming to market characteristics such as right-hand drive models; and 3) establishment of a network of dealers specializing in its cars. In this way, MITI explains that strategies befitting the Japanese market have resulted in successful operations. Many factors cited in the pamphlet as accounting for successful operations seem to be based on the argument maintained by Tokyo at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The pamphlet appears to have been designed to promote Japanese refutation of the United States' criticism that "due to the closed nature of the Japanese market, it is impossible for us to join in."
