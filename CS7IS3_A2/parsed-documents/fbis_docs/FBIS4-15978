Here is our Sakhalin correspondent Lyudmila Filipova with the details: [Begin recording] The meeting noted that there was only a month and a half left before the beginning of the planting season, and that all agricultural enterprises are in fact bankrupt at present. That is, they cannot assure supplies of fuel, lubricants, seed, or fertilizer to begin sowing work, and only about 25 percent of the equipment is ready for spring field work. There has never been such a state of affairs in the history of the oblast. The level of work discipline is very low, although this is not surprising because wages have not been paid at some agricultural enterprises since October. The leading specialists have moved to other industries where wages are quite a bit higher and where wages are still being paid. In short, the agricultural industry is collapsing. It was emphasized that the welfare of the agricultural industry workers is deteriorating. Even attempts to improve working conditions and to observe the fundamental rules of equipment safety have been discontinued. The basic means of production are worn out and there is no possibility of renovating them. All this comes at a time when the agricultural department and the oblast authorities are not taking any effective measures to normalize the situation. Every agricultural enterprise, it was emphasized, is struggling with its own troubles on its own. The loans that the government allocates for the support of the primary producers do not reach them. It is apparently not profitable to produce anything under these conditions, especially livestock products. All agricultural enterprises, without exception, incurred losses last year in livestock production due to low prices for products and tardy payments. The producers were not paid for the products supplied. The cost of electricity and heating alone has completely impoverished enterprises in the last two and a half months. We cannot speak of production when agricultural enterprises' sales basically amount to approximately 100 million rubles a month, but they pay more for electricity. The demands tabled at this meeting -- and which are to be presented to the oblast administration and the government -- call for the introduction of compensation payments for loans taken out from 1 January 1994 and a number of other types of compensation and subsidies. It was also demanded that the oblast administration take charge of all agricultural enterprise infrastructures, or pay compensation for expenditures for the upkeep of housing; set up a regional order for agricultural products for the current year; and provide a 50-percent prepayment of their cost in accordance with concluded agreements. It was also stipulated that extreme measures should be taken, such as demanding the resignation of the government, stern criticism of the president, and perhaps even strike action, if these demands are not met. One more proposal suggests that it might be more effective if the entire Far East region made the demands of the government in a concerted way. [end recording]
