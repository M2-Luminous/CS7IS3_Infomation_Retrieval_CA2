According to a CNEL study, Italian firms with foreign shareholdings leapt from 270 to 350 in the two years from 1992 to 1993. Most of the 80 newcomers were small and medium firms, while big groups, with the exception of IFI [Italian Financial Institute]-Fiat, did not raise investments in this period, or even disinvested. "The lead role played by small and medium firms is proof of the vitality of the system, as Italian investments abroad appear to complement rather than replace exports," CNEL said. One other figure highlighted by the study was the ratio of Italian shareholdings abroad with those of foreign firms in Italy. Until 1992 this was about even in terms of staff employed in the companies concerned. But in 1992-93 it rose by 150,000 employees for the 350 Italian-funded business abroad, compared to 50,000 for the 150 foreign firms in Italy. As for the markets where the new Italian money is heading, CNEL highlighted Eastern Europe, with its high development potential and low cost of labour, followed by various areas in the Far East, especially China. Investments to the European Community (now Union) and North America fell proportionally in the two years. The study also found a marked drop in foreign investments in Italy between 1989 (176 firms) and 1992, with just 68 firms with some or all foreign capital (foreign investors in fact prefer takeovers, the study said). But there was a slight recovery last year, to 84 firms. CNEL said the devaluation of the lira, which might have been expected to generate an influx of foreign money, instead had little effect, "raising the need for a policy that can stimulate and develop the presence of multinationals in Italy, especially in the areas of the South which, with just 16 percent of the total, continue to receive a modest quota of total investment." CNEL stigmatized a perceived tendency to exclude foreign firms from privatisation sell-offs as the fruit of "creeping nationalism and also possible interests against competition." It said this tendency must be rooted out if Italy is to have "efficient ownership solutions that will raise international competitiveness."
