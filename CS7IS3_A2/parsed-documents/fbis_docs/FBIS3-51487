Williams told the Caribbean News Agency he needed more time to take care of the organisation and development of his constituency, South Windward. The resignation was effective from Saturday, he said. Williams was health minister until June last year when he was transferred to the prime minister's office after a crisis in the health sector. He said he intends to contest the next general election, constitutionally due by the end of August. But it was unclear whether he would be a candidate for the ruling New Democratic Party. Williams, reported to be in the late 30's, went into politics in 1984. At the time, he was operating a taxi service. On Friday, in a paid announcement on national radio, Williams stated his intention to be a candidate for the South Windward constituency which he represents in parliament. This followed months of speculation that Williams was among three persons who would be axed from the slate of candidates of the New Democratic Party for the next general election. Williams, in the announcement directed to his constituents, termed the reports a malicious rumour "by persons intending to create division and confusion..." He continued: "I have no intention to, and will never ... Be ungrateful nor disrespectful to you all. I want you to understand clearly that I will be contesting the next general election on your behalf." The three functioning parties here have not announced their candidates for general election, but the campaign unofficially kicks off on the electronic media this week with the beginning of weekly television appearances by the NDP. The main opposition St. Vincent Labour Party has been having regular weekly broadcasts. Dr. Ralph Gonsalves' Movement for National Unity returned to the television screen Wednesday after a few weeks' break.
