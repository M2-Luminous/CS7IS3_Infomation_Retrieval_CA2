[Begin Rivero recording] My first impression is one of surprise, because we are a neighboring country. Venezuela is a country that shares common interests with Colombia, a good many Colombians live peacefully in Venezuela and many Venezuelans live in Colombia under conditions of stability and respect. I do not have the slightest idea why the terrorists chose to bomb this consulate. [end recording] Rivero said the terrorist attacks may be an effort to create chaos in the city and to hinder investigations. The Venezuelan consulate in Medellin must be transferred to another site due to the magnitude of the damage caused by the bomb explosion at 0548 this morning.
