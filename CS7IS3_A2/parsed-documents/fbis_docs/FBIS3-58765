Officially, Edouard Balladur and three of his ministers made a wide-ranging "survey" of the country's situation for more than an hour, thus making it possible to confirm "the encouraging prospects of the economy," said Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy. "We did not adopt anything," summed up tersely another participant at the committee meeting, Alain Madelin, the minister in charge of businesses. So, for now, the government is sticking by its projected growth figure of 1.4 percent for this year and is awaiting the full effect of recovery actions taken since its arrival in power in March 1993. [Economy Minister] Edmond Alphandery repeated this yesterday: "We agreed to say that nothing justified calling into question the government's economic scenario for 1994." Choices To Be Made Known on 3 February The economic minister once again left the door open to measures for encouraging consumption. "More specifically, we will see what can be done within a few days, when the figures for the end of 1993 and January show are released and when we know what the sales and Christmas period [le blanc] yielded," he said without further clarification. It is true that too much talk of possible supplementary recovery instruments, "just in case," could end up having the opposite effect to the one desired: Consumers might hold off their purchases while awaiting new incentives. The short statement made by Edmond Alphandery two weeks ago about possible measures to boost the automotive industry put the government and the manufacturers in a awkward situation. Yesterday's meeting was the first in a series of three "interministerial committees" organized by Edouard Balladur to redefine the government's economic and social strategy. A second committee meeting on social security issues is planned for today, while the third -- which is to concentrate on employment -- is scheduled for next Tuesday [25 January]. The work will be summarized during a government seminar on 3 February, at which time the prime minister will make his choices known, i.e., with regard to the essential recovery of the economy and the reduction of social security deficits. In the meantime, the entourage of ministers is putting the emphasis on the last survey from the Bank of France, which notes a slight improvement in the economic prospects of business leaders. Yesterday, another indicator heartened the economic analysts at Bercy [Finance Ministry]: Industrial production rose in November, even though it has been dropping continuously since summer. It rose by 0.6 percent compared to October, using data corrected for seasonal variations.
