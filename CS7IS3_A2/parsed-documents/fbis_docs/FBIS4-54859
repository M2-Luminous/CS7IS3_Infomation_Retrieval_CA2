I have not come to Belgrade with any specific plan, but I brought two important messages, Hogg said after his meetings with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. Hogg specified that the first message was that it was of vital importance to cease hostilities as soon as possible. The second message is that it is necessary to realize that a comprehensive peace solution in Bosnia is based on a division of the country, giving 51 percent of the territory to the Muslim-Croat federation. Hogg stressed that the sanctions will not be relaxed until the war stops and the peace plan begins to be implemented in Bosnia. He confirmed that he had discussed with Milosevic and Jovanovic the problem of the UN protected areas in Croatia, but he did not specify what they talked about. As regards the fresh crisis surrounding Brcko and the latest attempts to create an exclusion zone there as well, Hogg said that this subject had not been discussed because these talks did not involve any details. He stressed that he agreed with the increase in the number of UN observers in that area, which the Serb side had agreed to as well. Yugoslav Minister Jovanovic explained that the stance on the division of Bosnia that Hogg had mentioned was in fact an old EU proposal, which Britain believes should be a framework for demarcation in the resumed negotiations. This is not a problem that should be obstructing the negotiating process and the ending of the war at this moment, he underlined. We agreed that the work of the contact group is very important and that it is necessary to sign an agreement on the cessation of hostilities as soon as possible, which should be followed by political negotiations, Jovanovic said. What the Yugoslav side insists on, according to him, is that the sanctions, as an acute problem, are the basic obstacle to the implementation of any political solution either in Bosnia or in Krajina, or, for that matter, the entire territory of Yugoslavia. We pointed out that the sanctions are a form of hostility against the entire Serbian nation, not only against us in Yugoslavia, and that before the cessation of hostilities, due attention ought to be paid to ending all other forms of hostility. The sanctions are one of them, as well as the media war and the biased approach of the international community to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Yugoslav crisis in general. It would be impossible to cease military hostilities while keeping economic, propaganda and other forms in force. Jovanovic told the reporters that Hogg's visit was part of the British Government's initiative aimed at "assessing the situation" for the work of the contact group which is preparing a new peace conference. Hogg conveyed to us the assurances that the British Government and probably other Western governments were not prepared to fight the war for the Muslims against anybody. We do not have any reason to doubt this, even though the development of the situation will be the best proof for this, Jovanovic said. The assessment of the situation should be carried out before the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina is signed. The interested parties, i.e. representatives of the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mediation, will hold further talks to discuss whether the agreement will be of limited duration or a permanent one, Jovanovic pointed out. According to Jovanovic, Kosovo was also discussed in the context of an overall political solution in the former Yugoslavia, and after visiting Zagreb, Sarajevo, and Belgrade, Hogg will visit Pristina and it is very likely that he will go to Zagreb again.
