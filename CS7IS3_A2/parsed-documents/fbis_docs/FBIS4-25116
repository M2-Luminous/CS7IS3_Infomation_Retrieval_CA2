This will be the first time that Li Peng -- the person responsible for the suppression of the democratic movement during the Tiananmen incident in 1989 -- will have visited the advanced industrial countries since the incident. As the United States has decided to renew most-favored-nation treatment for China, and to discontinue linking renewal to human rights issues, the visit is meant to demonstrate China's complete rehabilitation in the international community five years after Tiananmen. Backed by rapid economic growth, the PRC is expected to engage in active, omnidirectional diplomacy from now on. Advanced Western nations have had an aversion to visits by top Chinese leaders, especially Li Peng, who is particularly loathed by pro-democracy forces, since sanctions were imposed on the PRC following the Tiananmen incident. It was Li who declared martial law in Beijing. Li's trip will return the visits made to Beijing by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in November 1993, and French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in April. He is expected to propose further expansion of cooperative relations, particularly in economics and trade. Japan also invited Li Peng to visit when former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was in China in March. Factors contributing to China's rehabilitation in the international community include its good record in economic development, compared to Western economies which have suffered from a recession, an improvement in the PRC's position as a major power in Asia and the Pacific region, and chaos in democratized Russia and eastern Europe. The Chinese source said: "Helped by a favorable atmosphere, the wounds left by the incident have been healed over five years." One of the outstanding characteristics of China's recent diplomatic strategy is that it gives central importance to establishing friendly ties with neighboring countries. China, which became isolated following the Tiananmen incident, first tried to cement relations with Japan and other neighboring countries, and subsequently started to move toward improving relations with the advanced nations. In the case of the United States, China applied pressure by actively improving relations with its economic rival, Japan, and its political archenemy, Russia. China calls its strategy "yuanjiao jinhe [close ties with faraway countries and peace with neighboring countries]," taking and adapting a leaf from the Warring States period [475-221 B.C.] strategy of "yuanjiao jingong [close ties with faraway countries; invade nearby countries]." Furthermore, it tries to play the advanced nations one against another as they attempt to make economic inroads into China. Among China's neighbors, the PRC places emphasis on Japan, Russia and ASEAN. China is sending Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to the regional forum scheduled to be held in Bangkok in July because it attaches great importance to this first opportunity for China to discuss politics and security in Asia and the Pacific. Southeast Asia has lingering fears of China caused by its military modernization efforts, the territorial dispute over the Spratlys, and its economic successes. The PRC will explain its position candidly at the forum and attempt to seek the understanding of Southeast Asia to make the gathering a "conference at which anxieties are removed" in volatile post-Cold War Asia.
