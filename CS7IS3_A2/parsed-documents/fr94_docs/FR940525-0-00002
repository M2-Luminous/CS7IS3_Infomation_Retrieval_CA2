ACTION: Interim final rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim final rule invites comments on the revision of the administrative rules and regulations of the marketing order for Florida citrus. This rule redefines the term ``Special Purpose Shipper'' to mean those persons who handle citrus fruit which is certified as organically grown under Florida law, and requires such persons to certify that they will limit shipments of such fruit to outlets handling organically grown fruit. This rule more precisely defines organically grown Florida citrus fruit, and may increase the market for organic shipments. This rule was unanimously recommended by the Citrus Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order. DATES: Effective on May 25, 1994. Comments which are received by June 24, 1994 will be considered prior to issuance of any final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 905 (7 CFR part 905) regulating the handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This interim final rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This interim final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.
