According to the city administration press center, a corresponding decree was signed recently by acting Mayor of Vladivostok Konstantin Tolstoshein. These actions by the city authorities were undertaken in carrying out the decree of the head of kray administration dated 24 February 1994 "On Introducing Mandatory Licensing of Activities in the Sphere of Trade, Public Catering, and Consumer Services for the Population." In accordance with the decree at the city level, the aforementioned licensing will be carried out by the Committee for Entrepreneurship, Trade, and Consumer Services of the Vladivostok Mayoralty; the right to sign licenses has been delegated to its chairman, Yuriy Terskiy. As Mr. Terskiy told NOVOSTI correspondent, his committee is currently preparing to begin issuing licenses. It is known that all enterprises conducting economic activities in four spheres of entrepreneurial activities--liquor sales, retail trade, public catering, and consumer services for the population--are to undergo the "licensing purgatory." Beginning 1 May the price of a license for each point of sale (kiosk, stand, store, cafe, etc.) engaged in one of these four activities will be R30,460. Entrepreneurs of all forms of ownership will have to pay separately for their right to conduct business in each of the four listed categories. In the event a certain point of sale is intended both for retail sales and consumer services for the population, the proper license will cost R60,920. According to Yuriy Terskiy, by introducing new rules for licensing activities in the sphere of trade and so on, the city will get a reliable source of additional budget revenue. The actual scale of this additional revenue will be clear after 1 May.
