FR940328-0-00025 FR940328-0-00012 Cyrtandra crenata was first described by Harold St. John and William Storey (1950) from a specimen that they had collected on the Waikane-Schofield Trail. The specific name refers to the rounded teeth of the leaf margin (St. John 1966). Cyrtandra crenata, a member of the African violet family (Gesneriaceae), is a shrub 3 to 7 ft (1 to 2 m) tall with few branches. The leaves are arranged in whorls of three, tufted at the end of branches; they are generally elliptic or lance-shaped, 4.7 to 11 in (12 to 28 cm) long and 1.6 to 3.1 in (4 to 8 cm) wide, and have toothed margins. The upper leaf surface is generally hairless and has a wrinkled texture; the lower surface has only sparse hairs. Dense clusters of three to seven white flowers, covered with thick brown hair, arise from the leaf axils. The calyx is bilaterally symmetrical, with the three upper lobes somewhat longer than the two lower lobes. The curved, funnel-shaped flowers, about 0.9 in (24 mm) long and 0.2 in (4 mm) wide, develop into fleshy ellipsoid berries about 0.7 in (1.8 cm) long that contain numerous tiny seeds. The berries, as well as various other plant parts, are covered with short-stalked, brownish, hemispherical glands. C. crenata is distinguished from other species in the genus by the combination of its three-leaf arrangement, bilaterally symmetrical calyx, and brownish, hemispherical glands (St. John 1966, St. John and Storey 1950, Wagner et al. 1990). Historically, Cyrtandra crenata was known from Waikane Valley along the Waikane-Schofield Trail in the Koolau Mountains (HHP 1991c1, St. John 1966, St. John and Storey 1950). It now remains below that trail, about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) from its historical location, at the boundary of private and State lands (HHP 1991c2). This population has not been observed since 1947 and although the number of remaining individuals is not known, it is thought to be very low. This species typically grows in ravines or gulches in mesic to wet forests between elevations of 1,250 and 2,400 ft (380 and 730 m) with associated plant taxa such as 'ohi'a, Dicranopteris linearis (uluhe), and Machaerina angustifolia ('uki) (Wagner et al. 1990; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). The primary threat to this species is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the species' restricted range and the small number of individuals that are thought to exist.
