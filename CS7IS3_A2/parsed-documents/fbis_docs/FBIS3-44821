Currently the government allows the importation of 1,664 merchandise items from the mainland. The government has sought to limit the impact of cheap mainland products on the Island's economy by allowing only semi-finished products to be imported. According to the Economic Affairs Ministry, the ROC [Republic of China] is considering lifting import restriction on mainland products. Over the next two years, the number of permitted imported products may increase from the current 1,664 to 5,000. In addition, once the 5,000 target has been reached, a recommendation will be made to the Cabinet that the list of permitted imports be dropped in favor of a list of banned imports. The ministry estimated that this year, Taiwan's total imports from the mainland will grow more than 20 percent.
