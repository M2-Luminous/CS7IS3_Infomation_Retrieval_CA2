The task of taking various reform measures to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the economy is very heavy. How can the tasks of reform and development be smoothly fulfilled? Strict control over the scale of investment in fixed assets is the key. In the past year, the whole party and all the people of the country have seriously implemented arrangements made by the central authorities concerning macroregulation and control, acted in unison, made concerted efforts, and achieved positive results in resolving conspicuous contradictions and problems which have emerged in economic development. Since the beginning of this year, the macroeconomic environment has remained pessimistic. The credit and currency situation has not eased. Transportation capacity, energy supply, and the supply of raw materials have shown a tendency to become tighter. New enterprise debts continue to increase. In particular, the rise in commodity prices is excessive and inflationary pressures continue to increase. All this shows that if strict control over the scale of investment in capital construction is not continuously exercised and if such investment is allowed to grow, the entire national economy will eventually become uncoordinated and the fluctuations which will occur will cause tremendous losses. Moreover, if such a situation occurs, we may lose the historic opportunity we have at present. Therefore, the central authorities have paid special attention to controlling the scale of investment and have decided, beginning from this year, to establish a restriction and risk mechanism for investment in fixed assets, to conduct a general inspection of the scale of investment, and to adopt various measures to curb growth in investment and to maintain a basic overall balance in the economy. This is entirely correct and necessary. To date, leaders of some localities and departments still do not have a sober understanding of the situation and are still blindly expanding the scale of capital construction. This is mainly expressed by: in making arrangements for capital construction projects, some localities have divorced from unified planning and have tried to set up a "small but complete" systems or to duplicate things; some, ignoring actual possibilities in local financial and material resources, have hankered after competition with others in doing things on an excessive scale, resulting in a waste of resources; some have violated construction procedures, encouraged "making investments first and using the status quo as pressure to gain approval" and "acting first and reporting afterward"; and others have broken up major projects into parts to avoid applying for state approval and have expanded the scale of construction scale and standards without authorization after projects have been approved; and so on. What are the consequences of such practices? If such projects go beyond the capacity of national strength to bear and readjustments have to be made, the damage done will be serious and the opportunity for economic development will also be forfeited. We have had many lessons in this respect in the past and we should keep them in mind. Why is it so difficult to control the scale of investment despite the fact that the situation is clear, the reason is clear, and our experiences of an expansion of investment on several occasions have been bitter? What is the root cause? To solve this problem, we should have a correct understanding of how to handle the relationship between macroregulation and control on the one hand and rapid development on the other, in addition to overcoming structural drawbacks through deepening reform. At present, some people think that since we practice a market economy and seek rapid development, we should no longer have macroregulation and control over investment activities. Such a way of thinking is not correct. In a modern market economy, especially when our country is still in the "catching up stage" of economic development as at present, the extent of market development is limited, and the gap between the level of economic development of different localities and of the urban and rural areas is relatively great, the market itself, because of its own weaknesses, cannot settle the issues of an overall balance in the macroeconomy, the rational distribution of resources, and fair distribution in society. Correct and effective macroregulation and control carried out by the government can correct market imbalances and remedy defects of the market, and only by organically integrating the two will it be possible to give normal play to the foundation role of the market in the allocation of resources and to promote the sustained and healthy development of the national economy. Another idea holds that in recent years, some localities have carried out flexible "adaptations" and have "made use of gray areas" in implementing the central authorities' policy of macroregulation and control and have rapidly developed the economy, while those who have honestly and obediently acted according to the policies of the central authorities have "suffered losses." Therefore, violations of regulations are regarded as "successful examples" in speeding up local economic development for various localities to follow. This is something totally undesirable. In the course of replacing the old structure with the new, indeed there are still many loopholes in the structure for some people to take advantage of because our policies and laws are not yet sound. However, such practices of achieving local development at the expense of overall interests have jeopardized the healthy operation of the entire economy. At present, investment continues to grow at a high level and the macro situation is tending to become tense. Has this nothing to do with the fact that some localities have ignored warnings? Just imagine, if all localities staked economic development on studying "countermeasures," what would the situation of economic development in our country be? That the central authorities have called for strict control over the scale of investment in fixed assets and for the comprehensive use of various means to regulate investment activities is precisely to correct and restrict unstandardized and even illegal economic activities and to create a fair environment of competition for honest people who really act according to the policies of the central authorities. Correctly handling the relationship between reform, development, and stability involves the overall situation in various kinds of work this year. Strengthening macroregulation and control over investment in fixed assets and strictly controlling the scale of capital construction are an extremely important aspect of subordinating to, and serving, the overall work situation. Each locality and each department should, in accordance with overall state planning and a rational layout, proceed from local reality, seek truth from facts, and do what they are capable of, and they should never follow the beaten track of ignoring objective conditions, stubbornly seeking output value and speed, and blindly expanding the scale of investment. It is necessary to comprehensively and correctly understand and implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and to really shift the focus of work to readjusting the structure and increasing economic results. This is the economic objective we should seek in reform and development and is also where our hope for the modernization of our country's economy is placed.
