The transitional government has still not been seated, with continuing squabbles over who should have what job in the government. Yesterday, in Monrovia, Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] tried to force the pace and get its nominees installed in their ministries. The operation failed, and the nominees have now left Monrovia and gone back to NPFL headquarters at Gbarnga. The whole thing was apparently based on a letter from ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] chairman, President Soglo of Benin, passed through UN Special Representative Trevor-Gordon Somers, urging the Transitional Council to give the NPFL the Ministries of Justice and Foreign Affairs, but there have been claims that the letter was, in fact, a fake. On the line to Gbarnga, Robin White asked Momolu Sirleaf, who would have taken the foreign affairs ministry, if the Soglo letter was a forgery: [Begin recording] [Sirleaf, laughing] I think that you ought to talk to Gordon-Somers, you know, because he sent the letter to everybody, including the Council of State. You should ask him whether he forged it, and, if he did, why did he do it? (?I am saying) this goes to the very credibility of Gordon-Somers, the UN, and ECOWAS. You ought to talk to Gordon-Somers and to President Soglo because they can't play with the Liberian people's lives like this. We want the government to be seated. We want the Cotonou Accord to be implemented. We hope that people would stop all of this tomfoolery and let the Liberian people have peace. [White] Why are you in such a rush? Why are you trying to force the pace? [Sirleaf] Am I in a rush, Robin? The Liberian people have been at war for four years. Please, I believe they are tired. I am not in a rush. I think the Liberian people want to put their lives together, and each time they try to do this politicians come out with all sorts of lies and dash their hopes. [White] Couldn't you hang on just a couple of days, instead of just storming out in a huff, while you settle this matter. [Sirleaf] No, no, no. We haven't stormed out in a huff. I told you our delegation is there. It is not safe, but our delegation is there. We have a team that is remaining there, and we intend to stay in the process. We will never pull out. In fact, we know that this is what they want to happen, but we are not going to pull out. [White] Mr. Sirleaf. [Sirleaf] Yeah. [White] Mr. Sirleaf, sir, you think you should be the foreign minister, that is right? [Sirleaf] Well, I mean, it is not whether I think I should be the foreign minister. I am the foreign minister, and I am going to work to make sure that democracy is established in my country. [White] Yes, but would you be prepared to give up that claim in the interest of peace? [Sirleaf, laughing] But why would I want to give up something in the interest of peace? I am a man of war? Have you known me to be a man of war? [White] Yes, but if it would solve the problem for you to step down, would you do that? [Sirleaf] But why would I be a problem? [White] Well, because other people don't want you there as the foreign minister. They'd rather have their own man in. Would you be prepared to step down in the interest of peace? [Sirleaf] I wonder who doesn't want me there. You mean the people that have tried to install a puppet government? Now, listen to me. All along we've been saying ECOWAS, you know, we've been talking about ECOWAS. ECOWAS has written and said that they have no objection, and the Liberian people have not elected any government. So who is the one that is going to object? [end recording]
