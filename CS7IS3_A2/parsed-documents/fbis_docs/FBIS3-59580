John Abernathey invited us to a photo opportunity. The "Quarter-Micron" project leaders from the participating Siemens, IBM, and Toshiba enterprises are in a good mood. They have accomplished a lot indeed in this one year since the contract had been signed. "We are entirely on schedule" says Hans Schuster-Woldan of Siemens. Since January he is heading one of the most diverse teams of workers from all three firms in East Fishkill, about 100 km north of New York. "The first experimental chips produced by the quarter-micron technology are already available" he announces proudly. In order to prevent further runaway of costs for development of ever more finely structured chips, these three large DRAM producers from the competing camps of Europe, U.S.A., and Japan decided last year to such an unprecedented alliance. They are sponsors of the joint project designed to develop a technology of producing fine chip structures. The is to develop processes which will yield 0.25 &mgr;m wide structures. As the first product they want to come out, by the middle nineties, with a 256 Mbit DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory): a semiconductor memory with optional access to all 256 million memory cells. If this project succeeds, it will be owing to Siemens alone that Europe has regained ground in microelectronics. This is by far the only enterprise which devises such clever strategies. All other microelectronic firms still just swim behind the technological leader. Instead of all joining forces, each enterprise in Germany -- industry and institutes alike -- tries to keep its head above water with with its individual solution. What looked so promising in 1990, when the fathers of the JESSI EUREKA program found a new home and new task for the Fraunhofer Institute of Silicon Technology (ISiT) in Itzehoe, has in the meantime turned into dust. The Institute was supposed to explore new processes for structurization of microchips by x-ray lithography. Soon, however, did the Research Minister cut off the funds for this because the "large industry has abandoned x-ray lithography." The ISiT chief Prof. Dr. Anton Heuberger notes today: "Since the European firms had largely stopped manufacturing memory chips, there was no prime user of this technology to be found in Europe. We therefore had discontinue our efforts." This assessment is, of course,not quite correct in view of the activities at Siemens. Rather, photolithography was also applicable to much smaller structures than had been assumed at that time. The Japanese tried it already then on KrF excimer lasers. And for this reason, evidently, the large industry let x-ray lithography go. A new concept made it nevertheless possible to begin construction of the ISiT in Itzehoe, after both Federal and State governments released the funds. Meanwhile very large-scale integration was been abandoned and somewhat smaller integration is being targeted: Only system integration, hybrid technology, and ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrate Circuits) for the medium-size industry are now considered.
