FR940104-1-00009 FR940104-1-00002 Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;NM&hyph;174&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;174&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On March 18, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8526 (58 FR 19571, April 15, 1993), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, to require that the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program be revised to include inspections which will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural Significant Item (SSI). That action was prompted by a structural re-evaluation by the manufacturer which identified additional structural elements where, if damage should occur, supplemental inspections may be required for timely detection. The requirements of that AD are intended to ensure the continued structural integrity of the total Boeing Model 747 fleet. Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Document No. D6&hyph;35022, Volumes 1 and 2, ``Supplemental Structural Inspection Document (SSID) for Model 747 Airplanes,'' Revision E, dated June 17, 1993, that revises the effectivity by adding airplanes to the candidate fleet on which supplemental inspections that give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural Significant Item (SSI) must be performed. This document also clarifies the selection criteria for candidate airplanes. The original Model 747&hyph;100 and &hyph;200 series airplanes in the candidate fleet were selected based on having accumulated 10,000 flight cycles by June 30, 1983. Subsequently, selected high time airplanes were added to the candidate fleet to replace out-of-service airplanes. Incorporation of the inspections described in this document will ensure the continuing structural integrity of the total Boeing Model 747 fleet. Since the failure of an SSI can compromise the structural integrity of these airplanes, and since such conditions are likely to exist or develop on other Model 747 series airplanes, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01 to expand the applicability to require that the inspections identified in the Boeing document, described previously, be performed on the airplanes in the candidate fleet to provide no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural Significant Item (SSI) listed in Revision E of the SSID. Moreover, the FAA has identified eight additional airplanes that are not listed in Revision E of the Boeing Document, and that must be added to the candidate fleet to replace certain airplanes that were removed from the candidate fleet. Some of these newly identified airplanes were operated as short range (SR) airplanes and have now been converted to freighters. Therefore, the FAA has determined that these airplanes must be included in the SSID program, and that supplemental inspections must also be performed on these additional airplanes to ensure safety of the entire Boeing Model 747 fleet. The AD proposes to expand the applicability by adding these eight airplanes. There are approximately 128 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 87 airplanes of U.S. registry and 8 U.S. operators would be affected by this proposed AD. Incorporation of the SSID program into an operator's maintenance program, as required by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, and retained in this proposal, is estimated to necessitate 1,000 work hours (per operator) at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost to the 8 affected U.S. operators to incorporate the SSID program is estimated to be $440,000, or $55,000 per U.S. operator. The recurring inspections costs, as required by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, and retained in this proposal, is estimated to be 1,275 work hours per airplane at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the annual recurring cost required by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, and retained in this proposal, is estimated to be $6,100,875 for the affected U.S. fleet, or $70,125 per airplane. Since no new operators have been added by this proposal, there will be no new costs associated with incorporating the SSID program into an operator's maintenance program. Therefore, the future economic cost impact of this proposal on U.S. operators is now only the cost of the recurring inspections for these additional airplanes. The number of required work hours for the recurring inspections in this proposal, as indicated above, is presented as if the accomplishment of the actions were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' action. However, in actual practice, these actions, for the most part, would be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of necessary additional work hours will be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling will be minimal. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
