The chairman of the RPF, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, has been in Tanzania to explain the RPF position that what is needed in Rwanda now is not negotiations and mediation, but Rwanda needs material aid. Rwanda also needs to bring to justice those who are responsible for the massacres that have been taking place in Rwanda. The RPF chairman said that Rwanda does not need another Arusha peace agreement. The peace agreement was signed after 12 months of negotiations only to be derailed by the same people who are now calling for negotiations with the RPF. These are the members of the self-imposed government in Rwanda. [passage omitted] It's only yesterday that this government murdered 21 orphans and three Red Cross workers who were taking care of the orphans in Butare Prefecture. While they call for negotiations with the RPF, members of the illegitimate government in Rwanda are holding the entire nation hostage. [passage omitted]
