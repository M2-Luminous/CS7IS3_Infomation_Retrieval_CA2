Pyongyang successfully test-fired the Nodong-1, a sophisticated Scud missiles with a range of about 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) in May, according to Japan. The colonel said Tehran was trying to develop aircraft and missiles ``directly threatening'' Israel and at the same time continuing a long-term nuclear programme. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said in August that Syria and probably Iran had received deliveries by Russian aircraft of North Korean Scud-C missiles with a range of 600 kilometres (370 miles). However, the colonel said Syria had not ordered any SA-10 or SA- 11 Russian surface-to-air missiles because of economic difficulties and a ``certain pause'' in the arms race linked to the Middle East peace process. The colonel also said Iraq ``apparently'' still had missiles and launchers which U.N. disarmament inspectors had failed to locate. Iraq launched 39 Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War killing one person, injuring hundreds and damaging thousands of homes.
