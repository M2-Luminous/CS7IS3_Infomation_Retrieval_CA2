"Secret" Survey According to Catherine Pegard writing in the 9 April Paris weekly LE POINT, a large-scale "secret" survey is being conducted nationwide by the Central Office for Polling and Statistics on behalf of the Renseignements Generaux (RG) following a request by Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua. According to Pegard, Balladur is the survey's principal theme. Out of 32 questions included in the survey, Pegard cites the following: "Do you believe that Edouard Balladur is presently carrying out an in-depth course of action aimed at preparing France for the future, or a limited course of action aimed at preparing the presidential elections?" "Can you tell me if you agree or disagree with the following opinions? --"Edouard Balladur's government is right in proceeding prudently, for French society is fragile. --"Edouard Balladur's government is carrying out an in-depth course of action by preparing the foundation for our country's recovery. -- "Sometimes the government meets with obstacles. This was to be expected. Everything will be simpler after the presidential elections. -- "No other policy but Balladur's is possible. No one could do better. --"The government is doing all it can under difficult circumstances. One must be patient and trusting. --"The situation is more serious than it is admitted, and the government has not sufficiently taken into account the realities and problems of the French people." According to Pegard, the survey also includes a series of questions related to political figures such as Balladur, potential presidential candidate Raymond Barre, Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, Union for French Democracy (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, EU Commission President Jacques Delors, Minister of Defense Francois Leotard, Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua, National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard, and President of the National Assembly Philippe Seguin. The survey seeks to determine the degree of "trust" they inspire in solving problems ranging from unemployment to morals, societal cohesion, and AIDS.
