Shaymiyev, president of the Republic of Tatarstan, by Aleksandr Sabov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special correspondent, Kazan-Moscow; date not given: "Did the Treaty Reconcile the Two Constitutions?] [Text] [Begin boxed item] We will remind the reader of the stages of the three-year discussion between Russia and Tatarstan. 1990, August. Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan on the state sovereignty of the republic was enunciated. It was Tatarstan that opened the "parade of sovereignties" in Russia. 1992, March. Referendum: Mass support of the sovereignty of the republic; moreover, not only by the Tatar but also by the Russian-speaking population. 1992, November. On the basis of the results of the referendum, a new constitution of the republic was adopted proclaiming it a "sovereign state and a subject of international law associated with the Russian Federation." 1993, December. As a result of the massive failure of voters to participate, the elections in Tatarstan to the Federal Assembly of Russia, in essence, were not held. The position of the republic: New elections will be conducted only after the signing of a special treaty between the Republic of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation. 1994, 15 February. The leaders of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan signed the treaty "On the Demarcation of Powers and Subjects of Jurisdiction between the Organs of State Authority of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan." 1994, 13 March. Repeat elections were held with a rather high activeness of the population. Tatarstan took two seats on the Federation Council and all five seats in the State Duma of Russia. [end boxed item] [Sabov] In my opinion, here, in Tatarstan, after three years of peripeteia, which Russia followed with anxiety, a certain very important precedent was set for regulating relations between the Federation and its components. In the treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan, unlike your constitution, the words on Tatarstan as "a sovereign state" and "a subject of international law" are excluded, and the concept of a Tatarstan that is "associated" is replaced by the concept of a Tatarstan that is "united" with Russia. Tell me, Mintimer Sharipovich, what do you see as the advantage of joining the Federation in this way. Why did you not agree, like Bashkortostan or Yakutia (Sakha), to sign the Federative Treaty with the special supplements to it? [Shaymiyev] Well, first, you are right in saying that our relations with Russia remained uncertain for a long time, more than three years. Not only were those who watched from the side anxious, but there was also anxiety here among the residents of the republic. It was intensified by the feeling of general instability in Russia which, after the collapse of the Union, is itself experiencing a time of troubles in its own history. We were accused of separatism and violation of the integrity of Russia. The so-called "central" mass media printed many articles that were not objective, frequently confusing the demands of the radical nationalistic movements of Tatarstan with the positions of the official leadership of the republic. But, after all, they never coincided. For example, as president, despite all the pressure brought to bear on me, not once in any form did I demand "independence" for Tatarstan. Overall, I always remained calm, knowing that sooner or later Russia would understand and appreciate our position. It was three years ago, while adopting the Declaration on the Sovereignty of Tatarstan--imagine, this was in the time of the Union, when hopes still existed for the success of the Novo-Ogarevo process!--that we declared that as soon as we build a rule-of-law society, relations between the republic and the Federation should be built on a treaty basis and mutual delegation of powers. At the time of the conduct of the referendum on the official status of the republic, our Supreme Soviet once again made a distinct clarification: Tatarstan is not for violation of the integrity of the Russian Federation, but is seeking a path of reasonable coordination of its interests with all-Russian interests. After the signing of the treaty on 15 February, I tirelessly emphasized the principles of our joining the Federation in my preelection campaign: a treaty basis, demarcation and delegation of powers, and no violation of Russia's integrity. Our position was consistent, because we defended the mutual conditionality of these three principles from the very beginning. [Sabov] Nevertheless, in the final stage, the matter ended in a compromise for you as well? After all, a number of provisions of your constitution do not coincide with the provisions of the treaty. [Shaymiyev] Well, what can be done without a compromise? As president, I cannot violate the Constitution of Tatarstan, under which we are now living for the second year. Yes. The constitution and the treaty differ in many articles. But we came to an agreement in principle with B.N. Yeltsin--and this is reflected in the treaty itself--that it, the treaty, prevails over both constitutions--of the Republic of Tatarstan and of the Russian Federation. If you wish, this is a document of the coordination of two constitutions: Where they do not coincide, both sides are guided by the provisions of the treaty. So, this is a mutual compromise. Therefore, Russia itself does not raise the fact that Tatarstan, say, must amend its Basic Law, just as we in turn proceed from the fact that within the scope of delegated powers Tatarstan can get along with the Russian Constitution. But if we took the path or were forced to take the path of revising the provisions of our constitution, then we simply could not arrive at an agreement. I must say frankly: The new Russian Constitution is basically decorative-federative. Even a majority of Russian political scientists talk about this openly, and those who do not say it, confirm it with their silence. In fact, this is the constitution of a unitary state and, therefore, we did not agree to recognize its action on our territory. But it has been adopted and has become a reality. So the signing of the treaty, which has been ascribed predominant meaning, is a fact of enormous political significance for Russia as well: After this it in fact stops being a unitary state. [Sabov] But, after all, according to your logic, this is no more than an exception: Tatarstan is only one of the 21 republics in the system of the Russian Federation... [Shaymiyev] In this case, it is the first step toward the renewal of the democratic Federation of Russia. By the fact of signing the treaty, it stopped being a unitary state not only with respect to Tatarstan but, no less important, also with respect to itself. [Sabov] But with respect to other regions? [Shaymiyev] It is still unitary. But so that an empire of lesser dimensions did not arise in place of the USSR, a precedent was important for this: to disrupt the unitary thinking that was already elevated to the constitutional level. Incidentally, a long ago time we proposed at the Council of Heads of Republics: Let us voluntarily unite and create a strong federation. This would remove the tension and suspicion in the relations of Russia with its previous autonomies that took on the status of republics. But the fear intruded: What if after the collapse of the Union the very same fate befell Russia as well... As soon as we did not succeed in starting the collective treaty process, we had no choice left: We came to an agreement with Russia by ourselves. [Sabov] Well, fine, the treaty prevails over the two constitutions... But out of 21 republics, it seems, seven have declared the supremacy of their own laws over all-Russian laws. Is this really not a path toward disintegration? [Shaymiyev] Yes. But this danger can be avoided, if the republics conclude treaties with the Federation. For example, in our case the concept of the supremacy of laws was transformed entirely. In those powers that we delegated to the exclusive or joint jurisdiction of the Federation, the supremacy of the Russian Constitution is unconditionally recognized. But where the treaty grants exclusive powers to Tatarstan, the principle of the supremacy of its Basic Law is just as firm. If the Federative Treaty became a part of the federal constitution, which the regions tried to achieve at one time, then possibly the powers could be more or less accurately demarcated and delegated--from the localities to the center, and vice versa. Incidentally, the first draft of the constitution was drawn up in precisely this spirit. But then it was thrown out! But the Federative Treaty simply was not included in the new, final text of the constitution, which made it a document of an unclear juridical nature. Its weakness is that it does not provide a mechanism for the implementation of powers. In contrast to our treaty, which we accompanied with 12 agreements--on questions of defense, ecology, higher education, etc. We now know precisely which questions are "ours" and which are "not ours." [Sabov] To end the subject of the Federation: How do you see the problem of krays and oblasts in Russia joining it? [Shaymiyev] I think that the signing of the Federative Treaty with krays and oblasts was a mistake in principle. Russia itself should have come out as one state, as a component of the Federation that united all of its administrative entities. The priority then is something else entirely: the economic equality of the republics, on the one hand, and of the krays and oblasts on the other. [Sabov] It is written in your treaty with Russia: Tatarstan is sovereign on the question of establishing its own state institutions and structures of authority. But, in contrast to a majority of the regions of Russia, you have not yet removed the so-called soviet authority. [Shaymiyev] The entire path we have traveled in three years: the Declaration on State Sovereignty, the constitution, and the program of economic reform in the republic--all this was done with the very close participation of the Supreme Soviet, which was elected at the time under a one-party system. As the head of the executive authority, I can say that we did not have any confrontation with the legislative authority, and there is none. Of course, problems arose, but they were resolved with the assistance of conciliatory commissions, or the deputies themselves demanded the intervention of the president. [Sabov] But, after all, life has changed! New parties have emerged, and they are demanding their own place in political life... [Shaymiyev] True. However, should this be done by means of the dispersal of the old organs of representative authority, and is it not better to prepare a planned and painless transition to a multiparty political system? We are preparing for such elections. For this, it is necessary first of all to adopt a new election law. Three variants of it have already been proposed, but not one has passed yet. All that remains is to come to an agreement on the principles of this reform. [Sabov] And when does the term of power of the Supreme Soviet expire? [Shaymiyev] In March next year. Thus, we still have almost a year to go. We will hold new elections at the end of 1994 or beginning of 1995. On a multiparty basis, of course. [Sabov] In this connection, Mintimer Sharipovich, a question about the opposition: Alas, it is reprints from its articles in the Russian press that have so damaged Tatarstan's reputation in public opinion. What today is the real weight of the national-radical opposition in the republic, and will it in the future be able to become a destabilizing factor in relations between Tatarstan and Russia? [Shaymiyev] We have more than one opposition. There are two: the Tatar national-radicals, and, as they call themselves, the "Russian Federalists." Both of them stand on extreme positions. From the very beginning, the Federalists were up in arms against our sovereignty: We do not need any kind of "Tatarstan state," and it is not necessary to renew the Federation. That is, in fact, they are for a unitary Russia. The national-radicals are at the other extreme: the complete independence of Tatarstan, no kind of federation with Russia, Russia is simply "a neighboring state." They met the fact of the signing of the treaty with hostility: They declared a boycott of the elections, they began to collect signatures for the recall of the president as a "traitor of Tatarstan," etc. But here is what is indicative: Today, at the expiration of three years of political transformations in Tatarstan, there is less public support for them than there was at the beginning! Their extremist slogans lost their attraction. Pardon me if I refer to myself without false modesty: On 13 March in the elections to the Federation Council of Russia I received 204,000 more votes than I did three years ago, when I was elected president of Tatarstan. The centrist niche is occupied--it is occupied by the policy of the president and other official organs of the republic. This makes it that much more difficult for extremists from one or another kray to position themselves. Shaymiyev or no Shaymiyev, it is not a matter of personalities: Only a person with firm centrist positions can be the president of Tatarstan. [Sabov] By virtue of the multiethnic composition of the population? [Shaymiyev] Unquestionably. After all, our Tatar and Russian population is practically half-and-half, and each third family is mixed. [Sabov] Nevertheless, the opposition is raising the question of the establishment of a monoethnic Tatarstan? [Shaymiyev] It used to. But it has already dropped this slogan. Tatarstan's self-isolation, against the background of difficulties, most of all in the economy, would add new incredible difficulties for us. Why complicate people's life? For the sake of someone's political ambitions? Permit me to express in confidence: The example of the treaty that was concluded by Tatarstan and Russia will also find an echo beyond the borders of our Federation. You will recall that Gamsakhurdia came to power after receiving almost 99 percent of the votes. It seemed: How easy it is to resolve questions in a mononational state! However, it is easy to get ill with nationalism, but it is far more difficult to recover from it, as we see from the example of Georgia and Moldova. To work in a multinational environment is more difficult, but during the years of my presidency I have understood that multinationalism is a great blessing. And you begin to especially appreciate this blessing in such difficult times as ours, when the very social foundations are changing. It is not accidental that the concept of the "people of Tatarstan" is present in our constitution, and not the "nation of Tatarstan." And two state languages. After all, why did such discord occur in Moldova? Because of the temptation to impose one state language on a multinational population. [Sabov] Is the Russian-speaking population of Tatarstan excepted from the difficulties it is experiencing in the former republics of Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the aforementioned Moldova? [Shaymiyev] A question for your question: Have you seen refugees from Tatarstan anywhere in Russia or in the CIS countries? On the other hand, more and more are coming to us. Of course, 75 percent of them are Tatars who have left their place of residence, but the rest are basically Russian. Nevertheless, even here a certain tension has been felt in the relations of the two communities. This came both from the intrigues of radicals and from the continuous displays on television of the hot spots in the CIS... Therefore, even on the purely human plane, the fact of the signing of the treaty with Russia is very important: It finally dispelled the anxiety of Russians over their position in Tatarstan. [Sabov] My fellow-traveler on a train, a young doctor, a Tatar, admitted: "The establishment of the Tatar language as the only official language would be a tragedy for me." Here is an absolutely unexpected aspect of the problem: Tatar youth and a Tatar intelligentsia who are not fluent in their own language! [Shaymiyev] Yes, two languages are recognized here as official, but the Tatar language now needs help. After all, office work and training are conducted in Russian, not to mention the fact that everyone speaks Russian. It was a pleasant surprise for me to learn that many Russian families sent their children to groups we opened up for the study of the Tatar language. [Sabov] Is it true, as was written by Russian newspapers, that demands were heard at the World Congress of Tatars for the creation of a national parliament (a little majlis) as a kind of parallel government of a "Great Tatarstan?" [Shaymiyev] This did not happen! We viewed the World Congress of Tatars from the very beginning as a measure that was not political but strictly cultural. There are about 7 million Tatars in the CIS countries, and less than 2 million in Tatarstan. There are large Tatar communities in the United States, Australia, Finland... Like every dispersed people, we are also endeavoring to "find" each other, so that we may preserve our culture, language, and ethnos together. Even the opposition in the course of this congress did not dare to put forth the idea of a "World Government of Tatars." I especially thanked the Russian population, the Russian part of our people, for the fact that I did not see even a shadow of dissatisfaction on their faces when we conducted this congress here in Tatarstan. After all, there could have been a different reaction: They assembled Tatars, it is said, from the whole world, expect oppression... But when the authorities do not play to the gallery and do not tell lies, then the people understand everything. Of course, here in Kazan the opposition created its own little majlis. But this is an illegitimate organ, not elected by anyone, and according to its own official registration it is an ordinary public organization. Moreover, believe me, with insignificant influence. [Sabov] But what as a result does the treaty promise in Tatarstan's economic plan which, incidentally, is constantly called a debtor of the central budget? Have you rejected your tax obligations to the Federation? [Shaymiyev] Well, no, everything is being done in a different way. Henceforth, we will collect republic taxes ourselves, and we will submit that share to the federal budget that is necessary for the implementation of powers transferred there. Or for the conduct of joint federal programs; for example, the building of a bridge across the Kama. After all, the transportation of all Russia will move across this bridge, not only ours. You asked about our new economic advantages. Here is an example. Russia is now tormented with nonpayments. Everyone says: It is necessary to establish a system of bill of exchange settlements immediately. They say this, but do not do it! As a result, thousands of enterprises in Russia have stopped work. Of course, nonpayments are hitting the economy of Tatarstan hard also, when it is a matter of foreign accounts. But we have resolved this problem inside the republic: We have a bill of exchange in circulation whose guarantor is the government. Here is a specific advantage of the economic independence of the republic. Another example: specifically directed social protection of the poor. A summary is laid on my desk every day on the correlation of minimum expenditures and incomes of the population. For example, according to the status on 1 February, the subsistence minimum in Tatarstan was 29,000 rubles [R]. But the minimum level of wages for Russia was R14,700. As a result, almost a third of the population of the country ended up below the poverty line. But is this really fair--to pay people half of the subsistence minimum? The Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan increased the minimum income per person to R30,000, which is the law for our commodity producers. As a result, I make so bold as to hope that not one person in Tatarstan is living below the poverty line. Go into a store: Products are cheaper here than in Russia. We have not dissolved our kolkhozes, as an edict of the Russian president at one time demanded of us. We did not cut the number of cattle. For the second year we have an increase in the production of agricultural products. We stopped, as before, saluting the federal authorities. We resolve questions that, according to the treaty, remained in our jurisdiction in a way that we find reasonable under our conditions. This does not mean, for example, that we are for the perpetuation of kolkhozes. We prefer another policy: That is, kolkhozes should help put farmers on their feet. Or the question of the fight against crime. It has taken on such scope everywhere that it is no longer possible to fight it without emergency measures. And we have undertaken such measures. We passed a resolution to detain suspects not for three days, as is allowed by federal legislation, but for 30 days. The solving of crimes has increased sharply. I can tell you that they are now coming here from Moscow "to study the experiment" in keeping crime in check...[end Shaymiyev] While bidding farewell, M.Sh, Shaymiyev said: "But you know, I have a guest tomorrow: President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov is flying in." The purpose of the visit, it seems, is clear. Is there not a need there also, in Ukraine, for a breach in the wall that divides the "center" and the "outlying districts?"
