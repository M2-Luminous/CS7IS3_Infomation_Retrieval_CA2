Father Mba Abessole is going to France "to take some rest, and he will maintain contacts with his friends," the same source said without stating the duration of his trip. The National Lumberjacks Rally leader, who was accompanied by an opposition delegation and seen off by several dozen supporters at Libreville Airport, was able to "board the aircraft without any difficulty," the spokesman added. Since security forces besieged his residence on 23 February, Father Abessole has not made any public appearance. The government has specifically accused him of provoking the four-day disturbances which rocked several areas in Libreville at the beginning of the general strike called by a pro-opposition trade union to demand postdevaluation salary increases. Several opposition leaders belonging to the High Resistance Council chaired by Father Mba Abessole are currently in Paris.
