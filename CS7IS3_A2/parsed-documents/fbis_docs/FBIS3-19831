Day after day and night after night, he carries on an endless series of dialogues in Brussels, making every effort to convince his interlocutors with reasonable arguments. As president of the negotiations, he had to tolerate how his impatient German colleague, Klaus Kinkel, took over the reins and, sometimes rudely, put pressure on those who would obstruct taking on board Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria as new EU member states. Now, however, it looks as if the planned enlargement of the European Union by 1 January 1995 is a big mistake and a big misunderstanding. Pangalos himself thinks that this is the case. The EU would have been better off with an internal reorganization aimed at making mutual cooperation stronger, and not taking on any new members until the end of the decade, the minister said this week, just after returning to Greek soil. Has Pangalos gone crazy? Or is he right? The intended enlargement to include Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria had already caused deep splits in the EU, even before the European Parliament had received all the texts of the agreements. Great Britain and Spain are mercilessly threatening to explode an institutional time bomb with their refusal to give up any of their voting weight in an enlarged Union. [British Prime Minister] Major can hardly make a move, hunted as he is by the Euroskeptics in his own rank and file and the media, which never stops recalling the glory days of former Prime Minister Thatcher, who, all on her own, had the rest of Europe on its knees in the debate on reimbursing EC contributions. On the continent itself, the reliable Franco-German axis has shown signs of overheating, following the controversial statements made by the French ambassador in Bonn concerning the all too assertive role which Germany wants to play in Europe. Elsewhere, too, distrust is raising its head. "Germany wants to complete the enlargement of the EU as soon as possible so that it can seize its opportunities in Central and East Europe." That is how Netherlands Foreign Minister Kooijmans interpreted Kinkel's enthusiasm in Brussels. So what happens now with the enlargement? Diplomats in Brussels have no idea how the impasse over the "blocking minority" during the decisionmaking process -- i.e., should it be 23 or 27 votes in the EU? -- can be resolved by next Tuesday when the foreign ministers of the 12 EU member states meet again. Various formulas are making the rounds whereby the decisionmaking process would be interrupted for, say, two months in order to reach a consensus, but so far this looks like it has little chance of succeeding. This means that there is a real threat of an enormous crisis, and this seems to prove Pangalos even more correct. It would have been better if the EU had given itself more time to "digest" the Maastricht Treaty. The European Commission also felt that first there should have been talks on "deepening" and then enlarging the Union, but the European heads of government decided otherwise at their summit in Lisbon in the summer of 1992, recalled a Commission spokesman suddenly when asked for a reaction to Pangalos' statements. That decision in Lisbon can be attributed to the amazing outcome of the first Danish referendum in spring 1992. President Delors' plans to produce "a political, intellectual, and institutional shock" with his report on the impact of the EU enlargement were quickly consigned to oblivion. Nobody needed a shock. So instead, Great Britain got all the support for recommending that enlargement negotiations should begin as soon as possible, without first discussing the institutional adjustments. London feels that the larger the Union, the more noncommittal the cooperation. The remarkable thing is that Great Britain is now provoking an institutional discussion through demanding more decisionmaking weight as a large member state, and thus is threatening to block the enlargement. This is precisely the reason why Germany is keeping its powder dry and wants to wait until the intergovernmental conference in 1996 before tabling its claim for more weight in the European Council of Ministers. Bonn first wants to ensure that the enlargement is secure, and then lean back and advance the thesis that 10 votes for 80 million inhabitants is not very much, compared to the 10 votes which, say, France and England, each have for around 58 million inhabitants in their countries. Pangalos -- the man who made the wrong decision - still has the task of finding a way out of the impasse next week, with the help, of course, of the always obliging Kinkel.
