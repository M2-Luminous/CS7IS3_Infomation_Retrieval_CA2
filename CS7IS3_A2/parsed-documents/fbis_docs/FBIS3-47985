In a fourth working-level meeting, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency Wednesday urged North Korea to submit to all inspections as stipulated by the nuclear safeguards pact and explained why they are required. After the meeting, IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that although North Korea had agreed on many items of inspection that the IAEA had proposed in a meeting Monday, it still balked at a considerable number of items. The IAEA told North Korea clearly that it would push through the items it refused to accept, he added. In order for the inspections to be meaningful, North Korea has to meet the detailed and reasonable inspection requirements of the IAEA, he stressed. The position of the IAEA is that unless North Korea agrees on all the inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites under the nuclear safeguards regime, the IAEA will not send an inspection team to North Korea, and this position has been clearly conveyed to Pyongyang, he said. The IAEA hopes that North Korea will accept the inspections of its declared nuclear sites as requested, Meyer said. Commenting on inspections of two undeclared sites in Yongbyon that are suspected of being nuclear waste processing facilities, he said access to these facilities for additional information would be dealt with separately. The IAEA and North Korea will have another working-level meeting in Vienna next week, an IAEA source said. North Korea has agreed, in principle, on inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites but refused to accept some inspection items at two problem sites, a radiochemical laboratory and a five-megawatt reactor, such as examination of chemical substances used there, other sources said.
