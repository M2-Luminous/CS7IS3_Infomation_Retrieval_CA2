The town will aim at upgrading old industries and old enterprises, the sources said. In the locality, there are now 17 large and medium-sized state- owned enterprises, two large joint electronics ventures and several scientific institutes, employing a total 44,000 people. A survey of ten major electronics enterprises in the locality shows that they lost 313,000 yuan in 1992, while in 1988 they made profits totalling 29.84 million yuan. According to a plan approved in March this year, enterprises in the locality will be transformed into joint ventures, shareholding companies and conglomerates, to help improve their management and market performance. Besides electronics development and manufacture, the town will also house trading, banking, real estate, information and other industries. According to the sources, the city government will extend special policies to support the new town. For example, the part of taxes from enterprises within the town that goes to the city coffers will be refunded to them as encouragement for technical upgrading. By the year 2000, the authorities expect, the town will reach 10 billion yuan in industrial sales and five billion yuan in trade and services a year.
