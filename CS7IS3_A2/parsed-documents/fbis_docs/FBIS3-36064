[Begin recording] [Nesirov] Each state must defend its own borders, and borders should be defended by the border guards of a given state. We must defend our borders with our own border guards. We will undoubtedly achieve this. [Ochaghly] Talks are being held on this subject. Are you taking part in these talks? [Nesirov] The commander of the Russian border guards wanted us to defend the borders jointly. That is, Azerbaijan's border with Iran. We said at that time, and even earlier, and during the talks with Lieutenant-General (Mikhalayov) in Baku that we ourselves will defend our own borders. It will not be correct if we allow the Russian border guards to defend Azerbaijan's border with Iran jointly with us. It will mean the loss of sovereignty. We have a sovereign state and border guards. We must defend our own borders with our own border guards. Undoubtedly we will achieve this. [end recording]
