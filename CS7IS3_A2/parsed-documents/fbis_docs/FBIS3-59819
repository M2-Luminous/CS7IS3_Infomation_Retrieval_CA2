Hardships harden people and hone their abilities to confront challenges. Our country has gone through a difficult experience that gave rise to other experiences. Some of those experiences have been beneficial and others may be written off as negatives. Cooperatives have been one such experience. The cooperative movement was launched in Iraq with the promulgation of Cooperatives Law No. 22 of 2/7/1922. The first consumer cooperative was founded in 1937 in Baghdad's al-Za'franiyah district. Cooperatives Law No. 202 of 1970 was promulgated by the glorious 17-30 July revolution to define the parameters of cooperative action. Cooperatives have continued to proliferate and their number grew to 203 by 10/6/1991. Did those cooperatives live up to their raison d'etre by helping citizens endure the infamous economic boycott imposed upon our steadfast country? Or were they a merely a means for lining the pockets of certain individuals who infiltrated that vital sector with commercial agendas designed to serve their personal interests? The proponents and opponents of the cooperative sector have been debated that question back and forth. There are even those who accuse that sector of failing to achieve the well-publicized economic objectives that prompted its creation. To ascertain the workings of that sector and the problems and difficulties that beset it, causing many citizens to express dissatisfaction with cooperative organizations and their activities, AL-'IRAQ interviewed those charged with responsibility for that sector whose motto is: "Serving Citizens Is Our Objective, The Prosperity of Society Is Our Goal, and Breaking the Unjust Siege Is Our Quest." We interviewed Mr. Shakir Mahmud al-Mashhadani for this comprehensive discourse, which is not devoid of frankness. [Tarrad] The federation has existed for sometime now and has enjoyed the support and patronage of the [country's] leadership. Has it realized the aspirations of the revolution and the patriotic objectives with which it is charged? [al-Mashhadani] Yes, were the country living under conditions of normalcy. We will not, however, use the siege as an excuse for not achieving programs and objectives in their ambitious forms. We point out, however, that this sector deals directly with the public, be it in the fields of consumption, service, production, or housing. As such, we face many obstacles. It is common knowledge that cooperative sector purchases for consumption can only be of products available in domestic markets, of whatever else we can buy on commercial markets, and of other essentials supplied by the Ministry of Trade such as sugar, rice, and small quantities of tallow. Our sector has no recourse but to sell at government-set prices and can not deviate from them whereas goods available on commercial markets are governed by factors that run contrary to government-fixed pricing. Our outlets therefore have little to offer and we can't meet the needs even of one-half of cooperative members. [Tarrad] How do you plan to deal with that situation? The siege is a fact of life. Are you going to deal with it sitting on your hands when the citizenry expects you to supply its needs? [al-Mashhadani] Indeed we have strategies and have begun the search for alternative sources of basic goods in order to supply members enrolled in the cooperative sector. Merchants are the only problem we now face since they control the market. If only they would cooperate with us we would be able to maintain stability. They should be content with a reasonable profit on their transactions with us. We believe that this is a difficult equation that be achieved only through the efforts of the good and honorable sons of our beloved fatherland. [Tarrad] A vast network of cooperatives has sprung up throughout the country but the federation's efficacy and its oversight function are nowhere to be seen? [al-Mashhadani] This is a valid indictment. We have established representative offices of the cooperative movement in all the governorates and have bolstered the efficacy of internal oversight to keep pace with the proliferation of cooperatives. We also conduct unannounced inspections, especially of new cooperatives, and we allow people's groups supervisory roles when distributing building supplies and other subsidized essential goods. [Tarrad] Cooperatives are charged with negligence in assuring the needs of their members, that their boards appropriate their offerings, and that their employees undermine the [cooperative] movement by their belligerency towards member-shoppers. [al-Mashhadani] There may be some truth to that. We, as a federation, issue direct guidelines as well as circulars to convey the instructions given by the leader President Saddam Husayn, may God keep him and nurture him, when he honored the cooperative movement with an audience. He impressed upon us the importance of treating citizens with dignity and justice. We consider that an order to be obeyed and have circulated [that directive] to all our cooperatives and conveyed it to them in face-to-face meetings. We take immediate and direct action against those cooperatives that do not rise to that directive. [In that,] we depend not only on written reports but also on those that are phoned in and that we immediately investigate. We are delighted that all the reports and complaints we received had merit and that prompt and immediate remedial action was taken. [Tarrad] Would you cite an example? [al-Mashhadani] A lady contacted me personally to inform me that the chairman of one cooperative and its secretary-general obtained a refrigerator and a freezer without benefit of lottery. We investigated the matter and took appropriate action against those individuals. I would like to mention something positive for the record. Our citizens have reached such a state of understanding that they report all the aberrations that they witness. [Tarrad] Many members are discouraged from shopping at their cooperatives because of their distant locations and because there are no established shopping hours. Consequently, those who live in their vicinity get the lion's share and those who are not get nothing. [al-Mashhadani] Our objective in the cooperative movement is to achieve justice. As far as cooperative are concerned, we have two types of cooperatives: professional and geographic. For example, al-Zawra' consumer cooperative whose membership is composed of journalists, has to dedicate one shopping day for employees of AL-'IRAQ and another for employees of AL-THAWRAH. The same holds true for the cooperatives of physicians, engineers, etc. Geographic cooperatives are meant for retirees who are not issued central market cards and who do not belong to professional cooperatives. I would like to point out here that those with central market cards are not allowed membership in federation cooperatives. We are serious about this rule and violators will face the consequences. We hope to raise the awareness of those individuals because this is the only way to ward off violations. Frankly, violating that rule effectively means stealing somebody else's rights. We will be deferring to the findings of a member's precinct and of the People's Council. The federation shall continue to be on top of that. [Tarrad] What action do you take against those [violators]? [al-Mashhadani] We have instructed the Oversight and Inspection Organization to make unscheduled inspections of cooperative society books. Those found in violation would be dropped from membership and their precincts notified. I would like to point out that cooperative chairmen and secretaries-general are directly accountable to us for such incidents. We have indeed found a number of cooperatives to be in violation and have, as a result, dismissed their boards and merged them with other cooperatives or turned them into cooperative markets for other cooperatives whose boards function properly in a manner consistent with our primary objective of service to citizens. [Tarrad] Do you have a specific strategy to develop cooperative action and to keep out opportunists? [al-Mashhadani] This is both very difficult and easy at the same time. The secret lies in how aware cooperative general assembly members are. General assemblies have to elect honest and competent members and this is our only guarantee against opportunists who manage to infiltrate cooperatives as they proliferate. We are serious about holding conferences to renew confidence in members of administrative assemblies. [Tarrad] What happened to the year-end statements of cooperatives and why haven't the members received their share of the profits? [al-Mashhadani] I am the one to answer to this. Professional federations and all service cooperatives have forwarded their statements with the exception of three societies in the production sector and the books of the latter are already in the hands of [the accountants]. It was impressed upon those cooperatives that unless their statements are completed within two months their boards would be dismissed and their managers held to task. [Tarrad] What are the activities of the professional housing cooperative federation. Does it have strategies for dealing with the economic problems that burden the citizenry? [al-Mashhadani] We follow the leader's directives on the housing sector in that its function should not be limited to the distribution of building lots. This can be handled by the state. The housing sector has therefore begun to prepare studies on low-cost housing in coordination with architects and specialists. We received studies and models from several sources and have begun looking into these models. Cost accounting, however, showed that they are very costly and we are therefore proceeding slowly for the time being in view of the onerous siege. We have distributed several building lots in the governorates and are obliging citizens to build on them in conformity with the award-winning prototypes models made available by the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction. [Tarrad] And the service cooperative federation--what is its purpose and has it won the satisfaction of those whom it serves? [al-Mashhadani] The function of that federation is to provide services to the inhabitants of housing complexes and to offer household services through equipment repair and mass transportation cooperatives. This year, it is transporting the employees of 13 ministries on 1034 busses of which 758 are currently in operation, 145 in need of major repairs, and 131 in need of minor repairs. We have been able to resurrect some busses that were completely broken down. We are grateful to the Ministry of Industry for supplying 300 batteries and we anticipate the delivery of tires for those busses. As to services for housing complexes, the competent federation responsible for 12 such complexes in Baghdad and in the governorates, has its problems. Those are not easy and they relate primarily to subsidized transit fares which fall short of providing permanency and sustainability. We are optimistic about the future, though. [Tarrad] What pragmatic working plans does the federation have for supplying future citizen needs? [al-Mashhadani] We have ambitious plans and programs and it is our hope that the cooperative sector would attract aware and educated elements that would help bolster its relations with other populist organizations in the effort to achieve our primary objective of securing for citizens a better quality of life.
