FBIS4-51621 "dreas084_d_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 South Korea DPRK Peace Treaty Proposal to U.S Viewed DPRK Peace Treaty Proposal to U.S Viewed SK0105055094 SK0105055094 BFN [Editorial Report] Three Seoul vernacular newspapers on 30 April carry editorials and reports on North Korea's proposal to replace the armistice agreement with a peace treaty with the United States. The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The Pitfall of a Peace Treaty." Referring to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea as North Korea's main goal in nuclear negotiations with the United States, the editorial says, "the North Korean Foreign Ministry proposed to the United States that it would hold talks to discuss the replacement of an armistice agreement with a peace treaty." The editorial adds, "North Korea shows its move to actually link the peace treaty with the settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue," referring to remarks made by a high-level North Korean diplomat at his new conference regarding replacing the armistice agreement with a peace treaty to solve the nuclear issue. Noting the U.S. Government's refusal of North Korea's proposal the editorial says, "it is, however, questionable whether the United States will continue to hold its present position in case North Korea concretely proposes to sign the peace treaty, while promising to resolve the nuclear issue." Referring to the background of North Korea's nuclear development, the editorial says, "North Korean politicians are likely to believe that nuclear weapons can be an economical and effective means to guarantee their security, and that their possession of nuclear weapons can delay U.S. intervention in the case of an emergency situation on the Korean peninsula or, ultimately, promote the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea." Referring to the U.S. forces in South Korea as the main obstacle to North Korea's strategy for national reunification, the editorial says that in the next round of U.S.-North Korean, North Korea will more persistently push ahead with its strategy to replace the armistice agreement with a peace treaty. The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO on page 5 carries a 1,000-word article by reporters Kang Yong-chin and Yu Yong-ku entitled "Progress in North-South Relations Is the Key To Resolve the North Korean Nuclear Issue." Referring to the U.S. Government's new proposal to North Korea at the recent U.S.-North Korean working-level contacts in New York, the report says, "this indicates that North-South dialogue should be simultaneously carried out with the third round of U.S.- North Korean high-level talks in order to resolve the nuclear issue." Noting the contents of the U.S. Government's new proposals indicating that it will decide on the suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise only if progress has been made in North- South dialogue, the report says the United States seems to believe that the North Korean nuclear issue cannot be ultimately resolved if no progress has been made in North-South dialogue. Referring to the U.S. Government's "emphasis" on North-South dialogue in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and to North Korea's proposal to replace the armistice agreement with a peace treaty, the report says, "there is a difference between the two countries' proposals: That is, North Korea has put forward an additional proposal, which has nothing to do with the settlement of the nuclear issue, while the United States has concentrated every effort to resolving the issue." Referring to the possibility that the U.S. Government will improve relations with North Korea to resolve the nuclear issue and to North Korea's using the nuclear issue card as leverage to maintain its system and to promote its economy, the report says, "it is, therefore, possible that such proposals by the U.S. Government may create a more complicated situation in resolving the nuclear issue." The moderate HANGUK ILBO on page 2 carries a 200-word report entitled "The United States Has Expressed a Negative Attitude Toward North Korea's Proposal for the Replacement of the Armistice Agreement With a Peace Treaty." Referring to the U.S. Government's negative position on the North Korean proposal, the report says (Christine Shelly), vice spokeswoman of the U.S. Department of State, said that the armistice agreement is still in effect and that the U.S. is not aware of any moves concerning North Korean military deployment and that in dialogue with North Korea, the U.S. has "clearly taken necessary steps to hold the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks." The report concludes, "the spokeswoman stressed that she does not believe that there is any direct relation between the armistice agreement and the North Korean nuclear issue."
