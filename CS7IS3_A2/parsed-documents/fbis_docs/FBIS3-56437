This afternoon did you see the prime minister? [Gaydar] No, I did not see the prime minister today. [Dorenko] You did not have any telephone conversations with either the president or the prime minister -- no contacts? [Gaydar] No. Today I did not speak either with the prime minister or the president, and there is nothing surprising in this because after all the matter had been decided earlier. Indeed, on Sunday the fact of my resignation, my statement on my resignation was just made public but I had already had a talk with the president on Thursday, and overall the main question was decided then. [Dorenko] Did the premier and president try to dissuade you from resigning? [Gaydar] No, the president regarded my position with understanding. [Dorenko] Naturally, and Kozyrev's visit? [Gaydar] Andrey is an innate diplomat; he always tries his utmost to find a point of contact. [passage omitted] [Dorenko] Will the communists be able to force Chernomyrdin to change his policy, do you think he might perhaps willingly do that himself? [Gaydar] I do not think the communists will manage to force Chernomyrdin to change his policy, and I do not think Viktor Stepanovich will himself want to radically change course. It is another matter that politics consists of pretty difficult decisions that are being taken every day. [Dorenko] But he is already under pressure, pressure from the communists in the Duma. And if we were to talk of a coalition government, then there would be the Party of Russian Unity and Accord -- Shokhin -- and many from Russia's Choice and Zaveryukha from the Communists and the Agrarians. If you are going now, and Zyuganov is not satisfied with the policy of Chernomyrdin and the remaining Russia's Choice people, he may find himself under double pressure from Russia's Choice and the Communists, may he not? [Gaydar] In the first place, in realistic terms, following the adoption of the new constitution, the government's independence is substantially greater than it was in 1992-93. Therefore, I would say that today it is not a matter of political pressure from one or another group, but rather of pressure of circumstances, pressure from branches of industry, from major complexes and enterprises, which of course would not want to part with their subsidies, would not want to restructure production, would of course want their problems to be resolved through new inflationary taxes, at the taxpayer's expense. [Dorenko] How soon do you reckon your party comrades in Russia's Choice will quit the government, or how soon will they be forced out? [Gaydar] Well, that is a hypothetical question, almost a conjectural one. I reckon that in many aspects, where the policy being conducted by the government merits support, our colleagues can and must work. I would mention here international affairs, and in general the privatization policy which one would wish to sustain. [Dorenko] Is that because they are approved by and directly supervised by the presidential staff, or because ...- [Gaydar, interrupting] I would even say that it is not the presidential staff but simply the president. In Russia it was traditional for international affairs to be outside the competence of the Cabinet of Ministers, however this was composed, and this has been the case recently, too. This is primarily the president's sphere, and he determines things. [Dorenko] So Russia's foreign policy will, to judge from all indications, remain as before, and the minister of foreign relations, the minister of foreign affairs, will stay. [passage omitted] Boris Fedorov, it is reported, was today offered the post only of minister of finance and not vice premier, that is, he may not replace you in your post. At the same time he evidently put forward some requirements, and the Council of Ministers session has been put off to tomorrow. What do you think, what are the requirements in which your party comrade will stay? [Gaydar] I think they will be quite simple and impersonal: sufficient control of monetary and credit policy if everyone believes anyway that he is responsible for it. [Dorenko] Organizationally speaking, does that mean control of Gosbank? [Gaydar] As to organization, it primarily means effective interaction with the Central Bank. [Dorenko] To what extent is Chernomyrdin ready to support Fedorov today? [Gaydar] That is a question for Viktor Stepanovich. [Dorenko] You know the atmosphere in the government. Who is closer to Chernomyrdin, Gerashchenko or Fedorov with his demands as regards economic policy? [Gaydar] Viktor Stepanovich would, I think, like to keep both. [Dorenko] Both. And both directions of policy. [Gaydar] And both directions of policy. [Dorenko] Is that in order to set them against each other or ... [Gaydar, interrupting] Simply because to a certain extent this is in keeping with his approach to the conduct of economic policy. [Dorenko] The leak of information which we have that Skokov may be made vice premier; is it likely? [Gaydar] I would not rule out such a possibility, although it seems to me unlikely. [Dorenko] I see. To all appearances there is another option for the development of events in which there remains just Oleg Soskovets as vice premier. In that case the whole scheme of the government changes, and would that, in your view, resolve the crisis? [Gaydar] You see, the economic crisis cannot be resolved by a redistribution of portfolios. It is being resolved by change or continuation of policy. Concentration of attention on redistribution of portfolios greatly personalizes what is happening. In my view it is much more important how many and what kind of expenditure decisions are made by the government in the course of the next two weeks than the question of who is in what office. [Dorenko] I also wanted to ask a question about your party. Now you are heading the faction in the Duma and your first deputy Gennadiy Burbulis has already twice -- or at least once -- declared this and twice tried to organize a presidential party. Will you attempt to set up a party or structure your faction in an attempt to create a presidential party? [Gaydar] In the first place, the development of events, including the development of events as manifested in the elections on 12 December, fully and obviously indicate the need for the establishment of an effective structure supporting democracy and reforms in Russia. That is obvious. How is this task to be embarked on? How is it to be done? How is it to be made non-sectarian? That still has to be tackled and ways have to be found of doing it. [Dorenko] And you will head this government? [Gaydar] You know, this is again much less a question of personality than of content. This organization, largely from an historical point of view, now has two tasks: To prevent military ventures which we are now being nudged towards, and to prevent a fresh division of property with its accompanying huge social cataclysms. The movement, the party, the public force which makes this its tasks merits, in my view, the most serious support. [Dorenko] Thank you, Yegor Timurovich.
