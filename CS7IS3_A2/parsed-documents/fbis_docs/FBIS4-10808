During a news conference, the leaders of the organization indicated that they are more than willing to continue the dialogue. They also reported the existence of provocateurs who have met with the Civilian Society Bureau [Mesa de la Sociedad Civil] installed in Mexico City's Zocalo District to create problems and thereby justify any aggression against the peasants and Indians who are awaiting a reply from the government. Genaro Dominguez, adviser to the National Coordinating Board of United Indian People (CNPI), said, "Those of us here have been angered by this situation, and yet no one will force us into any provocation that would justify aggression against the Indians and peasants." Earlier, peasant leaders disclosed that today at 1200 they would head to the Chamber of Deputies to present several proposals aimed at reforming Article 27 of the Constitution. They insisted that the camp they have erected in Zocalo will remain there. They also indicated that they plan to wait until Government Secretary Carpizo announces when panels will be formed to discuss problems reported by the various peasant organizations. Meanwhile, Francisco Jimenez Pablo, representative of the Chiapas State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC), denied that property seizures are being organized by ranchers and landowners themselves. He insisted that this is just a rumor being spread by the state government "as an excuse not to resolve the land problem."
