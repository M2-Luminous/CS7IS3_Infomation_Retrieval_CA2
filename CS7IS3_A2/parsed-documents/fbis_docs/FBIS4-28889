In countries where socialism has been frustrated due to the antirevolutionary maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries, and where national sovereignties have been infringed upon, the popular masses are hovering between life and death, and the destinies of the countries and the nations are being miserably trampled upon. Solving the question of the destiny of the popular masses, the country, and the nation is one of the historic tasks of the progressive people shrewdly presented by the last decade of the 20th century. The significant question put forth by the current times has been most brilliantly solved in our country in which the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is being upheld high at the top of the party and revolution. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Our people are singing the song "Without Comrade Kim Chong-il, the Fatherland Does Not Exist." I like the song. As the song's lyrics state: Without Comrade Kim Chong-il, you comrades and the socialist fatherland do not exist. It is his destiny, as well as the destiny of you comrades and the fatherland. The great leader [widaehan suryong] of the working class is the one who plays the decisive role of pioneering the destiny of the people, the country, and the nation. The destiny of the people, the country, and the nation is pioneered, protected, and brilliantly elucidated by the leader [suryong]. The great leader of the working class analyzes and integrates the independent demands and interests of the popular masses to found the guidance ideology of revolution and leads the activities of the popular masses to elevate the ideology in a unified manner. He makes the popular masses into a self-defending main force of history and revolution by making them conscious and organized, and enables them to pioneer a bright future for themselves, their descendants, the fatherland and nation as the true masters of their destinies. The fact that the destiny of the people and the fatherland is brilliantly pioneered and blossomed only under the wise leadership of the leader [suryong] is a lofty truth proven by our revolutionary practices. Our people have become the proudest and most dignified people by upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song at the fore of revolution. Our fatherland is shining brilliantly in the whole world as a strong independent, self-reliant, and self-defending socialist country. The struggle to pioneer and elucidate the destiny of the people, the country, and the nation is a long-term struggle to be continued generation after generation. To win or lose the historic struggle depends on whether or not the leader [suryong], who first pioneered the revolutionary road, and the people's true leader [chidoja], who is endlessly loyal to the cause, are upheld at the top of the party and revolution. To the people, the greatest misfortune is having a wrong leader [chidoja], and the greatest fortune is having the leadership of a wise leader [suryong]. Shouldering the destiny of the fatherland and the nation all by himself, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader [widaehan yongdoja] who leads to victory the chuche revolutionary cause pioneered by the respected and beloved leader [suryong], and a benevolent father [chaaeroun oboi] who devotes his everything for the people. Thanks to the dear comrade leader, our people have a rewarding life today and a promising future tomorrow, as well as the glory and bright future of chuche-based Korea. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a genius of ideological theory who plainly enlightens the road of elucidating the destiny of our people and fatherland with extraordinary wisdom. The destiny of the people, the country, and the nation can only be pioneered and elucidated by a correct ideological theory. As a boat without a compass cannot correctly sail to its destination, the destiny of the people, the country, and the nation cannot be successfully pioneered without the guidance of a revolutionary ideological theory. The only guidance for pioneering the destiny of the popular masses is the immortal chuche idea. Chuche idea, which is based on the philosophical principle that the master of one's destiny is oneself, and the power of pioneering one's destiny also lies in oneself, elucidates the most correct road for pioneering the destiny of the people, the country, and the nation. The dear comrade leader has formalized the respected and beloved leader's revolutionary ideology into an integrated system of chuche-based ideology, theory, and methods, and further deepened and developed the chuche idea in conformity with the demands of the current times and the development of revolution. Developing and completing the great revolutionary theory of pioneering and elucidating the destiny of the popular masses by further enriching the chuche idea with new theories and contents, and deepening the idea on a full scope is the dear comrade leader's immortal historic achievement accumulated during pioneering and elucidating the destiny of the people, the country, and the nation. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great leader [widaehan yongdoja] who leads the struggle to elucidate the destiny of our people and fatherland to victory. The struggle to pioneer and elucidate the destiny of the people, the country, and the nation is propelled by the spontaneous function and role of the main force of revolution. The main force of revolution, which is a united body of the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses, is the decisive force and the one directly in charge of pioneering the destiny of the people, the country, and the nation. Therefore, the leadership of the people's leader [chidoja] is significantly reflected by the way he gathers the main force of revolution and the way he enhances its role. The leadership of the dear comrade leader, who leads the struggle to elucidate the destiny of our people and fatherland to victory, is wise because throughout the times, he has strengthened the main force of revolution and taken the question of enhancing the role of the main force as the fundamental task. The dear comrade leader has strengthened and developed our party into an invincible and ever-victorious chuche-type revolutionary party, and firmly consolidated all the people around the party, thus making them into a powerful force of our revolution. He has also extraordinarily enhanced the role of the main force of our revolution by tightly combining the leadership of the party with the line of revolutionary masses and giving precedence to the human reform work and political work. Because the party and the popular masses have firmly united as one to become the main force of revolution and the role of the main force has been enhanced, the great historic transformation of nature and society has been achieved, the dignity and honor of our fatherland and people have been proudly displayed, and our people's destiny has become more brilliant. This is another special historic achievement of the dear comrade leader for our party and revolution. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a benevolent father [chaaeroun oboi] who endlessly cares about and loves the people, and devotes his everything for the people. The destiny of the people, the country, and the nation can only be blossomed in the bosom of a leader [yongdoja] who possesses the extraordinary wisdom of ideological theory and outstanding leadership, as well as an endlessly lofty virtue. A lofty virtue of the people's leader [chidoja] eliminates the slightest shadow from the work and life of every member of society. It is also a fountain enabling the people to absolutely trust and follow the leader [yongdoja], wholly entrust their destiny to the bosom of the leader [yongdoja], and lead a rewarding life. The dear comrade leader bears the highest loyalty toward the great leader, embraces revolutionary comrades and people of all walks of life in his benevolent bosom, and warmly takes care of their work and life. Thanks to the great labor and warm love of the dear comrade leader, who always involves himself with the people, shares joy and sorrow with them, and generously gives away everything for the people's happiness, the destiny of our people and fatherland is shining more brilliantly today. That is why all our people are upholding the dear comrade leader as the benevolent father and wholly entrusting their destinies and future to the comrade leader. Indeed, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the symbol of victory of our fatherland and nation, and happiness and brilliant future of all our people. Upholding the dear comrade leader, who is matchless in terms of ideological and theoretical wisdom, leadership, and virtue and who is the great man of great men, is a rare fortune of our people and honor of the generation. The future of our people and the socialist fatherland is even brighter upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is our destiny and the destiny of chuche-based socialist fatherland, high at the top of the party and revolution.
