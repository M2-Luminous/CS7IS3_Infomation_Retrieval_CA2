We are playing a bad trick with our indecisiveness. First, our neighbors the Serbs will always remember that we were against them to the very end. Greece, Romania, Hungary, and Ukraine will insist on lifting the embargo and will not be thrilled by the fact that we did not support them. Second, would the United Nations believe our cries regarding the billions of dollars we are losing from the embargo? It is logical for a state whose economy is being destroyed by the sanctions to fight by all means for lifting them. It appears that we can simultaneously be on bad terms with our neighbors and not be compensated for our losses. So, what is the benefit of our twisted internationalism?
