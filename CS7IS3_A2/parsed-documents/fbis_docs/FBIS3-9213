Officials within the Ministry of Privatization and the Ministry of Trade and Industry admit there has been poor communication and a lack of coordination over the future of energy regulations and management. Milan Cerny, deputy energy minister at the Ministry of Trade and Industry, admitted that misunderstandings have arisen between the ministries. Jan Maixner, a director at the Ministry of Privatization, said his ministry should have been better prepared for the energy privatization process. "If you take your time and you think about it [privatization], you lose that time and you're screwed. We thought it was better to move fast. If you do it fast, you might make some mistakes," said Maixner, saying he was speaking from a "philosophical" point of view. "Maybe we should have privatized energy within one wave." At the center of the dispute is future access to the republic's energy transmission grid. The network transmits energy from the source to eight distribution centers. At present, the utility giant CEZ, which was privatized during the first wave and is now 70 percent controlled by the National Property Fund (FNM), has a monopoly. Meanwhile, officials within the FNM and the Ministry of Privatization want to open the energy market to foreign competition, thus granting access to the transmission network. Distribution centers, to be privatized during the second wave, would then be able to purchase power from the cheapest utility. But there is little agreement among CEZ officials, the government or the distribution centers as to the effect the open network will have on energy service. "We are convinced that if the whole transmission system is separated from CEZ, it will be more expensive for everybody, especially for the customer at the end of the chain," said spokesman Miroslav Novak. The utility will have to act as an energy guarantor for foreign energy producers wishing to use the network, Novak said. Costs will increase because CEZ will be on continual standby in the event of an emergency. As a result, consumers can anticipate an estimated 30 percent increase in their energy bill, he said. Without a transmission monopoly, CEZ will also be less attractive to foreign investors, he said. Worst of all, there are no regulations concerning foreign energy sources--energy legislation is still under debate and is not expected to be passed by parliament until later this year. The current law makes no mention of foreign competition, Novak said. "There have to be certain rules for everybody. It is impossible for CEZ to compete with everybody," Novak said. The FNM, however, has offered some relief, he said. The fund has guaranteed the transmission network will stay under CEZ's control for the next three to four years. But the Ministry of Privatization disputes the results of the transmission separation and CEZ's time frame. "The transmission network should be taken out of [CEZ's hands] and it should be accessible to all countries entering the energy market," said Maixner, adding that the FNM will first sell off its 70 percent share in the utility and then separate the transmission network, perhaps as soon as 1996. Only then will regulations regarding foreign energy use be finalized, he said. When told that CEZ believes energy costs will rise if it loses its monopoly. Maixner said: "Why? They will all be paying less. If the distribution companies are independent and foreign capital is in the companies, it should lead to lower prices for energy." But the head of the Prazska Energetika distribution company, which supplies Prague's electricity and buys most of its energy from CEZ, isn't sure costs will fall. "[Factories and industry] will have cheaper electricity, but it's difficult to ensure the same for the small customers," said Prazska Energetika Director Milan Kanda. Prazska Energetika, along with its seven Czech counterparts, is busy courting foreign investors. Twenty percent of each center will be up for sale to a foreign energy concern later this year; another 15 percent will be sold to voucher holders during the second wave of privatization. The majority of the remaining 65 percent will be controlled by the FNM and local municipalities. CEZ will have no choice but to compete as best it can in a free market, said Deputy Minister Cerny. "I hope they will play it very clever and set some long-term pricing contracts with their distributors," he said. But what role the government, and specifically which ministry, would take in running the distribution centers was less clear. "It is a problem of the whole energy plan," said Cerny. "We need to collaborate with the FNM to try to find some managers for these companies." Revenues generated from the sale of the distribution centers will be under the control of the FNM, he said. The Ministry of Trade and Industry preferred to put the money back into energy services, he said. Meanwhile, foreign companies that want to invest in Czech energy--either in a distribution center or by linking up with the transmission network--must do so before the new energy law is passed or regulations are put into place. "Investors will have to take a risk," Cerny said.
