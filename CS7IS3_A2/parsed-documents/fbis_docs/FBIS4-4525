Security Council OW0304134294 Tokyo KYODO in English 1318 GMT 3 Apr 94 OW0304134294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 3 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and his South Korean counterpart Han Sung-chu agreed Sunday that China has a vital role in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, Foreign Ministry officials said. Hata and Han commended the U.N. Security Council for leading China to back its statement urging North Korea to accept unimpeded inspections of its nuclear facilities, the officials said. The foreign ministers gave "positive appraisal" to the statement adopted unanimously on Thursday by the 15 member states of the U.N. Security Council, they said. The statement of Security Council President Jean-Bernard Merimee of France was adopted after the United States dropped its bid to have the Security Council adopt a binding resolution. It urged North Korea to allow International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to complete an uncontrolled check of its nuclear facilities, while expressing concern that an IAEA team was barred from inspecting a radiochemical laboratory earlier this month. After the Security Council members agreed to comply with Chinese demands to eliminate any language about sanctions, China, North Korea's traditional ally, agreed to endorse the mildly-worded, nonbinding statement. The two foreign ministers confirmed their intention to monitor how the North will respond to the Security Council's demand to have it accept unhampered inspections within a month, the officials said. Han will hold talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday before flying back to Seoul from a three-country trip to help solve the nuclear proliferation issue, they said. Before flying to Tokyo, Han sought cooperation from both the U.S. and China.
