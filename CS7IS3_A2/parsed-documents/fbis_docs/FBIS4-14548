This decision was prompted by the proceedings on the purchase of arms for the National Defense Ministry from Russia instituted by the Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office. With the investigation underway, searches were carried out at the apartments of former Defense Minister Audrius Butkevicius and other top ministry officials. Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas National Security Committee, has stated at a press conference that as long as the ministries themselves engage in arms purchases, corruption will not be prevented. The National Security Committee is working on a draft law under which relevant offices will be supplied with arms by a special institution -- the Lithuanian Arms Fund.
