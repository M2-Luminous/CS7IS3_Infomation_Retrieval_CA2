The discipline of property rights theory and law developed very rapidly in 1960's, forming various schools of thought in property rights as the Western nations attached great importance to it. Currently, although property rights theory has moved toward maturity and is widely used, theoretical circles in the West have yet to establish a unanimous, complete, and uniform standard for an exact concept of property rights. China began to practice the property rights concept in 1980's but our economic circles were similarly not totally unanimous on the concept and its understanding. In particular, the argument that property rights amounts to ownership created misunderstanding in property rights theory. Although there is not unanimity on the concept of property rights currently practiced in enterprise reform, the general opinion is that property rights is a concept derived from ownership. It is a legal form based on property ownership to reflect the rights, interests, and duties of principal investors regarding their property. Under normal circumstances, property rights are related to operating assets and the amount of capital injected by principal investors into enterprises. Once a principal investor has injected capital into an enterprise, he possesses the corresponding property rights of the enterprise by law, and becomes a principal owner of the enterprise's property rights. Property rights must consist of two fundamental functions. First, they must possess the power and function of profit sharing, or the profit function for short, that is, the right to share part of the profits realized through the application of property in business operations. The economic significance of property rights lies in profit-making. Of course, there are different ways to represent and realize profits for different types of property rights. For example, in property organizations under the shareholding system, the profit shareholders realize from their property rights is reflected in dividends, and the profit of corporations is reflected in the right to control the use of undivided profits (generally for re-investment) for upgrading corporations' earning capacity, thereby raising operating income, workers' wages, and other benefits, as well as accelerating corporations' development. Second, they must enjoy controlling power, that is, the principal to property rights shall not, within legal limits, be subjected to any interference in his right to control assets, particularly profits. The right to profit and right to control constitute complete property rights arising from the production and exchange of commodities. A principal is a principal of independent status to property rights only when he possesses these two powers simultaneously. Property rights and ownership are not one concept. Property ownership determines the ultimate ownership of things and shows a principal's right to the monopoly of such things. It possesses the characteristics of exclusiveness, origin, and comprehensiveness. The exclusiveness of ownership indicates that, by law, the ownership of things can only belong to one principal. Of course, this principal can be a natural or legal person. In market economy, major features of property rights are: 1. A principal of property rights possesses the characteristics of an economic entity, which generally has the following three characteristics: First, it must own a definite amount of assets for participating in social reproduction. The ultimate legal ownership of assets does not necessarily belong to the entity. Second, it must directly participate in society's reproduction activities. Third, it should possess its own independent economic interests, and its main goal of participating in society's profit-making economic activities is to produce the greatest possible benefit for itself. 2. The property rights movement is independent. The independence of the property rights movement means that once property rights are established, the principal may utilize the rights within legal limits to seek the greatest possible benefits for itself, and shall not be interfered with by other principals at will. A principal may possess many property rights, but a specially designated property right can belong to only one principal. 3. The property rights system is divisible. In a developed market economy, due to the development of a credit system, property value is separated from the value generated by its utilization. Different principals may exercise control over different forms of property so as to separate the ownership of unitary properties and allow them to be owned by different principals.
