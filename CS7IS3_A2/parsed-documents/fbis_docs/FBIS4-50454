Commenting on the recent sluggish performance of China's stock market, Guan Jinsheng, president of the Shanghai International Securities Co. Ltd (Sisco), said that it is only natural for the market to plummet after the share prices were sent through the roof. "China's stock market is so young that it fluctuates wildly," Guan said. At present, the share indexes at the Shanghai Stock Exchange dived below 620 points while those at the Shenzhen exchange dropped underneath the level of 170 points. This is in sharp contrast with the bullish mood a year ago. "The falling of the share indexes was inevitable," Guan said, citing China's macro-economic control measures as a reason. "Undoubtedly they have a certain bearing on the stumble -- the stock market always eases when interest rates are put up to dampen inflation -- it's a common scene all over the world, Guan added. [no closing quotation marks as received] But the stock market plunge mainly resulted from its intricate structural problems, Guan stressed. It is due to the fact that share-trading and share-offering are closely related to each other, he said. Yet in share-offering, their magnitudes are strictly controlled, only to neglect the quality of the listed companies and enterprises [as received], he said. He called on securities companies, which act as underwriters, to bear the responsibility and obligation to ensure the quality of their clients. Certified public accountancy firms should also help in this regard by carefully checking the re-evaluation of the assets and financial reports; and stock exchanges and supervisory organs should fend off any administrative interferences wherever they come from, he said. He also expressed concern over the dominating speculative attitude in the trading of stocks and pinned the blame on the flawed composition of investors. Now about eight million individual investors are pulling together efforts to prop up a market of nearly 300 billion yuan in market value -- it can only make sense after institutions and funds join in, he said. The stock market can hopefully keep stable only when 50-100 funds, each of which has billions yuan of assets, are involved to select shares and enterprises for long-term investment, he added. Guan became optimistic when talking about the future of China's stock market and predicted a period of substantive development in the coming few years. With the gradual perfection of its macro-economic control system, Guan said, China will be capable of avoiding vicious inflation and attaining rapid economic growth. "There is no reason to believe the prospects of the stock market -- a barometer of the economy -- are not bright," Guan said. He said the establishment of a modern enterprise system in China will give rise to new channels and instruments of financing and eventually the trade of property rights, which are bound to stimulate the development of the securities industry. Another contributing factor is the formation of a team of supervisory as well as operating personnel over the past few years since China began to embrace the stock market as a means of financing.
