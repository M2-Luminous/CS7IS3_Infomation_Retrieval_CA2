In his words, the situation will run out of control in the near future if the government, the federal employment service and the local authorities take no immediate measures to prevent large-scale unemployment. According to forecasts of specialists, the number of officially registered unemployed will reach three millions by the end of this year. The concealed unemployment that is currently estimated at approximately seven million will at least double. Unemployment has turned into a major problem of social services. It should be settled by joint efforts of the authorities, employment centers and trade unions, said Yarov. In his opinion, the state should allocate money for payment of dole from the federal budget to those regions and districts that are in critical condition. The state debt of regions with a high rate of unemployment should be paid fully and in the first turn.
