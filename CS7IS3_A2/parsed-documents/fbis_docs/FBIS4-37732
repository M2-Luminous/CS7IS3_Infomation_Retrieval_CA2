The Palestine Liberation Organization leader stressed the need to "continue efforts to reach a just solution that takes into account the interests of the Yemeni people," the Palestinian news agency WAFA reported. The Yemeni delegation, which also met with Tunisian parliamentary leaders and members of legal opposition groups, accused Saudi Arabia of supplying arms to southern forces, according to diplomatic forces. Civil war erupted in Yemen on May 5 in the midst of a political dispute between northern and southern leaders on the administration of the country. The south proclaimed itself a separate state on May 21. Southern representatives are also touring north Africa. A spokesman for the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic earlier Thursday appealed to the international community to "impose a ceasefire by force." The Tunisian government has expressed concern at the deteriorating situation in Yemen but has not taken sides in the conflict.
