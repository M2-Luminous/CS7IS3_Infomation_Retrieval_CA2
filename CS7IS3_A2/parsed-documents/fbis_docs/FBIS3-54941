Yavlinskiy's activity? -- a questionnaire from the All-Russia Center for the Study of Public Opinion enquires. One of the most widespread replies (34 percent) is: "I have some idea of him from newspapers and from television interviews." An equal number of those polled say that they know of Yavlinskiy only by hearsay, while approximately 23 percent claim not to be familiar with his name (what radio-less backwoods did they helicopter in the questionnaire leaflets to?). Five percent, however, have a good idea of Yavlinskiy's person, being familiar with his works and his political platform, and a further 4 percent know of the results of his activity in his state post. It is out of such motley fragments that Yavlinskiy's portrait takes shape. Although the smalt from which this mosaic portrait is made is of varying brilliance and quality, recently it has been attracting attention increasingly frequently. What is it that makes us stop stop to look at it in the midst of a busy schedule? Precisely 28 percent of those polled acknowledge Yavlinskiy's high level of education and intellect, 10 percent perceive boldness in his activity, 9 percent value his principledness, and the same percentage value his ability to talk with people (incidentally, 6 percent of those questioned believe that he expounds his thoughts in too complex a manner and that it is difficult for an untrained person to understand him). Yavlinskiy's positive image is supplemented by the 5 percent who emphasized his political wisdom, 4 percent noted as a virtue the fact that he is a practical person and an active politician, and 7 percent have felt his personal charm. But the portrait would be flat if it were without shadows: 3 percent of those who participated in creating the mosaic noticed in their model a political opportunism and even unscrupulousness, 2 percent noticed a superficiality, and 9 percent rebuke Yavlinskiy with being a pure theoretician and armchair scientist. And yet these dark stains do not overshadow the bright aspects in the image of the person sitting for his portrait. Proof of this is provided by the reply to an intriguing question in the questionnaire: If Yeltsin does not declare his candidacy in the presidential election and you have to choose between Yegor Gaydar and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, for example, for whom would you cast your vote? It turned out that 25 percent would prefer Yavlinskiy and 19 percent Gaydar. If there were a similar confrontation with Aleksandr Rutskoy, in the respondents' opinion Yavlinskiy would achieve a still more convincing victory (32 percent against 18 percent). One of the reasons for this success is that, according to 16 percent, he expresses the interests of the widest sections of the population. It is curious that 1 percent of those who replied to the questionnaire perceived Yavlinskiy as a stooge of the West, 2 percent, conversely, as a supporter of "the regime" and a champion of Great Russia, while a similar percentage consider him altogether a supporter of "socialism with a human face." But the majority (21 percent) agree that Yavlinskiy advocates democratic reforms but has serious disagreements with Yeltsin and the present government. In these disagreements the respondents frequently prefer Yavlinskiy. In the list of statesmen who hypothetically could improve the situation in our economy the majority (22 percent) prefer him, 17 percent prefer Gaydar, 7 percent Yeltsin, and 5 percent Shakhray. In this same category first place is allocated to Yavlinskiy when it is a question of the ability to ensure compliance with social justice. On looking at this portrait, the assembled people started sharing their impressions. The most enthusiastic (6 percent) said: "I would like him to become president." Cautious people (18 percent) put them right: "I believe that he should hold some other high state post." Others (19 percent) noted categorically: "He should work in the government or parliament, but under the leadership of a more influential politician." Others (35 percent) spoke out altogether definitely: "It is hard to say, as he has not yet shown his worth." Will there be any other opinions?
