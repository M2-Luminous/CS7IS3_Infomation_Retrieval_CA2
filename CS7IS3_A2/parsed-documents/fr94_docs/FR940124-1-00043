FR940124-1-00043 FR940124-1-00008 One alternative definition for prebaccalaureate vocational education that the Secretary is considering is ``undergraduate vocational education that leads to a certificate or other educational credential but not to a degree.'' The Secretary is considering this definition in order to ease the burden on institutions whose vocational education programs leading to an associate degree would also trigger special action under the proposed regulations. If this alternative definition were to be adopted, however, the Secretary is concerned that some institutions might try to stretch their non-degree programs into associate-degree programs simply to avoid the additional requirements that, as a result of these proposed regulations, accrediting agencies will have to impose on institutions that provide prebaccalaureate vocational education. The Secretary invites comments on the alternative definition of prebaccalaureate vocational education and suggestions for preventing unwarranted course or program stretching, should the alternative definition be adopted. The Secretary also wishes to know if commenters believe there are other risks associated with adopting the alternative definition that might outweigh any benefits derived by the degree-granting sector of the higher education community through its adoption. The Secretary acknowledges that the definition of ``vocational education'' in these proposed regulations differs from the definition of ``vocational program'' as that term is defined in the proposed regulations for the State Postsecondary Review Program (``an educational program below the baccalaureate degree level, that is not classified as a professional program, that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized profession''). The Secretary requests specific comment on whether the same definition should be used in both regulations and, if so, what that definition should be. Section 602.3␣Organization and Membership Section 496(a) of the HEA requires accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables the institutions they accredit to participate in programs authorized under the HEA to be administratively and financially separate from and independent of any related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization. The term ``separate and independent'' is defined in section 496(b) of the HEA. In §602.3 (a), (b), and (c) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary reiterates the statutory requirement and definition. During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, non-Federal negotiators expressed concern that the ``separate and independent'' requirement would prevent any joint use of personnel, services, equipment, or facilities by an accrediting agency and a related, associated, or affiliated trade association or membership organization, a practice that is fairly common among accrediting agencies and helps reduce the cost of accreditation. To address this concern, in §602.3(d) the Secretary proposes conditions that accrediting agencies must meet regarding the joint use of personnel, services, equipment, or facilities if that use is not to be considered a violation of the ``separate and independent'' requirement. The Secretary believes this approach respects the intent of Congress yet eases the financial burden on agencies to implement the new requirement. Section 496(a) of the HEA permits the Secretary to waive the ``separate and independent'' requirement if the agency is one that, for purposes of determining eligibility for SFA programs, either conducts accreditation through a voluntary membership organization of individuals participating in a profession or has as its principal purpose the accreditation of programs within institutions that are accredited by another agency recognized by the Secretary. In §602.3(e) of the proposed regulations, the Secretary proposes conditions under which the Secretary may waive the ``separate and independent'' requirement. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to grant an agency's request for a waiver if the agency demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the existing relationship between the agency and the trade association or membership organization has not compromised the independence of its accreditation process.
