Idiz: "Turkey and U.S. Tread a Delicate Path on Iraq"] [Text] Ankara--The firm U.S. stance on the U.N.-imposed embargo on Iraq, and Turkey's continuing insistence that the question of its losses resulting from that embargo be addressed, remain potential sources of friction between Ankara and Washington. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit last week to the Gulf, his article published in THE NEW YORK TIMES over the weekend, entitled "Rigid Iraq Merits No UN Mercy," as well as a statement by a U.S. State Department spokesman on Monday [2 May] on the subject, are all being interpreted in Ankara as open signals of disapproval of the policy Turkey is trying to develop over Iraq. Prime Minister Ciller on Tuesday denied recent press reports that Washington had given Turkey a "strongly worded" diplomatic note on the matter, and said that Ankara's efforts towards the lifting of the embargo on Iraq would continue. Ciller also said that Turkey had no intention of departing from the U.N. system on this issue. Hoping to avoid a serious fall-out with Washington over this matter, but still trying to ensure that Turkey's vital interests regarding the ongoing problem in Iraq are not overlooked, officials in Ankara have acknowledged that Turkey is currently treading a delicate course in terms of its relations with the United States. A sign of this was given by Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Ozdem Sanberk, when he told reporters on Monday that contacts with the United States on this subject were continuing. "The United States acknowledges the need to work together on this issue," Sanberk said, indicating that technical level talks were underway in Washington. "Turkey has overtaken everyone by taking the Iraq initiative in hand," he added, underlining that it would not let go of this initiative in the debate which will apparently continue. Sanberk's visit to Baghdad last month, the highest level visit from Turkey since the Gulf Crisis, had raised some eyebrows in Washington. Diplomatic sources say the visit increased the discomfort felt ever since Prime Minister Ciller started arguing last year that the embargo on Iraq should be eased. Upon his return to Amman from Baghdad, Sanberk remarked that the two countries had agreed to flush the pipeline running between them, within the context of a "limited rescue operation," in order to prevent the pipeline from being damaged. This statement was also met with displeasure. "We propose a limited rescue operation, whereby the pipeline will be flushed once or twice, repaired and closed, and then we will wait for the lifting of the embargo" Sanberk had said. Sanberk told reporters on Monday that Turkey's flushing of the pipeline did not require an application to the U.N. Sanctions Committee because Turkey would not export the oil and no funds would be transferred to Iraq as a result of this operation. But there have been suggestions emanating from officials in Ankara that of the 12 million barrels of oil in the pipeline, 3.8 billion belonged to Turkey, because Ankara was owed $2 billion by Iraq. Officials also suggested that a portion of the oil belonging to Iraq could be sold to meet the humanitarian needs of that country, without breaking the U.N. sanctions. However an article in THE WASHINGTON POST on Saturday quoted anonymous U.S. officials in Washington as saying that such an arrangement "may have some elements that could violate the sanctions." Turkey argues that the Security Council should review the trade sanctions against Iraq because these have not only proved ineffective but have also damaged Turkish interests. Official estimates in Ankara indicate that ever since the United Nations imposed the sanctions on Baghdad, following the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Turkey has lost at least $3 billion a year in trade, services and revenues from the oil pipeline which it shares with Iraq. Shortly after coming to power last year, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller made getting Turkey's allies to rethink the embargo one of Ankara's main priorities. Addressing the parliamentary group of her True Path Party on Tuesday, Ciller repeated that Turkey was incurring great losses from the embargo on Iraq, and estimated that the total loss to date was $20 billion. The 1.6 million-barrel-per-day pipeline links the Karkuk oil fields in Iraq with Yumurtalik, a terminal on the Turkish Mediterranean coast. Ciller also stressed that the pipeline ran the risk of severe damage due to disuse, and said that the recent agreement with Iraq aimed at ensuring that the damage was assessed and repaired. Ciller also suggested that a portion of the oil from the pipeline could be used for humanitarian aid to Iraq. "Our efforts without allies to get the embargo lifted are continuing. It is not true that the U.S. has given us a note because of these efforts of ours. There is an effort to make it seem as though we were departing from the U.N. system on this issue. This is not true," Ciller said. The United Nations has offered to allow Iraq to export oil worth $1.6 billion through Turkey to pay for imports of food, medicine, relief work and war reparations, but Baghdad has rejected the offer, claiming that the conditions were a violation of its sovereignty. In talking about giving humanitarian aid in return for oil, Ankara is said to be making use of the advantage provided by the U.N. decision. Turkish officials say that Ankara's current diplomatic activities vis-a-vis Iraq can be characterized as "intense lobbying." They say that while they do not intend to "let Iraq get away with a violation of international law," the world also has to acknowledge the full ramifications, for a country like Turkey, of the ongoing situation in Baghdad. They also argue that the sanctions against Iraq have contributed to the destabilization in Turkey's troubled Southeast, because of their adverse economic effects in the already depressed region. "This is too high a price for any country to pay, especially as it is not clear for how long the regime in Baghdad, which the U.S. is so opposed to, will remain in power," one official told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS. "If the proof is in the facts, then it must be admitted that the embargo has not achieved its objective. It has hardly brought about any change in administration in Baghdad," he remarked. He went on to say: ``At present, we are putting forward proposals that have to be taken into account, given that Turkey is a regional country and following developments in Iraq closely. ``One proposal we have put forward, based on our own personal observations, is that the sanctions against Baghdad have not worked in the way that the U.S. and some of our other allies wanted.'' In other words, Saddam has grown immune to the negative effects of these sanctions, and has turned the resistance of them into a social virtue for those that support him. "This means that there is no light at the end of the tunnel as of yet. Unless the U.N. and key allies such as the U.S. come up with a new formula to overcome the impasse with Iraq, it is senseless that a country like Turkey should be left to foot a massive bill that it cannot afford." [quotation marks as published] Christine Shelley, a deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department, told reporters on Monday, "We understand that it is important for Turkey's economic future that they should be able to preserve what for them is certainly a very vital economic asset." But she added immediately, "We have made it clear that we would be opposed to any steps that violated the U.N. sanctions against Iraq," thus underscoring the determined stance adopted by her country on this issue. Officials in Turkey also say that what Ankara is asking for, in terms of the Iraqi pipeline, is not totally without precedent. They point to the "oil-for-debt arrangement," which the United Nations extended to Jordan, enabling the country to import Iraqi crude for domestic use, without any cash changing hands. Officials say that this is one option that Turkey might accept. They also point to an arrangement with Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War. Under this agreement, the Saudi government flushed the Iraqi crude oil in the pipeline that runs through its territory, sold it and gave the money to the Saudi Aramco Oil Co. to cover the costs of maintaining the pipeline and storage tanks.
