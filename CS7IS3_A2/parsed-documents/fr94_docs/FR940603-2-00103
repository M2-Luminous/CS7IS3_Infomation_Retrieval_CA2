FR940603-2-00103 FR940603-2-00062 Notice of Availability of the Technical/Agency Draft Recovery Plan for Large-flowered Skullcap for Review and Comment AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice of availability and public comment period. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability for public review of a technical/agency draft recovery plan for large-flowered skullcap. Large-flowered skullcap ( Scutellaria montana Chapman) is an herbaceous representative of the mint family (Lamiaceae), with known populations in northern Georgia and southeastern Tennessee. The Service solicits review and comments from the public on this draft plan. DATES: Comments on the technical/agency draft recovery plan must be received on or before August 2, 1994 to receive consideration by the Service. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the technical/agency draft recovery plan may obtain a copy by contacting the Asheville Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 330 Ridgefield Court, Asheville, North Carolina 28806 (Telephone 704/665&hyph;1195). Written comments and materials regarding the plan should be addressed to the Field Supervisor at the above address. Comments and materials received are available on request for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. J. Allen Ratzlaff at the address and telephone number shown above (Ext. 229). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Restoring endangered or threatened animals or plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria for recognizing the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed. The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ) (Act), requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans. Based upon available information concerning the range, biology, and threats to its continued survival, it is not yet possible to determine if or when full recovery of the large-flowered skullcap is possible. Accordingly, this draft recovery plan outlines a mechanism that provides for the protection and maintenance of all known populations, with emphasis on determining autecological factors necessary to manage the species. In 1986 the taxon was listed as endangered by the Service. At that time there were seven populations known in Georgia and three in Tennessee. The taxon was threatened by habitat loss to timbering or development. Over 90 percent of the 7,000 individual plants known in 1986 occurred at only two sites, neither of which was completely protected from known threats. Currently, large-flowered skullcap is known to occur in two counties in Tennessee and four counties in Georgia, within a limited area of the Ridge and Valley and Cumberland Plateau provinces. There are 17 extant populations (12 in Tennessee and 5 in Georgia) that vary greatly in size. Comments and information provided during this review will be used in preparing the final recovery plan. Public Comments Solicited The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified above will be considered prior to approval of the plan. Authority The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f) Dated: May 26, 1994. Brian P. Cole, Field Supervisor.
