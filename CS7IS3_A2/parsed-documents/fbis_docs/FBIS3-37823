At the same time, he told Interfax-Ukraine that Russia continued to supply Ukraine with gas. According to Yalovega, Ukrainian consumers "have nothing special to worry about, for the republic's facilities store gas in sufficient quantities which would last until the end of the heating season." Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Valentin Landyk told a press conference in Kiev today that Ukraine will send 60,000 tons of grain to Turkmenistan to reimburse part of its debt for Turkmen gas that he estimated at $150 Mn. However, Turkmenistan believes that the debt has already reached $700 Mn. Landyk added that a telephone conversation between acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy and the Turkmen leadership failed to help resume the deliveries. In 1993, Ukraine received 25.5 Bn cubic meters of gas from Turkmenistan and another 69 Bn cubic meters from Russia.
