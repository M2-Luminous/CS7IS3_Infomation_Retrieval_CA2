This was disclosed by Ms Wu while addressing a meeting organised jointly by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) under the aegis of the Joint Business Council (JBC) here on Wednesday. The trade contract envisages an import of $5 million worth of raw silk and $7.5 million worth of pig iron from China and an export of $7.5 million worth of iron ore to China, she said. She said the Indian government and China were striving for a direct trade link to do away with the intermediaries. She said both the governments were already seized of the issue. Exuding optimism about the two-way trade and economic cooperation between the two countries, she said there would be more exchange of business delegations and also economic cooperation in areas like science and technology between the two countries. Later, addressing a press conference, she said the Chinese government was very strict about anti-dumping regulations, and said penal legislation would be brought out shortly for those exporters who were indulging in export of products at artificially low prices, and also indicated that the international trade licence of these exporters would be cancelled if warnings on dumping are not heeded. Earlier, at a meeting between Chinese businessmen and members of Ficci and Assocham, a senior official of the external affairs ministry disclosed that a double taxation avoidance treaty would be signed shortly between the two countries. Other steps being taken to establish direct trade links between the two include setting up of bank branches in each others' country to circumvent the problems being faced in opening letters of credits and establishing direct shipping lines and air services. Officials of the external affairs ministry present during the meeting informed that the Reserve Bank of India and the Peoples Bank of China would shortly sign an agreement for setting up branches in each others' country. They said the State Bank of India was ready to set up a branch in Shanghai soon. In his address, the Assocham president, Mr G H Singhania, said that taking advantage of the recent spurt in Sino-Indian bilateral trade, which presently hovered around $600 million, the JBC should set a target of $3 billion in the next three years.
