The committee is led by Stanley Kalpage, Sri Lanka's ambassador to the United Nations. The statement notes that Israel used all sorts of methods that violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Geneva Conventions of 1949, and the Hague Conventions of 1907, as well as international humanitarian law, in order to change the identity of the territories and the people. Israel has also used these methods in order to judaize these territories and exploit their resources to plant settlements, settlers, and military fortifications in order to exercise oppression, repression, aggression, and expansion. The statement says that, throughout the past few decades, it has become clear to the entire world how Israel has been destroying the villages and Arab features of the Golan, most notably the city of al-Qunaytirah. The number of villages and urban centers that have been wiped off the map has reached more than 240. Moreover, the number of inhabitants of Syrian Golan that have been displaced by Israel has reached more than 120,000 people. Israel has plundered these people's resources and carried out a policy of removing the Arab identity of the occupied Golan and of obliterating its Arab features. The statement also notes the Israeli's repressive methods and hostile policies against the Syrian Arab inhabitants, which are aimed at isolating them from their Arab surroundings and imposing an Israeli identity on them. The statement also notes the suffering of the inhabitants in terms of poverty and poor living, health, and educational conditions, in addition to fomenting sectarian hatred among the inhabitants. The statement also notes that Israeli practices, which violate the human rights of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples in the occupied Arab territories, are a result of Israel's occupation of the Arab territories since 1967. The statement adds that Israel will not stop these practices unless the Israeli occupation of these territories is removed. In conclusion, the statement says that Syria has provided a chance for a just and comprehensive peace that achieves Israeli withdrawal from the Golan and the rest of the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories and secures the Palestinian people's rights to self-determination in implementation of UN resolutions and international legitimacy. However, Israel is still obstructing progress in the peace process. Afterward, the committee met with a number of eyewitness deportees from the occupied territories. Members of the committee listened to the deportees' statements on Israeli practices and the methods of interrogation and torture used by the Israeli authorities against the Arab inhabitants. Moreover, the committee was briefed on practices by Israeli authorities on how the citizens are deported.
