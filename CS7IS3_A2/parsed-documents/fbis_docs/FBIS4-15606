According to Andrey Grachev, the chief of the Black Sea Fleet press centre, the storming was conducted from 21:00 to 23:00 [1700 to 1900 GMT] on [10] April. The Ukrainian storm troopers arrested Russsian officers Oleg Feoktistov, Dmitriy Starikov and Aleksandr Zelyonka. According to the source, the Russian naval officers were handcuffed, although their only "offence" was that they remained loyal to the oath of allegiance they gave once. The other officers and midshipmen of the division were blocked by Ukrainian commandoes inside the division base. Grachev said the Ukrainian Navy commander Vladimir Beskorovainy was aboard the commandship Slavutich in Odessa at the time and his complicity in the action was, according to Grachev, beyond doubt.
