This is said in the ministry statement that was provided yesterday by the director of its Press Department, Marek Skolil. He added that the Ministry only learned about Zhirinovskiy's intention to visit the Czech Republic from the press. According to earlier comments by the Legal and Consular Section of the Czech Foreign Ministry, Zhirinovskiy's visit cannot be prevented. He is a regularly elected deputy of the Russian State Duma, which gives him a legal right to the diplomatic passport of the Russian Federation. Not even the newly drafted visa-free travel agreement between the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation will change anything on the status of the holders of diplomatic passports. According to the Prague Lawyer Firm of Tomas Hofmann, LL.B., Zhirinovskiy can come to the Czech Republic without an invitation. Should he violate any law here, however, he can be prosecuted like any other person who violates the legally protected interests of the Czech Republic.
