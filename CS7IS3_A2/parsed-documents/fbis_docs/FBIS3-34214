[Sidqi] All the legitimate forces will take part in this dialogue, regardless of their inclination. Naturally, illegitimate forces are excluded from this dialogue and will not participate in it. The dialogue, which will open in April, will be on political, economic, and social issues. Therefore, as President Husni Mubarak said, all the national forces and legitimate parties will participate in it. The basic aim of the dialogue is to arrive at an agreement that will enable us to see the issue of security and stability in the right perspective. Stability is the foundation that will allow Egyptian society to advance in all fields. The national dialogue also aims to draw a scientific and comprehensive vision of Egypt's future in the coming century. [Al-Sa'id] Does this classification of forces as legitimate and illegitimate mean that the Muslim Brotherhood will not take part in the national dialogue? [Sidqi] As I just said, only the legitimate forces will take part. The Muslim Brotherhood is an illegitimate and illegal force. Besides, the Egyptian Constitution does not allow the formation of religious parties. [Al-Sa'id] Some people have voiced the fear that the national dialogue would turn into an aimless ramble [maklamah]. These people say that change is, in essence, a matter for deeds, not words. [Sidqi] They are wrong. Dialogue is the main course for finding the truth and improving reality. This is our aim; to better ourselves in everything: politics, economy, and social relations. We seek solutions to problems that we all recognize: education, health, and development, among others. Therefore, it is very useful to have a dialogue on these issues. It is possible for us to reach an agreement on a number of principles that will shed light on how to resolve these problems. [Al-Sa'id] Some people are afraid that the dialogue will turn into a solo performance by the National Democratic Party [NDP] and its sympathizers. [Sidqi] The dialogue will not turn into an NDP monologue. Representatives from all the national and party forces will be present. How can it turn into a solo performance? There is no doubt that the dialogue will be an opportunity to exchange opinions, formulate a comprehensive vision of our national priorities, and draw police guidelines. Egypt, as President Mubarak said, does not aim to blur the distinction between opinions but to uphold the principles and prerequisites of democracy. [Al-Sa'id] Is terrorism one of the proposed subjects in the dialogue? [Sidqi] Of course. It is a major issue. The call for dialogue is also an attempt to rally efforts to formulate a national action plan to support stability and development, and to strike at terrorism to uproot it completely. But, at the same time, we should not exaggerate the extent of terrorism. Such an exaggeration is not needed. It is true that there is terrorism; this is an undisputed fact. But I say that the terrorism movement in Egypt has never been and will never be similar to the movements in other countries. The criteria here makes the difference between the two. Terrorism here is within narrow limits when compared to other countries. The terrorists certainly have their instigators and backers abroad. We know of the remnants who have left Egypt and have gone to other countries. [Al-Sa'id] The remnants that went to Afghanistan? [Sidqi] They went to more than one country where they settled down, trained, and carried out their activities by communicating with their cadres in Egypt. The latter received their instructions from them to carry out their criminal acts against the state and its citizens. [Al-Sa'id] Why do you not mention specifically the countries that support terrorism? [Sidqi] We have exposed them and there is no need to mention them again. They are known forces that do not want stability and progress for Egypt but want our country to remain burdened by poverty. They are tools of destruction and sabotage. [Al-Sa'id] Are they Sudan and Iran? [Sidqi] I do not want to accuse a specific country and I do not want to assert anything. But there are very strong possibilities that there are people residing in some surrounding countries or in countries near us. [Al-Sa'id] There are opposition voices which say that political reform is the basis for eliminating terrorism and is the main door to dialogue. [Sidqi] What do they mean by political reform? [Al-Sa'id] One aspect of political reform is the guarantee of honest elections. [Sidqi] Elections are always honest in Egypt. The current laws ensure the honesty of elections and no one here can dispute our elections. [Al-Sa'id] Some of these voices are also demanding the amendment of the Constitution and believe that this Constitution is not being applied and is merely ink on paper. From this comes the call to amend it so that it can conform to current conditions in Egypt. [Sidqi] Who has made the Constitution merely ink on paper? We are living in a state that respects law and this means that the Constitution is respected and the law is respected. There is no distortion or bypassing of the law. I do not understand what they mean when they talk about the Constitution in the manner suggested by your question. As to the amendment of the Constitution, I say that the current one is completely suitable for Egypt's current conditions. Tampering with the Constitution is not an easy matter. The above-mentioned Constitution was drawn up in 1971 and therefore it has been in existence for only 22 years. This is not long enough for judging and amending the Constitution. It is not reasonable for us to change the Constitution each period, otherwise the whole process will turn into chaos. [Al-Sa'id] Terrorist operations have not been eliminated or contained yet, despite the enforcement of the emergency law. On the contrary, they have become a serious phenomenon threatening society. [Sidqi] We cannot consider terrorist incidents a phenomenon. Egypt is more stable and secure than other states. If some wicked terrorist elements appear every now and then, they are a misled group unaware of Egypt's interests. They are elements who have rebelled against the situation, law, and legitimacy. They are trying to impose their deviant opinion and thought on others by force and with violence. This runs counter to the simplest rules of freedom and democracy, which are the pillars of the regime in Egypt. They are a group that must be confronted firmly and decisively. We cannot describe its actions as a phenomenon because the overwhelming majority of the Egyptian people reject its unsound and illogical practices. The Egyptian people are among the most moderate people and adhere to their sound Islamic and Christian religious ideals. [Al-Sa'id] However, more than one incident has shown that terrorism still exists, including the unsuccessful assassination attempt against you. [Sidqi] The emergence of extremist groups that practice violence and terrorism is not confined to Egypt. There are terrorist groups in our region, Europe, and elsewhere. These groups lack sound logic, correct thought, and wisdom. Therefore, their attempts to impose their custodianship and ideas by terrorism and violence are confronted by the people and government. These groups must not be allowed to pose a threat to Egypt's security. We are all confident that terrorism has no future on our land. It will remain besieged and will be eradicated, God willing, because its elements are a small fugitive group that is motivated by a desire to destroy. God willing, they will disappear thanks to national consensus. [Al-Sa'id] It is being said that confronting terrorism can be done without resorting to security measures, such as eliminating the shantytowns. [Sidqi] We are using all security and legal methods, as well as development projects, to put an end to terrorism. We are implementing a comprehensive program to remove shantytowns in 11 governorates. We have adopted serious steps and have allocated 3.03 billion pounds to remove these shantytowns. [Al-Sa'id] Some believe ideological dialogue can be held with these misled groups. [Sidqi] There is a difference between extremist thinking and terrorism. Dialogue can be held with the first. However, dialogue with terrorism is useless. There can be no dialogue with terrorism because you cannot speak to someone who is aiming a gun at you. There can be no dialogue between two sides, one of which uses words while the other uses firearms. Is this possible? Of course not. [Al-Sa'id] Speaking of corruption, some people accuse the government of ignoring the issue, especially when it affects some big names. [Sidqi] We do not ignore any corruption case; we promptly refer it to prosecution. I stress here that we will not be lenient toward corruption; we will expose and pursue every corruption case no matter who is involved. President Mubarak's instructions are clear in this regard. Deviation from the right course may occur anywhere in the world, including Egypt. We and no one else can prevent it. This is why we have laws that combat deviation and treat people equally without discrimination between the big and the small. [Al-Sa'id] The fact that the state's control authorities, such as the Administrative Control Organization, are affiliated with the Council of Ministers may raise concerns that the government colludes with those authorities to crush its adversaries and protect its friends. [Sidqi] Had this been true, we would not have brought many big and resounding names to trial. All are equal before the law. [Al-Sa'id] Like whom? [Sidqi] There is no need to mention names! [Al-Sa'id] Does this mean that corruption files are not opened selectively? Some say that while light is shed on some cases to discredit certain people, other cases remain on the shelf. [Sidqi] I would like to say first that there are not that many corruption cases. We are against all kind of corruption, major, or minor. Everybody must be sure that the state is against any deviation from the right path. All the cases that came to light were discovered by the state services, such as the Administrative Control Organization, the intelligence services, state security, the public funds authority, and the central agency. Officials of the state's administrative service inform the government of any corruption case. All these agencies play their roles in full. I would like to draw your attention to a very important point here: People should not be considered guilty for mere suspicion. People have their entities and personalities. It is noted that some newspapers publish allegations to discredit public figures without any evidence against them. This, I believe, is encroachment on people's reputations. This is more like intellectual terrorism and a call to harm others wrongfully. If the government did all it can, referred corruption cases to courts irrespective of who is involved, and never interfered to affect the normal course of those cases, then we all must wait for the results of investigations so that innocent people are not condemned and defamed. It is a sin to wrong innocent people and condemn them on the basis of tendentious rumors. We are alert, and we do not remain silent over any corruption or deviation. We watch, follow, and pursue any corruption case regardless of who stands behind it. When suspicion about the Madinat al-Nasr millionaire grew and a citizen filed a complaint, we did not hesitate; we took prompt action. [Al-Sa'id] There are many people demanding that the emergency law be lifted. [Sidqi] The emergency law is for the public good, especially because Egyptian society faces the danger of terrorism, which must be confronted and uprooted. The emergency law is only applied to terrorists and drug dealers; it is the least that can be done to protect Egypt. Dangers to society posed by these terrorists require deterrence and decisiveness. The emergency law does not affect anyone's freedom or creed, nor does it affect the parties. The law is used against outlaws and, therefore, there is no fear from the emergency law because it cannot harm any innocent citizen. [Al-Sa'id] But someone may ask why the emergency law exists. Although it has been in force since 1981, it has not contained or eradicated terrorism. [Sidqi] Why should the emergency law bother anyone if it is applied only to terrorism and drugs, each of which is a damned disease that must be resisted with all possible means? The emergency law has not been used against any other party and has not undermined democracy. Had it not been for the democratic climate we are experiencing, the opposition voices would not dare to say one tenth of what they say now. As to the question of why the need for it, I say that we are in dire need of it to protect Egypt's stability and the lives of its citizens, and to secure its economy. Once again, I ask why the alarm about the emergency law, which has not been used against any honest citizen, parties, or press, or to undermine democracy? There are no excesses in the application of the emergency law. [Al-Sa'id] The opposition parties are part of the state's political system under the Constitution's Article 5, which considers the multiparty system to be the basis for the political regime in Egypt. [Sidqi] Naturally, pluralism is the basis of the political system in Egypt and no one says otherwise. [Al-Sa'id] But the parties do not sense this fact and feel that they are excluded from politics. They do not feel they are part of the political system and feel that the government is uneasy with the opposition, although it does not show it. [Sidqi] How can they feel that they are not part of the political system with all the state's and ruling party's assurances that the opposition should indeed be part of the political system? As a general rule, a genuine opposition is heeded, but still we find some opposition elements trying to portray everything in Egypt as very black. This is unreasonable and unacceptable because everything has two faces--beautiful and ugly, good and bad. You saw some opposition papers recently reporting everything as bleak, which is untrue. Therefore, I say that the opposition parties are not separated from the political arena and they enjoy democracy in Egypt, which we see everywhere. We can see at the People's Assembly that the opposition enjoys the full right to speech and dialogue. The same applies to the Consultative Council, where the opposition takes more than its share of rights, and we do not go by the proportion criteria in allotting the majority and minority. The opposition parties receive every regard and respect, but the opposition should stick to objective opposition. It is not sensible for anyone to level accusations without evidence that the person is corrupt or bad. This is unlawful and I am very sorry about this situation. However, we deal with the opposition differently and I personally have numerous friends in the opposition parties, in al-Wafd, Labor, and other parties. My criticism of the opposition is that it tarnishes people's images haphazardly; it tarnishes the image of everyone and the system, which is unacceptable. [Al-Sa'id] People complain about high prices. They are afraid these prices will increase in the next few months. [Sidqi] There will be no price increases for any commodity, including gasoline, in the coming period. Prices have increased recently but they will not increase in the future. I want to say that we do not interfere in raising prices. Part of the reason for the price increases was a correctional measure and the other part was higher production costs, especially of imported goods. We are a part of the world market. Matters related to prices in world markets affect us eventually. [Al-Sa'id] What do you mean by saying that part of the reason for the higher prices was a correctional measure? [Sidqi] The prices that prevailed in the past did not reflect the real cost or the real value of the commodities. Our major problem is that for a long time we have been behaving like an ostrich, which buries its head in the sand. While prices were rising in the whole world, Egypt was putting a "brake" on prices through subsidies. Therefore, a collapse was going to happen if prices remained as they were. In other words, commodities were subsidized and sold at less than their real cost. It was necessary to reconsider this policy of subsidies, the continuation of which would have emptied the state's coffers. [Al-Sa'id] Some call for rationalizing public expenditures to curb government spending. [Sidqi] There is no government overspending. Spending is being done within the narrowest limits. Government expenditures have been squeezed to the minimum. [Al-Sa'id] What is your explanation of the discrepancy in the views of Egyptian officials regarding GATT? The ministers of economy, planning, and foreign affairs have different views on GATT. I ask: Why this discrepancy in views, given that the government has participated in the GATT negotiations over the past eight years? [Sidqi] Yes, Egypt has participated in the GATT negotiations for eight years. I see no differences on GATT. [Al-Sa'id] The foreign minister's statements look as if we have been surprised by GATT, as if it has been a shock to us, and as if it will negatively affect us as a developing country. [Sidqi] I do not believe this has happened. It is true that some statements have given this impression. What I say is that GATT has good privileges for the developing countries. At the same time it has some negative effects. Every official looks at the subject from a different angle. This in itself is a healthy phenomenon and not a discrepancy. It is not correct to say GATT is all good or all bad. [Al-Sa'id] But is it more negative or positive? [Sidqi] GATT will definitely affect us in the short run, but not in the medium or long run because the state opted to be part of the world economy. Therefore, we must respect and observe international systems. Anyway, GATT will not remain GATT; as of 1 January 1995, it will be named the World Trade Organization (WTO). The GATT that will be signed in the next few weeks will liberate foreign trade throughout the world. This means GATT will cover not only commodity trade, but also trade in services, copyrights, and patent rights. The last two are new to Egypt, and perhaps they are more worrying than commodity trade. The new system will therefore have a much wider scope than that of GATT, which covers only commodity exchange. I am not worried, although I have to take several precautions in the short run. Why am I not worried? Because our policy of liberating the national economy largely conforms with the new trends in the organization of international trade. [Al-Sa'id] How long can our products stand fast in the face of foreign competition? [Sidqi] GATT will give our products new opportunities. Talk about positive or negative impacts is linked to our ability to compete and improve our production. As a developing country, therefore, we must work to increase our ability to compete. We are able to have good and competitive products. [Al-Sa'id] When the unified tax bill was discussed in the People's Assembly, you were criticized for threatening to resign if the bill was not approved. [Sidqi] I did not threaten to resign. I only said that if the bill was not passed, we would withdraw it. [Al-Sa'id] Does this not mean the confiscation of democracy? The bill should have been given enough time for discussion. [Sidqi] The unified tax bill took more time for discussion than any other bill. Indeed, the bill itself is not new. The bill was issued in 1978 upon the People's Assembly's recommendation; it was then called the tax justice law. In 1980, I chaired a committee to work out the bill on the basis of a unified tax. Several years later, I presented the bill to the finance minister, and it was similar to the current unified tax bill. In 1986, we also discussed the possibility of its implementation. [Al-Sa'id] Does this mean that you are committed to the bill? [Sidqi] The bill is one of the fairer and best laws, but regrettably some people regarded it from the beginning as additional taxation, which is not true. We intended the bill to include and incorporate all taxes and general revenue in one tax, and the law is fair and takes low incomes into consideration. [Al-Sa'id] But the bill's exemption limit is not satisfactory. [Sidqi] This is just a social expression and there are many other countries that do not offer exemption on family burdens. [Al-Sa'id] But what about the talk that it was the United States that drafted the bill and that it was imposed on you by international financial institutions? [Sidqi] This is baseless because the law is 100 percent Egyptian. We embarked on it a long time ago and it has nothing to do with the United States. [Al-Sa'id] What about the Middle East market, for the idea and feasibility of which you formed a committee of many ministers? What are your conclusions? [Sidqi] We are examining not the Middle East market but the current circumstances that resulted from recent political developments in the region. These are the Palestinians and the Gaza-Jericho accord, Jordan and the understanding about a declaration of principles, and Syria, which is on its way to reaching an understanding. All this will have gigantic effects on the region in all aspects, particularly in the economic sphere. Therefore, the committee was set up to follow these developments and measure their effects on all aspects, especially on the economic side. [Al-Sa'id] What is your own view on the Middle East market and on the possibility of including Arab countries in it? [Sidqi] Like it or not, we are bound to adjust to new circumstances and we cannot distance ourselves from them because they are a reality. Failure to deal with reality is a grave mistake. We must adapt to reality and adjust our economy and ties to be in line with this fact. Today we cannot exclude certain facts; Israel exists and we must normalize ties with it as much as possible. Large world economic groups exist--NAFTA, Southeast Asia, and the European Union. We also must go in the same direction. [Al-Sa'id] Concerning foreign policy, what are the main lines of Egypt's foreign policy? [Sidqi] Two main lines are peace and development and they are integrated. [Al-Sa'id] What about our relations with other countries? [Sidqi] Our relations are excellent with all world countries, except a country or two, and this is no problem. [Al-Sa'id] What is your assessment of the U.S. role in the region? [Sidqi] We cannot deny that the United States has become the sole superpower in the world following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Therefore, it would be illogical on my part to deal with the region and the world without realizing or taking this new situation into account. The United States is now the sole superpower. It has influence all over the world. It is playing a role in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. I must have full and good relations with it. Thank God, our relations with the United States are very good. [Al-Sa'id] Can the United States put pressure on you to adopt certain policies toward regional problems? [Sidqi] No one puts pressure on us. Our decisions emanate from our willpower and not the willpower of others. We depend on ourselves in making decisions that do not antagonize the world. The pivots of our policy are peace and development. I believe peace was rejuvenated in the region only when the United States showed interest in it. It is true that the superpowers were represented in the past by the Soviet Union and the United States. The situation has changed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, which drowned in its own problems. The only superpower in the world now is the United States. [Al-Sa'id] Some say that the Gaza-Jericho agreement is in the intensive care unit. [Sidqi] We view the agreement as a step toward a comprehensive, permanent, and just peace in the Middle East. It is a step on the road to peace. We hope that the gap between the Palestinians and Israel will be bridged in a way that will lead to the honest and accurate implementation of the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington in September. [Al-Sa'id] But Israel does not want to implement the agreement honestly and accurately. [Sidqi] The negotiator always keeps some "cards" to himself. However, if Israel wants to live in the region, it must normalize relations with its neighbors in general and the Palestinians in particular. It is in the interest of all parties for peace to prevail in the Middle East. [Al-Sa'id] Israel deliberately speaks about unilateral deals with one party without the other and looks forward to measures that primarily safeguard its security without caring about the security of the Arab parties. [Sidqi] Let it be known that the basis of any peace is the return of the Arab territories Israel occupied in 1967 to their owners. This has been acknowledged by the international community in an almost unanimous manner. I believe UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 are the starting and reference points. Since the peace conference began in Madrid in October 1991--and even the efforts that preceded it--these two resolutions have been the cornerstone of any just and comprehensive settlement in the region. Resolution 242 is clear regarding the need for the exchange of land for peace and the inadmissibility of the seizure of the land of others by force. President Clinton affirmed this during the Geneva summit with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. Clinton affirmed his determination to establish a comprehensive and just peace in the region. [Al-Sa'id] How do you evaluate the al-Asad-Clinton summit in Geneva on 16 January? [Sidqi] It was undoubtedly a tremendous step that gave impetus to the peace process. It also helped clarify positions. The statements to journalists by Presidents Clinton and al-Asad showed clearly that the summit produced positive results. But these could not appear overnight. We will see these results gradually in light of the current Arab-Israeli talks in Washington. The results of the Geneva summit will affect all negotiating tracks. The results of the meetings between Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin must also affect the Arab-Israeli talks. [Al-Sa'id] How emphatically can we say that this year can bring peace to the Middle East and to the domestic front? [Sidqi] Domestic peace, praise be to God, is at hand. The incidents that take place in the country are only individual ones. I stress this although I myself could have been one of the victims, but I am not really worried because of these incidents. I believe that before the year ends, God willing, we will have put things on their right course. The state's arm is strong and able to eradicate terrorism. As regards peace in the Middle East, I say that this year, God willing, will usher in a new era toward the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace and the attainment of the full rights of the Palestinians, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. Each party must be given its rights. Arab territory will return to its rightful owners. Neither Israel nor any other country in the region can live in peace and stability unless all pending issues concerning Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians are resolved on the basis of a land- for-peace exchange. [Al-Sa'id] Do you not feel annoyed with the persistent criticism of government policies in daily press caricatures? Does this not indicate a loss of government prestige? [Sidqi] This never annoys me. I only feel annoyed when people are harmed as individuals. Criticizing policies is no problem; different views do not disturb cordial relations. One feels annoyed when comics or jokes harm people as individual persons with independent entities, values, and beliefs. A slanderous caricature may disturb one for an hour or two, but not more; one has no time to be annoyed day and night. Political criticism is acceptable any time and from any person, whether a government or an opposition reporter. I absolutely do not feel hurt.
