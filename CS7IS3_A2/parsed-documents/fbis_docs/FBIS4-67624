Speaking at the "Biotechnology and AIDS" conference currently in progress in Florence, Aiuti stressed how these revelations "confirm the existence of the virus in Italy in the Seventies." In making his claim, Aiuti cited research by virologist Ferdinando Dianzani and separate research by Carlo Baroni and two other scientists, who performed biopsies on tissues from living patients. Dianzani in his address at the conference did not agree fully with Aiuti but stated that, according to his own conclusions, the first death by AIDS in Italy occurred in 1978. Also announced at the conference yesterday by Peter Piot of the World Health Organization (WHO) was the start of first-stage trials of an anti-AIDS vaccine within the month on 35 volunteers from Brazil, Thailand and Uganda, under WHO auspices. The main aim of the trials will be to determine the safety and the effectiveness of the vaccine, chosen from a group of 12 possible vaccines developed over the last few years. Duke University immunologist Dani Bolognesi, speaking at the conference, warned however that some of these latest candidate vaccines, like many of their forerunners, have also come from laboratory-produced strains and thus may not produce substantially different results from those already known, and may not have the same effects on human beings as on laboratory animals. Hopes are increasingly turning towards the positive signs coming from studies into seropositives whose longevities are longer than expected and whose high levels of anti-bodies, known as CD-8 Lymphocytes, seem to have a neutralizing effect on the HIV virus, which causes AIDS. Bolognesi pointed out that researchers should be looking for ways to imitate the natural resistance of these anti-bodies in formulating the next stages of vaccine research.
