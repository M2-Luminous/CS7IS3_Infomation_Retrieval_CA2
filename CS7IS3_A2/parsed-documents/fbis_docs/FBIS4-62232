At the same time he noted that distortions in pricing policy are leading to a situation whereby bread is being produced in Russia using a calculation of 200,000 rubles [R] for 1 tonne of wheat, even though agricultural producers are selling bread at R70,000 per tonne. The vice premier also reported that as of today stocks of meat, butter, and sugar are concentrated at depots in large quantities. In Zaveryukha's opinion these products are unwanted because many food products have been imported into Russia.
