FR940719-1-00087 FR940719-1-00015 (d) If an unusual variance in the mine ventilation pressure is observed, or if an electrical or mechanical deficiency of a main mine fan is detected, the mine superintendent, assistant mine superintendent, or mine foreman shall be notified immediately, and appropriate action or repairs shall be instituted promptly. * * * * * 5. Section 75.312 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (c), (d), (g)(1), and (h); by redesignating paragraph (f) as (f)(1) and revising it; by redesignating paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) as paragraphs (g)(3) and (g)(4) and revising them, and by adding new paragraphs (f)(2), (g)(2) and (g)(5) to read as follows: §75.312 Main mine fan examinations and records. (a) To assure electrical and mechanical reliability of main mine fans, each main mine fan and its associated components, including devices for measuring or recording mine ventilation pressure, shall be examined for proper operation by a trained person designated by the operator. Examinations of main mine fans shall be made at least once each day that the fan operates, unless a functioning fan monitoring system is used in accordance with §75.310. No examination is required on any day when no one, including certified persons, goes underground, but an examination shall be conducted prior to anyone entering the mine. (b) (1) If a main mine fan monitoring system is used, a trained person designated by the operator shall_ (i) At least once each day obtain and review the data provided by the fan monitoring system to assure that the fan and the fan monitoring system are operating properly. No review is required on any day when no one, including certified persons, goes underground, but a review of the data shall be performed prior to anyone entering the mine. Data reviewed should include the fan pressure, bearing temperature, revolutions per minute, vibration, electric voltage, and amperage; and (ii) At least every 7 days_ (A) Test the monitoring system for proper operation; and (B) Examine each main mine fan and its associated components to assure electrical and mechanical reliability of main mine fans. * * * * * (c) At least every 31 days, the automatic fan signal device for each main mine fan shall be tested by stopping the fan. Notwithstanding the provisions of §75.311, underground power may remain energized during this test. If the fan is not restarted within 15 minutes, underground power shall be deenergized and no one shall enter any underground area of the mine, except as provided in this paragraph below, until the fan is restarted and an examination of the mine is conducted as described in §75.360 (b) through (e) and the mine has been determined to be safe. Only persons necessary to evaluate the effect of the fan stoppage or restart, or to perform maintenance or repair work that cannot otherwise be made while the fan is operating, shall be permitted underground. An alternative test that does not require stopping the fan may be used provided it provides the same level of assurance that the fan signal will function as intended during fan stoppages and the alternative method is approved in the ventilation plan. (d) At least every 31 days, the automatic closing doors in multiple main mine fan systems shall be tested by stopping the fan. Notwithstanding the provisions of §75.311, underground power may remain energized during this test. If the fan is not restarted within 15 minutes, underground power shall be deenergized and no one shall enter any underground area of the mine, except as provided in this section, until the fan is restarted and an examination of the mine is conducted as described in §75.360 (b) through (e) and the mine has been determined to be safe. Only persons necessary to evaluate the effect of the fan stoppage or restart, or to perform maintenance or repair work that cannot otherwise be made while the fan is operating, shall be permitted underground. An alternative test that does not require stopping the fan may be used, provided it provides the same level of assurance that the automatic closing doors will function as intended during fan stoppages and the alternative method is approved in the ventilation plan. * * * * * (f) (1) Certification. Persons making main mine fan examinations shall certify by initials and date at the fan or another location specified by the operator that the examinations were made. Each certification shall identify the main mine fan examined. (2) Persons reviewing data produced by a main mine fan monitoring system shall certify by initials and date on a printed copy of the data from the system that the review was completed. (g) (1) Recordkeeping. By the end of the shift on which the examination is made, persons making main mine fan examinations shall record all defects found during the examination that may affect the operation of the fan. Records shall be maintained in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. (2) When a fan monitoring system is used in lieu of the daily fan examination_ (i) The certified copies of data produced by fan monitoring systems shall be maintained separate from other computer-generated reports or data; and (ii) A record shall be made of any fan monitoring system malfunctions, electrical or mechanical deficiencies in the monitoring system and any sudden increase or loss in mine ventilating pressure. The record shall be made by the end of the shift on which the review of the data is completed and shall be maintained in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. (3) At mines permitted to shut down main mine fans under §75.311, if a pressure recording device is not used, a record shall be made of the time and fan pressure immediately before the fan is stopped, and after the fan is restarted and the fan pressure stabilizes. Records shall be maintained in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. (4) By the end of the shift on which the monthly test of the automatic fan signal device or the automatic closing doors is completed, persons making these tests shall record the results of the tests. Records shall be maintained in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. (5) The records required by paragraphs (g) (1) through (4) of this section shall be countersigned by the mine foreman by the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled working shift. Within 2 scheduled production days thereafter, the record shall also be countersigned by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. (h) Retention period. Records, including records of mine fan pressure and the certified copies of data produced by fan monitoring systems, shall be retained at a surface location at the mine for at least 1 year from the date of the last entry and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners. * * * * * 6. Section 75.313 is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3), (d)(1) (i) and (ii), and (d)(2) of the stayed standard to read as follows:
