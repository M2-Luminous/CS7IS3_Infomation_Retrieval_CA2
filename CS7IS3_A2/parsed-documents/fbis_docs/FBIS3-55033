Men in Tbilisi Abstain From Comment"] [Text] Russia has ended its economic blockade of Abkhazia. As has been explained to your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent at the Russian Foreign Ministry CIS Department, Moscow's decision is the result of the following considerations: The leaders of Abkhazia have been of late demonstrating their readiness for a dialogue with Tbilisi and taking specific steps toward a peaceful settlement of the situation in the conflict zone. Besides, it is primarily civilians, including Russians, who are suffering from the blockade. In the opinion of Russian diplomats, the lifting of the blockade shortly before the new year will be assessed as Moscow's goodwill gesture and will contribute to the stabilization of the situation in the region. From the point of view of Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba, Russia's blockade of Abkhazia contravened the Geneva agreement signed by Moscow. (One of the items in the document says: "The sides appeal to the international community for assistance in restoring the life-support systems in the zone of conflict....") The problem, however, has a reverse side too. Russia, as a guarantor of the Sochi agreement, is responsible for any violation of the understandings by the Abkhaz side. Significantly, in his interview for your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, Andrey Kozyrev did not deny facts attesting to Russian Army help to the Abkhaz people. The blockade of Abkhazia demonstrated to the world community, albeit not too convincingly, that Moscow condemned the violators of the Sochi agreement. The lifting of the blockade in effect consolidates the victory for Abkhaz military formations and, as a consequence, will lead to even an greater anti-Russian mood in Georgia. True, at this stage, as your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent was told at the Georgian Embassy, Tbilisi officials refrain from assessing the event. Also rather interesting is the fact that Moscow has made up its mind to lift the blockade despite the fact that there was after all no real progress in the settlement of the Abkhaz crisis. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has already reported (21 December 1993) that the problem of refugees from Abkhazia had been the main stumbling block in the talks between Tbilisi and Gudauta: the Abkhaz side insists that the republic's status be determined in a referendum. Today, as an overwhelming majority of Georgians have left Abkhazia, a referendum, according to Tbilisi, will not be legitimate. As Vladislav Ardzinba stated in an interview with your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, the republic's leaders today cannot guarantee the safety of Georgian refugees who would like to return, hence the question of the republic's status is being shelved once again. Also, your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, who has just returned from Abkhazia, can testify that the remaining Georgian population in the republic is continuing to be plundered. Moscow's position would have been explicable had it rejected the blockade idea right away on the grounds that it was unwilling to punish innocent civilians. As for Moscow's present decision, there may be only two explanations: Either Russia has realized it made yet another mistake, or the decision to institute economic sanctions had been no more than a trick aimed at pacifying the world community.
