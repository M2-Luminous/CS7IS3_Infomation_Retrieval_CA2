This is inferred from Dona Violeta's remarks upon returning from El Salvador. She said that Nicaragua will respond to the United States in December with regard to receiving Haitian refugees. "I always said that all of us in Central America are studying the request and will announce our decision at the summit to be held with President Clinton in Miami in December," she said. While the presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Costa Rica have ruled out the possibility of their countries' receiving Haitian refugees, citing excessive poverty and a lack of proper conditions, Dona Violeta keeps saying that the request is being studied and that a decision will be made in December. We must admit that this position -- a very intelligent one -- makes it possible for the Nicaraguan Government to gain time. According to international analysts, the problem created by the military in Haiti will have been resolved by December. The hypothesis that anything can happen between now and December is much more acceptable if we take into consideration the fact that Nicaragua will most likely support the U.S. proposal at the OAS to restore democracy in Haiti. The U.S. proposal for Haiti even considers the possibility of a military invasion, which, if approved, would take place very soon thereafter, because everything is ready. It goes without saying that Nicaragua is in no position to receive refugees. We must admit, however, that Dona Violeta has already learned to deal with international politics. Too bad it is a little late.
