GEIS, one of 12 subsidiaries of the General Electric Company, authorized the Great Wall to become its sales arm in China. The Beijing-based company, one of the largest computer makers in China, had been service agent for the American firm's China-based clients. GEIS is one of the largest global suppliers of electronic mail (E-mail) and electronic data interchange (EDI). It has 15 users based in China, including China National Chemicals Import and Export Corporation (Sinochem) and China Ocean Shipping Corporation (COSCO). ``By developing our cooperation with the Great Wall, our products can be fully adapted to local requirements,'' said Owen Chan, managing director of GEIS operations in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Three Golden Projects will link China's banking and customs services and national information interchange through huge information networks. Although the project has yet to begin, foreign companies have been lobbying hard to get contracts. Many of the projects are attracting overseas investors despite the heavy input they require. Hellene S. Runtagh, president of GEIS, said: ``Having an impressive local partner like the Great Wall will help us come to meet the Chinese requirements for the information highway. Competition will be less with such a partnership.'' She said her company hopes to win bids in the Golden Customs and Golden Card Projects since GEIS has more than 20 years of experience in handling EDI trading and credit card services. GEIS has a joint venture in the United States with Ameritech, which has long been in the credit card sector. Quentin P. Gallivan, vice-president of GEIS, said he is interested in technology transfer with Chinese partners. ``We want to have the technology operating in the US brought to China and work with companies like the Great Wall to meet Chinese needs,'' he said. ``We're not only concerned with giving EDI software, we want to teach the Chinese how to set up an EDI service and how to make it successful.''
