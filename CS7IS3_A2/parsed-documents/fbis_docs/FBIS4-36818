[passage omitted] Brahimi ended his meetings with southern leaders with a lunch meeting yesterday in 'Ali Salim al-Bid's house. The meeting was attended by Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]; Foreign Minister 'Abdallah al-Asnaj; and Muhsin Bin-Farid, deputy prime minister and planning minister. Muhsin Bin-Farid told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone from al-Mukalla yesterday that Brahimi met the day before yesterday with representatives of the political parties and organizations and ulemas. He also met with al-'Attas and al-Asnaj, stressing that "his basic mission is to listen to the southern leadership's view in the framework of the fact-finding process." He was provided with a detailed memorandum on the southern position. Bin-Farid added that the southern leaders told Brahimi "of the need to impose the will of international legitimacy on the party violating the cease-fire" in accordance with Security Council Resolution 924, which stipulates "an immediate halt to the fighting and sitting at the negotiating table." Bin-Farid said that the continuation of the fighting in Yemen -- despite Brahimi's visit -- "represents an attempt by Sanaa to use the fighting as a means to seize more land in southern governorates, while continuing to announce cease-fire initiatives merely to deceive foreign public opinion and impose a fait accompli." He also called for "adopting more powerful resolutions to force it to halt the fighting." The southern official said that DRY leaders raised during their meetings with Brahimi the need to dispatch international observers "to supervise and consolidate the cease-fire." He said that "there have to be a third party in order to ascertain the quarter violating the resolution." [passage omitted]
