What can it do to help the Palestinian people after such a sad event? ['Abdallah] Greece, as the president of the European Union, must press hard for the international protection of Palestinians and the occupied areas in the face of the Israeli aggression, official and by the settlers. Second, Greece, as president of the European Union, can also press for the immediate implementation of the Declaration of Principles and immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces and a dismantlement of the settlements which are time bombs that threaten both Israelis and Palestinians alike. [Correspondent] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias is going to visit the Middle East next week. What does he have to say to the Israelis? ['Abdallah] I hope he will tell them that Israel cannot work for peace and at the same time arm its settlers to murder Palestinians. This is against peace and not the way that would bring about tranquility and stability in the region. [Correspondent] Mr. Ambassador, yesterday you were telling us that Greece can contribute a lot to the peace process. Now, after such a sad event, what can we do? [Sason] Well, I do believe that Greece, like all the other countries in the world, can contribute by convincing the Arab people, the extremists and the Palestinian themselves to reduce the tension. To understand that this is the act of a saboteur, an extremist one. That it is not something that was planned, guided by the State of Israel. It was an act that was done in order to provoke the peace process. So, all of us are almost obliged to try to reduce the terminology, to try and to speak in minor tones, about this incident, which is a very sad one.
