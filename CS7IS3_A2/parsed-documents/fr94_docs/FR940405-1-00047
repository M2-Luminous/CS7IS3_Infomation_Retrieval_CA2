FR940405-1-00047 FR940405-1-00013 Exposure to tobacco smoke has been shown to increase the permeability of the respiratory epithelial membrane to macromolecules. Burns et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;45] have shown that exposure of guinea pigs to tobacco smoke followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC&hyph;D, molecular weight 10,000) increased the amount of intact FITC&hyph;D that crossed the respiratory epithelium into the vascular space. Transmission electron-microscopic studies showed that the FITC&hyph;D diffused across damaged type I pneumocyte membranes and cytoplasm to reach the basal lamina and entered the alveolar capillaries through the endothelial junction. Damage to alveolar epithelium was more frequent for the smoke-exposed animals than the room air-exposed animals. Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) participates in the activation of various carcinogens, such as benzo(a)pyrene. This is one of the many carcinogens found in ETS. Both mainstream and sidestream smoke are capable of inducing pulmonary AHH activity. Gairola [Ex. 114] has demonstrated the induction of pulmonary AHH activity in Sprague-Dawley rats and male C57BL mice after exposure to either mainstream or sidestream smoke from University of Kentucky Reference cigarettes (2R1) for seven days per week for 16 weeks. However, no such induction was noted in Hartley guinea-pigs under similar conditions, indicating a species difference. The mainstream and the sidestream smoke were equally effective in inducing the AHH activity. There is consistent evidence that decrements in pulmonary function and increases in respiratory symptoms occur in current smokers and in exsmokers. However, in passive smokers these health effects are not as easily demonstrated. The Environmental Protection Agency's December 1992 report, Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other Disorders [Ex. 4&hyph;311], reviewed an abundance of evidence showing persistent physiologic changes in children's respiratory function and related health effects as a result of exposure to ETS. Studies evaluating these same effects are not as plentiful in adults. However, the EPA concluded, ``recent evidence suggests that passive smoking has subtle but statistically significant effects on the respiratory health of adults'' [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. The weight of the evidence shows that exposure to ETS results in decreases in pulmonary function indices and increases in respiratory symptoms in otherwise healthy men and women who are exposed to ETS for periods of 10 or more years. The risk of developing COPD appears to be increased in passive smokers with lifelong exposures to ETS. Whether these changes impact upon respiratory function to a degree that impairment occurs may be dependent upon the individual's pulmonary status and overall health condition. 4. Cardiovascular Effects A developing body of research indicates that the cardiovascular effects of ETS exposure on the health of nonsmokers include acute effects, such as exacerbation of angina, as well as chronic effects, such as atherosclerosis [Exs. 4&hyph;123, 4&hyph;291, 4&hyph;330]. Cardiovascular diseases [Exs. 4&hyph;91, 4&hyph;136] such as myocardial infarction [Ex. 4&hyph;12], sudden death, and arterial thrombosis occur more frequently in cigarette smokers as opposed to nonsmokers [Exs. 4&hyph;86, 4&hyph;233]. The same chemicals which produce these effects in active smokers are present in ETS. These include nicotine, carbon monoxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and tobacco glycoproteins. The following discussion on cardiovascular effects covers thrombus formation, vascular wall injury and the possible mechanisms of these effects in nonsmokers. Discussion of the acute and chronic health effects follows. (a) Thrombus Formation. Blood clots in the coronary arteries are an important component of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). An additional component of the acute MI is the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in the walls of the coronary arteries. Platelets are involved in both the acute formation of blood clots and the chronic formation of atherosclerotic plaques. There is evidence that ETS exposure can cause platelets to become more easily activated thus predisposing the platelets to become involved in forming clots and atherosclerotic plaques. For example, evidence exists that demonstrates that the platelets of nonsmokers exposed to ETS are more easily activated [Exs. 4&hyph;40, 4&hyph;80]. The study by Burghuber [Exs. 4&hyph;40] demonstrates that the platelet activating capabilities of ETS are more prominent in nonsmokers than in smokers. The results of this study suggest that nonsmokers are at a greater risk of blood clot formation secondary to ETS exposure than smokers. Acute ETS exposure also results in an increased platelet aggregation, which is an initial stage of the development of coronary thrombosis or vasoconstriction. This vasoconstriction can lead to the development of coronary atherosclerosis after chronic exposure [Exs. 4&hyph;111, 4&hyph;123, 4&hyph;272]. Environmental smoke exposure also can increase platelet-activating factor (PAF), platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, and fibrinogen concentration which provides a marker of its effect on coronary heart disease [Exs. 4&hyph;85, 4&hyph;157, 4&hyph;224]. (b) Vascular Wall Injury. Atherosclerotic plaque formation is a complicated chronic process that can lead to constriction of the lumen of the blood vessels, resulting in reduced blood supply to the myocardial tissues. It is thought that an essential step in plaque formation is injury to the endothelial lining of the arterial wall. ETS has been implicated in causing injury to the endothelial cells which line the arterial walls. This was demonstrated in the study by Davis et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;80] which identified an increase in the number of endothelial cell carcasses in the circulation of healthy people after being exposed to ETS. ETS has also been implicated in stimulating smooth muscle cell proliferation and in altering blood lipids. Each of these can contribute to plaque formation which leads to an increased susceptibility to heart attacks. (c) Possible Mechanisms of Effect. At least three mechanisms are described in the literature by which ETS may place stress on the heart by increasing myocardial oxygen demand, decreasing myocardial oxygen supply or interfering with the cell's ability to utilize oxygen for energy production. One mechanism by which ETS may reduce oxygen supply is through the formation of carboxyhemoglobin. Carboxyhemoglobin is formed when a person is exposed to carbon monoxide, a component of ETS. The carbon monoxide effectively competes with oxygen for the heme group of the hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell (RBC). In fact, carbon monoxide has a much greater affinity for hemoglobin than does oxygen and binds very strongly with hemoglobin making it unavailable for the transport of oxygen. The heart muscle (myocardium) can experience injury at the cellular level when the oxygen demanded by the heart muscle exceeds the oxygen supplied by the blood. Therefore, the formation of carboxyhemoglobin can decrease the ability of the blood to deliver oxygen to the myocardium and can cause injury to the heart if myocardial oxygen demand exceeds supply.
