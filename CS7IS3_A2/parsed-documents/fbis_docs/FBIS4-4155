About 40 percent of the projects are categorized as fundamental or basic research, and all of them will be supported for a period of up to three years. The research areas to be funded include new and improved materials, manufacturing technology, advanced automotive components, computer science and engineering and automotive technology. The 1.6 million U.S. dollar fund was set up last October by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Ford Company of the United States. A technical advisory committee with representatives from both the Chinese and U.S. sides made the final selection from more than 90 grant proposals received since the program was created. "The establishment of the fund opens a new chapter in China's cooperation with foreign corporations in fundamental research," said Song Jian, State Councillor and minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, at the presentation ceremony held at the Great Hall of the People today. "China appreciates Ford's decision to sponsor this form of cooperation." He described the cooperation between Ford and NSFC as a very meaningful one. Ford has contributed 800,000 U.S. dollars for the project, and the NSFC provided an in-kind contribution of equivalent value. James Paulsen, president of Ford China Operations, called the project an excellent example of cooperation between U.S. and Chinese interests, and China, Ford and the worldwide scientific community would all benefit from these projects.
