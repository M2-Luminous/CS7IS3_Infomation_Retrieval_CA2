In the 22 June meeting, setting of objective criteria and such issues as postponing deregulation on the "third sector" like disease and damage insurance were discussed, but no agreement was made as "there was considerable distance in positions between the two parties" (according to the Finance Ministry). Another meeting is expected to be held in Washington next week. The United States is beginning to show the possibility of making concessions in some issues, and the next meeting is likely to be a final round as both nations are seeking to finalize negotiations by the time of the industrialized nations' summit in July (the Naples Summit). At the latest meeting, both parties began drafting a document on what has been agreed on so far, and discussed pending issues, including setting objective criteria. In the criteria to measure the degree of market liberalization (according to the Finance Ministry), there was a proposal from qualitative and quantitative perspectives, but the Japanese delegation was not responsive to it. No progress appears to have been made in the issue of the third- sector or the question of correcting keiretsu-tied business practices either. The U.S. concession plan proposes preparing a uniform model in determining criteria for issuing permits for insurance businesses and urging all U.S. state governments to adopt this model. At present, the states have independent permit systems, and this has been pointed out by Japan as a barrier in the U.S. market. Both countries agreed to include this plan in the agreement document, and are now working on the details.
