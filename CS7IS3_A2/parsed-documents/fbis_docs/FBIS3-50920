In a news conference held at the Legislative Palace yesterday, Molirena legislators released a communique warning that their proposal "must be implemented urgently because Panamanian democracy is dying and disintegrating with every passing minute." Molirena faction spokeswoman Gisela Chung said the Molirena legislators' call to unity is to th e Christian Democratic Party, the new parties, and the civic forces that fought for democracy. Chung said the civic forces reached an agreement at the assembly level, but, unfortunately, the same has not been done yet at the leadership level among the ruling parties. According to Chung, the people are surprised at how little ability the parties have for a constructive dialogue and effective understanding to reach the unity which will prevent the military's return through the civilians, who backed the cruel dictatorship for many years. "It is not possible therefore that a presidential ticket of the democratic forces cannot be formed because of intransigent and haughty positions, senseless self-deception, inappropriate arrogance, and petty shortsightedness," Chung noted. She said the country's legislators are even willing to give up personal political aspirations and added that they are urging party leaders to contribute.
