"We call upon our brothers in Fatah to join hands and escalate the intifada and holy war against the enemy," said an open letter signed by Hamas. In a separate statement, the group, which is dominant in the occupied Gaza Strip, warned Palestinian negotiators to quit the peace talks or face unspecified consquences. Hamas is the largest religious-oriented group in the occupied territories challenging the domination of the PLO and Fatah, which is led by Yasir 'Arafat, who is also chairman of the PLO. Hamas and Fatah, at two ends of political ideology, have been locked in a power struggle in elections to various Palestinian organisations and student unions in the occupied territries. "The (massacre in Hebron) in which hundreds of our people died confirms the righteousness of the resistance and armed struggle... and exposes the Zionists' claims that they wish to live with our people in peace," said the statement. In its open letter, a copy of which was made available to the Jordan Times, Hamas urged "our brothers in Fatah ... to respond to this brotherhly and national call ... to abort the surrendering scheme led by the Oslo men." Hamas, while vowing to wreck the autonomy accord through escalated attacks against Israeli targets, appeared to drop its earlier stand that it would not take up arms against fellow Palestinians. In its message addressed to the Palestinians in the occupied territories, Hamas threatened Palestinian negotiators with attacks if they do not withdraw from negotiations with Israel. "We demand that the Oslo team announce their immediate withdrawal from the negotiations with Israel ... we will not allow a handful of us (Palestinians) to continue negotiationbs with those murderers at the expense of the Palestinian people," said the letter. The letter also called on the Palestinians in the occupied territories to observe a three-day general strike, escalate the intifada and carry out revenege attacks against Israeli soldiers and settlers and engage in fights with them. "We call on our people to avenge the killing of our martyrs and consider the occupation troops and settlers as permanent targets wherever they may be," read the letter. The letter also called for demonstrations and marches throughout the occupied territories. It also called on the people of Hebron to protect the Ibrahimi mosque and continue praying in it. Salih Ra'fat, of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) Sunday urged the PLO to freeze its negotiations with Israel. He also called on Mr. 'Arafat not to respond to U.S. President Bill Clinton's call for a summit with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Washington. Reports of such an invitation by Mr. Clinton were Saturday denied by a spokesman for Mr. Rabin, who said that the only invitation out of Washington was to lower-level peace negotiators to resume the talks. But other sources confirmed the invitation. Mr. Ra'fat also called for the protection of the Palestinians in the occupied territories, the dismantling of settlements and the disarming of Jewish settlers. Sulayman al-Najjab, member of the PLO Executive Committee, called for the suspension of the peace negotiations with Israel for the time being until they are preceded with conditions that are in line with international legitimacy.
