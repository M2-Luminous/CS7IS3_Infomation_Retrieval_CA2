FR940617-2-00216 FR940617-2-00117 Section VI. Review and Selection Process U. How will pre-applications be reviewed and who will conduct the reviews? Pre-applications will be reviewed in two phases_the screening phase and the evaluation phase. During the screening phase, pre-applications will be reviewed to determine whether they are consistent with the requirements described in Section IV.L.1&hyph;5., Section IV.M.1&hyph;4., and Section V.S.3.a-d. Only those pre-applications which meet all of these requirements will enter the evaluation phase of the review process. During the evaluation phase, pre-applications will be evaluated based upon the quality of their work plans, especially the degree to which the work plan meets the requirements set forth in Section IV.N.1.a-c. and Section IV.N.2.a-d. Reviewers conducting the screening and evaluation phases of the review process will include EPA officials and external environmental educators approved by EPA. At the conclusion of the evaluation phase, the reviewers will rank each applicant's work plan based upon the scoring system identified in Section V.S.3.a, b, c, and d. V. How will the final selections be made? After individual projects are evaluated and ranked by the reviewers as described under Section VI.U. above, EPA officials in the regions and at headquarters will identify finalists among the highest ranking pre-applications. In identifying finalists and making final selections, EPA's goal is to fund projects that, when viewed together, provide a balance among the types of projects being funded, by taking into account the following: 1. The target audience and their socioeconomic status; 2. The methods used to reach the target audience; 3. The type of organization submitting the proposal and/or whether the proposal makes effective use of partnerships; 4. The type of environmental issue addressed; 5. The geographic location of the project; and 6. The cost. In reference to socioeconomic status, under Section VI.V.1. above, EPA's goal is to encourage applicants to submit proposals that promote environmental justice for culturally-diverse and low-income populations. EPA hopes to fund many proposals which score high in the evaluation process and which promote environmental justice. The term environmental justice refers to the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and income with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Fair treatment means that no racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic group should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from the operation of industrial, municipal, and commercial enterprises and from the execution of federal, state, local, and tribal programs and policies. Efforts to address environmental justice through environmental education may include educational programs that provide culturally-diverse and low-income populations with critical-thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills to identify, assess, and address an environmental problem that has a disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental impact in their community. In reference to the effective use of partnerships, under Section VI.V.3. above, EPA's goal is to encourage applicants to submit proposals which form partnerships, where possible. EPA hopes to fund many proposals which score high in the evaluation process and which promote the effective use of partnerships between organizations. The term partnerships refers to forming a collaborative working relationship between two or more organizations such as governmental agencies, non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and/or the private sector. In reference to the type of environmental issue, under Section VI.V.4. above, EPA's goal is to encourage applicant to submit proposals which use pollution prevention concepts or techniques to address a high priority environmental issue (as discussed under Section IV.N.1.c.). EPA hopes to fund many proposals which score high in the evaluation process and which convey the importance of pollution prevention. The term pollution prevention refers to reducing or eliminating waste or pollution at the source. It means not creating waste or pollution in the first place, instead of deciding how to recycle, treat, or dispose of waste and pollution that has already been created. Pollution prevention may include increasing energy efficiency and resource conservation efforts, as well as finding non-polluting substitutes for existing products and activities. Pollution prevention is not the only strategy that EPA uses to reduce risk to public health and the environment, but it is EPA's preferred approach. Efforts to promote pollution prevention through environmental education may include projects that educate the public about the value of preventive approaches to environmental problems and the choices they can make in their everyday lives to minimize adverse effects of human activities on the environment (e.g., in the home, work place, market place, and/or community).
