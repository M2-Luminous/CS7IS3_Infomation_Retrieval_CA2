FR940127-2-00024 FR940127-2-00016 Data analysis efforts should focus on making maximum use of UAV-derived data, in conjunction with CART and other data sources, to address key radiative heating issues and to provide calibration/validation of satellite derived data products. In addition, the investigators funded for these efforts are expected to assist in planning the future missions to include locations, mission profiles, and instrument complement. Mission planning will be conducted by these investigators, UAV instrument developers and interested members of the ARM science team, and the UAV mission planning group. Proposed instruments for the UAV missions should provide data relevant and of unique value to the mission's objectives. Instruments should be compatible with use on a small UAV as part of a multi-instrument payload. Typically they should weigh less than 30 kg, draw less than 100 W, and occupy less than 1.01m3. Instruments must be capable of autonomous operation fully exposed to the ambient atmosphere. The UAV payload interface will provide power to the instrument through a DC Bus (voltage negotiable) and will also provide for telemetering the data stream to the ground. Applications for instrument development should include optimum conditions for taking data from the proposed instrument as well as requirements for other instruments on-board or required from other platforms (e.g., the ARM site). The proposed instruments will be subject to a review at six months after the award. A decision on which instruments to bring to operational capability will be made at the six month review. It is anticipated that approximately $3.5M will be available for awards for these activities contingent on availability of appropriated funds. Multiple year funding is expected, also contingent upon the availability of funds. The allocation of funds will depend on the number and quality of applications received. Typical Environmental Sciences Division awards are $200,000 per year, but range between $50,000 and $750,000. The technical portions of the applications should not exceed twenty-five (25) double-spaced pages, and should be accompanied by an abstract of not more than two paragraphs. Information on the development and submission of applications, eligibility, limitations, evaluation, selection process, and other policies and procedures may be found in the Application Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program and 10 CFR part 605. The Application Guide is available from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Health and Environmental Research, Environmental Sciences Division, ER&hyph;74 (GTN), Washington, DC 20585. Telephone requests may be made by calling (301) 903&hyph;4902 . The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for this program is 81.049. Issued in Washington, DC, on January 14, 1994. D.D.
