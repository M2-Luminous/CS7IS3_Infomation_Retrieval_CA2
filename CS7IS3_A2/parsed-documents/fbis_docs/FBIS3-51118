FBIS3-51118 "drlat010__a94004" FBIS-LAT-94-010-A Document Type:Daily Report 14 January 1994 ANNEX Cuba Foreign Minister Expects No Change in Relations With U.S. PA0701164894 Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 0337 GMT 7 Jan 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PA0701164894 Havana PRENSA LATINA Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Report by Alejandro Gomez] [Text] Havana, 6 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said today that 1994 offers no special prospects for changes in Cuba's relationship with the United States. During a news conference shortly before departing on a tour of five African nations, Robaina pointed out that Cuba cannot decide whether there will be changes in those relations because the island has defined its position, and it is now up to Washington to change its policies. We should not be overly enthusiastic about the absence of aggressive language because this can be the case even while, as is currently happening, the blockade is intensified. Under such conditions there is not room for much, Robaina said. Regarding a list of political prisoners given to American clergyman Jesse Jackson during a recent visit to Havana, Robaina pointed out that he has categorically asserted that Cuba may have many concerns, but it does not work through requests or lists. The fact that at a given moment, under certain circumstances we agreed to this in 1984 [as received] does not mean that it will always be the case. Nevertheless, Robaina pointed out, Jackson requested information concerning certain cases and the government provided him with the information. He did not request that anyone be released. The Cuban diplomat underscored that Cuba was not under any obligation to present the list and does not have to respond for the people listed, because their situation does not exactly depend on a request or on the difficulties that may emerge during a negotiations process. Robaina added that the first thing that is evaluated during a penal process is what the person's current situation is, what sentence he received, and how he has behaved. It is not a phenomenon based on lists because there are many lists floating around the world but there is a lack of information concerning the people who are on those lists, he said. Regarding Cuba's relations with other areas of the world, Robaina said that 1994 offers new opportunities which may not necessarily be for the better or very lofty or numerous. Today we have a situation in Latin America that we did not have in the past; we have formed a joint commission with the Caribbean that did not exist in 1993, we are about to participate in a technical meeting to create the Association of Caribbean States, and we are preparing the Fourth Spanish-speaking Latin American summit scheduled to be held in Cartagena. Furthermore, Robaina added, we recently held a meeting with representatives from the European Parliament which is a sign of a new relationship with that community. We have not asked anyone to share in what we are doing, Robaina underscored, adding that it is not necessary to share what Cuba is doing but to respect it. Cuba, he said, is willing to maintain exchanges with the entire world, including the United States. Concerning his two-week tour of five countries on the African continent, the foreign minister said it will help to strengthen Cuba's already magnificent relations with the governments of those countries. Although an expansion of Cuban civil cooperation with those states is not expected, Robaina pointed out that Cuba might cooperate with them in areas such as health, education, culture and sports. Robaina pointed out that he basically wants to brief those countries on the island's current reality and identify areas in which relations could be strengthened, especially economic relations which, due to the current opening, offer magnificent investment opportunities for African businessmen. Regarding the internal situation in Angola -- one of the countries he is scheduled to visit -- Robaina pointed out that it is up to the Angolan people to find a solution. In response to a question regarding Cuba's position on the negotiations process in South Africa, Robaina said that his country is closely following it. During this first trip to Africa since his appointment in April, the Cuban foreign minister will make official visits to Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Namibia, in that order. Prior to his arrival in Accra, capital of Ghana, Robaina will take advantage of a brief stopover in Zurich to meet with Swiss officials from the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Economic Relations Ministry, PRENSA LATINA was told by Tomas Lorenzo, head of Robaina's office. Robaina, accompanied by a small entourage, will meet with President Jerry Rawlings (Ghana), Jose Eduardo Dos Santos (Angola), Robert Mugabe (Zimbabwe), Frederick Chiluba (Zambia) and Sam Nujoma (Namibia).
