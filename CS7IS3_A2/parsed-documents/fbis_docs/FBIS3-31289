In January the rate of unemployment was 16 percent, an increase of 1.9 percent on December. Also on Tuesday Deputy Labour Minister Jerzy Szreter told a press conference that the rise in unemployment probably had a seasonal character, and should be halted in March. However, he feared that the anticipated number of unemployed of 3.05 million at the end of 1994 might be "threatened" unless more money was allocated for active forms of combatting unemployment. Unemployment rose in 48 provinces in January with the highest growth in Chelm (by 6.3 percent) and Cracow (5.3 percent) provinces. The highest rate of unemployment was recorded in Koszalin (29.3 percent) and Suwalki (28.9 percent) provinces, the lowest in Cracow (7.6 percent) and Warsaw (7.9 percent) provinces.
