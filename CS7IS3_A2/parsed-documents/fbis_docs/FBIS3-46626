It appears the new SDPJ faction is getting ready for a breakaway from the party when Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and the ideology-oriented factions react negatively toward the enactment of the political reform bills. In fact, the Democrats are steadily promoting "exchanges" with the Japan New Party [JNP] and the Sakigake. The weak point of the Democrats is the fact that they have no prominent leader yet, but many members expect Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi to return to the Diet to lead them. If that happens, the Democrats may trigger the second stage of political regrouping, with some members actively seeking the foundation of "a troika party led by three ex-governors -- Prime Minister Hosokawa, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, and Mr. Yokomichi as the leader of the Democrats." Forty Dietmen Gather at Founding Assembly On 22 December, or the day following the launch of the Democrats, SDPJ Diet Administration Committee Chairman Koken Nosaka criticized Vice Chairman Churyo Morii in the Diet for participating in the Democrats as a commissioner. Nosaka said: "I do not think organizing a new, giant faction is a good idea. Even in my faction there are members seeking to form new groups, but I am stopping them from such reckless action." Morii, however, did not take the complaint seriously, and answered: "I agree with you. I just allowed them to use my name. That was all I did." Nosaka angrily said: "If you really agreed with me you would have tried to stop them." The founding assembly of the Democrats comprised 40 SDPJ Diet members from both the rightist and middle-of-the-road factions. Members include former SDPJ Chairman Makoto Tanabe and former Secretary General Hirotaka Akamatsu. While such interfactional movements have never had any success so far in the SDPJ, the foundation of the Democrats may represent the turning-point for the party. In an address given to the founding assembly, Secretary General Shogo Abe of the Social Democratic Federation said emotionally: "I feel my party has now completed its historical role." SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo did not address the assembly out of consideration for the position of Chairman Tomiichi Murayama; however, the group adopted as its main objective the "regrouping of political parties" rather than the SDPJ rightists' conventional goal of "party reform." The Democrats use their broadly-acceptable name to actively seek ties with other parties. As the secretary general of the Democrats, former Secretary General Akamatsu attended the first meeting of a study group on "long-term and basic problems" on 22 December. It was jointly organized by the Democrats and some JNP members. Akamatsu stressed that "closer ties between the Democrats and the JNP will trigger a greater trend toward political regrouping." The study group was organized by 26 members, with equal numbers from the JNP and the SDPJ. The SDPJ members all belong to the Democrats. In its platform, the Democrats declared policy is to seek "small central government and big local government." This is also an objective of the study group. On the evening of the same day, Democrats Commissioner Masanori Goto met with Representative Kenichiro Sato and other Sakigake members. They discussed positively a "three-party tie-up between the JNP, Sakigake, and the SDPJ." Goto proposed: "The JNP, the Sakigake, and the SDPJ should carry out a nationwide campaign tour next spring. It will have a great impact on the public." Receiving Yokomichi as Deputy Prime Minister On the evening of 21 December, SDPJ ideologists held a meeting as if in competition with the Democrats. At the meeting, SDPJ Chairman Murayama predicted: "The coalition government may make further concessions to the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] on the political reform bills, and further revise them to bring them more into line with the LDP proposal. This means the coalition is deserting the SDPJ. In mid-January, the SDPJ is likely to be faced with the ultimate choice." SDPJ ideologists will not accept drastic concessions on the political reform bills, but Murayama is afraid the "Democrats may support the coalition even against the wishes of the party leadership." When Diet debates on the political reform bills reach a climax in mid-January, the SDPJ will face a crucial choice. The Democrats group, meanwhile, is not yet fully active because it "has a team flag but no captain." The faction is currently led by nine commissioners selected from eight pro-coalition factions. The lack of one prominent leader is the reason the Democrats want Governor Yokomichi, who used to serve as an SDPJ lower house member, as their leader alongside Hosokawa and Takemura. The Democrats, JNP members, and major union officials are excited about the idea of getting Yokomichi back to the Diet. Some of them say: "The Democrats, the JNP, Sakigake, LDP reformists, and some Democratic Socialist Party members should form a 100-man party now, before the next general election, to start a new trend in Japanese politics. If that were to happen, the party would become popular under its troika leadership of Hosokawa, Takemura, and Yokomichi." Yet others say: "If Mr. Yokomichi returns to the lower house, we would prepare for him the post of deputy prime minister." SDPJ Secretary General Kubo was an ally of Yokomichi when they organized the New Trend Association [Atarashii Nagare-no-kai]. An SDPJ cabinet member said: "At that time, Mr. Kubo's dream was to serve as the party secretary general under Chairman Yokomichi. I think he still has the dream." "Differences" in Attitudes of JNP Members In mid-December, Governor Yokomichi visited Tokyo to make petitions about the 1994 budget; however, he had positive meetings with senior SDPJ officials and labor unions during his stay. On 24 December, he held a news conference at the Hokkaido Prefectural Government's Tokyo office, and announced "I am now working on Hokkaido's fiscal 1994 budget, and I have to serve my third term to the end." However, when he met Shinseito officials Yokomichi reportedly said he might resign from the prefectural government after enacting the fiscal 1994 budget. He was quoted then as saying: "If the general election is held in January, I cannot run in that. The governor's position is different from that of an assemblyman because I have to fulfill my responsibility to the public by enacting the 1994 budget for Hokkaido." Governor Yokomichi is unlikely to take action if there is an election in January. Members of the Democrats are irritated by this, saying "contrary to our expectations he seems to be a man of indecision." At the JNP secretaries' meeting held on 22 December, Vice Secretary General Seishu Makino called reported the foundation of the long-term problem study group and called it a joint JNP-SDPJ group. Secretary Kodo Kohata reacted strongly to this, saying: "What I want is not an explanation, but your apology." There are many pro-Shinseito members in the JNP, and they do not really welcome closer ties with the SDPJ Democrats. SDPJ Democrats may have great expectations of political events next year, but they still feel a sense of uncertainty.
