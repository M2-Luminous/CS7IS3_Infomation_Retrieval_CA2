Believing that Russia should derive definite benefits from the destruction of combat toxic agents, they moved to include in the state budget a separate item, envisaging spendings on disarmament and conversion programmes. Moreover, the scientists hold, it is necessary to launch a broad explanatory campaign and to discuss in a professional way all the problems linked with the destruction of weapons. ITAR-TASS was told by Major-General Yuriy Tarasevich, assistant commander of radiation, chemical and biological defence forces of the Russian Federation, who took part in the deliberations, that a concept has already been drawn up for scrapping combat toxic substances, but this required special financing. Shortage of money for the development of special technologies, construction of various installations and other jobs, envisaged by the complex programme, retards the implementation of the already adopted decisions. General Tarasevich believes that this year will be decisive for preparations to begin the planned destruction of chemical weapons. He denied rumours and publications on the alleged "incineration of chemical shells". "All the ammunition is being reliably guarded and poses no threat to the environment," Tarasevich said. He believes they could remain stored for several more years. "It would be wrong to shift the difficult job of destroying them to the next generation. There is every opportunity to do it now, relying on international agreements," Tarasevich noted.
