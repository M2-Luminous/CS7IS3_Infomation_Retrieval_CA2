There are only Russian citizens who arrive in the republic to see their families, INTERFAX was told by the Chief of the General Staff of the Lithuanian Army Stasys Knezys. The statements about the presence of some other Russian servicemen in the republic, said Knezys, are groundless. The general staff of the Lithuanian Army has no information about incidents involving Russian servicemen, he said. The statement was a response to the recent claim by the former commander of the coastal guard division, stationed in the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda, Major General Ivan Chernykh, that staying in Klaipeda are approximately 150 Russian officers "whose future has not been decided by the Russian Defence Ministry." He said that Lithuanian law enforcement bodies attempted last week to arrest one of the officers, Colonel Vitaliy Yegorov, who had been warned in advance and escaped the arrest.
