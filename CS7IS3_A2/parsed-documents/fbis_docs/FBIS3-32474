TRABAJADORES, the official newspaper of the Cuban Workers Federation, has written in an editorial the subject has gained prominence in all of the meetings taking place in factories and institutions to gather opinions and proposals aimed at drafting regulations that will contribute to the improvement of the economy. TRABAJADORES has said during the past four years the breach between monetary liquidity in the people's hands and the official offering of goods and services have broadened the negative consequences of a recessed economy [economia sumergida) and the black market to limits that are increasingly unbearable economically, socially, and politically. The editorial then explains the recessed economy, with a relatively small physical volume of products, is taking away the largest part of workers' salaries due to high prices, something which reflects an inflationary process that is hardly noticeable in the state price policy. TRABAJADORES has said the huge difference in prices is an invitation to crime, because many people who handle state funds and become sellers can be tempted to take advantage of lack administrative controls and actions against the so-called "missing funds" ["faltantes"] to steal merchandise and obtain an additional income. The labor parliament--the name given to the meetings held by workers to discuss the country's economic problems and give possible solutions--has expressed its rejection of these practices, which are amoral and harmful to the country. The editorial acknowledges, next to private producers, the state enterprise today is the main source of income to that recessed economy. The editorial later criticizes the irresponsibility and neglect displayed in the economic control operations in both the flow of goods [flujos materiales] and basic financial elements. TRABAJADORES stresses the accounting, cost, inventories, exact measurement of consumption, and discipline of collection and payments are the tools to fight corruption and disorder in any workplace. The editorial stresses it is the unions' responsibility, because they own the means of production, to insure worker's control and a proper settlement of accounts for the proper use of material and financial resources.
