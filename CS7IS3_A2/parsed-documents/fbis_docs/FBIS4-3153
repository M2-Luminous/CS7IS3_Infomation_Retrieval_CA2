Song, also minister in charge of the State Science and Technology Commission, said that there had been problems in developing the cooperation in science and technology, but they had all been solved with concerted efforts by scientists of the two countries. He expressed confidence that Chinese and U.S. political and business leaders could do the same in case of difficulties. Song made these remarks here tonight during a reception given by Zhang Weichao, China's consul-general in New York, in honor of Song for his visit to New York city. Earlier this week, Song attended the Sixth Session of the Sino- U.S. Joint Working Committee on Cooperation of Science and Technology held in Washington. U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with Song and his delegation on April 12. In his speech tonight, Song also expressed his hope that the momentum seen in cooperation of science and technology between the two countries would be maintained and that the fields of cooperation further expanded. "China imports more than 100 billion U.S. dollars worth of commodities each year from foreign countries," he said, "and we hope our American friends from the scientific, technological and business circles will seize this opportunity to engage more actively in economic, trade, scientific and technological cooperation with China." Also attending the reception were more than 100 leaders from science and business circles in New York.
