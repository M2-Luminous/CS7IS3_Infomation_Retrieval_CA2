Al-Baghli also confirmed that oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) would meet in the Saudi port of Jeddah next month to discuss prices ahead of OPEC's talks on March 25. "Kuwait is ready to lower its oil output if other producers commit themselves to reductions," he told AFP in an interview. "Kuwait is willing to abide by any agreement or decision at the March 25 meeting." The emirate produces two million barrels per day (b/d) under a six-month quota agreement by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Since the end of the Iraqi occupation of the emirate in February 1991, it had previously violated its quota to press the 12-nation cartel for a higher share. OPEC oil ministers are due to discuss cutting the official production ceiling of 24.5 million b/d for the second quarter to support prices, which have remained nearly seven dollars below its benchmark of 21 dollars. The GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates -- have offered to trim production if other oil exporters agree to do the same. Omani Oil minister Sa'id Bin-Ahmad al-Shanfari said last week that most of the countries he had visited to seek their support for OPEC were willing to cut production. But he did not specify how much they were ready to cut. During talks in Doha last week, OPEC president 'Abdallah Bin-Hamad al-'Atiyah of Qatar and Nigerian Oil Minister Don Etiebet proposed a five to 10 percent reduction in the organisation's October-March ceiling. Etiebet also had talks with Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazir but it was not clear if the kingdom backed the proposed cut. "I am optimistic that oil prices will improve in the next stage," Baghli said, declining to elaborate. "Oil prices will be on top of the subjects to be discussed by the GCC oil ministers in Jeddah," he added. "But so far, there is no specific agenda." GCC states produce more than half of OPEC's oil output and one fifth of the world's. The price fall has hit them hardest as crude accounts for more than 80 percent of their total exports.
