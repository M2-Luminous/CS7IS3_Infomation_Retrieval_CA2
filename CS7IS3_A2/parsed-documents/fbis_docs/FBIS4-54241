Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, has also welcomed the announcement and the decision to remove the link between China's trade status and human rights issue. Senator Evans said it was unlikely that the withdrawal of Most Favored Nation status would have significantly advanced the human rights cause in China. [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0535 GMT on 27 May, in a similar report, adds: "Canberra said pressure on China to make human rights improvements in order to get MFN status again had appeared counterproductive, with change in China being more grudging than it might otherwise have been. `Trade and investment is playing a catalytic role in China's economic reform through the introduction of ideas, capital, technology and foreign exchange,' Evans said. Economic growth and liberalisation would `generate their own momentum for political liberalisation,' he said. `The Australian Government agrees with President Clinton's sentiment that, if we are serious about improving human rights, the best path is now to intensify and broaden engagement between the US and China,' Evans said. ["In a statement echoing the view of trade analysts here, opposition trade spokesman Tim Fischer said the US decision was correct and that withdrawal of MFN status would have threatened Australia's trade, especially in wool. `China has been extremely successful in value-adding to its purchases of Australian wool and in marketing woollen clothing in the US. This outcome is clearly a breakthrough for US trade policy that was showing signs of faltering, and will be welcomed by Australia's wool growers.'"]
