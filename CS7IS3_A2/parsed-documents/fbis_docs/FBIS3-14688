They see King Husayn's brave stand as a reflection of their deep feelings of being deceived throughout the past. This is especially so since the siege imposed by the U.S. Navy on the Port of al-'Aqabah encroaches on what is most valuable for Jordan -- its dignity and its national reputation. The siege directly encroaches on Jordan's sovereignty, in addition to the economic losses it causes and the difficulties it produces, which add to the difficulties Jordan faces in the wake of the Gulf war. In light of this, Jordan justly and legitimately demands the lifting of the unfair and unjustified siege of the only port linking it to the outside world. It demands that naval forces stationed in international waters stop dealing with Jordan as an outlaw country that is secretly violating international resolutions. Hence, any measure intended to be a quick solution to the siege of the Port of al-'Aqabah will be rejected if it is conditional on the presence of U.S. barges in the Jordanian port. This is especially so because such a solution would be a blatant violation of the sovereignty of an independent country and a UN member that has not committed any violation that stipulates such punishment. In return, Jordan -- which accepted the UN Security Council resolutions without being convinced about them and which avoided as much as possible appearing as a violator of international legitimacy resolutions that deal with the ongoing siege -- accepts the presence of international employees to inspect the goods arriving at the Port of al-'Aqabah. In other words, it accepts the presence of a neutral international party delegated by the United Nations to inspect incoming ships. We believe the stand bravely expressed by His Majesty King Husayn reflects the feelings of every citizen in this patient and mobilized country. We realize at the same time that the siege of the Port of al-'Aqabah is an issue that goes beyond implementing the UN embargo on Iraq. It reaches the level of exercising political pressure and compelling Jordan to accept what it did not accept in the ongoing peace process. This prompts us to stand together in support of King Husayn's stand to reject every encroachment on our sovereignty and national dignity.
