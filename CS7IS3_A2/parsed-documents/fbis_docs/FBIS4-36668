It was the first time since the civil war broke out five weeks ago that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's troops were reported to be in Hadhramaut, with the fighting so far centred around Aden and Shabwah provinces. Al-Bid, who declared a breakaway southern state on May 21, has been based in his home town of al-Mukalla for several weeks, after moving from his political headquarters in the southern port of Aden. UN peace envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi was Sunday headed for al-Mukalla to meet al-Bid, after visits to Sanaa, Amman, the Saudi city of Jeddah, and Muscat. "Our forces are ready to mount an assault on al-Mukalla within 48 hours, once we have received the order from the military command in Sanaa," Colonel 'Abdallah 'Aliwi told an AFP correspondent in Mayfa', west of the port. The first northern lines were around 55 kilometres (33 miles) from al-Mukalla, in a mountainous a?ea overlooking the coastal town of Burum on the Arabian Sea. Another officer said the forward positions were established Thursday night. The two sides fight artillery duels and southern warplanes carry out raids over the northern army posts, he said. Three soldiers were wounded on Saturday as shells crashed around 20 metres (yards) from an army escort for journalists touring the region. Northern units hit back with rounds of artillery fire. "If the southern bombardment keeps up, we will be forced to resume our advance toward Burum and al-Mukalla," said Colonel 'Ali Haydar Salih, head of the army's 5th Brigade which was fortifying its positions. On the road from 'Ataq in the neighbouring oil province of Shabwah and Mayfa'ah, northern troops have total control. But the route was filled with craters, which northern officers said were caused by southern air raids. The empty casings of anti- aircraft rockets littered the sides of the road.
