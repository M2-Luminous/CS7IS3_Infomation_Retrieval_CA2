It says, in particular: On 1 April this year, Mr. Hryshankov, the head of the Crimean president's administration, familiarized me with Mr. Meshkov's decree relieving me of my duties as the president of the Krym TV and Radio Company, and the decree appointing another person to this post. The reasons for my dismissal are not substantiated, while the content of the decree, from the first sentence to the last, runs counter to the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, and the current laws of Ukraine and Crimea. The decree is unlawful for a number of reasons. Firstly, according to the provision on the Krym State Television and Radio Company, its president is appointed by the Supreme Council of Crimea for a period of five years, following the nomination of a candidate agreed with the Ukrainian Television and Radio Company and the Crimean Council of Ministers. Secondly, at the time when the decree was signed and until today, I remain a people's deputy of the republic's Supreme Council, which is still in office, since the new Supreme Council of Crimea has not been elected yet. Yuriy Meshkov's decree has been contested by Mykola Okhamkevych, the president of the Ukrainian Television and Radio Company. Therefore, Valeriy Astakhov stresses, I regard the decrees by the president of the Republic of Crimea as unlawful and refuse to comply with them.
