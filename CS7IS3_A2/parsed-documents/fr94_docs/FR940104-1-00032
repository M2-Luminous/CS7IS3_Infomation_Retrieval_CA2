FR940104-1-00032 FR940104-1-00007 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [W12&hyph;2&hyph;5550; FRL&hyph;4821&hyph;2] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Wisconsin AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rule. SUMMARY: USEPA is proposing to disapprove the State of Wisconsin's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Rules, Natural Resources (NR) 405.01 through 405.17, as a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP). The State developed the rules as Wisconsin's plan to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in areas designated as unclassifiable or attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and to satisfy the requirements of part C of the Clean Air Act (Act). USEPA proposes to disapprove these rules because they do not meet USEPA's regulation governing State PSD programs (40 CFR 51.166). Until USEPA approves a SIP submission from Wisconsin satisfying these requirements, the Federal PSD requirements at 40 CFR 52.21 remain applicable within the State of Wisconsin. DATES: Comments on this revision and on the proposed USEPA action must be received by March 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Carlton Nash, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Please submit an original and five (5) copies, if possible. Copies of the SIP revision request and USEPA's analysis are available at the following address for review: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. It is recommended that you telephone Constantine Blathras at (312) 886&hyph;0671, before visiting the Region 5 Office. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Constantine Blathras, Grants Management and Program Evaluation Section, Air Toxics and Radiation Branch (AT&hyph;18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 886&hyph;0671. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act added part C to title I, which required implementation of a PSD program. On June 19, 1978 USEPA promulgated a PSD program to meet the requirements of part C. It promulgated 40 CFR 51.24 (now 40 CFR 51.166), which listed the requirements a State must meet in order to have a State PSD program approved as a part of its SIP. It promulgated 40 CFR 52.21, which contains the procedures and requirements which USEPA follows when it carries out the mandates of part C itself. These ยง52.21 requirements were then promulgated into those State SIPs where a State did not have an approvable plan in place. Section 52.21 provides that its requirements and authorities, or parts thereof, can be delegated to the State and local air programs if USEPA determines they have the ability and authority to carry out its mandates. On June 19, 1978 (43 FR 26410), USEPA promulgated the Federal PSD program, 40 CFR 52.21(b) through (v), into the Wisconsin SIP at 40 CFR 52.2581 because Wisconsin had not submitted an approvable PSD program. On August 19, 1980 USEPA gave Wisconsin partial delegation to run the Federal PSD Program and on November 13, 1987 gave Wisconsin full delegation of the program. Seeking a SIP approval of the State's PSD Program, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted its PSD rules, NR 405.01 through NR 405.17, to USEPA as a revision to its SIP on March 16, 1987. A further revision to these rules, which addresses oxides of nitrogen (NO x ), was submitted on November 24, 1992. Wisconsin NR 405 deals exclusively with PSD permitting requirements. 1 USEPA evaluated NR 405 by comparing each section of the rule to the appropriate paragraph of 40 CFR 51.166 (formerly 40 CFR 51.24). Although Wisconsin's PSD rules essentially incorporated the Federal PSD provisions in 40 CFR 51.166, USEPA's evaluation revealed deficiencies relative to references to New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), federally issued PSD permits, source-specific allowable emissions, and modeling guidelines. 1 Chapter NR 405 applies the PSD regulation within the total area of the State of Wisconsin. Court decisions have determined that State governments do not have jurisdiction over most Indian lands. This in itself does not affect USEPA's proposal to disapprove the rule, but would have to be addressed by Wisconsin if it submitted a revised rule.
