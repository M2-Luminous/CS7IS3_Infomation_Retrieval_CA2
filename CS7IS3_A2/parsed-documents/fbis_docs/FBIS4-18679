Engelen in Paris on 29 March: "The Central Bank in Paris `Knows How To Protect Its Independence'"] [Text] The Bank of France -- which was released from the government's guardianship in terms of monetary policy at the beginning of the year -- knows how to protect its independence and consistently continue its policy of stability, its governor said. With another good result: Jean-Claude Trichet, who has headed the central bank since September, expects the French inflation rate to drop below 2 percent this year. In the past few years, France managed to reduce the traditional difference in inflation to Germany and, as of 1990 and 1991 even managed to reverse it. The rate of inflation is clearly below Germany's. In an interview with HANDELSBLATT, Trichet emphasized that the two currencies are being regarded as the central pillars of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism [ERM]. It was, of course, not easy to get to that stage, he said, adding that "to break through the vicious circle of high inflation and high interests requires perseverance." Financial Markets Convinced by Course of Stability Yet, the efforts have been worthwhile for the French: The inflationary trend speaks for itself. The financial markets, which were originally skeptical whether the French monetary authorities would be able to maintain a tough policy of stability, have been converted. This optimism explains why not only the short-term, but even the long-term interest rates have long since been adapted to German rates. Trichet was evasive regarding the question of whether the French capacity for interest cuts was not limited by the Bundesbank. Germany and France bear joint responsibility for the stability of a multilateral exchange rate system. The monetary policies of the two countries are complementary. His words suggest that the German and French central banks are acting on an equal footing. However, many observers have noticed that the old asymmetry in the European Monetary System [EMS] continues: The room for interest cuts of the central banks that are tied to the German anchor is usually determined by the pace of monetary policy set by the Bundesbank. The French central bank is no exception here. External stabilization is also, for the Banque de France, one of the two interim objectives (apart from the money supply) on the path toward price stability. If and when the members of the EMS return to narrower currency bands and whether such a narrowing is necessary at all in the letter and spirit of the Maastricht Treaty should be decided "in a pragmatic and practical and not in an abstract and theoretical way at the appropriate moment," Trichet said. The old, close bands of 4.5 percent were extended to 30 percent under the pressure of foreign currency market speculation in early August. The Maastricht Treaty only allows a member to permitted to participate in monetary union if it can keep its exchange rate within the narrow bands for at least two years before going over to a single currency. In retrospect, Trichet justifies the August decision to abandon the old bands. "We wanted to indicate to the markets at that time that the key rates were in harmony with the fundamental economic figures and that we were determined not to give in to speculation. In particular, we wanted to signal that exchange rate risks existed for both sides." The financial markets accepted that, he said, which is why the system was currently working very well. No Additional Powers for the EMI He obviously does not think that initiatives to Europeanize monetary policy, even in the run-up to monetary union, are desirable. "In Europe, we have a mechanism of coordination that has proven to be successful. And then there is the Maastricht Treaty. We have what we need. I would not recommend any new ideas." He added: "People should not forget that France's monetary policy is determined by the French central bank in Paris by law, in the same way in which German monetary policy is determined by the Bundesbank." He would like the European Monetary Institute [EMI], designed to prepare for the single currency, to be given all powers laid down in the Maastricht Treaty on monetary union, but no more, either. Here, too, Trichet's view is in full agreement with the Bundesbank, which is not willing to cede its powers and responsibility on monetary policy prematurely. According to Trichet, there are currently no plans to give the president of the EMI the power to act as proxy in negotiations with the outside world -- such as on exchange rate initiatives with the United States or Japan. These powers stay with the national monetary authorities. Whether it will be possible to stick to the agreed timetable for monetary union wass answered diplomatically by Trichet: "We will go through the stages laid down in the Maastricht Treaty and see where this will take us." Trichet, his two deputies, and the other six members of the French Central Bank Council (Conseil de Politique Monetaire) will still have to work hard to convince people and dispel all doubts regarding the independence of French monetary policy. A few months ago, the German Association for the Protection of Savers voiced its skepticism. It is not enough to make the central bank autonomous and to make it responsible for monetary stability; it must also be able to implement decisions even if these are painful. Distrust toward the French Government bureaucracy's urge to intervene, which at one point might be able to affect the autonomous Banque de France, is created when Paris -- as in the current case of massive subsidies for Air France and the large Credit Lyonnais bank -- shows that it is finding it hard to give up old habits. Critics of the Central Bank Law have mainly pointed to the passage that sees monetary policy as being part of economic policy in general. The statute does not clearly define at what point monetary policy may refuse to support the finance and economics ministers. Governor Trichet does not want to accept such objections. Even the first article of the Central Bank Law, which also bans the government or any other authority from issuing decrees, cites price stability as the number-one objective. The law even bans the Central Bank Council from accepting instructions from politicians. Trichet points to the country's very high "culture of stability." How important price stability is for the government could be seen in August when the EMS bands were extended. Instead of using the room for abrupt interest cuts and a devaluation of the franc, as was suspected by many observers, and thus creating the impression that price stability was no longer a central objective, there was a quick return to parity, while interests were cut gradually and continually. New Communicative Tasks Even within the business community, which used to call for devaluation to improve export opportunities, there is now a growing understanding that only a monetary policy that is geared toward price stability can bring the economy back on the right track. "It is also thanks to the French public's very strong adherence to monetary stability that we have managed to protect the stability of the franc for more than seven years." Trichet is aware that the central bank will also have to explain its policy of stability to a skeptical public, which will push the Banque de France toward increased public relations efforts. The formerly tight-mouthed institute has opened its doors. In monthly and annual reports it now explains its policy. As happens after Central Bank Council sessions in Frankfurt, the media are briefed on monetary policy in Paris, too. Under law, the financial committees of the National Assembly and the Senate provide an additional forum to explain the goal of monetary stability. Central Bank Council members repeatedly gave interviews to journalists, including, for the second time, also HANDELSBLATT. In talks and conferences we "make it clear again and again that price stability is in the interests of all."
