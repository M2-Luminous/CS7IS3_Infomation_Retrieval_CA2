Coordinated and urgent activity to save the environment is what is needed now. This thought was predominant in all the speeches at the conference. Of course, on the whole, it brought to mind the unforgettable meetings of party economic management aktivs: a statement of the facts, miscalculations and successes (alas, there are not many of the latter), and comparative percentages. For a certainty, these are the shortcomings of an initial effort. In his speech Minister A. Shchepovskiy that the department was just beginning to develop methods and ways of executive and monitoring activity based on the implementation of priority tasks--providing residents of Tatarstan with fresh drinking water, resolving problems of industrial and everyday wastes, including toxic and radioactive wastes, and establishing an integral system of monitoring in the republic. The ecological department published the first state report on the status of the environment of the Republic of Tatarstan in 1993, and a Tatarstan Green Book was issued in which analysis of materials concerning the ecological situation was systematized and presented for the first time. A Tatarstan Red Book will also come out soon. Problems that require priority attention were also highlighted at the conference. These are the ecology of agriculture, saving forest resources and restoring the purity of natural waters, and cleansing the atmosphere in cities. For example, due to erosion there is an average annual loss of 70 tonnes of humus per hectare of land. In addition, a good third of the mineral fertilizer is washed away, which pollutes reservoirs and rivers. An ecological chemical analysis of the topsoil in the republic showed that in half the rayons the land is especially oversaturated with harmful elements from the Mendeleyev table, among which are lead, mercury, strontium, and arsenic. In addition, the aftereffects of the compounds of agrochemical processing of the soil do not emerge immediately, but after many years. For a half century our undoubtedly valiant oil workers, engrossed in increasing a well's output, were not overly careful with the land, but now they are being forced to compensate for the regrettable costs of irresponsible land use in hundreds of billions of rubles. But is it not late to reanimate the benefactress? Judging by the speech of A. Iskhakov, head of administration of both Aznakayev and Aznakayevskiy Rayon, this agricultural area, given all the bounties acquired from four oil and gas producing administrations located there, can be referred to as an ecological disaster zone. According to doctors' findings, the water there is unsuitable for drinking, and the air is polluted to a maximum. No matter how the oil workers try to improve the ecological situation in the rayon, its condition remains threatening for the health of the population. The ecological problems in our republic are becoming aggravated by the elimination of production and consumption wastes. Up to 2.5 million tonnes are formed in a year in the republic. Among them are not only raw materials byproducts (10 percent), but also especially harmful poisonous chemicals, containing mercury, calculated in the tens of tonnes. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic of Tatarstan examined the technical and economic justification of a plant project for the processing of wastes. And as soon as it appears, it apparently will begin to work on Kazan's needs. But what will the situation be with the needs of the rayons? The reports of representatives of Goskomsanepidnadzor [State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiologic Inspection] concerning the effect of an unfavorable environment on our health were sad. It was especially emphasized that the general ecological condition is reflected in the rate of childbirth and the health of the next generation. The death rate in the republic last year exceeded the birth rate. Infant mortality reached 22 percent per 1,000 newborn. In comparison with 1990, the adult population has begun to get sick a third more often. Indeed, we have lost the time when we were still able to be charitable toward nature. There is now a need for efficient consolidation of all scientific and practical forces to stabilize the process of barbaric use of nature and to relieve the current condition of the nature that we have desecrated. There are certain rays of hope: The Republic of Tatarstan Academy of Sciences has turned to these problems in real earnest and created an interdisciplinary council on ecology that is coordinating the activity of five departments of the academy. In addition, a special Institute of the Ecology of Natural Systems has been organized that will have to prepare maps of the ecological condition in the republic. It is clear that the republic Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources is still in the stage of formation and that the burden of concerns that has fallen on it are excessive at the present time. Moreover, they have to be resolved with the meager sum that is available. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources was allocated R7 billion, but 20 times more is needed to carry out the paramount tasks.
