In Tehran, the Friday prayers were led by Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moselmin Hashemi-Rafsanjani. At the beginning of his sermons, the acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran set out to describe the mission of the prophets and the battle between evil and righteousness. He said: After the passage of seven centuries since the mission of His Holiness Jesus Christ -- may peace be upon him -- humanity was in dire need of a new prophethood. Then the greatest miracle in the history of mankind occurred, and with the prophethood of the esteemed prophet of Islam, a comprehensive and all-embracing doctrine was created that was able to nurture human beings, build civilizations, and provide all the answers to all the needs of mankind in all eras and historical junctures. In this way, God was able to communicate His fundamental ethos to mankind through the Prophet's tongue. Even at that time, the atheist and arrogant camp lined up against God's prophet, and stopped at nothing in their confrontation against the divine messenger. They were shamelessly ungrateful and employed the most violent and coercive measures to keep the history's most eternal truth well-hidden. However, this school of thought [Islam] was to become the architect of a great civilization, which has about 1.5 billion followers today. During the last 15 years, the most beautiful manifestation of this civilization has been crystallized by the selflessness and the sacrifices of the nation of Iran. Moreover, the president clarified: At present, history is witnessing the repeat of events that unfolded at the advent of Islam. The plight that the Islamic world faces today is the same as the one that the prophet had to endure during the early days of Islam. A glance at the conditions of Muslims in various parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kashmir, Bosnia, and Palestine, and the silence of the West toward their plight, testifies to this reality. At the end of the first sermon, Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed the need to consider the Prophet, his ethics, and his characteristics in life, worship, piety, and jehad as a model.
