Han Jun, a researcher with the Institute of Rural Development under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the plan will open the gates of cities at and below the county level to peasants who have been denied permanent urban residence since the late 1950s. China had 517 official cities by the end of 1992, 323 at the county level. Above the county level were 191 prefectural level cities and three municipalities. There were a total of 2,171 counties. Han, who has been widely quoted in the Chinese press recently for his study of the household registration system, welcomed the scheduled move as a breakthrough. By the end of 1992, 78 per cent of the population, or 919 million Chinese citizens, were classified as rural residents. Frustrated by low income from farming and few job opportunities due to the dearth of arable land, some 50 to 60 million farmers have left their hometowns. At least half have moved into cities despite the fact they have no legal status there. This has been possible because urban reforms have increasingly commercialized employment, the supply of housing, food and other basic commodities, as well as welfare and social securities, which were distributed administratively in the past under the traditional command economy. The old system is no longer effective in holding back the city-bound population flow following the disintegration of "people's communes" and the compulsory government procurement of all farm products. Household registration has become detrimental to further economic development, Han said in an interview with China Daily. The scholar described farmers who have entered the cities as "amphibians." Not acknowledged by urban authorities as permanent residents, they are not permitted to take some city jobs. So to be safe, they hold on to their contracted land at home, though they never actually cultivate it. A rural labourer is entitled to 0.31 hectares of land in the countryside. Even with basic equipment, they can complete a year's worth of farm work in a few months. This explains why many have the time to look for jobs in cities. However, as cities close their doors to rural workers, most surplus rural labour is forced to seek jobs in the countryside -- explaining why 80 per cent of China's rural non-agricultural businesses are located in villages, whereas a mere 1 per cent are in county seats and cities. Scattered companies have caused inefficiency in land use and infrastructure construction, difficulties in pollution treatment and sluggish development of the tertiary industry. The permanent residence system has also caused social problems, Han said. Transient rural labourers face problems in registering for marriage, sending children to nurseries and schools, looking for housing and buying social security. They are also left in an administrative vacuum as they are no longer governed by the authorities of their hometowns. City governments, on the other hand, do not regulate them either because farmers do not have residence. As a result, the number of crimes has risen sharply among transient workers in cities. The percentage of criminal offences committed by transients has nearly doubled to 41 per cent from 1990 to 1993 in Beijing. In Shenzhen, cases involving transients jumped from 26 per cent of total criminal cases in 1980 to 93 per cent last year. Han said the reform will break the division between rural and urban residents and remove the various privileges those in the city get so the two groups may be placed on a more equal footing. Answering worries among urbanites, Han said the reform should not hurt them much if it is carried out step by step. Farmers should not flood cities if the restrictions are lifted, he said, as has been the case in Brazil, Mexico and India. In Brazil, for example, most farmers have lost their land to large landlords, who carry out farming with modern machines. Farmers thus flock to cities to make a living. In China, however, each farmer is entitled to a piece of land of largely the same size. Most of them would probably remain on the land. The expected commercialization of welfare and social security following the end of the residence system also would increase the cost of moving to cities. Han said the reform would invariably intensify employment competition between urbanites and rural workers and increase unemployment in some areas. But this should not be an excuse to keep the mandatory registration system. Latest statistics show that there are many more unemployed people in the countryside than in cities. Han noted that most transient labourers take up blue-collar jobs shunned by their urban counterparts, such as selling vegetables, making clothes and building houses. They are helping city residents more than seizing opportunities from them, and have created as many new jobs as they have taken, Han said. The rural population's lower educational standards also hurt them in their job hunting efforts in the city. To minimize the risks of the reform, the government should establish a national market to regulate the labour flow and let farmers know about the opportunities and risks in cities. In cities, the hidden subsidies employees receive in medical care and housing should be substituted with cash wages. At the same time, a socialized welfalre and securities system open to all residents should be introduced so that urban residence cards do not mean additional benefits. Han said the reform should begin in small cities because most privileges for city residents there have already been eliminated, thus making the transition easier. People who apply for permanent urban residence would be required to transfer their land to others so that those still in the countryside could be given larger plots. New city recruits would no longer enjoy previous privileges, and the government would encourage farmers to pool funds to build cities of their own, Han said.
