FR940707-2-00054 FR940707-2-00032 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;165&hyph;006] Southern Natural Gas Co.; Notice of Refund Report June 30, 1994. Take notice that on June 27, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) tendered for filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) a Refund Report reflecting its refund to interruptible transportation customers of certain amounts directed by the Commission to be refunded in its order in the captioned proceedings issued May 27, 1994 (May 27 Order). The report states that Southern refunded $520,873 to its interruptible transportation customers on June 10, 1994, reflecting the amount, with interest, overcollected since April 1, 1994 under previously accepted tariff sheets that amortized the recovery of pricing differential costs from interruptible transportation customers in the instant proceeding over three months, rather than over twelve months as provided in the May 27 Order. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before July 8, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
