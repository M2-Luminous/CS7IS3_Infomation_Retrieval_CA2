AGENCY: Bureau of Indian Affairs, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) amends the regulations contained in the Code of Federal Regulations to eliminate premium, bonus, or other like payments from consideration in the calculation of the royalty price for crude oil in Osage County, Oklahoma. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gordon Jackson, Superintendent, Osage Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Pawhuska, Oklahoma 74056, telephone (918) 287&hyph;1032. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of this final rule is to amend 25 CFR 226.11(a)(2) to eliminate premium, bonus, or other like payments from consideration in the calculation of the royalty price for crude oil in Osage County. Prior to amendment the regulations were the subject of administrative appeals by numerous oil producers over the meaning of: ``and settlement shall be based on the highest of the bona fide selling price, posted or offered price by a major purchaser (as defined in Sec. 226.1(h) of this Part) in Osage County, who purchases production from Osage oil leases.'' The Bureau of Indian Affairs has interpreted that language to mean that when a higher price is offered and paid for crude oil in Osage County, that price shall be used for royalty computation for all oil of the same quality sold in the county. However, there is reason to believe that this interpretation has discouraged purchasers from offering bonus prices. The Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA) issued its decision in favor of the producers on February 5, 1993, in Okie Crude Co., et al. v. Muskogee Area Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs, IBIA 92&hyph;18&hyph;A, et al. The IBIA concluded that the then existent regulations required a producer to pay royalty on the highest price available to that producer, whether or not that producer actually received that price. Prices not available to a producer would not be used to calculate royalties due from that producer. This final rule eliminates the language that caused the differences in interpretation that led to the appeals to the IBIA. This rule was published as a proposed rule on November 5, 1993 (58 FR 59142). The last day for public comment was January 4, 1994. No comments were received.
