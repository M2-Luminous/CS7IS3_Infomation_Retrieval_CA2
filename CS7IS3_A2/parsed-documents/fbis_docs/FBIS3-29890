Exports to China rose to 5 billion U.S. dollars, however, signaling a shift in export markets from advanced countries to Asia. Exports to the United States, Japan and the European Union reached 39.11 billion dollars last year, or 47.6 percent of total exports worth 82.23 billion dollars. The ratio was 50.8 percent in 1992. Exports to the three main markets rose 0.5 percent last year, far lower than the total export growth of 7.3 percent. The three markets' combined share peaked at 70.5 percent in 1987, but the ratio fell to 68.5 percent in 1988, 66.5 percent in 1989, 62.9 percent in 1990 and 56.6 percent in 1991 mainly because of the falling competitiveness of Korean products. Meanwhile, exports to China rose 94.1 percent to 5.15 billion dollars last year, the first time that shipments to that neighboring country have topped the 5-billion-dollar mark. Imports from the country rose 5.5 percent to 3.92 billion dollars. Two-way trade with the Chinese thus hit 9.08 billion dollars last year, with China becoming Korea's third largest trading partner after the United States and Japan. Exports to Asia, including the Middle East, rose 16.4 percent to 42.37 billion dollars last year, or 51.5 percent of total exports.
