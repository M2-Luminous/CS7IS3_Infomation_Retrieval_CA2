This was the fruit of all-out efforts by Beijing Municipality over the past few years to promote the practice of respecting teachers and stressing education, as well as the practical turns it did for education. [passage omitted] In 1982, Chen Xitong, who had just assumed the mayoralty, attended a meeting of the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] to hear opinions. Several CPPCC members presented their cases passionately, expressing their views and raising questions before him. Their sharp words revealed their true and sincere feelings. Chen Xitong expressed his heartfelt thanks for the "friends who do not hesitate to offer admonition." On a blackboard in a suburban normal school which he visited shortly thereafter, he saw a newly composed verse to the effect that education was not being given due attention, that nobody cared about the poor teachers, and that "nobody showed compassion" for education, which resembled an orphan. Once again, the new mayor was deeply moved by the words. He felt that he would not be able to justify himself before the people, and would be negligent in his duties, if he did not make up his mind to improve educational services in Beijing. At that time, there was a lack of common understanding about education. Some comrades asked: If we stress education, what about other professions? If we raise teachers' salaries, what should we do about the pay of other workers and staff members? [passage omitted] Reviewing that period, Chen Xitong, who is now secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, said: The key to whether education is truly considered important lies in determination on the part of leaders at all levels. Only by conducting investigations and studies in schools can we understand the conditions of schools, teachers, and the practical problems and hardships in running schools; only by doing so can we develop feelings toward education. When leaders at all levels show real feelings for education, they will develop a common language and show a common determination. [passage omitted] Chen Xitong said: Competition in today's society ultimately consists in vying for professionally trained people. We cannot merely ferret out such people; the more important thing is to train them. If we now invest our money in education, we shall have large numbers of useful people in the future for our modernization drive. [passage omitted] During the interview [not previously mentioned; date and place not given], Chen Xitong told the reporters: The party Central Committee and the State Council take educational work seriously. Although Beijing has achieved some success in educational work, it still falls far short of the demands of the central authorities and people throughout the municipality, and there remain quite a few problems. At present, further efforts should be undertaken to deepen educational reform and improve teachers' salaries and living quarters. More school buildings need to be constructed so that schools will not institute the "two-shift system" to cope with yet another surge in enrollment. Further efforts should be made to solve new problems and difficulties in connection with school administration. We must remain level-headed, identify areas where we are lagging, continue our efforts, devote great efforts to educational reform, and resolutely improve education.
