On the contrary, he said Tuesday [22 March] in an interview with foreign journalists in Simferopol, this will help transfer relations into a definite channel. Meshkov said that due to irrational economic policies of Kiev's leadership our Crimean home is razed to the ground. Our task is to build it up and we ask Ukraine not to interfere, he said. Meshkov intends to build the Crimean "home" by restoring normal economic relations with Russia and establishing mutually advantageous relations with Ukraine and other CIS and foreign countries. Dual citizenship, said Meshkov, is the bleeding wound that causes most people in the Crimea to suffer. He believes the problem is caused by the abnormal conditions of the Soviet Union's disintegration, the disruption of traditional ties and largely bears a moral-political rather than legal character. The Crimean Republic having its own citizenship, with people also being allowed to hold a second Ukraine or Russian citizenship will lessen the suffering of Crimeans, believes Meshkov. The problem of citizenship, he said, is also the problem of statehood. That is why it should be solved immediately. I do not have negative feelings for the President of Ukraine (Leonid Kravchuk--"IF"), said Meshkov. I believe he does not feel negatively about me. It is a matter of the incompatibility of nationalist sentiments within the Ukrainian leadership and the Crimean's aspirations as a consequence of the collapse of the economy, said Meshkov.
