Slovakia thus rejected the Czech proposal of mutual recognition of decisions and certificates for all commodities regardless of differences in state norms. The decision was reached at a meeting of representatives of both the Czech Republic [CR] and Slovakia today, led by Michal Tosovsky and Lubomir Sutek, chairmen of the National Offices for Technical Normalisation, Metrology and State Testing. As regards food products, as from April 1 the Slovak Agricultural and Food Inspectorate will issue a single certificate valid for Slovakia. The decisions taken by the Czech authorities will form the basis of the issuing of the certificate. Until March 31 the Slovak customs authorities will require the same documents it required before February 11, when the Slovak customs authorities announced that food products without a Slovak quality certificate would not be allowed to enter the country.
