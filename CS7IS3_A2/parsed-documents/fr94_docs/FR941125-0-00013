ACTION : Final regulations. SUMMARY : This document contains final regulations relating to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The regulations provide guidance on the computation of alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) with respect to items that are determined by reference to adjusted gross income (AGI). The regulations affect taxpayers who are subject to the alternative minimum tax. DATES : These regulations are effective November 25, 1994. These regulations are applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 18, 1994, a notice of proposed rulemaking (IA&hyph;4&hyph;94) was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 12880) which contained proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 55 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). A detailed explanation of the proposed regulations is contained in the preamble to those regulations. The proposed regulations provide that, in general, all Code provisions that apply in determining the regular taxable income of a taxpayer also apply in determining the AMTI of the taxpayer. However, the proposed regulations provide that, for purposes of computing the AMTI of a noncorporate taxpayer, all references to the taxpayer's AGI in determining the amount of any item of income, exclusion, or deduction must be treated as references to the taxpayer's AGI as determined for regular tax purposes. The IRS received written comments on the proposed regulations and on June 6, 1994, held a public hearing on those regulations. After consideration of the comments received and the statements made at the public hearing, the proposed regulations are revised and adopted as final regulations by this Treasury decision. Discussion In the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress expanded the application of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for individual taxpayers. Although Congress generally intended that the AMT be treated as a tax system separate from and parallel to the regular tax system, in certain limited instances deviations from the separate and parallel concept may be necessary to reduce complexity and ease administrative burden.
