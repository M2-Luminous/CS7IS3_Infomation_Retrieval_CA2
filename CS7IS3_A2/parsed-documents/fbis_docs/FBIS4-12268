FBIS4-12268 "drnes067_l_94011" FBIS-NES-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Reservists Receive Orders for Duty in Hebron Reservists Receive Orders for Duty in Hebron TA0704082494 Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew 7 Apr 94 p 1 TA0704082494 Tel Aviv DAVAR Hebrew BFN [Report by On Levi] [Text] Thousands of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] reservists have recently been issued special call-up orders to reinforce the Army's presence in Hebron and to replace some of the regular Army units that have been stationed inside and around the town since the massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs over one month ago. The commanders of these units have been receiving dozens of requests from soldiers asking to be released from reserve duty because of personal or business-related problems. Yesterday, IDF sources explained that were it possible, they would have been glad to do without the service of these soldiers, and promised that these soldiers will be the first of those in the field to be released from duty. The call-up orders were issued without giving the soldiers the required advance notice. They were based on a special authorization issued by Major General Yoram Ya'ir, head of the IDF Manpower Branch, in light of the situation. According to senior military sources, "the situation made the call-up of reserve soldiers necessary. We cannot freeze the education and training of the regular soldiers for long periods. The detrimental effect this has had on the regular soldiers is already untenable." The sources added that employing the reservists will involve thousands of reserve duty days and constitute a difficult burden for the reserve soldiers. Over the past few weeks, reservists from the Artillery and Infantry Corps have received thousands of call-up orders for special operational activity in the territories. The call-up orders were issued without the customary 44-day advance notice. At this stage, call-up orders have been sent to reservists who were not supposed to serve in the territories in the current workyear. The units called up for special reserve duty have done long periods of reserve duty in the territories over the past two years, and the IDF had originally intended to refrain from using these units this year. The call-up orders were sent to the soldiers several weeks ago, in the wake of a situation analysis conducted by the General Staff's Operations Department. The commanders of the reserve units met with Maj. Gen. Yoram Ya'ir over the past few days to protest the decision to break the promises made earlier to their soldiers.
