FR940706-0-00038 FR940706-0-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;159&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8963; AD 94&hyph;14&hyph;15] Airworthiness Directives; Dassault Aviation Model Mystere-Falcon 50 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Dassault Aviation Model Mystere-Falcon 50 series airplanes, that requires replacement of certain attachment clamps installed on the engine exhaust ducts with improved clamps. This amendment is prompted by reports of failures of certain attachment clamps due to fatigue cracking. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent such failures, which could cause exhaust gas to leak and, subsequently, could trigger a false engine fire alarm. DATES: Effective August 5, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Falcon Jet Corporation, Customer Support Department, Teterboro Airport, Teterboro, New Jersey 07608. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Slotte, Aerospace Engineer, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2797; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Dassault Aviation Model Mystere-Falcon 50 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on November 22, 1993 (58 FR 61636). That action proposed to require replacement of certain attachment clamps installed on the engine exhaust ducts with improved clamps. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter requests that paragraph (b) of the rule be revised to indicate that instructions for verifying that the clamp screw is straight are contained in Dassault Aviation Service Bulletin F50&hyph;229 (F50&hyph;54&hyph;13), Revision 1, dated July 21, 1993 (which is the service bulletin cited elsewhere in the proposed rule). The commenter notes that those instructions indicate that the verification cannot be made if the clamp is installed; the clamp must be removed from the tail pipe attachment in order to determine if it is bent or not. The FAA concurs with the commenter's request and has revised the final rule accordingly. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. The FAA estimates that 133 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,315, or $55 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.
