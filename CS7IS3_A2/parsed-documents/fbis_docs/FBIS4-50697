Speaking at a press conference yesterday for the coming four-day Hong Kong '94 China Trade and Investment Conference to be held in the territory next week, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) deputy director-general Ma Xiuhong said the administration had seen rapid growth in foreign investments in inner regions since late 1992. "As China's open door policy continues and foreign investments increase to a certain level along the coastal areas, inner regions have become the targets recently for most foreign investment," Ms Ma said. In addition, they (the inner regions) are also improving their own investment environment, which also contributes to the rapid growth," she said. Ms Ma said the amount of foreign funds flowing into the inner regions last year exceeded that of the coastal areas by 5 to 10 percent. Earlier this year, China vowed to continue its foreign investment policy and extended it to the inner regions. "In fact, the trend had already begun in late 1992. But it was more obvious last year." She said that in its bid to re-enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, China was "actively" refining its trade laws to conform to international standards. "We are determined to tailor a more secure and better protected environment for foreign investments in terms of adjusting our laws." The country had stepped up work on trade regulations this year. "In the process of reform, the refinement of legislation is necessary and will be to the interest of foreign investments." Moftec, under the Foreign Investment Administration, is to jointly host the Hong Kong' 94 China Trade and Investment Conference with the territory's Trade Development Council at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai. The conference begins on Monday and will continue until 26 May. Seminars on China's latest foreign investment policies will be held during the conference, to brief interested investors. Meanwhile, China's April industrial production figures showed a year-on-year increase of 17.9 per cent, according to the State Statistics Bureau.
