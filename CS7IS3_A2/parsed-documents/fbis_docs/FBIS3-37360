The program concludes with announcer Sergey Dorenko saying: "As we learned this morning from our sources in the Kremlin, the president will postpone his keynote address to parliament from 18 February to 24 February, and an official announcement on this will be made a little later. Our sources believe that now is not the time for the president to speak to parliament while there still remains the slightest hope of a peaceful resolution of the Bosnian crisis. In parliament, there are very many politicians who are capable of demanding of Yeltsin the most resolute measures up to and including military ones."
