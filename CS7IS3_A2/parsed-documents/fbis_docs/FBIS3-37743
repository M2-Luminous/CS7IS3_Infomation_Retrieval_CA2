Our correspondent reports: [Begin recording] [Akif Mecitoglu] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev left for an official visit to Great Britain today at the invitation of the British Prime Minister John Major. Agreements on political, economic, and cultural cooperation will be signed between the two countries. [Unidentified correspondent] Esteemed President, the signing of a number of economic cooperation agreements between Azerbaijan and Great Britain is envisaged. You will also be meeting with British businessmen and state officials. What effect will such ties have on the development of Azerbaijan's economy? [Aliyev] The Azerbaijani president's visit to Great Britain is aimed at establishing and developing ties between Azerbaijan and Great Britain. This is because, since the attainment of independence, Azerbaijan has not yet been able to forge interstate ties with a great world power such as Great Britain to the degree needed. The British ambassador arrived here only a few months ago, and Azerbaijan's ambassador left for Great Britain only in recent days. Thus, diplomatic ties are just being established. As a young independent state, Azerbaijan is in dire need of broad interstate ties, first and foremost political and economic ties. The economic ties in themselves cover a broad spectrum, ranging from trade to close ties between the various British and Azerbaijani business circles to scientific and cultural ties. As you know, Britain is one of the major world powers, is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and is one of the seven most developed countries. Both in the past and at present Britain has been strongly influencing international politics and economics. Therefore, the creation of close ties between Azerbaijan and Great Britain is first of all exceedingly important for the national interest of the Azerbaijani Republic. We are also aware that Britain itself is highly interested in Azerbaijan. It wants to establish economic ties with Azerbaijan. Historically, Britain's interest in the Caucasus and Azerbaijan is obvious. In this present stage at the end of the 20th century, Britain wants to establish economic ties with Azerbaijan on a new foundation. We have already accomplished some work in this direction. That is, we have done preparatory work. We have to resolve all these matters there. As you know, my visit to Britain is of an official nature. This is an official state visit that is taking place at the invitation of British Prime Minister John Major. Some days ago I received a letter from Mr. John Major in which he says that he is looking forward for our meeting and is hopeful that this meeting will produce fruitful results for Britain and Azerbaijan. Therefore, I attribute great importance to this visit and hope that the British leaders are also giving it great importance. Our program there is now clear: There will be talks with Prime Minister John Major and we will sign a number of agreements with both the prime minister and other officials. We will have meetings at the British Parliament and at other state departments. Undoubtedly, all these are important matters aimed at strengthening our young and independent Azerbaijan's foreign policy and its international position. And I am going to Britain to resolve these problems. [Unidentified correspondent] We wish you success. [Aliyev] Thank you.
