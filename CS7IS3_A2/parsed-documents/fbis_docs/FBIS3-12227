This took place at the extraordinary session the House held this afternoon under Speaker Tahir al-Masri, atttended by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, to discuss the results of the reprehensible massacre Zionist extremists carried out against defenseless worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque. At the start of the session, al-Masri said yesterday's incident is a mournful and momentous event. Although what the Zionists had perpetrated against the people in Hebron is not the first of its kind that the Palestinians and Muslims have experienced at the hands of the Zionist aggressors, the manner in which it was carried out, in a safe and sacred place, adds to the harm done to one's sentiments and makes it stand out as a very strange incident. Al-Masri added: If our relatives in the occupied territories cannot be safe in their mosques and during their prayers, then where can they be safe?
