In a report assessing the impact of the health reforms, it says they have brought both benefits and disadvantages for patients. On the negative side: -- One in three hospitals has had to slow down the number of patients being admitted because of cash problems. -- Patients of non-fundholding GP's have found they cannot get into hospital as quickly as fundholders' patients. On the positive side: -- Waiting times to get into hospital have shortened. -- Fears that patients would have to travel further as the internal market developed have proved unfounded. The report is unable to reach clear-cut conclusions about the overall benefit of the reforms. It says: "Opinion is divided among community health councils about the impact of the reforms on the quality of care delivered. Some feel purchasers and GP's are more able to insist on higher standards. Others feel patient care is being compromised by cost-cutting and staff demoralisation." The report adds that there is little evidence of non-fundholding GP's having to change referral patterns to fit the contracts made by their health authorities. In contrast, "fundholding GP's are revealed as the most dynamic and disruptive sector of the NHS internal market. Thirty-eight percent of CHC's say local hospitals have lost patients because of fundholders. They have sent their patients to private hospitals or to other NHS hospitals. "Fundholders' patients can get better treatment, sometimes at the expense of other NHS patients. One in five CHC's report that fundholders' patients get priority access to local hospitals." Great difficulties have resulted from hospitals facing too much demand without purchasers having funds to match, says the report.
