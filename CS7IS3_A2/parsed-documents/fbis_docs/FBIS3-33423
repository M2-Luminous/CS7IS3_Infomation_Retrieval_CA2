Fenasteg has also demanded the intervention of the Inter-American Human Rights Court to guarantee the security of 40 workers who, as of this morning, seized the government house. Fenasteg leader Armando Sanchez, who leads the 40 workers who are occupying the National Palace and another 5,000 workers who are demonstrating in the outskirts, has told NOTIMEX they will not leave the building. Sanchez has blamed De Leon, who took power on 6 June 1993, for the situation of "ungovernability," the wave of violence and insecurity, and the economic, political, and social crises Guatemala is facing. Sanchez has said: "Guatemalans are disappointed with the current government. Everyone has made a mistake by believing Ramiro de Leon was going to be a fair president who would readdress the country's fate." Sanchez has said there is a consensus regarding De Leon's resignation. He has said: "As the situation is progressing in Guatemala, any sector might try to overthrow de Leon." Sanchez explained the national strike is aimed at pressuring the government into complying with its promises to overcome the levels of poverty affecting 8 million people in Guatemala. Sanchez said a group of 100 workers has met with Jose Francisco Guerrero, president of the Central American Parliament [Parlacen], whom they asked to form a commission to mediate in the labor conflict. The committee members are reportedly Sergio Ramirez, former Nicaraguan vice president; a Honduran delegate; Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo, former president of Guatemala; and members of the Parlacen Board of Directors. The union leader said a communique will be sent within the next few hours to the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, asking them to intervene and attempt to try and convince De Leon Carpio to soften his position. Sanchez, in an interview at the National Palace, said a motion was also presented in Geneva, Switzerland, demanding respect for labor and human rights in Guatemala. About 100 policemen have surrounded the building, while some 40 members of the Presidential General Staff, geared with gas masks, are awaiting orders to evict the union members. Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman, Government Ministry personnel, and National Police Director Mario Cifuentes, among others, are inside the building. De Leon Carpio is touring Chimaltenango, some 57 km west of the capital.
