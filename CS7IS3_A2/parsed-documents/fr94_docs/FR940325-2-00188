FR940325-2-00188 FR940325-2-00089 The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register so that the hedge exemption pilot program can be re-implemented without further delay and to help avoid any potential investor confusion concerning the availability of the hedge exemption as a result of the lapse of the pilot program. The Commission notes that the NASD has not experienced any significant problems with the hedge exemption pilot program since its inception and that the NASD will continue to monitor the pilot program to ensure that no problems arise. Moreover, no adverse comments have been received by the NASD concerning the hedge exemption pilot program since its implementation. Additionally, the proposal to expand the hedge exemption pilot program to include convertible securities and securities economically equivalent to the stock underlying the corresponding hedging options position is substantively similar to proposals previously approved by the Commission for the options exchanges. 10 Finally, the proposed example to be added to section 3 of the Rules merely serves to clarify the operation of the hedge exemption pilot program and is not a substantive rule change. As a result, because of the importance of maintaining the quality and efficiency of the securities markets, the Commission believes good cause exists for approving the extension and expansion of the NASD's hedge exemption pilot program on an accelerated basis. 10 See supra note 7. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NASD. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;07 and should be submitted by April 15, 1994. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 11 that the proposed rule change (File Nos. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;07), is approved and, accordingly, the hedge exemption pilot program as expanded herein, is extended until December 31, 1995. 11 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 12 12 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1992). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
