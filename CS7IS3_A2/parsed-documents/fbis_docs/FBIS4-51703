Samonte] [Text] The country's debt planners may be praying for more rain. Partly because the financial system is still relatively awash with dollars, a senior Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] official said monetary authorities are confident government will be able to service its $1.1 billion maturing obligations with the Paris Club creditors sans any restructuring agreement. "Even if these debts are not restructured, since we have more dollars ... we need not use up our gross international reserves (GIR)," the official yesterday told BUSINESS WORLD. Earlier, fiscal and monetary officials said the country may no longer be able to fully reschedule its maturing Paris Club debts in the next three years with the external financing gap programmed to dwindle from $500 million this year. The country serviced about $750 million in maturing obligations last year. Another $234 million was paid during the first quarter, while $560 million is scheduled in the second quarter. A three-year extended fund facility (EFF) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), seen to be approved this June, is expected to enable the country to negotiate for a fifth rescheduling agreement for its $1.1 billion maturing obligations with the Paris Club. Ironically, the high liquidity of the system -- mainly brought about by the continuous deluge of from overseas contract workers funds [as published] -- is testing the limits on the country's healthy GIR position, which stood at about $6.3 billion as of mid- April. Bank treasury officials were surprised when the Bangko Sentral suddenly shifted gears and slowed down on its dollar buying tack the other day after weeks of heavy buying. From a total volume of dollar purchases of $1.06 billion as of mid-April, the Bangko Sentral slowed down its support of the peso with its current total volume now standing at about $1.2 billion, or a difference of about $141 million within the almost two-week period. The peso gained 78 centavos to the dollar the other day, to close at P27.457 [Philippine pesos] to the dollar from the previous day's P27.535. As of about 2:30 PM, a trader said the last done deal stood at P27.23. "With Bangko Sentral intervention, it may close at P27.35," he predicted. The Bangko Sentral has lately been buying only between $2 million and $3 million on the average per bank, the Bangko Sentral official admitted. He, however, said the Bangko Sentral is "still following market (movements)." A primary reason for the heavy buying tack it earlier adopted may be inflation, which monetary authorities are closely watching out for because of the system's excess liquidity situation. "It's not that we're not buying much, but there really is low corporate demand due to last quarter's uncertainty in the market." Investors overbought dollars anticipating that the uptick in the peso exchange value would be carried over in the first quarter of the year, the source said. The interbank call loan rate (IBCLR) again surged, closing at a high of 68 percent (value dated Wednesday) or about 12 percentage points short of the record-high rate registered end-September last year when the peso plummeted at a record-low against the dollar. The average IBCLR was at 45.5625 percent, 5.875 percent higher than the previous day's average of 39.6875 percent. "It's a very unusual situation," a treasury official described. The foreign exchange rate is seen to taper off to "normal" level within two months' time, in anticipation of huge dollar outflows as banks negotiate for more import demands. The Bangko Sentral official said there has been a significant uptick in the number of 60-day letters of credit being opened recently. Still, at this point, treasury officials held mixed views on where the upsurge in dollars come from.
