In addition, North Korea has let it be known that they would remove Polish members from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, a UNC official at the Armistice Commission said. Early last year, North Korea withdrew Czech delegates from the truce-watching commission. Poland and Czechoslovakia had been the communist-side-chosen member countries of the four-country supervisory commission, whose delegates were responsible for watching the North Korean area. The planned withdrawal by North Korea is an express violation of the Armistice Agreement, over the issue of which the U.N. Command has been contacting North Korean delegates and UNC member countries related to the maintenance of the truce agreement, a UNC official said.
