FR940912-0-00055 FR940912-0-00010 (5) the payment of commute compensation when the overtime assignment begins 16 hours or more after the last regularly scheduled assignment (19 CFR 24.16(f)(2)(v)), and; (6) the exclusion of workers compensation benefits from any applicable pay cap calculations (19 CFR 24.16(h)). Certain other issues raised by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU, one of the parties submitting comments) are the subject of pending litigation before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (Civil Action No. 94&hyph;0163, filed January 31, 1994). As it would be inappropriate for Customs to discuss those issues at this time, those comments are not addressed in this document. We now address the identified areas of concern in turn. 24.16(a)_Interpretation of exclusivity clause Comment: Although the 1993 Act prohibits employees who are paid overtime under subsection (a) of the statute or premium pay under subsection (b) of the statute from receiving ``*␣*␣* pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of law'' (emphasis in original), the exclusivity clause contained in the 1993 Act does not divest employees of their right to receive payment under other applicable pay statutes for work performed during periods for which no 1993 Act payments are received. For example, an employee may be assigned to a night shift for which no night work differential is payable under the 1993 Act (11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.). That employee should still be paid night shift differential from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. under the Federal Employees Pay Act (FEPA) or other applicable law. The interim regulations should be modified to reflect this entitlement. Customs Response: Customs disagrees. With enactment of the COPRA in the 1993 Act, Congress created a total pay and compensation system unique to the inspectional duties performed by Customs Officers. The establishment of this new system effectively removed those officers from coverage under any other statute for pay and compensation purposes. Accordingly, no change to §24.16(a) is made. When the COPRA were promulgated, Congress reasoned that its purpose in requiring Customs Officers to work 40 hours in a week or 8 hours in a day, without regard to the hour of the day or the day of the week, before they qualify for overtime pay, was to encourage Customs to adjust its inspectional resources to meet actual trade patterns, rather than forcing the trade community to adjust to a predetermined Customs workday. Also, Congress wanted Customs to measure workload and trade patterns at each of its ports and then adjust work schedules to meet that demand while using as little overtime as possible. See, ``Report of the Committee on the Budget House of Representatives on Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993'', Report 103&hyph;111 (May 25, 1993), p. 573. Since section 267(c)(2) clearly provides that a Customs Officer who receives overtime pay under subsection (a) (19 U.S.C. 267(a)) or premium pay under subsection (b) (19 U.S.C. 267(b)) for time worked may not receive pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of law, it is axiomatic that Congress' explanation in the context of overtime pay is equally applicable to the payment of premium pay differentials, i.e ., night shift pay. And, as no allowance for night work differential premium pay is authorized under the Customs Officer Pay Reform provisions where less than a majority of night work hours is worked during the specified time periods (19 U.S.C. 267(b)(1)&hyph;(3), 19 CFR 24.16(g)(3)(i)&hyph;(iii)), it is clear that the 1993 Act does divest Customs Officers_but not other Customs employees_of their right to receive payment under other applicable pay statutes for work performed. Any other interpretation of section 267(c)(2) would render the express limitation meaningless. In the scenario presented in the commenter's example, the payment of night differential premium pay is not authorized because the Customs Officer, as defined at 19 U.S.C. 267(e)(1) and subject to the overtime and premium pay provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267, does not work a majority of hours between any of the three time frames established by Congress for payment of such premium pay. See, 19 U.S.C. 267(b)(1)(A) through (C). Although the Customs Officer is officially assigned to work an 8-hour shift which goes past the, heretofore, traditional working day of 6:00 p.m., no night work differential is authorized under the exclusivity of pay provision under the COPRA (19 U.S.C. 267(c)(2)); the terms of the exclusivity provision expressly preclude dual pay/compensation entitlement considerations under other Federal pay statutes.
