Difficult negotiations have been going on for four years, and finally last night there was a breakthrough. Agreement was reached on the main conditions for settling the Polish debt. These conditions include a comprehensive and realistic reduction of the debt, according to the statement published this morning. Mr. Krzysztof Krowacki, who led our delegation, says the agreement fulfills the basic requirements of the Polish side. First of all, our payments will be within the framework of the projected capabilities of the balance of payments and the state budget. They will be low in the first five years and will remain low during the most intensive period of payments due in accordance with agreements with the Paris Club. All of the components of the debt have been reduced. Also reduced were the costs of servicing the debt. Repayment periods will be longer, payments per one unit of debt will be lower, and the debt itself will be reduced further. The combined reduction of the debt exceeds 45 percent.
