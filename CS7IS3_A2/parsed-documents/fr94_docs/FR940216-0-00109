FR940216-0-00109 FR940216-0-00010 As a result, EPA concluded that while independent sampling and testing is necessary for reformulated gasoline, these procedures are not justified for conventional gasoline. Commenters suggested several alternatives to independent sampling and testing. None of these alternatives satisfy the program needs addressed by independent sampling and testing, however. Many commenters stated that EPA should establish a program of EPA certification of refiner and importer company laboratories, and participation in round-robin analysis programs, as an alternative to independent sampling and testing. Presumably independent sampling and testing only would be required where a company laboratory failed to obtain EPA certification. Commenters cited other federal programs that include the laboratory certification and/or round-robin approach, including the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and federal requirements for petroleum products produced to meet military specifications. EPA does not believe that laboratory certification and round-robin programs would provide sufficient verification of refiner or importer testing of reformulated gasoline. Programs of this type generally provide information on the quality of work a given laboratory is capable of performing under optimal conditions; they shed little light on the quality of the laboratory's day-to-day work which is the main focus of the independent sampling and testing requirement. Certification by EPA or another organization would determine if a laboratory has proper equipment and personnel properly trained as of the date of the certification, but would provide no certainty of the ongoing laboratory operation. The treatment of round-robin samples by laboratories is predictably special. If a laboratory's continued certification is contingent on the quality of its analysis of samples received from EPA, the laboratory would be expected to assign its best personnel to this task, to be particularly careful in the analysis, and probably to repeat the analysis enough times to be certain a correct result is obtained. The treatment received by round-robin samples may bear little resemblance to the treatment normal samples receive. Certainly, neither laboratory certification nor round-robin testing would constitute any deterrent to a willfully cheating refiner or importer. EPA believes the other federal programs that use laboratory certification and/or round-robins are inappropriate precedents for use of these approaches in the reformulated gasoline program. In the case of petroleum products produced to military specifications, the military presumably receives the products produced and can at that time verify whether the products meet relevant standards and criteria. This type of after-the-fact verification is not possible for reformulated gasoline for the reasons that have been discussed. In the case of facilities regulated under the NPDES program, it is possible to verify whether the levels of pollutants being discharged by the facilities are consistent with facility-specific permits that have been issued through EPA inspections that include water samples collected at the facilities. The reformulated gasoline situation is distinguished from the NPDES program because fungible mixing that often occurs within the refinery or import facility would render EPA inspections ineffective as a reformulated gasoline test verification mechanism. Commenters offered other alternatives to independent sampling and testing that would rely on random refinery audits by independent parties or by EPA, or of verification-analysis by EPA of a representative portion of the samples analyzed by refiners and importers. EPA rejected these alternatives. The limitations inherent in EPA refinery or import facility inspections that result from fungible mixing, discussed above, also would apply to audits conducted by independent parties. A program that would rely on EPA-conducted verification analysis of certain samples that are sent to EPA by refiners or importers raises the same types of concerns that occur under the round-robin approach. Refiners and importers would be expected to analyze samples that also are sent to EPA for verification-testing with a level of care that may bear little resemblance to normal laboratory practices, and this approach would provide small deterrent to the willful cheater.
