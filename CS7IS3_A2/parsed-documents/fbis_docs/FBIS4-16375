Speaking about the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsular at a press briefing after his talks with his visiting South Korean counterpart Han Sung-chu, Kozyrev said that the demilitarisation of the peninsular is an uncompromising question for Russia. He said Russia is seeking to normalise the situation, promote security and ensure trust in the region located in proximity to the Russian borders. "We have agreed with the foreign minister of South Korea to maintain contacts on the entire spectrum of problems. No one rejects Russia's proposal to hold an international conference on security and nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsular," he said. Kozyrev noted that, like in case with NATO air strikes in Bosnia, the Russian side is not pleased when it is asked to save the situation or vote for some sanctions or decisions adopted at some talks without its participation. Asked about prospects for imposing sanctions on North Korea over the nuclear problem, the Russian minister stressed "We will not consider measures which do not follow from our direct and substantial participation in all stages of the discussion of respective problems."
