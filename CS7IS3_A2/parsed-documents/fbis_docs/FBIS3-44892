Saiget] [Text] Beijing, Jan. 9 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata's just completed two-day visit to China was short, tough and to the point as the two Asian giants patiently lay down their cards amid ever-changing roles in Asia's burgeoning economic sweepstakes. The theme of Hata's visit this time around was a new era of development based on an orientation toward future relations and discussed in the context of contributions toward the international community, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Such a "forward orientation," an obvious way to avoid the horrors of times gone by, was carefully balanced by Hata's reiteration that Japan would not forget "the self-reflection of the past." While the Chinese leadership cordially listened to Hata's explanation of developing relations in a global context, they remained mum on questions concerning war retribution and refused to comment on Japan's ambitions to join the United Nations Security Council, the spokesman said. Hata, while sidestepping direct references to the war, told the press that "a frank exchange of views is natural to deeper relations." He did not, however, say when that exchange of view will come nor did he speculate on how China will use the "war compensation card." China, too, appears to be ready to use Japan's UN ambitions to the fullest effect, which in China's case usually means "more economic aid." Japan has lent thousands of billions of yen to China through its overseas development assistance program and the rearrangement in the loan schedules during the visit were applauded by both sides. Japan, among developed nations, arguably has the clearest understanding of the actual situation in China and is fully aware of China's financial situation which remains bogged down by the large, backward and underdeveloped regions. Meanwhile bilateral trade relations neared 35 billion dollars in 1993 to reach a record height, while China continued to call for increased investment from Japan. In such a light, the future of Japan-China relations has no big change on the horizon -- the Japanese Government will continue in its quiet ways to offer support and assistance to China's endeavors, while Japanese businesses will take advantage of their technology and advanced products to reap the benefits of the huge Chinese market.
