FR940921-0-00096 FR940921-0-00016 47. Section 86.109&hyph;94 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(4) and (c)(4), to read as follows: §86.109&hyph;94 Exhaust gas sampling system; Otto-cycle vehicles not requiring particulate emission measurement. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (4) The flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to eliminate water condensation in the system. (300 to 350 cfm (0.142 to 0.165 m3/s) is sufficient for most petroleum-fueled vehicles. Higher flow rates are required for methanol-fueled vehicles and may be required for natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Procedures for determining CVS flow rates are detailed in ``Calculation of Emissions and Fuel Economy When Using Alternative Fuels,'' EPA 460/3&hyph;83&hyph;009. (Copies may be obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce, NTIS, Springfield, Virginia 22161; order # PB 84104702.) * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (4) The flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to virtually eliminate water condensation in the system (300 to 350 cfm (0.142 to 0.165 m3/s) is sufficient for most petroleum-fueled vehicles). Higher flow rates are required with methanol-fueled vehicles and may be required for natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Procedures for determining CVS flow rates are detailed in ``Calculation of Emission and Fuel Economy When Using Alternative Fuels,'' EPA 460/3&hyph;83&hyph;009. * * * * * 48. Section 86.110&hyph;94 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(2), (b) heading and introductory text and (b)(3), by redesignating paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(7) as paragraphs (a)(7) and (a)(8), and by adding a new paragraph (a)(6), to read as follows: §86.110&hyph;94 Exhaust gas sampling system; diesel vehicles and Otto-cycle vehicles requiring particulate emissions measurements. * * * * * (a) *␣*␣* (2) Bag, continuous HFID (required for petroleum-fueled diesel-cycle and optional for methanol-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles), and particulate sampling capabilities as shown in Figure B94&hyph;5 (or Figure B94&hyph;6) are required to provide both gaseous and particulate emissions sampling capabilities from a single system. * * * * * (6) For natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel vehicles either a heated flame ionization detector (HFID) [375 ○ # 20 ○F (191 ○ # 11 ○C)] or a non-heated flame ionization detector may be used for hydrocarbon analysis. * * * * *
