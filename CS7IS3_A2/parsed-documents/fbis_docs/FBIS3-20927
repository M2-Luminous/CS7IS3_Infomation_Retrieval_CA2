GEC had offered one penny per share, or 10.1 million pounds (some 90 million French francs) in addition to taking over the Ferranti's debts, estimated at 140 million pounds. Following GEC's withdrawal, Ferranti has been put into receivership. The receiver will try to sell off the company's assets in an attempt to pay off creditors. Operations may be sold off one by one, which would enable GEC or others to take over only the most attractive activities (for example, the sonar operation managed through a joint company with Thomson-CSF) without Ferranti's debts. During the first quarter of the fiscal year, Ferranti recorded a loss of 19.4 million pounds for revenues which fell by 17 percent to 91 million pounds and an order book worth 165 million pounds. GEC, for its part, has just concluded its first quarter with a 2.9 percent increase in revenues (4.38 billion pounds) and pretax profits totaling 360 million pounds.
