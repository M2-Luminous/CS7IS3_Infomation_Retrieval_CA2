He was commenting upon serious changes made in the Republic's power body structures and reshuffles during the past short period. "Lately the government was working out a programme of its actions which will be presented to the Supreme Soviet. Under the new programme, the new government will form a team and together with it carry out the programme," the Kazakh president said. According to Nazarbayev, among reappointed ministers and chiefs of departments are mainly those who took part in preparing the programme. Nazarbayev also said that the president's office will strictly monitor the fulfillment of the programme proposed to the government. There is nothing to be surprised at, Nazarbayev emphasised. According to him, in all civilized democratic countries of the world every government comes forward with a definite programme which it puts before the society. The people accept it and allot time to fulfill it. Together with the fate of such a programme the fate of the government is also decided. If the government is able to cope with its work, it is normal. If the government does not fulfill its promises, it must resign, the Kazakh president said.
