In this connection, I wish to state categorically that there has never been any discussions about the Burmese students in Thailand between H.E. Lt Gen Khin Nyunt and me or any members of the Thai diplomatic mission in Yangon [Rangoon]. Furthermore, during the past two years since I have been the Thai Ambassador to the Union of Myanmar [Burma], no member of the Government of the Union of Myanmar has ever requested the Thai diplomatic mission in Yangon to do anything regarding the Myanmar students in Thailand. 1, therefore, hope that any fantasies of collusion between the Myanmar Government and the Thai diplomatic mission in Yangon to repatriate the Myanmar students in Thailand back to Myanmar will finally be put to rest. However, I wish to remind the Myanmar students in Thailand that their continued presence in Thailand has been due to the humanitarian consideration of the Thai Government. Verbal attacks against the Thai Government by them will sap the humanitarian reservoir of Thailand. So will their political actions in Thailand against the Government of the Union of Myanmar, of which they may question the legitimacy, but which is a member of the United Nations and is recognized by the Government of Thailand: I do hope that the Myanmar students in Thailand will spend their time as guests here in our country investing in themselves in acquiring knowledge that will be of practical use in developing their country when the time comes for them to decide on their own will to return to their homeland.
