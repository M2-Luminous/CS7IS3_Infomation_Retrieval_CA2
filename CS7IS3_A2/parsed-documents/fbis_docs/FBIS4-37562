Al-'Attas hailed the results of his visit to Saudi Arabia, concluded yesterday. He said: "On the two visits I recently made to Saudi Arabia I found the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz and all the brother Saudi officials very understanding. I can say that on this visit I am more optimistic about the future." Praising the Saudi position, he said: "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands with all its capabilities [willing] to help our people in their current plight." He expressed the southern leadership's readiness for dialogue, but after a cease-fire and the disengagement of forces. He affirmed his rejection of the revivial of the military committee formed before the war broke out. He urged regional and international organizations "to quickly provide urgent humanitarian aid for the Yemeni people in the Aden Governorate and surrounding governorates which are suffering from an acute shortage of medical supplies, food, and services as a result of the continuous shelling by the north Yemeni forces." He called on the military command in Sanaa to "submit to the resolutions of the international community and to international legitimacy by stopping the fighting and implementing Security Council resolution 924." He stressed the need for "international forces to separate the warring forces if Sanaa does not comply with the Security Council resolution." He reaffirmed the unity of the south Yemeni leadership, the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership, and their alliance with the patriotic forces in the south." He said that "the Sanaa regime has, since the beginning of unity, tried to divide the southern leadership and the YSP leadership. It failed in the past and it will fail now and in the future." He noted in this connection that "perhaps there are some people or some individuals with special circumstances, and, because of these circumstances, they take certain stands with the Sanaa regime." On the question of international recogntion of the DRY, al-'Attas said: "Our efforts are geared to stopping the war first. There is great sympathy with our efforts. That sympathy reflects recognition of the reality imposed by the circumstances of the war. After a cease-fire is achieved and consolidated we will turn to the international matter of recognition." He also spoke about the "sympathy of some Arab states with Sanaa." He said that "some very few states sympathize with the other side without knowing the real situation. Some of them perhaps take that attitude because of special circumstances relating to them, but one day they will know the truth and will take the position they should be taking." He expressed "satisfaction" with the U.S. position on the Yemeni war. He said that "the U.S. position is balanced and does not at all condone this war. It is against this war and does not approve of the imposition of unity by force. We are in contact with the United States and are explaining our views continuously. We believe that the U.S. position is balanced and helps toward the achievement of results that would, first and foremost, stop this war and consolidate the cease-fire so that we could move to the next phase, which is dialogue concerning the political situation in Yemen. That cause also concerns us, and we are ready for that phase which should come after the cease-fire, its consolidation, the cessation of the war, and the disengagement of the warring forces. Then we would be able to have an open-minded dialogue on the political situation, solutions, and ways out. [no closing quotation mark] Referring to his meeting in Jeddah with [the UN secretary general's envoy] Lakhdar Brahimi last Thursday evening, he said: "We resumed discussion of his mission based on our meetings with him in al-Mukalla last week. Brahimi had conveyed to us a proposal from the brothers in Sanaa regarding a military committee to supervise the cease-fire, but that proposal referred to an old committee formed before the war. It is clear that the war torpedoed all the insitutions which existed before and created a new situation. That is why we expressed complete willingness to search for an appropriate mechanism for the consolidation of the cease-fire and the monitoring of any violations which might occur, and that is in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 924. We explained to brother Lakhdar Brahimi our position, which included the following points: "1. Willingness to discuss, with whoever is assigned by Sanaa, this matter...of finding a mechanism for the observance and consolidation of the cease-fire, provided the meeting is held in Cairo. "2. That team (to discuss the cease-fire) should be formed in the context of implementation of Security Council resolution 924. "3. The meeting of representatives of the south and representatives of the north should be held under the chairmanship or the supervision of Brother Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general. "4. The meeting to be held in Cairo should be preceded by an effective cease-fire. "We gave brother Lakhdar Brahimi the names of our representatives for that meeting. They are: Brother Muhsin Muhammad Bin-Farid, Brother Qasim 'Abd-al-Rabb, and Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Bakri. We await the reply of the brothers in Sanaa." He reaffirmed that the military committee was invalid at the present time. He said: "The old military committee is invalid. It was formed in certain circumstances before the war, and it was formed by an administrative decision and included brothers from some Arab states, that is from Jordan and Oman in addition to the U.S. and French military attaches, but the new developments and the war situation require something else." He added: "We do not object to the old committee being part of the new committee to be formed, but the circle of participation must be enlarged to include the Arab League, the United Nations, and other states. We suggest participation of the rest of the Security Council members in the committee, and we suggest that a team of observers from states to be agreed on be attached to that committee. So, we are in favor of having this new committee, to be the new mechanism for the implementation of the Security Council resolution and to be attached to the representative of the UN secretary general."
