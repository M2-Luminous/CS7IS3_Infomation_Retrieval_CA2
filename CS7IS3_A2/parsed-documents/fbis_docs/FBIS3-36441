Pishchayev; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] [Pishchayev] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's subtleties knew no bounds today. At a meeting with electors in Moscow, he warned that presidential elections will be held before the end of parliament's two-year term in office, that is, this year. The LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] together, of course, with its leader will come to power. How can they not win if, as Vladimir Volfovich says, the government has betrayed the interests not only of the Russians but of all Slavs. Who do you think are the most inveterate traitors? [Video shows Zhirinovskiy addressing meeting] [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] These are the scoundrels in the current Russian Government: Kozyrev, Chubays, and Shokhin. [end recording] [Pishchayev] At the same time, he was rude about Russia's Choice, calling the faction Russia's Rejects. Regarding the government in the Kremlin, he remarked that it is pandering to the West which is testing on Serbia a method to destroy Russia. Once it has destroyed the Serbs, Zhirinovskiy said, world imperialism -- familiar vocabulary this -- wants to settle Muslims on their land and encircle Russia with an Islamic cordon. The LDPR leader also demanded that the United Nations cancel its sanctions against Serbia. He compared Mitterrand to Hitler, since the French president has proposed, in his words, bomb strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. Also today, Zhirinovskiy advised the Russian president not to sign a friendship treaty with Georgia but offer it gubernare status within the Russian Federation.
