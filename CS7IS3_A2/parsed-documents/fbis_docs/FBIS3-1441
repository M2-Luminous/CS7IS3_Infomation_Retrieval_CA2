It has become increasingly difficult to know what is going on in Lusaka because the information blackout [preceding word in English] has become more rigorous. Information from diplomatic sources reveal the mediator could ask the parties to bypass the discussions on the country's administration to the last point which is connected with elections. According to such sources, only after the conclusion of these discussions, would the parties resume discussions on the important point of the country's administration, within the framework of national reconciliation. Malian-born mediator Alioune Blondin Beye renewed his appeal to the negotiating parties to achieve a lasting peace as soon as possible.
