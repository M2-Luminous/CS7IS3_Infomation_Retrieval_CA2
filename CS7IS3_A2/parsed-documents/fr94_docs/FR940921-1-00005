On January 3, 1994, Maine submitted Chapter 137, ``Emission Statements'' and amendments to Chapter 100, ``Definitions.'' Rhode Island submitted amendments to Regulation Number 14 entitled ``Record Keeping and Reporting'' on January 12, 1993. On August 9, 1993, Vermont submitted a rule entitled ``Registration of Air Contaminant Sources,'' Sections 5&hyph;801 through 5&hyph;806, and a SIP Narrative, ``State of Vermont Air Quality Implementation Plan, February 1993.'' These SIP revisions were submitted by the States to satisfy the Federal requirements for an emission statement program as part of the SIP. COMMENTS: Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revisions and on US EPA's proposal to approve. DATES: Comments received in writing by October 21, 1994, will be considered in the development of US EPA's final rulemaking action. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed to Linda M.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The air quality planning and State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA or ``the Act''). EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIP's and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone transport areas within the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''), and 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NO X Supplement to the General Preamble'')). EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed in this Notice, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify part 40 of the CFR to reflect the requirements of the emission statement program.
