The statement on the situation in the Near East, which was distributed today by Russia's Foreign Ministry, will probably also arouse various emotions. The tense situation on the occupied Palestinian territories connected with the crime in Hebron is prompting Russia to take active steps towards a peaceful process. Mikhail Timurin, a staff member of the Press and Information Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, read us the text of the statement over the telephone: [Timurin] A tense situation persists on the occupied Palestinian territories. The Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation is keeping in constant touch with the Palestinian and Israeli leadership. On the personal instruction of the president of the Russian Federation, First Deputy Foreign Minister Ivanov has been sent to the Near East to meet with Chairman 'Arafat of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and also with the leaders of Israel. Russia believes it necessary for the UN Security Council to adopt an effective resolution with a view to ensuring security on the occupied territories. The idea of international protection for the civilian population on the occupied territories deserves most serious attention. The stalling -- for the umpteenth time now -- of the Near East talks shows that a new international impetus is needed for the cause of the reconciliation between Arabs and Israelis to proceed further. A second plenary meeting of the Madrid conference on the Near East at the level of foreign ministers could be this impetus.
