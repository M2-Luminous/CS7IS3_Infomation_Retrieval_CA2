FR940413-1-00015 FR940413-1-00005 At the present time, however, HUD lacks sufficient staff capacity to restructure a large number of loans. By selling delinquent loans, HUD would transfer restructuring responsibility to private purchasers who could swiftly and aggressively restore projects to economic health and stability. Many more tenants would benefit from swift resolution of loan delinquencies than from foreclosure, and for this reason, HUD proposes to sell nonperforming loans. There are three broad groups of delinquent mortgages suitable for sale: (1) Formerly coinsured mortgages, (2) mortgages on non-residential property, such as nursing homes, and (3) other unsubsidized mortgages. For formerly coinsured mortgages, it was never intended that HUD would become the holder of the mortgage or the owner of the project in the event of default. Under the coinsurance program, coinsuring lenders originally were responsible for foreclosing defaulted project mortgages and acquiring and disposing of the underlying properties. However, HUD agreed to convert coinsured mortgages to full insurance where the coinsuring lender issued GNMA mortgage-backed securities, subsequently defaulted on its obligations, and was taken over by GNMA. HUD's agreement to convert coinsured loans backed by GNMA mortgage securities to fully insured loans accounts for the formerly coinsured loans that are now in the HUD-held inventory. Low-income tenants in formerly coinsured projects with HUD-held mortgages are now potentially eligible for assistance should HUD foreclose the mortgage or acquire and sell the property. However, most projects with coinsured mortgages were built for market-rate occupancy. As with formerly insured mortgages, the Department would not sell those delinquent coinsured mortgages that it believes cannot avoid foreclose_i.e., those that have large unresolvable delinquencies, if those properties are occupied by low-income tenants not currently receiving rental subsidies who would do so under section 203 of the HCDA of 1978 if HUD foreclosed upon the mortgage. Non-residential properties, such as nursing homes, do not have landlord-tenant relationships and do not qualify for subsidy protection under Section 203. Loans on these properties are particularly suitable for a sale, because workout and renegotiation of these mortgages requires a range of specialized skills and knowledge not widely possessed by HUD staff. Finally, while some unsubsidized mortgages will continue to be foreclosed and the property sold by HUD, many unsubsidized mortgages will be sold in periodic sales in order more quickly and effectively to reinstate, refinance, or modify the mortgages and return the projects to stable operating condition. As noted above, the projects covered by unsubsidized mortgages to be sold would be occupied by tenants already paying market rate rental. Since projects would continue to be governed by market conditions following private mortgage restructuring, mortgage sales would be unlikely to result in involuntary tenant displacement. D. Sale of Subsidized Mortgages to State Agencies In addition to selling mortgages to private investors and FHA-approved mortgagees, HUD will consider selling subsidized HUD-held mortgages to interested State and local governments on a negotiated basis. Section 203(h)(3) of the HCDA of 1978 authorizes negotiated sales to State or local governments, or a group of investors which includes an agency of a State or local government provided that: (1) The terms of the sale include an agreement by the State or local government, or agency of same to act as mortgagee or owner of a beneficial interest in the mortgage, and ensure that the project will maintain occupancy by the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized housing program; and (2) the sales price is the best price that the Secretary can obtain from an agency of a State or local government, while maintaining occupancy for the tenant group originally intended to be served by the subsidized housing program.
