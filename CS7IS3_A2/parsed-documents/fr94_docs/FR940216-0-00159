FR940216-0-00159 FR940216-0-00010 Under the proposal, a refiner would be exempt from special blendstock accounting if the refiner's blendstock-to-gasoline ratio for any compliance year is three percent or less, regardless of how the increase compares with the baseline ratio. Blendstock tracking would be required only for refiners having a 1990 baseline more stringent than the anti-dumping statutory baseline. These provisions were designed to limit the blendstock accounting provisions to those circumstances where there is likely to be an environmental problem. This also would help to avoid unnecessary costs and burdens on the regulated community. In any case where EPA can show that a refiner transferred blendstocks in order to evade a more stringent baseline, however, the special blendstock accounting would be required. The proposed regulations would require refiners to track only specified blendstocks that have properties that are ``dirtier'' than normal anti-dumping baseline properties; a list of such blendstocks was included. In addition, tracking would not be required under the proposal for petroleum products the refiner could establish are used for non-gasoline-blending purposes. EPA received substantial comments on the blendstock accounting mechanism included in the 1993 proposal. Several comments addressed the manner in which the compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline ratios are compared to the baseline ratios. Several commenters said that the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio for any annual averaging period should be compared to the largest single-year ratio during the baseline period, and not to a multi-year averaging period as proposed. This change is necessary, according to one commenter, because refinery equipment is shut-down for maintenance during normal refinery operations (or a refinery equipment ``turnaround''), and that such turnarounds often will result in increased blendstock shipments from a refinery. An industry group commenter further stated that most refinery equipment goes through a maintenance turnaround every four years. Other commenters suggested that the possibility of triggers due to erratic blendstock-to-gasoline ratios should be solved by enlarging the ten percent ratio threshold. EPA agrees with the concerns raised by these comments, and has modified the manner in which blendstock-to-gasoline ratios are compared in the final rule. During 1995 through 1997, the annual compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio is compared to the largest one-year ratio during the baseline period. Beginning in 1998, however, because of data availability due to the implementation of the reformulated gasoline regulations the compliance period ratio is a running average consisting of the average of the current year's ratio and the ratios from the three previous years. This four-year compliance period ratio is compared to the similar four-year baseline ratio. EPA believes this approach to evaluating blendstock-to-gasoline ratios responds to the concerns raised by the commenters, and will minimize if not eliminate the chance that the ten percent threshold will be exceeded because of maintenance, turnarounds and other like events that do not indicate a transfer of production to achieve a less stringent baseline. For example, any increase in blendstock sales volume during the compliance period that is due to refinery equipment turnaround should be matched by blendstock sales volume during the baseline period that also is due to a turnaround. Beginning in 1998 the comparison of four-year averages should further dampen any unusual, short-term deviations from the normal proportion of refinery sales that is blendstock. EPA believes comparing the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio of a four-year compliance period with a four-year baseline period provides the best indication of a refiner's overall approach to blendstock production, because of its correlation with the normal period of refinery equipment turnarounds. During the first three years of the program when a four-year compliance period is not possible, however, the approach of comparing each compliance year's blendstock-to-gasoline ratio with the largest single year's ratio during the baseline period is the best alternative. EPA believes the one-year ratio comparison approach is inferior to the four-year ratio comparison approach as a long-term program mechanism, because under the one-year approach there is the potential for refiners to have large blendstock-to-gasoline ratios in each year that are not due to normal refinery operations, yet these ratios would be acceptable if smaller than the largest one-year ratio from the baseline period. The final rule nevertheless includes the one-year approach for 1995 through 1997, because refiners will be required to include 1995 through 1997 blendstock ratios in their 1998 four-year average ratio. Any refiner who has produced excess blendstock in order to ``game'' the one-year comparison approach during the first three program years is likely to fail the more appropriate four-year comparison in 1998. EPA believes the likelihood such a refiner would violate the ten percent threshold and incur the consequent blendstock accounting requirements will constrain refiner gaming of this type.
