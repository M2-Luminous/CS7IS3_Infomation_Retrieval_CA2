IEC spokesman Niki Moore said yesterday although political parties had handed in their final party lists last month, a large number of candidates had decided not to stand. It is understood that others dropped off the list after irregularities were discovered when details provided by the political parties were checked against state records. Following the closing date for the submission of candidates' lists, the IEC had barred political parties from adding names to their lists, she said. But the commission could not prevent parties from withdrawing names from their lists if candidates decided they did not intend standing. A total of 12,610 candidates had been put forward by political parties and their names were published in the March 31 Government Gazette. It is understood that few changes will be made to the major parties' lists. Some smaller parties submitted long lists, which included candidates whose chances of being elected are slight. This has raised speculation that some parties put forward candidates simply to ensure they had enough canvassers.
