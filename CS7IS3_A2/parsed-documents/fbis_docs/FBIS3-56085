Posts and outposts periodically come under unprovoked fire from Afghan territory. In the last five days the border guards of the Pyandzh border detachment stopped three attempts of armed groups of mojahedin of the Tajik opposition to break through the border from Afghanistan. Fortunately, there have been no losses among the Russian servicemen.
