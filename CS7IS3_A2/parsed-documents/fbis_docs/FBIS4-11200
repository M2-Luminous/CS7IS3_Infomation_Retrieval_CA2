The Solidarity Action Movement (MAS) legislator, who held a seat during deposed coupist President Jorge Serrano's (1991-1993) administration, claimed that the call for elections violated his political rights. In confirming the temporary suspension of the electoral process, a Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) magistrate said today that his organization accepts but does not share the CSJ ruling.
