Phase II should result in a carefully documented examination of alternative approaches and the selection of an approach to be used in the Phase III design process. Phase III: The purpose of Phase III is the completion of activities initiated under Phase II, the initiation of new activities required to implement programs, and the design of on-site actions required to mitigate environmental damage from DOD activities. The Phase III activities may include but need not be limited to: •development and implementation of a detailed management plan to: guide corrective action; resolve issues rising from overlapping or conflicting jurisdictions; guide a cooperative and collaborative effort among all parties to ensure there are no duplicative or conflicting regulatory requirements governing the cleanup actions; and, establish a tribal or village framework and/or parameter(s) that will guide the negotiations process for one or multiple cleanup actions; •establishment of priorities for mitigation programs when there are multiple clean-up sites; consider at a minimum the nature of the hazard involved: such as its physical and chemical characteristics, including concentrations and mobility of contaminants; the pathway indicating potential for contaminant transport via surface water, ground water and air/soil, and any other indicators that are identified during the environmental assessment, including the prioritization process identified under Phase II; •program design and implementation of information dissemination strategies prior to start up of on-site implementation of mitigation program activities; •development of a legal and jurisdictional strategy that addresses DOD/contractor liability issues to ensure quality, cost-effective mitigation services, and to evaluate any measures providing equitable risk between the DOD and the remediation contractor, as well as to incorporate Tribal Employment Rights Office (TERO) and other policies and procedures, if required; •design of an approval process and other processes necessary for the implementation of tribal and village codes and regulations for current and future compliance enforcement of all mitigation actions; •development/design of a documentation strategy to ensure all DOD and contractor cleanup activities are conducted and completed in a environmentally clean and safe manner for the social and economic welfare, as well as public health of Indian and Alaska Native people and the surrounding environment; •development and conduct of certified training programs that will enable a local work force to become technically capable to participate in the mitigation activities, if they so choose; and •conduct of any other activities deemed necessary to carry out Phase I, II and III activities. Phase III should result in a comprehensive plan for conducting all aspects of mitigation action contemplated. Phase IV: The Phase IV activities are the implementation of mitigation plans specified in the detailed plan completed in Phase III. C.
