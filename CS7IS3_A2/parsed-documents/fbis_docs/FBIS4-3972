FBIS4-3972 "drchi080_q_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-080 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 Southwest Region Southwest Region Expands Economic Cooperation Southwest Region Expands Economic Cooperation HK2604033694 Chengdu Sichuan People's Radio Network in Mandarin 2300 GMT 15 Apr 94 HK2604033694 Chengdu Sichuan People's Radio Network Mandarin BFN [Text] Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou Provinces, Guangxi and Tibet Autonomous Regions, and the cities of Chengdu and Chongqing have joined together to explore the market, thus enabling the great southwest to march toward the new market structure with giant strides. The southwest is one of the areas in China with the greatest potential for economic growth. Nevertheless, the southwest's per capita gross industrial and agricultural output value was lower than that of other parts of the country by 320 yuan in the early 1980's. Since early 1984, after the southwest economic cooperation program was initiated, the great southwest has been rising rapidly as a new power in the market. In 1993, the area's gross industrial and agricultural output value increased by more than 230 percent over 1983. Nowadays, the southwest has become one of the areas in China with the greatest economic vitality. Over the past 10 years, the five provinces and autonomous regions and the two cities have lifted restrictions one after another, removed barriers between them, and opened their own markets to each other. As a result, more than 6,000 economic cooperation projects were started. In the field of communications and telecommunications, all the parties of the southwest have joined to raise funds totaling more than 200 million yuan to build trans- provincial highways with a total length of 918 km, four cross-river bridges linking Sichuan Province with other provinces and regions, and opened more than 100 province-wide passenger transport routes. With the support of all parties, the electrification projects for the Chengdu-Chongqing, Guiyang-Kunming, and Chongqing-Guiyang railways were completed ahead of schedule. The key postal and telecommunication facility projects and microwave telecommunication centers of such central cities as Chengdu, Chongqing, and Kunming, as well as the Tibet satellite telecommunication station, have been put into operation. Members of the southwest have also made major progress in their joint efforts to explore energy resources.
