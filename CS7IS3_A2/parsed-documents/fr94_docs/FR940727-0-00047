ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: NASA has revised the NASA FAR Supplement to address the action NASA centers must take when the Small Business Administration (SBA) appeals a decision not to set aside a procurement for small businesses. DATES: Effective Date: This interim rule is effective July 27, 1994. Comments: Comments are due no later than September 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to Ms. Deborah O'Neill, Procurement Policy Division (Code HP), Office of Procurement, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Deborah O'Neill, (202) 358&hyph;0440. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Current policy contained in NASA FAR Supplement §1819.505 (c), (d), and (e) addresses situations in which a small business set-aside is not initiated or pursued. In NFS §1819.505(c), if the contracting officer disapproves the Small Business Specialist's set-aside recommendation, the contracting officer shall promptly refer the case to the SBA representative (if one is assigned and available) for review. In NFS §1819.505(d), cases involving the non-initiation of a set-aside require referral to the SBA representative (if one is assigned and available) for review. NFS §1819.505(e) addresses the situation when an SBA representative is not assigned or available, and the contracting officer disagrees with the Small Business Specialist's recommendation on a small business set-aside, or withdrawal or modification of a set-aside determination. The Small Business Specialist may make a written appeal to the center procurement officer whose decision may overrule the Small Business Specialist's recommendation. Upon later review of this action, SBA may disagree with the procurement officer's decision not to set aside a procurement for small business and may appeal the decision. If SBA does pursue an appeal in the situations described in NFS §1819.505 (c), (d), or (e), the Office of Procurement at NASA Headquarters wants the NASA center to notify them in writing as soon as SBA appeals the procurement officer's decision.

The SBA representatives may appeal the contracting officer's decision as described in 1819.505 (c) or (d) to the procurement officer, who may support the contracting officer's decision. Upon later review of the procurement officer's decision approving the contracting officer's determination described in 1819.505(e), SBA may disagree with the procurement officer's decision not to set aside a procurement for small business. If the SBA appeals the procurement officer's decision, Code H should be notified in writing as soon as SBA appeals this decision. This notification should include a history of the center and SBA discussions on the procurement as well as any actions the center has taken.
