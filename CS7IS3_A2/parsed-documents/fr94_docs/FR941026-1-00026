FR941026-1-00026 FR941026-1-00013 Section 1653.2(c) specifically states that certain orders are not qualifying. Section 1653.2(c)(1) provides that an order relating only to money that is not vested (under 5 U.S.C. 8432(g)) shall not be deemed a qualifying order unless the money will become vested within 90 days of receipt of the order if the participant remains in Federal employment. Section 1653.2(c)(2) represents a significant departure from current rules for processing court orders. Under current rules the Board has been paying court orders as soon as the amount of the award can be calculated, even where the order calls for a payment at a later date. In cases where a dollar amount is awarded and the order specifies that payment is to be made upon a date in the future, that dollar amount has been paid immediately. On the other hand, where the amount of the award is based on a percentage of the account balance as of a date in the future (such as the participant's separation from Federal Government employment or some other specified date), or is based on a percentage determined by a formula containing variables that cannot be determined until a date in the future, the Board's current procedures have called for the order to be retained by the Board so that payment could be made at the appropriate time in the future. Under ยง1653.2(c)(2)(i) of the proposed rules, orders requiring payment at a future specified date will not be considered qualifying orders unless two requirements are met. First, it must be currently possible to calculate the amount of the entitlement. Second, the award must provide for interest or earnings to be paid on the amount of the award until the date of payment. If both of these requirements are met, the order will be considered qualifying. However, payment will be made not at the future date specified in the order, but rather will be made currently after following the procedures of ยง1653.5. The rationale for this limited exception to the general rule that orders requiring future payment will be rejected is that, where the amount of the award can currently be calculated and the order calls for interest or earnings, a payment of that amount currently is the economic equivalent of a payment of the same amount plus earnings at a future date. However, under the proposed regulations there will be no case in which the Board will hold orders until a future date specified by a court for payment. Section 1653.2(c)(2)(ii) is designed to clarify that is not necessary for the exact amount of the award to be determinable upon receipt of the order by the Board. An order may be qualifying if it provides for a current payment to be calculated as of the date of payment. The Board recognizes that the procedures set forth in the proposed regulations will often require a few months between the receipt of the order by the Board and the payment of the account. Orders will not be deemed non-qualifying future orders merely because the amount of the award cannot be calculated until a payment date that will invariably be later than the date of receipt of the order by the Board. For example, an order that incorporates a formula using a variable such as the number of months of the participant's Federal employment as of the date of payment would not be considered a non-qualifying future order, even though the length of the participant's Federal service will have to be determined as of the date of payment, which is likely to be a few months after the Board's receipt of the order. Section 1653.2(d) defines the term ``former spouse'' as used in the proposed regulations, by adopting the definition contained in 5 U.S.C. 8401(12). Section 1653.3 sets forth procedures for reviewing retirement benefits court orders. Section 1653.3(a) provides that the Board will process court orders in accordances with applicable Federal law, namely FERSA and the Board's regulations. The Board's processing of court orders is not controlled by the procedures of the state divorce courts. Section 1653.3(a) also makes it clear that the Board cannot be made a party to the underlying divorce action and thereby be subject to the jurisdiction of the court handling the divorce proceeding. The Board is a Federal agency which, under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, is not subject to suit in state court absent specific statutory authorization. Therefore, legal process to join the Board as a party to a divorce proceeding will not be honored. Parties to a divorce must, without the Board's participation in the proceeding, obtain from the court an appropriate order and then submit that order to the Board for a determination as to whether it is a qualifying order. To the extent there is any dispute about the Board's actions concerning a court order, the matter must be resolved in Federal court under 5 U.S.C. 8477, not in state court.
