"I can give no assurance whatsoever that the negotiations can be concluded by the end of the year," said GATT secretary general Peter Sutherland prior to crucial talks with top Chinese foreign trade officials that will have a significant bearing on the outcome of China's bid for readmission. There are considerable difficulties ... and it is quite clear that a great deal remains to be done," Sutherland said in an interview with AFP. China, which was a founder member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) but left after the communists came to power in 1949, has made it clear it attaches great political significance to being readmitted before the institution is replaced by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on January 1. "But there is so much that can be done within a limited time frame," Sutherland said. [sentence as received] "Whether we have enough time or not remains to be seen." While GATT members are unanimous on the importance of China to the WTO, strong reservations persist over its ability to conform with requirements on a whole range of trade issues, especially the question of trade transparency. "Its trade rules and regulations and their availiability for analysis are in dispute and there are those who would say there is not an adequate degree of clarity as yet," Sutherland said, citing questions over licensing mechanisms, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers. There is a sense of a lack of understanding that needs to be overcome, and this requires pro-active work by China in persuading and explaining. It's not merely a question of political will," Sutherland said, adding that negotiations between now and the end of the year would require "enormous engagement." Sutherland was scheduled to hold a series of high-level talks Tuesday afternoon with Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, assistant minister Long Yongtu and vice premier in charge of foreign trade Li Lanqing.
