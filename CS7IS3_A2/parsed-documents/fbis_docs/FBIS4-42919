This is the plan formulated by Ferdinando Adornato, former spokesman for the Democratic Alliance [AD], who yesterday left the mixed group in the Chamber of Deputies to become part of the progressive alignment. But Adornato will carve out his own independent niche within the left-wing front, an Area, as the group will be called, to "multiply the opportunities for dialogue and debate, with the aim of facilitating in as many instances as possible opportunities for mutual coordination in parliament." The plan carries 12 signatures. Apart from Adornato, Deputies Serafino Pulcini and Enzo Torre also left the mixed group, while nine other Area deputies have come from the progressive group. There are former representatives of the Democratic Alliance such as Giovanna Melandrini, Miriam Mafai, Pasquale La Cerra, and Nicola Magrone, constituting part of the AD leadership which split when the time came to choose parliamentary groups. Willer Bordon, however, with the group of former Republicans elected on the AD lists, did not support the decision, and has stayed in the mixed group. Area has been joined, however, by a number of members elected on the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] lists, including Fabio Evangelisti, Ennio Grassi, Marco Pezzoni, and two independents, Ferdinando Schettino and Sergio De Julio. Thus, as the progressive forces' caucus leader, Luigi Berlinguer, noted with satisfaction, the diaspora of left-wing deputies that took different paths after the elections, is rallying together again: "With the three new members, we have reached 167 and are by far the largest group." Adornato stressed that Area "will not be a political subject" but an instrument for "policy discussions" of "liberal-democratic, Christian, and environmentalist" leanings, open to contributions from "all interested parliamentarians." It will be active on two major fronts: rules and modernization. In order to "rejuvenate" the country it has a "program for life" comprising three main points: a form of capitalism featuring widely distributed ownership, educational reform, and the defense of human and social relations and of the vulnerable sectors of society -- "all issues rarely the subject of comprehensive dialogue." With regard to rules, the promotion of an institutional and socioeconomic federalism, the direct election of the prime minister (with a system of checks in order to ensure a balance of power) and antitrust legislation whereby no single television company has more than one channel. "Berlusconi," Adornato said, "cannot represent an impartial viewpoint with regard to the television system. His attack on the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] was the first time he showed himself reasoning as a politician and not as a businessman." Adornato suggests "making state contributions subject to open criteria of efficiency and productivity." He was scathing with regard to the opinion polls that the prime minister has produced on the subject of the RAI: "I too have conducted some opinion polls, and it emerges that what the voters are demanding from the RAI is not a policy program but efficiency; they want an end to the duopoly, and they consider Berlusconi too biased." His final proposal for a comprehensive reform of the television system was to entrust the plan to a committee of experts, "perhaps comprising [author] Umberto Eco, [LA VOCE editor] Indro Montanelli, former directors of television news programs, and former chairmen of the Constitutional Court."
