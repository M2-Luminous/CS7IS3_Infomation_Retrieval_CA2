"I have received a very kind message to this effect from Bill Clinton in which he confirms the fact of his arrival in Riga and his wish to meet the presidents of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia," Brazauskas said. The Lithuanian president expects to discuss with Bill Clinton regional problems and hopes for Clinton's support which "has been felt until now." Brazauskas added that "we would attempt once again to acquaint the U.S. president with the conditions for foreign investments into the Lithuanian economy, which, in our opinion, are not bad and which we are going to improve, taking into account the experience of Central European states."
