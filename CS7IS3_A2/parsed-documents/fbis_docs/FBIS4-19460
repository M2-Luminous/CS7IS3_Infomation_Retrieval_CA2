Environmental cooperation with Estonia and Karelia has advanced well, but has been badly limping with Russia. Jaana Kannninen reports: [Kanninen] Finland has pursued environmental cooperation as part of its foreign policy for three years. There have been joint projects with four separate regions: Estonia, St. Petersburg, Karelia, and Kola. It became clear during these years that it is easier for a small unit to work with another small unit. The projects in Estonia and Karelia have got off the ground well. [Begin unidentified voice recording] The problem areas are the Murmansk area, St. Petersburg, and the Leningrad region where the scale is large. If one looks at this problem of scale, Finland's possibility of having more effective input in environmental cooperation in this region lies in seeking international cooperation partners, thereby sharing the burden. For instance, if we join the European Union, one central possibility is to direct the European Union's environment policies into these areas and that way acquire more resources. [end recording] [Kanninen] Tapani Vaahtoranta, director of the Foreign Policy Institute, says that there are other reasons too for the failure in Russia. The Russians have criticized the Finns for being too selfish. According to them, the Finns want, above all, to boost their exports of environmental technology. Surprise has also been expressed that the Finns want to support what locals regard as secondary issues. Why is it so important to clean St. Petersburg's effluent when the inhabitants in the region do not even have proper drinking water, people have asked. One problem is that, with the exception of the Republic of Karelia, Russia's decisions are still made in Moscow, far from the problems. The Foreign Policy Institute suggests that Finland could start supporting local citizens' organizations. [passage omitted] The effluent purification plant in Tallinn is the most advanced of the cooperation projects. The renovation of the power stations in Narva and the installation of desulphurization equipment in Kostamus are also in the construction stage. In the past three years, 110 million markkas of Finnish money has been spent on near-area cooperation, a sum that has been worthwhile spending beyond the border, even for selfish reasons, says director Tapani Vaahtoranta.
