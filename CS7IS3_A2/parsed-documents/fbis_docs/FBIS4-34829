Here is Cecilia Cayone with a report: [Cayone] Noris Aguirre made this statement after she was summoned by the congressional Finance Commission regarding the granted financial assistance. Aguirre had said only depositors in Caracas will be paid today. [Begin recording] [Aguirre] Only offices in Caracas will make payments while offices in the interior will begin payments tomorrow. Concerning Banco Amazonas, its Caracas offices will open at 1400. [Cayone] Will payments be made only upon presentation of a bankbook [word indistinct]? [Aguirre] Yes. Payments will only be made in this manner. [end recording] [Cayone] Meanwhile, Deputy (Jorge Roy) has said the Radical Cause Party will file criminal charges in the coming days against the Finance Ministry, the Banks Superintendency, and Fogade, because that party believes the granted financial assistance violates the General Banking Law. [Begin (Jorge Roy) recording] All financial assistance that has been granted in the past days must comply with Article 314 of the Banking Law, no exceptions. Article 314 clearly stipulates that no financial assistance can surpass the total amount, whatever it may be, which Fogade collected during the previous year or the previous two semesters. Fogade never collected more than 100 billion bolivares in 1993; therefore, the granted financial assistance should not have surpassed 200 billion bolivares. We asked Aguirre about this issue today, and she said she should have an answer ready by tomorrow, because her lawyers are studying the case. We are totally convinced this financial assistance is illegal, because it should have never surpassed 100 billion bolivares. As soon as we have Aguirre's report, we will proceed to file the corresponding charges. [end recording]
