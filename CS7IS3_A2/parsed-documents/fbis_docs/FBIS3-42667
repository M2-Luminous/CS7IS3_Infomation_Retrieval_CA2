The point is that despite good intentions--to ensure maximum budget revenues from customs duty--all documents that are being issued complicate considerably customs paperwork, which in practical terms nullifies the effectiveness of foreign trade deals. The Russia GTK's Order No. 549, "On Ensuring Payment of Customs Duties With Respect to Goods Subject to Excise Tax," the distribution of which to Russian customs points began yesterday, is no exception. In keeping with the Russian GTK's new instruction, importers of goods subject to excise tax are required practically before the contract is fulfilled to transfer to the escrow account in the customs where the shipment eventually will be processed a deposit in an amount equal to the value of the expected customs duty. After the necessary amount is deposited with the internal customs, this information is to be sent to the customs point where the shipment will be crossing the border. Without this exchange of information between customs services, the goods will not permitted to enter Russia. Everything would seem to be clear. The goal that is pursued in this is to preclude the possibility of an import shipment "disappearing" on the way from the border to the customs clearing point and, correspondingly, to safeguard the treasury from loss of revenue. This is where, however, the problems begin, which stem from the document provisions being insufficiently thought through and as a result nullifying all good intentions. First, the new rules for imports of goods subject to excise tax extend not only to regular imports, but also to re-export and transit. While with respect to re-export everything is more or less clear--the problems here mainly involve temporarily tying up the money, there is confusion with respect to goods coming through in transit. For instance, it is not clear how to treat the goods that are on consignment. Since the document does not cover at all the possibility of goods being delivered in the internal customs transit mode not only from the border but also from the customs warehouse, it turns out that whether to process or not to process the goods subject to excise tax under the new rules depends entirely on the individual customs inspector. The necessity of ensuring that the route of goods delivery from abroad goes only through a specific border point where the permission to enter has been sent will create additional complications for importers. It is not always possible to foresee in which particular place some shipment or other will cross the border of Russia. One of the factors affecting this may be that a foreign company with whom the contract is signed may ship the goods, for instance, from one of its warehouses abroad. In addition, transport companies that make international deliveries plan their delivery route taking into consideration the interests of several clients simultaneously. Finally, the point of permitted border entry may be "wiped out by an avalanche" or end up in a war zone. But the simplest obstacle that makes this document virtually unworkable is customs itself, because of its imperfect system of operational record keeping and control over arriving goods, as well as poor training of customs officers. One way or the other, it is obvious that Order No. 549 and a number of recently issued documents regarding entry of goods subject to excise tax will reduce the number of their importers, which will have a detrimental effect both on retail trade and the state budget. [Box, p 2] From the Russian GTK's Order No 549 --Money with respect to goods being shipped shall be deposited in the escrow account of a customs organs in advance--before the goods actually cross the customs border of Russia, but no later than 10 calendar days before the expected date of the goods actually crossing the customs border of Russia. Money with respect to transit goods shall be deposited in the escrow account of a customs organ before transit goods actually cross the customs border of Russia. --In the event that the customs organ at the departure point is not in possession of information permitting delivery of goods, or in the event that the amount of the security bond shown in the delivery control document (DCD) exceeds the amount actually deposited with the internal customs organ, the goods entering the country shall not be sent to the internal customs organ until the difference is deposited with the internal customs organs, with the exception of instances when the difference between said amounts results from a change in the ECU exchange rate.
