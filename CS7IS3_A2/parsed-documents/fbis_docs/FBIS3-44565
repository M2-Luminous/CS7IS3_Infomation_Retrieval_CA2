On December 27, 1993, the spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council (HKMAOSC) stated that the British-Hong Kong three-tier political structures, namely the Legislative Council, district boards and two municipal councils of Hong Kong, should be disbanded upon the termination of British rule over Hong Kong on June 30, 1997. At a press conference held two days later, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten accused the HKMAOSC of having pre-empted the right of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee to interpret the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, saying that HKMAOSC's statement violated the Basic Law itself, for instance, the article 160. Experts who took part in drafting the Basic Law pointed out that it is certainly the NPC Standing Committee's right to interpret the Basic Law, and this is defined in the Basic Law. However, they argued, the spokesman of the HKMAOSC was only reiterating the contents defined clearly in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and was not executing the right to interpret the Basic Law. The experts pointed out that both the forward of the Basic Law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulated clearly that the government of the People's Republic of China will resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997 and Britain will terminate its rule over Hong Kong. With the termination of British rule, the British political structures in Hong Kong will also be terminated and disbanded. Why should it be necessary to interpret this again? they asked. Xiao Weiyun, professor of the department of law of Beijing University, stressed that it is the internal affair of China and within state sovereignty to decide which institutions and organizations should be retained and which ones should be abolished according to the concrete situation and the principle of the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Chris Patten has no right to make indiscreet remarks on this. Professor Xiao, who took part in the whole process of drafting the Basic Law, recalled that the Chinese government has tried to follow the principle of keeping the social and economic systems and the people's living style in Hong Kong unchanged and making as little change as possible in the legal and political systems of Hong Kong. This is aimed at maintaining the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and ensuring a smooth transition of the city. These are precisely the wishes of the compatriots in Hong Kong. With this purpose, Professor Xiao said, the Chinese government has done its utmost to work sincerely during the Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994/95 elections. However, Chris Patten unilaterally decided to gazette the electoral bill and submit it to the Legislative Council before any agreement was reached between the British and Chinese sides in their talks, thus completely destroying the basis of further Sino-British cooperation on the issue. Under such urgent and complicated circumstances, Professor Xiao pointed out, the HKMAOSC spokesman made the above mentioned statement. The statement showed the firm attitude of the Chinese government toward the Hong Kong issue and reiterated and safeguarded the spirit of the Basic Law rather than violation of the law. Article 160 of the Basic Law reads: "Upon the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative region, the laws previously in force in Hong Kong shall be adopted as laws of the region except for those which the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress declares to be in contravention of this law. If any laws are later discovered to be in contravention of this law, they shall be amended or cease to have force in accordance with the procedure as prescribed by this law. Documents, certificates, contracts, and rights and obligations valid under the laws previously in force in Hong Kong shall continue to be valid and be recognized and protected by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, provided that they do not contravene this law." Some experts pointed out that article 160 talks about the issue of law while the HKMAOSC spokesman was talking about the issue of state sovereignty and the termination of British rule over Hong Kong. The British-Hong Kong authorities have no right to extend their political structures into the period after 1997. The experts noted that what Chris Patten said was beside the point, which showed that Mr. Patten is ignorant about the basic law. The experts pointed out that it is the British-Hong Kong authorities that have made improper interpretation of the Basic Law. For example, they have demanded that the formation of the preparatory committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Committee should be the result of Sino-British consultation and that China should promise to adopt universal suffrage in election of the Hong Kong Legislative Council in 2007. Actually, these will all be the internal affairs of China and are no business of Chris Patten. Many people have advised the last governor of Hong Kong to read the Basic Law more carefully so as to make fewer funny mistakes.
