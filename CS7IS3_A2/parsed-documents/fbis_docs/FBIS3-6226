Japan's export ceiling for the year should be worked out before the next fiscal year starts on April 1, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister, told a press conference. The comment came ahead of Japan-EU auto talks scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Tokyo, which are expected to discuss the size of auto demand in the EU in 1994, the benchmark for setting Japan's auto shipments to the union. In talks in February, the two parties failed to narrow their difference on the prospects for demand for cars in the EU. The Europeans projected demand would level off, while the Japanese predicted a slight pickup. The 1992 Japan-EU accord calls for the two sides to monitor Japanese car exports during a 1993-1999 transitional period before the EU auto market is fully liberalized in 2000.
