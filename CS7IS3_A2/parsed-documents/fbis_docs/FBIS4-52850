Hata told a plenary session of the House of Councillors that there is a growing voice in the United Nations for Japan to play a larger role in the key UN forum, which was set up by the victors of World War II. Hata said many important issues, including even environment and population problems, are decided at the council. "There is a call in the UN in the new age for Japan to play a role," Hata said. The premier responded to questions by Manso Hamamoto of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] and Akira Kuroyanagi of Komeito over Hata's key policy speech before the Diet last week. Hata also said the government is working on objective criteria to measure progress in Japan's market opening steps to reduce its huge trade surplus with the U.S., but reiterated his refusal to set numerical targets. While stressing the importance of improving soured trade ties with the U.S., Hata said setting numerical targets would run counter to the efforts for administrative reform aimed at lessening the government's intervention in the private sector. The bilateral talks under a trade framework agreement foundered in February, when former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa rejected demands by U.S. President Bill Clinton for numerical targets to gauge market access improvement in some sectors, such as in autos, insurance and medical equipment procurement.
