FBIS4-60543 "drnes102_l_94007" FBIS-NES-94-102 Daily Report 20 May 1994 ISRAEL Officials Differ on Timing of Request for U.S. Aid Officials Differ on Timing of Request for U.S. Aid TA2005134694 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 20 May 94 pp A1, A10 TA2005134694 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] [Excerpts] Israel has begun holding contacts with U.S. congressmen prior to submitting a request for special U.S. military aid as compensation for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights within the framework of a peace arrangement with Syria. Israeli Ambassador in Washington Itamar Rabinovich met with a prominent senator several days ago and presented Israel's security needs in the context of an agreement with Syria. Rabinovich explained that Israel would ask for aid in order to offset any damage to the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] deterrence and preclude any surprise Syrian attack. Rabinovich stressed that since no progress had been made yet in the negotiations with Syria, these were only initial preparations and no official request has been formulated so far. [passage omitted] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq has briefed the Americans on Israel's security needs in the event of an arrangement with Syria and has asked for approximately $5 billion in special aid. Baraq also specified the new weapons systems Israel will need, especially in the deterrence field. During Secretary of State Warren Christopher's last visit, a U.S.-Israeli working group was established to discuss the security components of the arrangement with Syria. On the Israeli side, the group includes the chief of staff; Amb. Rabinovich; and Major General Dani Yatom, the prime minister's military secretary, while the U.S. side is made up of the members of the U.S. peace team, including General Mike Ryan, the head of the planning department of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon. The working group held another meeting during Christopher's visit this week. The presentation of the aid request to the Americans sparked sharp disagreements in the defense establishment because no staff work had been conducted and no detailed discussion held on the components of the procurement list before it was presented to the U.S. team. The chief of staff claimed that it is preferable to conclude the details of the defense aid with the United States at an early stage of the negotiations, in order to secure a U.S. commitment to assist Israel. Defense Ministry Director General David 'Ivri claimed that an early agreement on U.S. compensation to Israel, even before an arrangement with Syria has been achieved, would enable the Americans to pressure Israel to accede to Syria's demands. He proposed putting off presenting the list of demands to the United States until progress is made in the negotiations with Damascus. Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, tried to resolve the differences and announced that the list handed to the Americans merely reflects initial ideas and thoughts and that more orderly staff work would be prepared on this matter in the future. The Defense Ministry director general said during internal consultations that he will demand that the procurement list presented to the Americans be amended and include a request to strengthen the U.S. commitment to Israel's defense against surface-to-surface missiles. 'Ivri explained that defense against surface-to-surface missiles will continue to be an important issue even after a peace arrangement is reached because of the threat posed by distant countries and the growing use of missiles around the world. This week, Scud missiles were fired in the war in Yemen. [passage omitted]
