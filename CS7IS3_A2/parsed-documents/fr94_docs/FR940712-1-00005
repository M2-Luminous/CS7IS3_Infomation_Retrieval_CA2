FR940712-1-00005 FR940712-1-00001 Section 3201.104␣Restrictions Concerning the Purchase of Property Held by the Corporation or the RTC as Conservator, Receiver, or Liquidator of the Assets of an Insured Depository Institution, or by a Bridge Bank Organized by the Corporation In order to avoid any self-dealing, appearance of self-dealing, adversarial relationship with the Corporation, or diminution of public confidence in the Corporation's ability to accomplish its mission, an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, would be prohibited under §3201.104(a) from purchasing assets held by the Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) as conservator, receiver, or liquidator or held by a bridge bank organized by the Corporation. In such roles, the Corporation and the RTC generally act as a fiduciary to the creditors of failed depository institutions. Property held by the RTC has been included in the proposed prohibition because of the RTC's significant ties with the Corporation. As proposed, §3201.104(b) would disqualify an employee involved in the disposition of the assets of a failed insured depository institution from participation in the disposition of such assets when the employee knows that a person with whom he or she holds a covered relationship intends to purchase such assets. Written notification of the disqualification would be required to be made by the employee to his or her immediate supervisor and the agency designee. Section 3201.105␣Prohibition on Dealings With Former Employers, Associates, and Clients In order to avoid the appearance of favoritism and maintain the integrity of the Corporation's regulatory oversight, insurance assessments, and resolution and liquidation transactions, proposed §3201.105(a) would prohibit an employee, for a period of one year after entering on duty with the Corporation, from participating in official Corporation matters involving an employer with whom the employee worked during the year preceding the employee's entry on duty with the Corporation. Proposed §3201.105(b) would include within the definition of the term employer a broad range of persons, as defined in 5 CFR 2635.502, with whom the employee has a covered relationship. In an individual case, §3201.105(c) would give the agency designee discretion to extend the prohibition beyond the one year period that would automatically apply to all new Corporation employees. Section 3201.106␣Employment of Family Members Outside the Corporation As proposed, §3201.106 would continue the Corporation's requirement at 12 CFR 336.21 that an employee be disqualified from participation in particular matters involving employers of family members or members of the employee's household. It would also require the employee to report the employment of family members or members of the employee's household by FDIC-insured depository institutions or companies that have business, or are seeking to do business, with the Corporation. This requirement eliminates the potential for any appearance of preferential treatment in those instances where employment of a family member or a member of the employee's household would be likely to raise questions regarding the appropriateness of actions taken by the employee or the Corporation. Section 3201.107␣Outside Employment and Other Activities Proposed §3201.107(a) would prohibit an employee from providing services, for compensation, to an FDIC-insured depository institution or to a person employed by such institution. The prohibition is based, in part, on 18 U.S.C. 1909, which prohibits an examiner from performing any service for compensation for any FDIC-insured depository institution or for any person connected therewith. Similarly, proposed §3201.107(b) would restrict an employee from using certain professional licenses in compensated outside activities when the employee's duties to the Corporation involve those activities. The areas involved in the prohibition have been limited to areas identified as especially sensitive and critical to corporate operations. Proposed §3201.107(c) would make it the responsibility of the employee to consult with an agency designee concerning outside employment or activities that could result in disqualification of the employee from his or her official duties. Section 3201.108␣Related Statutory and Regulatory Authorities This section sets forth additional statutory and regulatory authorities with which an employee should be familiar. Section 3201.109␣Provisions of 5 CFR Part 2635 Not Applicable to Corporation Employees Certain provisions of the Standards of Ethical Conduct have been determined by the Corporation to be inapplicable to its employees based on the Corporation's status as a mixed-ownership Corporation. To avoid confusion, the authorities which are not applicable to the Corporation and its employees would be listed in §3201.109 (b) through (e). Proposed §3201.109(a) would caution examiners that they may not use the gift exceptions in 5 CFR 2635.204 to accept a gift that would violate the criminal prohibitions in 18 U.S.C. 213 against examiners accepting gifts or gratuities from the institutions they examine. III. Removal of FDIC Employees Responsibilities and Conduct Regulations and Related Modifications On the effective date of the final rule, the Employee Responsibilities and Conduct regulation, 12 CFR part 336, will be amended to remove and reserve subparts A, B, C, E, and F, §§336.1&hyph;336.23 and 336.29&hyph;336.37, and remove the appendix to part 336. As proposed, a new §336.1 will be added to provide a cross-reference to the Corporation's supplemental ethical conduct regulation, to be codified at 5 CFR part 3201, the Corporation's supplemental financial disclosure regulation at 5 CFR part 3202, and to the Executive Branch-wide financial disclosure and standards of ethical conduct regulations at 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635. 12 CFR part 336, subpart D, §§336.24 through 336.28, was removed and reserved by action of the Board of Directors of the Corporation dated November 24, 1992, 57 FR 39628.
