The PZU believes that clinging to the nuclear "cudgel" could lead to Ukraine's isolation in the world community, and the possession of nuclear weapons today is not valor, but disgrace. Since PZU members are convinced that the high post of a public figure is incompatible with militaristic mentality, the Greens also demand that Minister of Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko, who was against Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, be dismissed from his post. The PZU statement was also supported by the Ukrainian association "Green World," which is concerned about possible ecological consequences of the careless handling of the technology by the military. Examples of such cases were quoted at the news conference held by the association.
