It was the Belgian side's active support that to no small degree helped on this. At today's news conference, Pavel Grachev stressed the special role played by Belgium and Defense Minister Leo Delcroix in bringing NATO and Russia closer together. The Russian minister said that the timescale for signing the partnership documents now depends not on Russia but on NATO, on how quickly it examines the parameters for partnership proposed by Russia. In an interview for the NTV company, Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix noted that it is simply necessary to take into account the weight and significance of Russia as a great nuclear power. For Russia is not Albania, with all due respect to Albania, he noted. If relations between Russia and the western partners are more predictable, then evidently this cannot be said of the former eastern bloc allies. A question from a Polish journalist to Pavel Grachev on his attitude toward Poland's joining NATO seemed more than just strange, for according to her they are seriously afraid of complications in the internal political situation in Russia. [Begin recording] [Grachev] What can we say when it is heard from the mouth of this Polish girl that they are saying that Poland wants to join NATO in order to ensure its future safety against the processes going on in Russia. What is this, a challenge? But of course we will consider that this is a lack of understanding. At state level our Russian-Polish relations are good, and I hope that they will be strengthened. [Svetlichnyy] During these two days have you had the feeling that some states participating in Partnership for Peace, present like you at the meeting, are playing a game against Russia? I mean the two days of the session's work. [Grachev] You know I do not want to draw any final conclusions. But those states that make up NATO, or are part of NATO, I have reached the unambiguous opinion that these states want to see Russia inside Partnership for Peace. As regards other states who have signed up, you know it is still early, I repeat, to draw any conclusions. There were no open yeses or noes. We will see. [end recording] [Svetlichnyy] Today the Belgian and Russian defense ministers laid wreaths at the eternal flame in the center of Brussels. This may not just have been a formality. The Belgian minister has said that his country is ready to be an intermediary between Russia and NATO. One has the impression that it is frequently much simpler for Russia to talk with W. European NATO member countries than with her former E. European allies.
