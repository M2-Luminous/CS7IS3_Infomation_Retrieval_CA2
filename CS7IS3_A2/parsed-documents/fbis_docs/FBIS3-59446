The agency is a government body that is in charge of restructuring the state-owned companies and certain public corporations. In an interview granted to one of our correspondents, Mr. Mircea Cosea, chairman of Romania's Council for Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform, emphasized that one has to do away with the conception that economic restructuring merely means the closing down of companies and the growth of unemployment, as that process may also have positive effects by reviving certain large companies that are very important for the economy to adapt to the new market economy structures. By a decision of the Prime Minister [Nicolae Vacaroiu], University Professor Dr. Dumitru Dan Popescu was appointed head of the new Agency for Restructuring. Until now, Popescu was holding the office of counselor of the minister of finance. Cosea also mentioned the fact that work has already begun to transform the property vouchers into shares and, thus, establish a stock exchange that will act as a source of capital, as well as moral support for both the respective companies and the shareholders. The first privatization actions to be implemented in the first month of the year will refer to branches that have not been targeted until now, such as social work, scientific research, and local administration, Cosea added.
