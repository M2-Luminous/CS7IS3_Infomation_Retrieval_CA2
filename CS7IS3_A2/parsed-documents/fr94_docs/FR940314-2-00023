Industria e Comercio 88.86 Companhia Brasileira Carbureto de Calcio 15.53 All Others 35.95 In its final determination, the Department found that critical circumstances existed with respect to exports from Brazil by Italmagnesio S.A. Industria e Comercio (Italmagnesio). However, on January 24, 1994, the ITC notified the Department that retroactive assessment of antidumping duties was not necessary to prevent recurrence of material injury from massive imports over a short period. As a result of the ITC's negative critical circumstances determination, pursuant to section 735(b)(4) of the Act, we shall order Customs to terminate the retroactive suspension of liquidation and to release any bond or other security and refund any cash deposit required under section 733(e)(2) with respect to Italmagnesio's FeSi entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption prior to August 16, 1993. This notice constitutes the antidumping duty order with respect to FeSi from Brazil, pursuant to section 736(a) of the Act. Interested parties may contact the Central Records Unit, Room B&hyph;099 of the Main Commerce Building, for copies of an updated list of antidumping duty orders currently in effect. This order is published in accordance with section 736(a) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.21. Dated: March 7, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. Note: Temporary Restraining Order Regarding Ferrosilicon Imports from Companhia Brasileira Carbureto de Calcio (CBCC) On February 23, 1994, the Court of International Trade (CIT) entered a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Customs Service from collecting deposits of the estimated antidumping duty margin for CBCC at a rate higher than that published in the original final determination. Thus, notwithstanding the language of the antidumping duty order (above), the Department will not, until permitted to do so by the CIT, instruct Customs to collect cash deposits equal to the amount of the antidumping duty margin calculated in the Department's amended final determination for imports of ferrosilicon from CBCC. Until we are notified differently by the Court, we are instructing Customs to collect cash deposits on imports of ferrosilicon from CBCC equal to 2.23 percent, the amount of the antidumping duty margin calculated in the Department's final original determination. Dated: March 7, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;5877 Filed 3&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
