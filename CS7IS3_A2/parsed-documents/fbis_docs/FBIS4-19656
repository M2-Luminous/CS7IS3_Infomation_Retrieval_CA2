He said that the situation of the blue helmets is becoming unacceptable. [Begin Barroso recording] None of the countries, or those where public opinion is, shall we say, more shocked by this situation, has so far advocated sending soldiers to the area to fight. One thing is troops to fight, another is blue helmets. The Blue Helmets -- many of them are almost hostages. They are witnessing massacres. Well, I ask myself whether it is very useful to have people witnessing massacres. Therefore, if we do not accept the possibility of massive military intervention, then we have to seek a political solution. [end recording] Durao Barroso was speaking after a meeting with the Slovene foreign minister at Necessidades Palace [Foreign Ministry]. Durao Barroso also said that the success of the elections in South Africa could be a good start for the pacification of southern Africa. [Begin Barroso recording] Contrary to a number of reports that have been made public which say the Portuguese Government's position is that the key to the issue lies in South Africa, I can say this is not true. There is a certain influence, but it would be an illusion to think that the Angolan problem will be resolved exclusively in South Africa, without denying, obviously, the links between the two situations. Of course, if the situation in South Africa evolves positively, with stability, with democracy, this can only be a positive factor for stability in the region, namely in Angola and Mozambique.
