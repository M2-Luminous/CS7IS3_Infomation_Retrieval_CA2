FR940620-2-00113 FR940620-2-00062 2. Scope and Effectiveness of Urban/Rural Opportunities Local Partnerships (25 points). Does the application demonstrate the strong commitment and support of employers (both within and surrounding the targeted area), representatives of local educational agencies and local postsecondary educational institutions (including representatives of area vocational education schools, where applicable), local educators (such as teachers, counselors, or administrators), representatives of labor organizations or nonmanagerial employee representatives, and students and provide for their sustained and specific involvement? Given the scope of the proposed School-to-Work Opportunities initiative, does the local partnership include other members appropriate to effective implementation, particularly community-based organizations and others experienced in dealing with the distinctive needs of youth residing or attending schools in high poverty areas? Are the roles and responsibilities of the members of the local partnership appropriate and likely to produce the desired changes in the way students are prepared for the future? Does the local partnership's plan include an effective and convincing strategy for obtaining the active and continued involvement of employers and other interested parties such as locally elected officials, secondary and postsecondary educational institutions (or related agencies), business associations, industrial extension centers, employees, labor organizations or associations of such organizations, teachers, related services personnel, students, parents, community-based organizations, rehabilitation agencies and organizations, registered apprenticeship agencies, local vocational educational agencies, vocational student organizations, State or regional cooperative education associations, and human service agencies in the implementation of the local program(s)? 3. Student Participation (20 points). Does the plan propose realistic strategies to ensure that ``all students,'' including disadvantaged students; students with diverse racial, ethnic, or cultural backgrounds; American Indians; Alaska Natives; Native Hawaiians; students with disabilities; students with limited English proficiency; migrant children; school dropouts; and academically talented students, have opportunities to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs? Does the strategy recognize barriers to their participation and propose effective ways of overcoming them so that these students are prepared for high-skill, high-wage jobs, including_for young women and minorities_nontraditional employment? Does the plan provide for the direct delivery of services to large numbers of students residing or attending school in the urban or rural high poverty area? Is there an effective strategy for assessing the academic and human service needs of students and dropouts within the high poverty area and making improvements or adjustments as necessary to ensure their successful participation in and completion of School-to-Work Opportunities programs? What, if any, provisions are made for the participation of elementary and middle school youth in school-to-work activities, such as career exploration and awareness? 4. Comprehensiveness (10 points). To what extent has the local partnership considered the current and future occupational needs of the urban or rural labor market area within which the targeted area is located? Does the membership representing employers in the local partnership reflect such current and future occupational needs? How is the strategy for implementing the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative likely to produce systemic change, rather than stand-alone program implementation? What evidence is provided that such systemic change will have substantial impact on the preparation of youth for a first job in a high-skill, high-wage career and postsecondary education and training? Is there existing or planned collaboration among other school districts, employers, labor organizations, and community groups that will lead to an increasingly comprehensive local School-to-Work Opportunities system? Are various forms of human services provided within the community included in the partnership's plan for coordination? Are strategies in place to coordinate various forms of Federal funding available to the urban or rural high poverty area? Does the local partnership's plan exhibit strong potential for maintaining School-to-Work Opportunities programs after Federal funding within this initiative ceases? 5. Collaboration with State (10 points). To the extent practicable, has the local partnership effectively consulted with the State in which it is located and established realistic methods for ensuring consistency of its program(s) with the statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system being developed by the State? Has the local partnership developed a sound strategy for adapting its plans, as necessary, to coincide with the State plan for a School-to-Work Opportunities system? If applicable, has the Urban/Rural Opportunities local partnership established linkages with the local partnership within which it is located and developed means by which to coordinate efforts and to share information regarding such items as work-based learning opportunities, human service providers, and skill standards and certifications? 6. Management plan (10 points). What evidence exists to demonstrate the effectiveness of the local partnership and/or its key members in the delivery of comprehensive vocational programs with successful job placement rates through cooperative activities among local educational agencies, local businesses, labor organizations, and others? Does the entity submitting the application on the part of the local partnership have the capacity to manage the implementation of the local School-to-Work Opportunities initiative? Does the management plan anticipate barriers to implementation and include a system for addressing them as they arise? Does the applicant limit administrative costs in order to maximize the amounts spent on delivery of services to students enrolled in its School-to-Work Opportunities programs? Does the plan include methods for sustaining and expanding the partnership beyond the high poverty area as the program expands in scope and size? Is there an effective strategy for identifying and utilizing other resources, including private sector resources, to maintain and expand School-to-Work Opportunities programs? Does the management plan reflect continuous improvement methodologies by building in specific, outcome-based, evaluative checkpoints and the mechanisms necessary to carry out improvements, redesigns, or mid-course corrections along the way? Are key personnel under the plan qualified to perform the required activities, including maintaining the essential partnership?
