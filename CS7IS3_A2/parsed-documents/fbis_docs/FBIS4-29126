Here is an excerpt of this report: This morning's discussion merely turned round and round on the first topic, that is, the cease-fire, and could not move on to the second topic despite the efforts of the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK]. 1. The cease-fire: The PDK announced this morning in a statement that it had already replied to His Majesty's request for a yes or no answer, that is, it was most delighted to have a cease-fire. After that, this party proposed the setting up of a committee to discuss how the cease-fire should be observed so that it would not be just a simple cease-fire. This party stressed further that a cease-fire date could not be specified without prior discussion on this matter. The Royal Government [RG]'s side, through H.E. Yu Hokkri, proposed 30 June 1994, beginning at noon, as the start of the cease- fire and proposed that there should be just an inter-Cambodian committee without any foreigners to control the cease-fire. 2. The minimal policy program: The RG party avoided discussing this matter, claiming that the king's 12 June message did not require the roundtable to discuss this matter before the first topic in the agenda, that is, the cease-fire. On its part, the PDK proposed that this minimal policy program be discussed as well, claiming that the two topics have [words indistinct] value and that it had already given the answer concerning the first topic through this morning's statement. This party insisted that the cease-fire [words indistinct] national reconciliation. The two sides mutually understood the strong and weak points of each other's strategies and hoped that the roundtable would be able to reach a common point of view beneficial to the Cambodian nation and people. The meeting ended at 1200 in a good atmosphere and will resume on the morning of 16 June.
