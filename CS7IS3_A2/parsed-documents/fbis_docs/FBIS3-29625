Weiss met earlier in the day with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and invited him for official visit to Israel, Japanese officials said. The speaker of the Knesset, or Israeli parliament, arrived in Japan on Monday as leader of the first Knesset delegation officially invited by the Diet, or Japanese parliament. On behalf of Israel, Weiss received an original visa issued by Sugihara during a ceremony at the Israeli Embassy. It was presented by Sugihara's widow, Yukiko, and Sumiko Simkin, widow of Joseph Simkin, a recently deceased Polish Jew who was a beneficiary of Sugihara's past humanitarian action. Embassy officials said the visa will be preserved in the Yad Vashem, a national holocaust memorial in Jerusalem. Simkin, who also participated in rescue operations during the war in Poland and Lithuania, came to Japan on the visa and remained as a businessman until his death last year. As Nazi forces rolled across Poland, Sugihara issued in August 1940 transit visas to Japan for 6,000 Jews without prior authorization from Tokyo. He was ordered to resign from the Foreign Ministry in 1947 and died in July 1986 at age 86. In October 1991, the ministry posthumously rehabilitated him and apologized to his widow. In Israel, Sugihara has been awarded the title of "righteous among the nations" and a small grove in a Jerusalem suburb is named after him. Embassy officials said Weiss, a holocaust survivor, will visit the atomic-bombed city of Hiroshima on Friday to lay a wreath at a memorial.
