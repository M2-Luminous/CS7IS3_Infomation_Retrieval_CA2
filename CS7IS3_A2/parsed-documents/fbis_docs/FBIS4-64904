Or perhaps not? One remembers who should know. Or perhaps not? There is a witness of the time who has recognized historical parallels. Or not? So how was it then--let us take Point 4: "Books of Jews must be removed from bookstores." Or Point 13: "Goebbels denies Jews their human dignity. They are outlaws." Or Point 16: "Jews get out." The man draws the connecting line from "then" to "today" 17 times. Then, Point 18, the congruence: "Civil cowardice"--"Civil cowardice." What is that? A comparison? Even that would be a perversion of history, far beyond the bounds of what can be tolerated. But it has become even more than that: an equation. The dreadful barefoot historian is named Heinrich Hirzel. And his parallels look like this: Point 4: "Books of Republikaner authors are no longer published or are traded only under the counter." Point 13: "Friedmann, member of the central council of the Jews denies Republikaner their human dignity." Point 16: "Republikaner get out." The presumptuous one-to-one of the tale of woe, printed in the April issue of the party newspaper DER REPUBLIKANER, is suitable at best as a piece in the completely open scale of interpretations: were things not nearly so bad in those days or are things again as bad today as they were then? To each his own, to be used deliberately. For Hirzel, in his own words a "marginal figure" of the Nazi resistance movement, "White Rose," and now a Europe candidate of the extreme rightist Republikaner, in any case, the comparability ends only "with the outbreak of World War II." At the end of five columns, such subtleties will not bother the reader of the brown paper, imbued with substantial end-line mentality anyway according to the findings of opinion polls. There is finally someone with chutzpa: a German man, a German paper, a free country. So one will still be allowed to say.... One is allowed..... In the latest report on constitutional protection presented last week by Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther, the actions of the Republikaner are summarized with astonishing forbearance. The compilation sees at best "clues" for extreme rightist aspirations of the party. Not a word about anti-Semitism. At the same time, according to the leaked findings of the North Rhine-Westphalian Office for Constitutional Protection, there are model speeches for the super election year in the drawers of the Republikaner, with which the anti-Semitic potential latent in the German populace is to be activated in the voting booths. But that, according to the analysis of Rainer Erb from the Center for Anti-Semitism Research in Berlin, would indeed be a new quality in the political unculture. "Never in the history of the FRG has an election campaign been waged with anti-Semitism." But the time has never been so favorable. Anti-Semitism in the German populace, says Erb, "has reached a level that will not melt away." And this is despite the fact that those who live in yesterday are dying out. For the Republikaner, it is again worthwhile to stir up the brown sediment. Certainly, according to Erb's observations, the muffled anti-Semitism was "a constant element in the party." Ernst Galinksi and then Bubis--the pattern was always the same: the chairmen of the Central Council of the Jews, according to Schoenhuber's crude logic, are themselves to blame for the anti-Semitism in Germany. For him, he says, the "decisive question" is therefore this: "Is the excessive philo-Semitism not just as dangerous as anti-Semitism?" Schoenhuber's conclusion: "It is very good that that sometimes bursts forth in Germany." It has burst forth. And the man in the pose of persecuted innocence has recently again been working on that with great determination. The latest "popular instigator" attack against Bubis, just days after a synagogue burned in Germany for the first time in half a century, fits the pattern. The Republikaner, dangling on the verge of insignificance in the media, are again "in." There is not a day of television without images of Schoenhuber, even though, as he laments, it is without the original tone. But that is delivered by his admirers via telephone. "Mr. Schoenhuber, you are a hero," is how his Republikaner friends commented on his suit against the chairman of the Central Council of the Jews. And in a "renowned inn" at Tegernsee in the deepest Bavarian territory of the CSU [Christian Social Union], the people greet the renegade "more than ever." Because of his broad success, Schoenhuber keeps on coming with new attacks: a denunciation against the writer Ralph Giordano "for public instigation to commit homicide." One must know the choice of words, the chief of the Republikaner visibly rejoices at Giordano's rhetorical faux pas: "If I, Franz Schoenhuber, were to say that Mr. Giordano must be done away with, then you ought to see what would happen in Germany." Nor is Schoenhuber letting up with respect to Bubis. He uncompromisingly called upon the chairman of the Central Council to apologize. Is a person who has obviously found a concept for success just talking this way to serve the baser instincts of his clientele? "I must understand the ordinary people if I want to make good policy," the relentless populist once said in an interview with the weekly newspaper DIE ZEIT. A little bit of sports palace in a beer tent and a few properly placed provocative words to transform the vague feeling in the stomachs of the horde of extreme rightist supporters into a political program? As hardly anyone else, Schoenhuber commands the polyphonous address." the transfer of racist and anti-Semitic messages to his supporters without having to be explicit," attests Siegfried Jaeger, professor at the Duisburg Institute for Language and Social Research. Or is that also the way the man thinks, who in press interviews is quite able convincingly to mimic the polyglot liberal? Behind closed doors, among his own people, the multicultural facade flakes off. The brown thoughts of the confessing SS-man ("I was there") likewise waft through the room. Gysi? Bolshevik and Jew. Bubis? The Jew. The Germans? It is time for them to raise their heads again. The only thing that "we" can be reproached for, is the fact "that we have lost two world wars," someone said who recently noted Schoenhuber's droning in the back room about us once again being somebody. Doubtless painful defeats for the top Republikaner. He would not like to have any more such feelings during the election evenings of this year. And enough of them are still ahead. That is why he is now talking the way he has always thought. A surfer has found his element. Gregor Gysi, himself the address of anti-Semitic abusive letters, has registered the insidious change of climate in Germany. But he is one of the few who also names it: Schoenhuber. In a topical hour about the synagogue fire in Luebeck, the man from the PDS [Party for Democratic Socialism] says that Schoenhuber expresses his profound anti-Semitism, "because he is convinced that that will yield him more votes." And in view of the times, Peter Glotz, a rhetorically gifted unconventional thinker in the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany], advocates a long-overdue showdown with the "strong man and terrible populist from Upper Bavaria." Glotz has also recognized the reality that considering a 13-percent share of the population with a closed world view one "cannot always sneak away." The sober realization is that Schoenhuber is relevant to the society. The society is no different. Certainly the boss of the Republikaner was one of the first to recognize that. Schoenhuber had the "fascism of the old parties" compiled on two leaflets. There is a lot of stuffy tavern talk there from the past eight years. Ministers, state secretaries, and a Bundestag president are included there. The Christian Democrats predominate in the collection of quotes but the Social Democrats are also present with xenophobic and racist babbling. Rejoice Germany. Franz Schoenhuber sets the leaflet aside and leans back satisfied in his Europe office. "The largest share of them would be subjected to a procedure to exclude them from our party." People buy that from him in these times. Still.
