The restraint will be finally abolished. Now that car exports have decreased due to the yen's appreciation and local production of automobiles overseas has increased, there is no need to continue the self-restraint on car exports to the United States. Meanwhile, the U.S. industry has made a remarkable recovery. This indicates the end of the era in which Japanese industry can enjoy an overwhelming victory in the world market. From now on, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] should make additional efforts to adopt trade policies based on multilateral trade rules. The economic circle also should once again keep this fact in mind that its economic-growth strategy centering on one-sided exports will not last long. The United States has begun calling for Japan's "voluntary expansion of imports" in place of the voluntary restraint on auto exports. It has demanded that Japan increase imports by setting targets as it did so under the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement. In the new Japan-U.S. economic consultations, the country has made such demands in the three individual sectors, including automobile and auto parts. The U.S. demands seem to be desirable as compared with the voluntary export-restraint which artificially curbs exports because the U.S. demands will promote an increase in bilateral trade. However, this can be applied only in the case where Japan purchases cheap, good-quality products and parts. If the two countries try to increase dealings forcibly by going to the length of setting targets in trade talks, there will be distortions in economic activities. While Japan needs to make efforts to increase imports by improving existing regulations and practices which constitute import barriers, as well as by expanding domestic demand, it has to reject unreasonable demands. When viewed from this standpoint, some devices can be noted in the "package of external economic measures" compiled by the government. For example, the government has proposed that procedures be improved in government procurement to facilitate entry of products of foreign companies into the Japanese market and that methods be introduced to follow up on results of the entry of foreign products in three individual sectors. However, the package only says that a conclusion will be made by about June on a program to increase public works spending--which was cited as a means to maintain domestic demand for the midterm--as well as tax system reform. Concrete measures to ease regulations were not spelled out in the current package. Meanwhile, the package of external economic measures was influenced by government's conventional idea of emphasizing administrative instructions. While various automakers voluntarily announced their plans to increase the purchase of foreign auto parts, the government welcomed their plans. Nevertheless, the word "voluntarily" is in name only. It has been reported that MITI and politicians exerted a strong behind-the-scenes influence on automakers. The auto parts purchase plans were worked out by the private sector. However, if automakers fail to achieve their goals after setting numerical targets, the United States may use the failure as an excuse for slapping sanctions on Japan. Moreover, there is a fear that hardliners in the United States, who believe Japan does anything if pressure is exerted, will gain the upper hand after they notice that while the Japanese Government is advocating deregulation in public, it has continued behind-the-scenes administrative intervention in industry. In various aspects, relations between Japan and the United States are in the transitional stage. To establish a truly mature relationship between the two countries, the tense situation will be unavoidable for the time being. Prime Minister Hosokawa made a daring decision and said "No" to the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets in trade talks. The government must take a logical attitude in anticipation of a certain tension in the bilateral relations. What is imperative for the government is to come up with substantial market-opening measures by the end of June. These measures will help consumers receive benefits through such factors as an increase in cheap imported goods. Based on figures in official economic forecasts, the government stipulated in the current package that the ratio of Japan's current account surplus to its gross domestic product has been decreasing since fiscal year 1992 when the ratio reached its peak. However, what is important is not to indicate figures but to root in Japan a system in which fluctuations in the exchange rate connect with an decrease in exports and an increase in imports. Although the current package of external economic measures is not a satisfactory answer to the United States, the ball has been thrown back to the U.S. side. It is hoped that the United States will receive the ball and resume the new economic framework talks. If the United States has any dissatisfaction, it should express it in the venue for the framework talks.
