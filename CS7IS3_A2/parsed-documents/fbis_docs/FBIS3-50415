Unimpex was founded by the Martimex company in 1990. As early as in 1993, Unimpex turnover reached 4.05 billion korunas [Sk]. Exports of T-72 tanks from the ZTS Martin production provided 99 percent of the total turnover. The value of last year's exports is Sk3.3 billion. Warecha said that the territories to which the arms are exported have changed substantially. He emphasized, however, that the license committee has granted licenses for all sales realized. In comparison with 1992, when exports to Russia reached Sk400 million, the volume declined last year to Sk200 million. Slovak exports of military technology face numerous problems on the world market. According to Warecha, Russia, which produces as many as 10,000 tanks annually, is great competition, as their prices hover around $500,000, while the Slovak tanks cost as much as $1 million, and the Slovak engineering facilities can produce only 250-300 tanks. Another handicap for the Slovak arms industry is its gradual antiquation. A total modernization would require tremendous financial means. The debts from the time of the federation still also work against the Slovak enterprises. On the other hand, the quality of the exported goods favors Slovak exports. Customers often prefer Slovak military hardware to Russian or Polish arms. The foundation of a new company with state participation mentioned by Prime Minister Meciar should serve, according to Warecha, the coordination of Slovak exports. Numerous contracts are signed at governmental level, and it will depend on the state how it will fend for the new company, he added.
