Filatov and Akbulatov met in Moscow on Monday. According to sources from Groznyy, arrangemenrs for a meeting between presidents Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev were discussed. The two presidents' meeting has been so far postponed for an indefinite time, the sources said. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on mounting interest in Yuriy Skokov: "Yuriy Skokov, chairman of the Federation of Commodity Producers (FCP), has makrkedly increased his activity of late. His activity and particularly the FCP efforts aimed at softening a sweeping production downturn, it seems, wins support not only among industrialists and trade unions but also among entrepreneurs, who until recently viewed him rather sceptically. Interest in Skokov is also mounting in view of his intention to run for the presidency in 1996". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the unlikelihood of a Crimean-Ukrainian war. "It is unlikely that there will be a war between the Crimea and Ukraine in the coming days. At any rate, this is how it looks like on the 45th day of Yuriy Meshkov's presidency in the Crimea, although Defence Ministry officials in Kiev, in their interviews with Ukrainian news media, increasingly often speak about the need to stabilise the situation in the Crimea and their readiness to restore order there by force. "At a time when people are concerned about their future and living standards disastrously decline, politicians often dream about a war." ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on the spectre of civil war in Russia: "The spectre of civil war has been roaming Russia for several years now. Presistence with which it is evoked is little connected with the real living conditions but is closely linked with the actions of some or other power and social structures. "This time the phantom of civil war has arisen from the State Duma's political amnesty decision. The Duma was also the first to try to neutralise the consequences of its own decision with a memorandum of accord -- well aware, most likely, that peaceable rhetoric will be just rhetoric but that political struggle will gain in keenness, which would be dangerous to the country's tranquility but beneficial to certain social forces. "This is traditional for Russian life: a problem is brought about and then everyone rushes to find a solution". TRUD on businesses' disagreement with Russian state customs committee decision to raise import duties. Directors of 12 major commercial organisations engaging in the import and marketing of food from abroad, have expressed their disagreement with the state customs committee decision to raise import duties. "The reasons for such rejection are understandable: the import of food has long become an indispensable condition for the functioning of the consumer market in large cities". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an exclusive interview with U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry in Moscow. The newspaper quotes Mr Perry as saying that he encountered scepticism among some members of the State Duma about the sincerity of the U.S. desire to maintain equitable cooperation with Russia. In view of that, Mr Perry told Duma members that a businesslike pragmatic partnership must be the two countries' common objective. PRAVDA runs an interview with prominent publicist Boris Oleynik. "Any provocateurs, hired under any contract, can march under various banners -- red, golden-blue or other ones. The banners are not to blame, but those who brandish them bear special responsibility," Oleynik pointed out.
