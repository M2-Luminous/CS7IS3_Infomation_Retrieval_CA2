FR941125-2-00099 FR941125-2-00074 Agreement on Social Security Between the United States and Greece; Entry Into Force The Commissioner of Social Security gives notice that an agreement coordinating the United States (U.S.) and Greek social security systems is effective beginning September 1, 1994. The agreement with Greece, which was signed on June 22, 1993, is similar to U.S. social security agreements already in force with sixteen other countries_Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Agreements of this type are authorized by section 233 of the Social Security Act. Like the other agreements, the U.S.-Greek agreement eliminates dual social security coverage_the situation that occurs when a person from one country works in the other country and is required, along with his employer, to pay social security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Under the U.S.-Greek agreement, a worker who is sent by an employer in the United States to work in Greece for 5 years or less remains covered only by the U.S. system. The agreement includes additional rules that eliminate dual U.S. and Greek coverage in other work situations. The agreement also helps eliminate situations where workers suffer a loss of benefit rights because they have divided their careers between the two countries. Under the agreement, workers may qualify for partial U.S. or Greek benefits based on combined (totalized) work credits from both countries. Individuals who wish to obtain copies of the agreement or want more information about its provisions may write to the Social Security Administration, Office of International Policy, Post Office Box 17741, Baltimore, Maryland 21235. Dated: November 8, 1994. Shirley S. Chater, Commissioner of Social Security. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29054 Filed 11&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4190&hyph;29&hyph;P
