FR940418-0-00009 FR940418-0-00005 On Wednesday, December 22, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing entitled Drawbridge Operation Regulations: Chicago River, IL. (58 FR 67745). The comment period ended February 7, 1994. The Commander, Ninth Coast Guard District, also published the proposed regulation change as a Public Notice on December 17, 1993, with a comment period ending January 22, 1994. The Coast Guard received 132 letters commenting on the proposal. Additionally, the Commander, Ninth Coast Guard District held a public hearing on January 20, 1994, in Chicago, Illinois. There were 107 persons in attendance at the public hearing, of whom 32 made oral statements and/or furnished data on the proposed regulations. Background and Purpose Presently, the bridges owned and operated by the City of Chicago are governed in accordance with 33 CFR 117.391 which allows draws to remain closed through the peak vehicle traffic periods during the morning and afternoon rush hours. In addition, certain bridges need not open for the passage of vessels unless notice is given in advance of a vessel's intended time of passage through the draws. The City of Chicago has requested that, from April 1 through November 30, the bridges which cross the Chicago River and the Chicago River Branches not be required to open for the passage of recreational vessels except between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 12 midnight on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. During these times, the bridges would not be required to open unless there are no fewer than five recreational vessels and not more than twenty-five recreational vessels available to transit during the opening and these vessels have given at least twenty-four hours advance notice of their requested time of passage through the draws. From December 1 through March 31, the draws of the highway bridges across the Chicago River, the North Branch of the Chicago River, North Branch Canal, and the South Branch of the Chicago River shall open on signal for all vessels if notice is given at least 12 hours in advance of a vessel's time of intended passage through the draws. On December 22, 1993, the Coast Guard issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to change the permanent operating schedules for the Chicago River bridges. This NPRM contained no weekday daytime openings, but did provide a 12-hour opening period on Saturdays and Sundays, as well as a 6:30 p.m. to midnight opening period on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Discussion of Comments and Changes From the 132 comments received from the Public Notice, 35 commenters were in support of limiting the openings of the Chicago bridges for recreational vessels, and 97 were opposed to limiting the openings of bridges for recreational vessels. The comments in support of the proposal were from managers of businesses, building managers and officials from various Departments of the City of Chicago. Reasons for support of the proposed regulations change submitted were: A proposal to build a Chicago Central Area Circulator, a light rail system, that will be used to transport people within the Chicago Loop; disruption of vehicle and pedestrian traffic when bridges open for the passage of vessels during the day; the movement of emergency vehicles (fire, ambulance, police) that could allow response time when a bridge is open for the passage of vessels; the cost of manpower to open the bridges; additional air pollution caused while vehicles are stopped during bridge openings; and the disruption of deliveries made to and from various business interests within the loop during business hours. The comments opposing the proposed bridge operating regulations were concerned with unsafe conditions because the two weekday openings begin when there are but a few hours of daylight left. Boaters do not reach Lake Michigan and do not reach their respective marinas along the Lake Michigan Coast until late at night or early morning hours when there is total darkness. In addition, these comments are concerned with unsafe conditions associated with the mass of vessels that are required to gather in order to have the bridge open. The large number of vessels during periods of darkness has caused some minor accidents among boaters on previous trips and they feel, should a serious accident occur, or someone fall overboard, the night trips would cause a loss of life because it is more difficult to locate a person in the water and conduct rescue operations when it is dark. Other comments received in opposition of the proposed regulations showed concerns with the inability of bridgetenders to see when all vessels have cleared the bridge, the loss of accessibility to the boatyards for normal and emergency vessel repairs, floating debris, unsafe seawalls and submerged pilings in the water that are not visible during periods of darkness, the additional cost, and the availability of professional help when a vessel needs towing or is in need of emergency repairs during late evening or early morning hours.
