Kim Yong-tae, chief of the central bank's Monetary Department, said yesterday [7 January] that the foreign capital influx will hit a record high this year. Kim said that foreign capital totalling 8-9 trillion won (10-12 billion dollars) will flow into Korea this year. The BOK said that it plans to supply about 15.5-18.8 trillion won in liquidity during 1994. Accordingly, the foreign money inflow will account for about 50 percent of the total money supply growth this year. It means half of this year's additional money supply will be set depending on the foreign capital inflow. The total money supply growth which peaked at 21.4 percent in last October has shown signs of declining since November and reached 17.4 percent in December on an outstanding monthly average basis. M2 increased by 1.78 trillion won in December from the previous month to 110.76 trillion won on an outstanding average basis. M2 includes currency in circulation and demand, time and savings deposits. The central bank is poised to tighten its reign on money growth in order to reduce inflationary pressure which has been building up since the beginning of the year led by rises in public services prices. The most important challenge facing the central bank is how to hold down consumer prices, Kim said. In that context, the rising foreign money inflow is emerging as a big burden to the central bank's fight against inflation because it will result in fanning prices. In order to offset the rise in money supply in the foreign sector, the BOK will have to tighten its control on money growth on the domestic side. As the central bank released huge amounts of money last year in the name of cushioning impacts following the implementation of the real-name financial transaction system, the overflow of funds has become a key factor for the current downward trend in money growth. The central bank did not fail to point out positive impacts of foreign capital. The BOK said that although total money supply growth will continue to decline, the liquidity conditions for enterprises will be in good shape because the capital inflow will boost the stock market and give companies more chances to increase their reliance on direct financing like issuing bonds and stocks. For January, the central bank said it set its monetary growth target at 17-17.9 percent, compared with 17.5 percent growth a year ago. It will release about 2.5-3.3 trillion won during this month. In the meantime, money market rates, as measured by three-year corporate bond yields, remain stable at about 12 percent at present, compared with 13.35 percent in December 1992. Reflecting the good liquidity conditions in the market, inter-bank short-term call rates also are hovering at the 12 percent range, lower than the 14 percent a year ago. Market analysts agree that interest rates in the money market will not rise at least till the beginning of the second quarter when firms's fund demands are likely to rise because they are expected to activate investments from April.
