"I believe this is even necessary", he said at a meeting on Wednesday with representatives of the business community and mass media of the Japanese district of Hokuriku. At the same time, Filatov noted that careless moves may result in launching election campaign "ahead of schedule." According to the chief of staff, the number of candidates for president, of which there are now over a dozen, will probably shrink by the time of elections. Much will depend on the election law and electoral thresholds. When asked about the possiblity of postponing presidential polls, Filatov said this was "very unlikely." "Whether we will begin overcoming the crisis this year or drag on for some more time depends on the social and political situation," the chief of the presidential staff stressed. He noted that the passage of the new constitution and creation of the supreme legislature made it possible to develop a calm social and political situation in the country. Giving his assessment of Russia's current economic situation, Filatov reiterated the government's commitment to the course of reforms. "They are going ahead with the same line, but the situation calls for manoeuvres," he said. The official expressed hope that constructive opposition forces would join the treaty on civil accord. He reported that the agrarian faction in parliament was ready to sign the treaty, but only after the federal budget was approved and certain concessions were made. According to his information, Russian Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov also agreed to sign the document, but did not met understanding in this issue from his fellow party members, who decided at their conference not to join the treaty. Filatov said various aspects and directions of this treaty would be discussed and further elaborated by a conciliation commission and round-tables, at which representatives of different parties and movements will be able to consider ways for further advance. I believe, the chief of staff pointed out, that "opposition forces should sit down at this negotiating table and to take part in this process, otherwise they will simply disarm themselves before the public." Filatov assessed positively the recent reshuffles within the Russian cabinet, noting that it was for the first time that a regional representative, Nikolay Travkin, was included into the government. According to Filatov, the problems currently facing Russia are related to its consolidation as a democratic law-governed federative state. "We are only on our way to all these goals," he said, noting that a well-functioning law-governed state should have not less than 5,000 legislative acts, while their number in Russia does not exceed one thousand.
