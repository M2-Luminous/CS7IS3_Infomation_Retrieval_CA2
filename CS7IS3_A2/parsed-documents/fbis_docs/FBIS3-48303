"Looking at the relationship between President (Boris) Yeltsin and the Russian Parliament, we cannot expect rapid progress on the northern territories issue," said Issei Nomura, director general of the ministry's European and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, in a speech at a Sapporo Hotel. Nomura was apparently referring to Yeltsin's troubles with anti-reform ultranationalists who won big in last month's parliamentary elections. The Ultranationalists strongly oppose Japan's demand that Russia transfer to its sovereignty the four islands, which were seized by Soviet Forces at the end of World War II. Japan calls the Islands -- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai group -- its northern territories, while Russia refers to them as the South Kurils. Nomura said that in the absence of an atmosphere conducive to major progress, Japan and Russia should work to improve their relations on the basis of the Tokyo declaration signed during Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October. He said the two countries should also further promote exchanges of visits between Russian residents of the disputed islands and Japanese from Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island. The exchanges, which have taken place over the past two years, are aimed at increasing mutual understanding between the two sides and conditioning Russian residents in advance of a future territorial settlement.
