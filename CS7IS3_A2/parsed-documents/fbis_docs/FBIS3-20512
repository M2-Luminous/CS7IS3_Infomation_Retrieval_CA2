But in September 1992, the heavy curtain was pulled back slightly to expose it. A Product of the Cold War The NRO was established secretly on 25 August 1960 by the U.S. National Security Council. Mainly, it was a merger of several space-related departments from the U.S. Air Force (USAF), Department of Defense (DoD), and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Despite its public title, the NRO's means of gathering intelligence and its capabilities were strictly held secrets. It is now known that in addition to national photo reconnaissance satellites, NRO employs telecommunications intelligence satellites, special purpose reconnaissance satellites for observing and controlling foreign radar, meteorological satellites for monitoring the climate at target sites, and telecommunications relay satellites to transmit information from space to the earth. The NRO uses virtually no aircraft. NRO's chief mission is to furnish accurate target data to the USAF's strategic nuclear force, assisting U.S. strategic bombers and guided missiles in carrying out accurate attacks. At the same time, it also gathers the topographical data which aids missiles' on-board computers perform the complex programming which controls the missiles' flight. NRO is a principal component of U.S. intelligence agencies, under the dual direction of DoD and CIA. Its staff is drawn from DoD, chiefly the Air Force, and with one high-ranking civilian official of the USAF in charge. The former director was Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Space) Martin Faga. Extraordinary Talents The success of NRO's advanced reconnaissance satellites has been a source of pride for their manufacturer and users alike. In 1961, NRO satellites discovered the precise number of strategic nuclear missiles of the former Soviet Union. Reconnaissance results showed that the number of intercontinental missiles in the former Soviet Union were much fewer than Washington had estimated. Satellites took pictures of the shipping boxes of the first SSX-18 intercontinental missiles of the former Soviet Union. This new discovery influenced the superpowers' weapons negotiations for many years. They also exposed the secret of the former Soviet Union's Y-Class nuclear submarine: A considerable number of them were huge, expandable, rubber boats which could be deployed as decoys. An NRO reconnaissance satellite soaring in the skies disclosed that the former Soviet Union was constructing a massive underground concealed command network for use by its leadership in case nuclear war broke out; that Korea was building a shrewdly camouflaged nuclear weapon facility near Yongbyon. In 1988, a satellite discovered a CSS-2 intermediate-range ballistic missile deployment in the Saudi desert. In this way, Western countries began to suspect that China had started to export weapons of this sort. However, NRO analysts have sometimes been fooled, perhaps due to the organization's blind faith in the very clear satellite photographs. When the U.S. found that Libya had a chemical weapons plant near Rabta, the Libyans played a trick--setting a fire in the plant area, then coating the plant building with dye to make it look charred. In this instance, the Americans believed only in what they saw, decided that the plant had burned down, and so were taken in. At the end of 1992, when President Bush decided to dispatch troops to Somalia, the first question he asked NRO was: "How long is the runway at the Mogadishu Airport where American aircraft will land?" This was a key point which the U.S. military had to know in order for American troops to carry out "Operation Restore Hope." No one doubted that NRO could answer this question with no problem. From the beginning of the seventies to the beginning of the eighties, Secretary of the Air Force and NRO Director Hans Mark believed that NRO played an "extremely important role" in world peace during the Cold War. He says, "NRO made it possible for the U.S. and the Soviet Union to reach agreement on weapons control, because NRO could keep watch on them." He also stated that "NRO plays a major role in providing timely, important information for policy makers." Some people estimate that NRO collects 90 percent of U.S. intelligence data. NRO's "Birds" It was a long-held, popular belief that NRO's satellite photographs, taken from 240 km out in space, could differentiate among the license plate numbers on cars passing through Moscow's Red Square. When Faga was asked whether they could determine an individual's sex from the photos, he just smiled. He never answers questions of this sort. There is no doubt that NRO has supplied a vast quantity of detailed pictures from outer space, including Russia's mobile intercontinental missiles, the mobility status of Iraq's "Fleetfoot" missile, and the actions of international terrorists in Libyan training camps. In these instances, timely intelligence supplied to the U.S. President for grasping the situation in military or diplomatic confrontations is an invaluable asset. Dennis DeConcini, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, regards the satellite reconnaissance system as the most complicated of the various reconnaissance systems now in operation. He believes that the billions of dollars spent on the satellite system were worth it for the most part. Former Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge secretly held the concurrent post of NRO head during the Reagan administration. He points out that during the entire Cold War period, the maintenance of world stability could be attributed to the success of NRO. Its contribution of pictures which kept the U.S. in a favorable weapons control position will never be forgotten. A satellite requires five to eight years from design to launch. For more than 30 years, satellites have continued to take on new telecommunications technology, computers, and optics. In addition, the microminiaturization of components has greatly downsized the satellites while considerably improving their functions and the speed at which they can process data, so their missions can be assigned or re-assigned rapidly. NRO satellites operate on an elliptical track, making one orbit around the earth every 24 hours. It on-board photo facilities can conduct target reconnaissance and monitoring. They can take close-up pictures of certain special areas, and take pictures of wide regions of the globe; researchers can then look for interesting content in the pictures. Today, NRO's "birds" are still staring at the strategic nuclear missile bases in the various countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. In the 1990s, in addition to such traditional assignments as checking on the status of implementing the agreement to reduce military facilities, the NRO will assume some new ones. One of these is monitoring the environment. Such natural disaster data as forest fires, volcanic eruptions, floods, earthquakes, etc. will be monitored by satellites of NRO or other information organs and the data then sent to a group of specialists doing environmental research. This group consists of more than 50 specialists drawn from government and localities. In 1991, the U.S. also set up an environmental operations contingent under the direction of the CIA. The demand for political intelligence increases daily. Examples of this are: taking pictures of the Bo Hei [3134 7815] POW camp, closely watching the spread of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and ballistic missiles throughout the world and monitoring the countless regional conflicts which might threaten U.S. interests. NRO has received new orders to assist the U.S. military in rapidly dispatching troops outside the U.S.'s borders. In the future, more and more U.S. troops will be stationed at home, so when a crisis situation occurs, intelligence concerning remote places must be collected in the shortest time possible. At such times, there is no better way than using satellites. NRO does not itself assign missions directly to its satellites; this task is undertaken by a special committee under the Director of Central Intelligence--the Photo Needs and Use Committee. NRO's daily assignments come from this committee. The NRO Staff NRO is responsible for information satellites and a complex network of ground facilities. At present, the three U.S. military branches employ a total of 38 military satellite control stations throughout the world. The USAF operates 15 stations, most of them used to assist NRO staff. How many people work for NRO? It is still a secret today. Its staff includes civilian technical personnel and engineers who have undergone intensive training, but it also gets a great deal of help from the USAF, and its facilities are all hidden in the USAF. NRO operators send controlling data to the satellites by computers, making each satellite travel its required path, as well as controlling the satellites' entry into space to take pictures. Unlike the National Security Agency, the huge U.S. communications intelligence organization, the NRO does not itself perform intelligence analysis of the data it gathers, but it has consumers which do. Examples of these are the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the State Department, U.S. military intelligence organs, etc. NRO personnel are very enthusiastic about their work. They operate complicated machines with thousands of components and parts; even a slight mistake can have serious consequences as a satellite could go off track. The Pentagon's budget has been slashed continuously over the past eight years, and estimates are that NRO's budget has been cut to 5 to 6 billion dollars. In the next several years, it is estimated that the number of reconnaissance satellites will be reduced by 25 percent, although more advanced and longer-lived new satellites will to a certain degree compensate for some of the reductions. But the budget reduction means that consumers may not able to get the intelligence they want on time.
