In a statement made today, al-Sharif said: No Egyptian ship has been stopped either in the Red Sea or in the Mediterranean Sea. He stressed that this report is entirely baseless and contradicts Egypt's firm and principled stand on the Yemeni problem. He said that Egypt believes the need to immediately stop the fighting and to move to the dialogue table. He added that Egypt also believes that it is not right to side with one party against the other in this problem.
