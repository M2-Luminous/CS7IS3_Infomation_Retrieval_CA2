Even though adjustments in inventories appear finally complete, we cannot ascertain the period of recovery at present. Although in response domestically to the high yen, business continues to shift production overseas, the issue is one of creating new production and a demand for replacement. Although fiscal and financial policies have not changed, they have a truly limited effect, given asset deflation. The primary criterion for a business recovery is to reverse the mindset of business and households. Higher Than Anticipated Asset Deflation [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Low growth in the last fiscal year that has continued into this one is certainly evident. What is the biggest factor putting in jeopardy the business recovery originally forecast for the latter half of the year? [Kaku] Although the possibility of a latter-half recovery is not entirely out of the question, there is considerable risk that it will be forestalled. I can point to two reasons. The first is an unforeseen factor which this spring added pressure to the slump and continued into summer. These were the external factors of a cold summer and long rains as well as a stricter policy vis-a-vis China, but even more than this has been the enormous impact of the high yen. However, this is not all. There is also the possibility that the impact of asset deflation has exceeded expectations; in other words, we have miscalculated the location of the recovery launch pad. A symbolic example is domestic sales of passenger cars which rose from January through March but which then fell. Of course, we knew when the January through March numbers became clear that they were artificial and had been brought on by unusual sales efforts by dealers and that the April through June figures would be different. The issue then is the degree to which the reaction to the downturn exceeded expectations, ran counter to then current perceptions, and made clear later that passenger car sales were no longer "carved in stone." [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] With capital investment and individual consumption in the doldrums, to what extent do you see inventory adjustments continuing? [Kaku] Although inventory adjustments have been sweeping, each progressed in its own way. Inventory adjustments in unit housing occurred the quickest, being completed by the end of the year before last. Although sales of condominium apartments have been the slowest, inventory adjustments in this category appear to have been completed about the beginning of this year. On the other hand, the most prolonged adjustment seems to involve office buildings. Because there will still be building starts, recovery prospects are not established, given that demand continues to be soft. Within this category is the inventory of durable goods and business equipment. I have the impression that these adjustments have all progressed satisfactorily. But, I don't know the clear turning point at which inventory adjustments will have progressed far enough. Judging by past patterns, I would not find it strange to learn we had already reached that turning point, but I couldn't specify when. [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] It seems appropriate to believe that there are factors external to the business environment which are lengthening the business slump. [Kaku] This is inconceivable in attacking the high yen. Still, the high yen should not be thought of as a sudden disaster. Rather, the Japanese economy should be thought of as surfacing an issue which it had kept contained until now. The Japanese economy shouldered the issue of converting to growth in the form of sustained leadership in domestic demand at the time of the high yen slump following the Plaza Accord in 1985. But, because the illusion was that there was expansion in domestic demand which perpetuated the bubble economy following that, the resolution of the issue was lost sight of. This issue is now once again being pointed to. Moreover, unfortunately, the economy is having to bear the heavy burden of cleaning up of asset deflation. Therefore, we must once again respond to this issue but this time with a greater handicap than that experienced following the 1985 Plaza Accord. [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] What is the reason for the large size of the high yen impact this time? [Kaku] The timing of its occurrence is utterly different from the last time (about 1985). Although there were dark clouds on the horizon last time, this time the high yen arrived following a business recession that had lasted over two years. The strikingly lower earnings ratio compared to other industries of electronics and automobiles, the two strongest export industries, is the direct result of the high yen. Additionally, in some industries the superior competitive strength of Japanese products in terms of quality, not to mention price, continues to be driven downward. For example, this becomes strikingly apparent for Japanese cars destined for the U.S. market when compared to U.S. cars. It is not as simple as blaming high prices as in the prior high yen period. That course is a dead end. Still, overemphasizing the view that we have fallen victim to the high yen which is undermining the Japanese economy and that the high yen exceeds the true strength of the Japanese economy is incorrect. Such thinking is somehow full of contradictions. Supposing such a high yen, not only would exports almost totally disappear but foreign exchange would revert to a cheap yen in accordance with market principles. It is impossible for the high yen to continue endlessly. Eventually, a yen which has gone too high will commonly be corrected based on market cognizance. But, if we look at the market over time and the type of response we expect to be there, such judgments are not always accurate. Because from time to time there are such opinions regarding the market, the fear is that the market will temporarily go too far. Therefore, there is nothing to say that the current level is absolutely rational. The True Nature of the High Yen [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Business in reality is taking great pains in response to the high yen. [Kaku] The response of business is not particularly a changed methodology, but merely an aggregation of basic efforts to switch to internal demand, stop exports, or shift to new and rationalized products. The true issue with the high yen is that "Japanese wages have risen in terms of the U.S. dollar." The plusses and minuses of the high yen definitely stem from this. An advantage of the high yen is that purchasing power overseas increases because the value of the Japanese labor force is highly rated. If domestic margins were restored, imported goods could be bought cheaply, exclusive of overseas travel. On the other hand, one disadvantage is that when we think of the labor force as a cost, the cost of Japanese products goes up. It makes sense that business not make use of things that are high priced. Basic policy is exhaustive on this point. Consequently, although business is moving the production base overseas or is importing parts, which is same as importing a labor force, the issue is whether or not this is inviting a withering of the domestic economy. [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Is there fear of a "hollowing out of production?" [Kaku] I suspect there is such fear. Nonetheless, although we hear such ugly phrases as the "hollowing out of production," this is advancing the horizontal division of labor, to put it another way. This is the natural outcome of the high yen, or to put it another way, we have the high yen because Japan has not developed a full response to this matter. The issue is whether to shift production overseas on a scale and with the speed to meet changing demands or to change industries to compensate for this domestically. It is reckless to try to restrain the evolution of "hollowing out" or the horizontal division of labor, which is altogether a different discussion. [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] What do you think about the relationship between the high yen and domestic employment? [Kaku] With unemployment rapidly increasing, this in reality is not now the issue. The growth rate in the number of employed is dropping but it is still growing. The issue is the fear that employment will emerge as a major topic in the near future. Although in the long-term employment judgments made by business depend on how they forecast demand, that forecast itself is influenced just the same if stagnation in real demand drags out. In this sense, while the employment issue is axiomatic, trends in business conditions are the drivers. In addition to our basic approach, we now must think anew the process that translates changes in the production structure and the issue of what to do about the Japanese employment system, which signifies lifetime employment. This has actually changed a bit. For example, the percentage of part-time employment has steadily increased. Because such changes in the employment situation will have to move forward anew from this point on, it may be reckless to consider at what pace and in what form. There Is No Clear Answer [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Despite the lowest interest rates in history, demand is not growing. What do you think about the effectiveness of our financial policy? [Kaku] To make the impact of deregulation clear, one needs to make comparisons with a "period when the discount was not lowered." Doing this is appropriate and gets us thoroughly comfortable with business earnings. Furthermore, although the lowering of interest rates is not a direct objective, the result should be a boost in stock prices. Although when actual investment activity is not clearly evident, we conclude that "financial policy is ineffective," but then looking at it in retrospect we find it was too effective. It is all the more deeply colored this way because the factor of asset deflation is involved this time. If we get away from the general effects of financial policy and confine ourselves to the impact of the official discount rate, we find significant changes. Although we formerly had interest rates that were changed in accordance with the system or customary practice when the regulated official discount rate moved, now such interest rates are almost gone. In the final analysis, unlike the official discount rate before, the idea of a "regulated interest axis" has been almost totally lost, indicating a major policy judgment. In the final analysis, the effect of the announcement in the broad sense has been steadily purified. In this sense, even though the position of the official discount rate will change as deregulation of interest rates progresses, this is not to say that the position of financial policy or its effectiveness has changed. [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] More than 20 trillion yen in public debt has been issued since last year. However, this still is not linked to private consumption. How about the effectiveness of public debt? [Kaku] The extent of the "effectiveness of government fiscal policy" is calculated according to the size of the multiplier. What determines this are the expenditure trends of business and households. In the final analysis, the issue is whether the economy itself which receives money expended through fiscal policy immediately reuses it. Now, because the overall outlook is bad, expenditure trends have dropped. For example, if you do construction, you will receive payment for it. However, if general construction does not buy new construction equipment with the construction fees it has received, or, if the laborers hired to do the construction work do not spend the wages they receive, the effectiveness of expanded government financing to boost business will be less effective. [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] How can the disposition to spend be encouraged? [Kaku] There is no clear answer. The disposition to spend is decided by the psychology of the economic entity. There is no good scheme for changing that psychology. [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Are not deregulation and restoration of a high yen margin effective? [Kaku] Deregulation will have an impact if we do it earnestly. On the other hand, restoration of the high yen margin is a weird phrase. The advantage of the high yen is that the yen base by which payment is made is lowered when importing and this occurs instantly. The problem is what this reverts to. Margin restoration is chiefly talk of changing that distribution. As soon as there is a way to change the distribution, the receiving economic entity may use this money. However, it makes no sense if it is not used. Therefore, if we do restore margins, we cannot say in general it will boost the economy. Conditions for a Favorable Turn of Mind [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Tax reform which would combine a decrease in the income tax with an increase in the consumption tax has surfaced. How do you see the impact of this on the business recovery? [Kaku] It is very, very difficult. If a decrease in the income tax and an increase in the consumption tax had no impact on revenue, that is, if they were in revenue-neutral form, and they were enacted at the same time, I think that, whatever you say, they would have a negative impact on business conditions. Although decreasing the income tax would increase income, it is best to use that money or to save it. A reduction in the income tax itself ought to be neutral regarding consumption tendencies. I think that if income taxes were definitely reduced there would be more spending because take-home pay would increase. But there would be no incentive to raise or lower the portion of the take-home pay used for consumption. For example, say one's income is 100 yen and the income tax rate is 20, then his net income is 80 yen. If he sets his consumption rate in this case at 50 percent, then he would save 40 yen and spend 40. Now, were we to reduce the income tax rate to 10 percent, the net take home pay would be 90 yen. However, with a fixed consumption rate, only 45 yen would then be used for consumption. With the first 40 yen in consumption becoming 45, the increase in consumption would increase only because net pay increased. There would be no change in consumption tendency. However, because the consumption tax depends on consumption, but clearly works as a restraint on consumption, in the final analysis, we must conclude that it works against consumption. Were we to enact a decrease in the income tax and an increase in the consumption tax in revenue-neutral form, I believe it would have a deflationary impact. If we want this to have a positive impact on business conditions, we must put a bridge between tax decreases and increases. However, should a gap open up between the two, it would be natural for a deficit to develop between the two and therefore have a major impact on the fiscal balance. Therefore, there are definite tradeoffs in the case of tax increases versus decreases between fiscal balance and their impact on improving business conditions. This is a major issue. Even having said this, I know of no other way to do it. Meanwhile, at some point we must tackle tax reform that will have a directly proportional correction unrelated to business conditions. Nonetheless, it is only natural that a perception emerge linking these two things. [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] The Japanese economy once experienced a high rate of economic growth, even reaching 10 percent. Following that, having survived the oil shock, we entered a period of stable growth at 4-5 percent. Do you not sense that we have now entered a third stage, which is a low rate of growth? [Kaku] I don't know. Everyone agrees that a 5-percent average growth rate for the four-year period we are calling the "Heisei economy" is extraordinarily high. The growth rate for the period following the oil shock and preceding the "Heisei economy" did not achieve 5 percent. Although one can make various calculations regarding the growth rate, I don't think they reflect the true earnings. I think a larger issue is the fact that various business people are not increasing their demand. If everyone thinks this way, the result will be a lower growth rate. The major issue is how one should go about changing this thinking. It makes almost no sense to argue that the growth rate is such and such based on some abstract model.
