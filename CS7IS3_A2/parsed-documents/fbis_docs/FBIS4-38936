This procedure is defined by the Lithuanian Constitution. Under it, the parliament is to confirm the government's powers if more than a half of its composition has been reshuffled. Otherwise, the government must resign. This situation emerged following the need to introduce three new ministers whose offices would be set up in accordance with a law on government passed by the Seimas. If Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas asks Slezevicius to form a new government again, the present composition will remain as it is and only the three new ministers will be added. Slezevicius is the chairman of the majority Democratic Labor Party in the parliament. This government which has been in power for less than 1.5 years is the sixth since Lithuania regained independence in March 1990. Over this period, Lithuania has achieved a number of positive changes such as stabilizing the economy, lower inflation and higher standard of living.
