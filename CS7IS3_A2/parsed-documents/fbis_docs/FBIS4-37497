FBIS4-37497 "drnes120_l_94004" FBIS-NES-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Foreign Ministry's Savir on Husayn, Syria, al-Tibi Foreign Ministry's Savir on Husayn, Syria, al-Tibi TA2206071394 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 0500 GMT 22 Jun 94 TA2206071394 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Telephone interview with Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir by Mikha Friedman and Ya'el Dan, on 22 June; place not given -- recorded] [Text] [Friedman] In view of our close acquaintance with King Husayn, and the general view that for every step forward he makes, he immediately makes two steps back, would you suggest that Yitzhaq Rabin have a new suit made up for a meeting with Husayn in October? [Savir] This government and its prime minister had their peace suits made up a long time ago. I disagree with you and think that what we see in almost all the tracks is two steps forward and one step back. There are those who are too influenced by the steps back. I think there has been a development in the Jordanian position, and it should be welcomed. [Friedman] Nevertheless, Israeli journalists were not allowed into the monarch's Washington news conference yesterday. That is not something indicating an imminent breakthrough in relations between the two states. [Savir] That is precisely the step backward. I watched the news conference where the king referred to anticipated meetings at a high level and Jordan's independence. I think that despite all the caution, we should see it as a positive development. What is interesting is that each time we see progress in a certain track -- this time it was again in the Palestinian track, that is implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement -- we later see progress in the other tracks. If previously in the peace process the lowest common denominator pulled everything down, now the highest common denominator pulls everybody forward. The train has left the station, and King Husayn does not want to miss it. [Dan] Do you not see any impact from the Jordanian track on the negotiations with Syria? Do you believe the Syrian president is really being indulgent? [Savir] I would not count on it. I think Husayn looks in the Palestinian direction and observes the fact that an economic agreement has been signed. The moves should be seen against the background of the economies in the region. I think that due to the Israeli-Palestinian economic accord, there is a Jordanian desire to join the various agreements, in order to make sure it is not being left out. The monarch apparently feels that al-Asad is progressing and is not necessarily asking for his opinion. 'Arafat also acted that way. If the king waits for others all the time, he will come out the loser on all sides. [Friedman] We discussed Syria, and yesterday we read that Israel's Foreign Ministry has finally been brought into the negotiations with Syria after being exclusively the hands of the prime minister for months. [Savir] That is incorrect because the foreign minister and his ministry were full partners to that issue as well, and I do not think there has been a change because there was no need for one. [Dan] Please help us to understand the Ahmad al-Tibi issue. Why does it crop up now? [Savir] I think it is coincidental. It cropped up a long time ago. At the outset when the PLO issue was new, we might have been mixed up, but the moment the contacts with the PLO became established, it was clear that Israel cannot conduct political negotiations via Israeli citizens as receivers of messages from the Arab side. Nobody has anything personal against al-Tibi. [Dan] But he has been a partner to the contacts for a long time, therefore he says the whole thing is the outcome of a power struggle between the Prime Minister's Office and the Foreign Ministry. [Savir] I regret to disappoint al-Tibi, but the Prime Minister's Office and the Foreign Ministry worked together throughout the Oslo talks, not with al-Tibi but with the PLO. It is true that later on he transferred a number of messages, and I can to a some extent understand his frustration, but I do not understand why as an Israeli citizen he takes it so much to heart. An Israeli citizen, whether Jew or Arab, cannot be an adviser to Yasir 'Arafat, but nobody plans to boycott him. Political contacts with the PLO are conducted with PLO officials. [Friedman] Nevertheless, Yo'el Singer's legal opinion was issued on 17 October, 1993 -- eight months ago -- and last month Shim'on Peres met with al-Tibi twice in his office and at his home. [Dan] The timing is strange. [Savir] I do not know what happened last month. It is true al-Tibi came with certain messages, and I think that due to the novelty of that track it is possible that it should not have happened in the past and that is no reason why it should happen in the future. I think that at present we have a clear partner on the Palestinian issue and it is also clear to us who is a PLO official and who is an Israeli.
