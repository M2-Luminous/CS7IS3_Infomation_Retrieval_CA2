As you know, the UN resolutions still stand. How will this problem be resolved? [Al-Sahhaf] As you know, the under secretaries of the Turkish and Iraqi Foreign Ministries met in Ankara upon the invitation of the Turkish side. The oil pipeline issue was particularly discussed during the Ankara talks. The crude oil in the pipeline must be emptied out and the pipeline must be refilled to prevent rotting and to maintain it. We have been suggesting this to the Turkish side for a long time. We should not wait any longer. Turkey suffered great economic loss because the pipeline was closed down. The international economic embargo imposed on Iraq greatly affected Turkey as well. Turkey suffered great damages. Turkey can extract certain resolutions from the United Nations to compensate for its losses.
