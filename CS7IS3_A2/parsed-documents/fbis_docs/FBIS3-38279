Asked if the IRA suported a cease-fire, Mr Adams said: "I don't speak for the IRA, I speak for Sinn Fein." But he added "the largest military presence in the north of Ireland is the British Army, followed by the allies of the Loyalists and then the IRA. I want to see them all disarmed." Asked if the British should leave Northern Ireland, Mr Adams said that was not necessary if they became part of the peace process. "They have to become the persuaders. Once they become part of the peace process then we will be able to build a peaceful country." Asked what he thought John Major was thinking, Mr Adams joked: "Probably how long he will stay in office." He added that he hoped that Major was willing to take the necessary steps to bring peace to Ireland. "If John Major is willing to go the extra mile, I am too. Let's bridge the gap," he said.
