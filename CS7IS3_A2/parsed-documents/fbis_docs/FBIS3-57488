A speedy reorganization of the Russian industry and further development of the privatization process are the most important tasks at the moment. This is a question of vital importance. There will be no investments without privatization, and without privatization it will be impossible to transform the Russian industry, make it more competitive and give it an opportunity to win new markets, the foreign secretary emphasised. Difficulties, which the Russian economy is facing, are not caused by reforms, they are a result of the policy pursued in the past years, he said. Assessing the situation in Russia, Douglas Hogg said that he would be concerned if the pace of reforms in Russia slows down, if signs of "weakening of the political will" to conduct reforms appear which will endanger this whole process. Speaking about the specific aid which the West could provide to Russia, Hogg emphasised that first of all it is necessary to open western markets to Russian exports. This is not an easy task, he noted, taking into consideration that a large part of the products, which Russian enterprises make for export, is already available in plenty on the western market. But trade and opening of markets are important conditions for the economic development of Russia, he said. Speaking of activities of the "know-how" fund which was set up by the British Government to provide technical assistance in the sphere of economic reforms to East European countries, including Russia, Great Britain was the first country to begin providing such aid, Hogg emphasised. We concentrated our activities in such key spheres as finance system, employment, support of small business, production and distribution of food products, power generation and a number of other spheres, he said. The secretary of state for foreign affairs said that the total financial resources of the fund, meant to provide assistance to Russia, were doubled to reach 120 million pound sterling in 1993. The experience of the past years has shown and we are glad to ascertain that the "know-how" fund is an effective body to provide aid to Russian reforms. Unlike certain other programmes it is not so bureaucratic, and more capable of quickly reacting to individual demands, Douglas Hogg said.
