Ford said the SI presidential office, at a meeting in Tokyo on May 10, will formally replace Craxi, who is mired in kickbacks scandals at home and is under investigation by magistrates in several cities on suspicion of violating party financing laws and receiving bribes. The continued stay by Craxi as SI vice president has caused growing controversy in Italy. The Northern League yesterday criticized the Left Democrat Party, formerly the Italian Communist Party, for "not having raised objections" to having Italy represented in the organization by a discredited politician. The Left Democrats responded by noting they had already raised the issue with the SI president, Pierre Mauroy. Today, Ford said Craxi will no longer hold any post in the SI and that the vice presidency should go to another Italian party affiliated to the organization; "the most appropriate person," he said, "is the party's secretary, Achille Occhetto." Craxi was elected SI vice president in 1992, when he was still Socialist Party chief and just as the nation's bribery scandals were beginning to emerge. He now faces more than a dozen possible indictments.
