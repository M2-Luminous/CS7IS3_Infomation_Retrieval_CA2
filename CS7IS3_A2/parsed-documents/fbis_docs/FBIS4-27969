FBIS4-27969 "dreas109_d_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-109 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 South Korea Objectives for National Security Council Meeting Objectives for National Security Council Meeting SK0706020694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0144 GMT 7 Jun 94 SK0706020694 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, after returning from visits to Russia and Uzbekistan, has called a National Security Council meeting for Wednesday [8 June], indicating his firm resolve to defend the country against possible provocation by a cornered North Korea. The fact that a Security Council meeting has been called for the first time since the inauguration of the Kim administration in February 1993 underscores the gravity of the worsening North Korean nuclear row. As stipulated by Provision 91 of the Constitution, the National Security Council is an official presidential organ from which the chief executive can seek advice on foreign, military and domestic affairs prior to deliberating policy at a cabinet meeting. A National Security Council meeting is one notch higher than a meeting of national security-related ministers or a unification-security policy coordination meeting, convened frequently in the past to discuss the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear program. Consequently, it is designed to be called at a time of crisis and policy decisions forged at this kind of meeting carry much more weight, according to analysts. While visiting Uzbekistan, President Kim said Monday, "North Korea's development of nuclear weapons is a problem on which not only the survival of the 70 million Korean people depends. It also threatens the peace and security of Northeast Asia as well as the world." "We are keeping a close watch on North Korea 24 hours a day and our troops, the U.S. and U.N. forces have enough strength to deter a war on the Korean peninsula," Kim said. This National Security Council meeting is a sizeable affair. It is being attended by the prime minister, deputy prime ministers, and the defense, foreign, home affairs and finance ministers in addition to the director of the Agency for National Security Planning. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is an associate member of the council, also has the right to speak at the meeting. Chief and senior presidential secretaries can attend the meeting if the president so desires. It is understood that Kim has invited chief secretary Pak Kwan-yong, Yi Won-chong, senior presidential secretary for political affairs, Chong Chong-uk, senior secretary for foreign and National Security Affairs, Pak Chae-yun, senior secretary for economic affairs, and presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik. By presiding over the first meeting of the National Security Council, President Kim obviously wants to demonstrate both at home and abroad his determination to handle any developments arising from the North Korean nuclear dispute. Officials at Chongwadae [presidential offices], however, took pains to stress that the meeting is being held in "a crisis situation." The president and his top officials want to "check the possibility" of the North Korean question reaching the crisis point, they said. President Kim appears to have considered three main objectives in calling the meeting. First, Kim probably aims to demonstrate to the world that South Korea, as a nation that is most directly involved, is doing its utmost as the U.N. Security Council prepares to discuss sanctions against North Korea. Second, the president wants to convey a strong message to North Korea not to misread the South's resolve and undertake any rash action. And third, Kim intends to assure South Koreans that the nation's preparedness is complete and its surveillance water-tight, enabling them to depend on their government.
