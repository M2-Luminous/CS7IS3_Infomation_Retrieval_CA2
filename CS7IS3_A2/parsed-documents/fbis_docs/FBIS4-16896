The reason was purely economic -- the nonpayment of wages since the beginning of the year. But if their labor is not paid for within a week, the miners warned, demands will be made that the government should resign and presidential elections be held ahead of schedule. The countdown was about to begin, but news spread of 2.7 billion rubles arriving on time; this should be enough to settle accounts with the miners. But only for January. It was decided to postpone the strike. Evidently, until this money runs out.
