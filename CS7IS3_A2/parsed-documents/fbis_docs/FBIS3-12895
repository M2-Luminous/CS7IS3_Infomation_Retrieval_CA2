FBIS3-12895 "drnes044_k_94011" FBIS-NES-94-044 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Mar 1994 IRAQ Paper Chides U.S. Use of Democracy, Human Rights JN0603110594 Baghdad INA in Arabic 0745 GMT 6 Mar 94 JN0603110594 Baghdad INA Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Baghdad, 6 Mar (INA) -- The newspaper AL-THAWRAH maintains that the U.S. Administration is using democracy and human rights as political cards to damage the interests of world peoples and undermine their abilities to freely make political decisions and pursue independent options. In an article published today under the headline "Clinton, Ignorance, and Zionist Motives", the paper, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, adds: When they advance arguments grounded in the U.S. concept of human rights and U.S. national security, U.S. officials forget that other world peoples have their own national security to worry about, and that they also have human rights that must be respected. The paper wonders: Since democracy is rooted in dialogue, how can anybody who professes to be a democrat and a staunch advocate of democracy reject dialogue and wave the big stick in the face of anyone who chooses to hold a dissenting view? The paper notes the periodic report U.S. President Bill Clinton submitted to Congress. In this report, the paper says, Clinton spoke, thanks to the bad advice offered him by his Zionist advisers, of what he called Iraq's sponsorship of terrorism, and of human rights violations in Iraq. Clinton said Iraqi policy continues to pose threats to U.S. national security and to U.S. foreign policy -- something that prompts the United States to support the continued enforcement of the economic sanctions against it. The paper adds: The U.S. President has deliberately chosen to overlook the fact that there is a UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution passed at Washington's urging, i.e., Resolution 687, that must be taken into account in this regard. The U.S. President has chosen to forget that Iraq has honored all its commitments toward this resolution, and that, consequently, the UNSC must immediately honor the provisions enshrined in Paragraph 22 of this resolution by lifting the sanctions clamped on Iraq. According to the rules in force, Iraq is entitled to see the embargo lifted. The UNSC must act to lift the sanctions. The paper goes on to say: Clinton has set fresh terms for lifting the sanctions clamped on Iraq prior to the UNSC's periodic review of the sanctions. His statements will not fall on receptive ears at the UNSC, particularly since the positions of the UNSC permanent members on the embargo have experienced a clear change due to Iraq's fulfillment of its commitments toward Resolution 687. The paper accuses the U.S. president of taking positions that reflect a flagrant ignorance of the geopolitical facts of the Arab region, of the cohesive political regime in Iraq, and of the Iraqi people's rallying around its nationalist leadership. The paper adds: Clinton must understand that his implication of Iraq in terrorism is meaningless. It is clear to those near and far that Iraq has nothing to do with terrorism. Clinton is aware of who the real terrorists are. Iraq has never been involved in the terrorism game, the parties to which have become known to all. The paper notes the hostage games and the bargaining conducted between the United States, some Western countries, and some Middle Eastern parties and political regimes. The paper says this is flagrant proof of the involvement of the United States and these parties in terrorism. This shows Iraq has nothing to do with terrorism. AL-THAWRAH says the "human rights" argument raised by the U.S. Administration whenever the UNSC's periodic review of the Iraq sanctions approaches has become ridiculous. The paper urges the United States to adopt a balanced policy toward Iraq and the Arab homeland, because it is not in its interest to see Iraq weakened, as Clinton's advisers must have deluded him into believing. Iraq is a crucially important factor for development, progress, stability, and equilibrium in the region. It is a factor conducive to world security and peace. As for the embargo, it is about to be defeated, whether Clinton likes it or not.
