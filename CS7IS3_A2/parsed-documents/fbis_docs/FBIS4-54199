The FTC said Toshiba Chemical and seven other companies, which dominate the domestic market for phenolic copper-coated paper laminates, formed a price cartel in June 1987 to boost prices. The ruling was identical to one the antimonopoly watchdog handed down in 1992, which the Tokyo High Court nullified in February this year. The court ordered the commission to reexamine the case, saying the FTC decision was unfair because an investigator in the original cartel probe was later named one of the FTC's five members who ruled on the case. Hitachi Chemical Co. and six other makers abided by an FTC order in June 1989 to halt the unfair practice, but Toshiba refused to comply and sought a legal judgment from the FTC. After a series of public hearings, the FTC concluded in September 1992 that the firm violated the Antimonopoly Law. Toshiba Chemical, dissatisfied with the decision, filed a suit against the commission.
