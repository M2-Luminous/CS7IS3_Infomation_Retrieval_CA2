Britain's deputy head of mission, Hamish Cowell, had been asked to leave the country, a spokesman said. Iran gave no reason for what the spokesman described as an "unjustified" request, but the move appears to be a tit-for-tat response to Britain's expulsion of an Iranian diplomat last week. The Foreign Office today for the first time officially confirmed that expulsion had been ordered and named the Iranian diplomat as first secretary Vahid Belourchi. He had been asked to leave because of false allegations about British policy in Bosnia. Members of the Iranian embassy in London had been distributing forged documents purporting to show Britain's policy in Bosnia was directed against Muslims, the spokesman said. Until today the Foreign Office would only confirm that a meeting had taken place last Thursday [26 May] between Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg and Iran's charge d'affaires in London, Gholamreza Ansari. Diplomatic sources said the Foreign Office's refusal to confirm the expulsion was aimed at trying to forestall a tit-for-tat move by Iran. The Foreign Office would not say today whether Britain would respond further. "We will keep the situation under review. We are looking at it very closely at the moment," the spokesman said. He confirmed the expelled Iranian diplomat had not yet left the country but said there were no signs that Iran was dragging its feet. Mr Cowell was not expected to be packing his bags yet either. "His departure would not necessarily be immediate," the spokesman said. Yesterday, Mr Cowell himself referred inquiries from PRESS ASSOCIATION News about the possibility of reprisals against British diplomats in Tehran to the Foreign Office news department in London. Although Iran gave no official reason for the move, the Iranian news agency IRNA quoted a radical Iranian newspaper which accused Britain of launching a propaganda offensive in the country.
