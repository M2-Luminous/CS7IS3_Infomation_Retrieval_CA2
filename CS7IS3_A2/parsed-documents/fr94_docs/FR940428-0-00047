FR940428-0-00047 FR940428-0-00018 Comment: A few commenters opposed the requirement that a school's clinical training program be approved by a State as of January 1, 1992, and remain currently approved by that State. One commenter claimed that because few States approve clinical training programs for foreign medical schools, Congress would not have intended to require that approval. Discussion: States can and do approve clinical training programs for foreign medical schools; thus, Congress specifically referred to that approval in section 481(a)(2) of the HEA for programs approved as of January 1, 1992. The Congress made clear throughout the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 the need for strict accountability of educational institutions to States, accrediting agencies, and the Federal government. The Secretary would be remiss in his duty to exercise responsible oversight of the administration of the FFEL programs if participating institutions were to be permitted to obtain or maintain eligibility for clinical training programs that, although once approved by a State, lost such approval. Further, approval of the clinical training program is among the criteria in the HEA used to demonstrate comparability to institutions in the United States. A school that lost its State approval after January 1, 1992 fails this criterion. Changes: None. Assessment of Educational Impact In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. Based on the response to the proposed rules and its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.
