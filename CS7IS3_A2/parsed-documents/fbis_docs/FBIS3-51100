One week ago, General Picon, former chairman of the 4th Supreme Council of Military Justice, assumed command of Peru's 4th Military Region, headquartered in Cusco, a south Andes region. According to Radio Programas del Peru Network, the tragedy occurred under circumstances that have not been clearly explained yet, when the aircraft was overflying Cusco's Velasco Astete Airport. According to an initial military report, the helicopter crashed for lack of fuel, but witnesses told the radio station that the aircraft exploded in the air, before crashing. This second version involves the possibility of the incident being a terrorist attack. The crash zone, a 200 square meter area over which the helicopter debris and bodies of the passengers are spread, has been surrounded by troops who are keeping the media away.
