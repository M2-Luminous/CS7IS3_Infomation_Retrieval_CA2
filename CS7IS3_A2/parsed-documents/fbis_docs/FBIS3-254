The party's chief secretary, Dr. Lem Theron, said the reason for the campaign was the success achieved by the CP during the past 12 years in establishing a bastion for the political aspirations of Afrikaners and their desire for freedom and independence. The Mulder brothers, members of the Afrikaner Volksfront's [Afrikaner National Front] negotiating team, say there are no differences within the Conservative Party about the ideal of an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] and the need to attain such a state as soon as possible. Dr. Pieter Mulder said in a statement by himself and his brother, Corne Mulder, that they were still convinced that a volkstaat should be seen as part of the solution to South Africa's problems.
