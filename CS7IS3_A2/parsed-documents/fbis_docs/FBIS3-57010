It might seem that this is not such a long stretch of time. However, looking back and analyzing the path that has been covered, one can see with particular clarity not only all of our achievements, but also problems and shortcomings. I would like to consider some of them separately. We inherited a considerable military formation from the former Soviet Army. However, in terms of structure and military equipment, it did not conform to those tasks that arose before Ukraine with regard to ensuring its own defense capability. At the first stage, we tried to reform those Union army forces into Ukraine's Armed Forces. However, later, it became clear that Ukraine needs an army that would not be a successor to any other army, that would possess characteristics reflecting the historical and national traditions, would be based upon its own infrastructure, and would take into account our states's specific geostrategic situation and other characteristics. As a consequence, we became convinced that it is not reforms that we must occupy ourselves with, but the building of our own Armed Forces. Of course, one cannot avoid problems in this demanding work. Among the problems that I am particularly concerned with, the problem of the personnel occupies the primary position. In those decisive months when Ukraine was acquiring the status and the characteristics of an independent state, some people who did not really care about the state's sovereignty, but only wanted to keep their "cushy jobs," benefits enjoyed by the nomenklatura, and so on managed to get into the leadership of the Defense Ministry. Of course, they did not really bother to build the Ukrainian Army in the best possible way. We can now see the consequences of such work particularly well. We have been gradually ridding ourselves of the services of such people over the entire period of existence of Ukraine's Armed Forces and are still removing them. We must adhere to one criterion: The serviceman's high military professionalism based upon the highest level of general and special training, his way of life, spiritual state, way of thinking, and activity. Competence, responsibility for the assigned task, and loyalty to Ukraine are those qualities that we must take as a basis for distinguishing a military professional from a time-serving dilettante. The general public knows how many emotions erupted, in particular around the question of reforming military education. The Ministry of Defense and the head of the military education administration in person were criticized in the press for the errors, shortcomings, and distortions in that work. In many cases, that criticism was justified. Therefore, we need to put in much effort to rectify the situation. However, in my opinion, a new, more experienced and better qualified person must head this work and the main administration for educational work. Many people remember the controversial reaction to the Ukrainian presidential edict on unifying the Air Force and Air Defense into Air Defense Troops. There were radically opposed opinions, and there was a real battle in the press. It was for a good reason. Today, it must be admitted that this step was untimely. Even despite the fact that, with the exception of Russia, China, and Romania, all other states of the world have these types of armed forces unified. I am sure that Ukraine must proceed to such unification gradually, in a balanced manner, and without haste, in order to avoid impairing our defense capability. Well, for the time being, our Air Force and Air Defense function separately. The only acute problem that bothers them is the shortage of fuel. Thus, the reform in military education, the attempt to hastily create Air Defense Troops, and the difficulties with building our own Naval Forces -- these and a number of other objective and subjective factors could but hamper the processes of building Ukraine's Armed Forces. The insufficiently skilled personnel and the shortage of money have further intensified the problem. Nor can one refrain from putting blame upon members of the Defense Ministry Military Board, deputy ministers, chiefs of administration, or commanders of the Armed Forces and military districts. Yet another acute problem is the fact that we have not had a defense budget for two years. Precisely its absence has become one of the main reasons for neglecting such constituents upon which the state's defense capability is based: science, the military-industrial complex, and the army. Today, those scientists who must work for defense are in a difficult situation -- they must think of how to survive, instead of creating something new. The situation at Ukraine's defense enterprises is not much better: Some of them stand completely idle, while at others, individual workshops and technological lines with most up-to-date equipment do not work. There are no state orders and no money. As a result, highly skilled specialists are leaving en masse. I could see that with my own eyes during numerous visits to enterprises of the military-industrial complex. World experience indicates that armed forces must be built on the basis of the achievements of military science and the most expedient utilization of the possibilities of defense enterprises. It is clear that for this we need funding. A separate fund for science, a separate one for the military industrial complex, and again a separate fund for maintaining the army. Of course, this will come up to quite a large figure, but we cannot do without large outlays if we want to be reliably protected. Several variants of the defense budget have already been elaborated by corresponding specialists. The documents have now been submitted to the Ukrainian president. It is possible that Ukraine's Supreme Council will discuss and approve the best of them in the second half of January. It is true, though, that Ukraine's acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy is already insisting that the defense budget be reduced. One often hears complaints about the numerical strength of Ukraine's Armed Forces. Some people say that the Army could be smaller and would, in that case, require much less money. At present, the Ukrainian Army has 533,000 servicemen. In accordance with world norms, the variant in which 1 percent of the state's population serves in the army is considered optimal. Therefore, all grumbling about the size of the Army is groundless. However, notwithstanding this, we are planning to reduce the Army to between 300,000 and 350,000 servicemen by the year 2000. This cannot be done in one go, as it is necessary to provide those servicemen who are demobilized with housing and work. Incidentally, many people are now willing to leave the Army. They are not satisfied with low salaries, delays with payments, problems with obtaining uniforms, and the absence of housing.... In 1994, the Army will be reduced by 90,000 persons. The problem of introducing the Ukrainian language in our troops is not simple. This problem is further aggravated by the relatively small number of officers with a command of the language and by the absence of special military literature in the state language. It is only with the help of a sufficient financing of the instruction process and with a deep conviction on the part of our soldiers that they need to master the Ukrainian language that we will be able to get rid of the shortcomings fast and with good results. It is necessary for every serviceman to be deeply convinced that he needs to study the language and the glorious history of Ukraine, its customs, traditions, and culture not only for his own general and spiritual development, but also in order to be proud of being the son of this land, of having grown on it and nurtured by it, for which he must ardently love it. The main thing is that he must be aware of the high honor of defending Ukraine's independence and territorial integrity with weapons. Our army has recently been reproached for remaining aloof with regard to political activity. I must point out that this is not my own invention or whim. Ukraine's legislation has determined that total departmentalization of the Armed Forces is one of the main principles of building them. The Army is a state structure and, like in any law-governed state, it must adhere to the government's political line and not meander among the positions of various parties and movements. Isn't this right? Many people are presently concerned about such serious problems as the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine and about the division of the Black Sea Fleet among Ukraine and Russia. It looks as if, this year, the question of strategic weapons will finally be resolved based upon the tripartite agreement between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. Compensation has been promised to us for the tactical weapons withdrawn from Ukraine back in 1992. As regards the Black Sea Fleet, the settlement of this problem is in the interests of both Ukraine and Russia. That is why this question must not be resolved through confrontation or by way of grabbing as much as possible, when economic and political difficulties are taken advantage of, but with mutual respect and through interaction and cooperation in this region between our two states. In conclusion, I want to gladden the hearts of those parents whose sons will serve in our army: The restoration by the Supreme Council of the two-year long army service that led to a wave of misunderstanding among the civilian population is a temporary measure. This step was due to the complication that emerged last fall as a result of the simultaneous dismissal to the reserve of two categories of conscripts -- both those who had served two years and those who served one and one-half years. Incidentally, even after the Supreme Council decision, the period of service will be between 18 and 20 months, and not a full two years. One more thing: During meetings with the civilian population, I often have to answer questions on whether the Ukrainian people may now sleep peacefully. I assure you with all responsibility -- our Armed Forces are capable of defending their people and Ukraine's independence.
