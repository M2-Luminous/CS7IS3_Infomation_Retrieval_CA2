Please note that this view is synonymous with the one used by Mr. Iliescu many times, and summarized in one word: consensus. Mr. Iliescu's consensus dream has taken here a more explicit form of the one between the government and the opposition. I do not want to overstress the fact that, if this dialogue, one absolutely normal in a democratic society, was not sufficiently clear and supportable, then it was not in most cases because of the opposition, but rather the government, which rejected all those proposals and suggestions from the opposition that could have gotten the discussions underway. The events are well-known. Every time the opposition asked the government for certain things that, in our opinion, were obligatory, the government rejected them. Every time the government was brought into a situation to implement the opposition's program, the government turned it to its own benefit. The most glaring example is the reorientation of the current government team in Romania from the East to the West, and from the CIS towards Euro-Atlanticism. This is a reorientation that can be very easily seen if I can remind you that, beginning with the August 1991 putsch and continuing, not directly in chronological order, with the treaty between Mr. Iliescu and Mr. Gorbachev, for a long time in first place in the negative reporting in many publications, the Government of Romania started to look to the East and precisely towards the CIS. The government took the country towards the West at the point when, to our good fortune, Gorbachev and Gorbachevism fell from favor in Russia, at the point when Russia radicalized itself. And, in recent times we have witnessed a sort of victory celebration on the part of the people who just one or two years ago were speaking only about the treaty with Gorbachev, but who are now speaking about the eventual agreements with Bill Clinton and our entrance into Europe and the Council of Europe. Just as, in the end, these gentlemen were the ones who brought about this extraordinary reorientation of our entire lives from the East to the West. Last night, they signed the document to establish the Consultative Council for Euro-Atlantic Integration, a document that has its roots in the opposition. This document came out of the ranks of the parliamentary opposition and is one that was finally accepted by the government. The opposition also sent representatives to this meeting, and Mr. Iliescu had an entourage there (don't blame me; that's what Mr. Iliescu calls it), and the ministries and other organs of the government were also represented there. Currently, the opposition's arguments for the West and for European integration can no longer be combated by the government. At this time, the government can no longer bet on the CIS and Yeltsin (if the government would do what Yeltsin is doing in Moscow, we could also avoid some problems), and, so, it is betting on the West and Euro-Atlanticism, and it wants to profit from this, which is not correct. The wolf can change his clothing, but not his habits. The government was represented by Mr. Gherman. More importantly, the PSM [the Socialist Party of Labor] as well as the PRM [the ROMANIA MARE Party] were there, but not represented by their presidents. Furthermore, they tabled a declaration that noted that they are signing the document, but have important reservations concerning several of its provisions. I would have admired the PDSR [the Romanian Social Democratic Party] if it had taken a similar action. The PDSR, however, completely changed its clothing. In this case, it bears no resemblance to the wolf of old, and it signed the document, after which the Romanian mass-media presented us with the interesting observation that this Consultative Council was a consensual effort. Returning to the analysis at the beginning here, I think that the real motives for the current situation are of a factual and governmental nature, not theoretical and oppositional or dialogue focused. I say factual and governmental because the government is the one that must implement the reform program with everything that it involves. And the government, what does it do? So you can understand, I will tell you what was proposed to us today in the Senate as a radical measure to improve our standard of living during the winter. In opening the meeting, I made a statement where I protested the manner in which we are treated in our homes, with no heating or hot water. I said that I understand that the government did not deliver on its promises that we would have heating oil and all the other things, because this is not the first promise that this government has not kept. But, what I do not understand is why we are paying for that which the government has not provided. The result of this was that one of our colleagues from the PDSR accused me of populism. Today, in conclusion, the government, informed by my populism, came forward with a radical measure: some allocations for the disadvantaged categories of people in order to pay for the recent increases in heating costs. I will ignore the amount of the allocation, which is sufficient for you to eventually buy an amount that would fill a lantern. I will also ignore the source of this money, which will only be partially covered by the budget, with the remainder coming from a tax that you will pay when you leave the country to travel abroad. The paradox is that those who leave and do not use heating pay more than those who stay and use it. The solution would be for as many people as possible to leave. If 40 percent of Romania's population were to leave, the remaining 60 percent could get heating. Such a plan is not far removed from what Ceausescu was also doing, giving us a few lei compensation for one thing or another. The gentlemen from "A Future for Romania" say that the political parties in the opposition have not answered the question "where goes Romania?" Yes, we have responded: towards capitalism. We were timid at first to say that word, but we have taken the bull by the horns and answered: back to capitalism! ``I am very worried that the manner in which `A Future for Romania' presents this problem sounds like a diversion: Let's give a dose of the politicians to the people, the people who cannot buy necessities and who are dying from the cold, and let's explain to the people that, if bread now costs what it does and if it is cold in your home like during the Ceausescu era, this has nothing to do with the government, with Mr. Vacaroiu, or with the stalled negotiations with the trade unions, but rather it has a direct and personal link with the politicians, especially those in the opposition. Right before you is one of the people to blame for the situation in the country.'' In conclusion, Mr. Nicolae Manolescu pointed out the members of the leadership of the PAC, present at this conference, as the "guilty ones," from the diversionist point of view of the above-mentioned group. Since the speech was very comprehensive, there were no further questions.
