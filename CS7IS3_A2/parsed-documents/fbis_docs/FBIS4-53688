Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Secretary General Wataru Kubo said that the Hata cabinet should resign en masse soon after the fiscal 1994 budget bills are approved by the Diet, and before the opposition camp submits a no-confidence motion. Kubo, talking with Japanese reporters traveling with him during his current eight-day trip to China since Sunday, said the SDPJ is likely to seek a no-confidence vote if Hata refuses to step down. The possibility of an SDPJ no-confidence motion would be "very high" if the Hata cabinet does not resign en masse, he said. The largest opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has already said it will seek a no-confidence vote after the long-delayed budget for fiscal 1994, which began in April, clears the Diet. Kubo also hinted the SDPJ, which holds the swing vote in the Diet, may move to make a rapprochement with its former coalition partners if Hata bows out. If Hata opts for resignation, he said, the SDPJ will consider that "the score is settled" with the former allies. He was referring to the feud over a new Diet bloc created by the coalition partners led by Shinseito, which infuriated the SDPJ and resulted in their break from the coalition the day Hata was named to succeed Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister. The SDPJ's defection from the ruling coalition left Hata with the first minority government in four decades. The three-week-old Hata administration has been under constant pressure from the opposition over what they call an insufficient mandate by the public. The opposition's call for Hata to give up the helm began moments after he took it. SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made a call last week for early general elections for the House of Representatives to restore stability in the government. Kubo's remarks Saturday that the SDPJ will likely seek a no- confidence vote against Hata unless he voluntarily resigns will put the premier in a tight corner since the LDP is almost certain to vote against Hata. Defeat by a no-confidence vote would leave Hata with a harsh choice of either resigning or calling a snap poll. On the issue of the SDPJ's participation in a successor government, Kubo said, "there is no chance that we would return to the current ruling coalition." "It should not be a reshuffle of the Hata cabinet. We would discuss the issue from a completely new standpoint." Kubo ruled out, however, the possibility of the SDPJ allying with the LDP. "A grand LDP-SDPJ coalition, which could lead to a resurrection of LDP politics, is not in the cards," he said. The LDP holds 206 seats in the 511-member House of Representatives, while the SDPJ has 74, against the ruling coalition's 178. Kubo also swiped at the government's increasing pressure on a government panel to hurriedly redraw an electoral map for the new election system of combined single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. Hata and his coalition's top strategist Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] are dead set against holding elections under the old multiseat system, which will be replaced with the new system once the electoral map is redrawn in line with the Political Reform Law passed in January. Kubo suggested he is opposed to extending the term of the current Diet session to pass the bills for the constituency changes. The 150-day parliamentary session is due to end June 29. "If the people's voices (calling for general elections) emerge before the committee task is finished, we will have no choice but to hold elections under the current system," he said. Kubo's call for Hata's early resignation pits him starkly against party chief Murayama in jockeying for leadership in the party as it tries to build up a new strategy for political realignment, political analysts said. Murayama is tilting toward the holding of early elections under the old multiseat constituency system to recover the SDPJ's loss of seats in the lower house before making its next political move. Behind Kubo's gambit is his more sober assessment that the SDPJ's victory in the elections is far from secured, party sources said. Kubo, therefore, moved toward what he believes is a more plausible path of going back to the ruling party, one analyst said. It is, however, by no means clear what kind of political realignment he has in mind for his strategic moves, since many SDPJ lawmakers are adverse to joining hands with Ozawa's Shinseito, they said.
