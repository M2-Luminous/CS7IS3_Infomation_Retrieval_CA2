At Tashkent Airport, which was decorated with the flags of the two countries, he was greeted at the steps of the presidential Concord by Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov. The two heads of state had a private meeting at the country residence "Durmen," where the guest is staying. Later the Uzbek president hosted a banquet in Francois Mitterrand's honor. Official talks with the participation of the delegations from both countries will continue tomorrow. It is expected that the agenda will include a wide range of topics on international politics and bilateral relations. It seems that the parties will also talk about the situation in the region, in particular about the situation in Tajikistan and Afghanistan, as well as security problems and stability in the Central Asia, and relations between CIS countries. A large group of bankers and heads of major companies is accompanying the president. They are hoping to establish positive contacts with their Uzbek counterparts. The tense situation in Bosnia has had an interesting effect on the protocol of the visit. Paris, apparently unwilling to leave unattended the Balkan side of its international policy, announced at the last minute that the composition of the delegation would be changed. Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has been replaced by Minister of European Affairs Alain Lamassoure on the list of officials accompanying the president.
