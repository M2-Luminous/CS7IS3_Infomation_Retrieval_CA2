Dole said: "We only have a few days before the President has to decide. If possible, the President absolutely should immediately announce that he will unconditionally extend MFN status to China." He added: The President "should frankly express what most of us have known for a long time: It is infeasible to link trade with human rights issues. That policy has already failed. The President should admit this and continue to move forward." He reiterated that he does not agree with the measure that will disrupt [po huai 4275 0975] trade relations between the two countries. He believes that it will only lead to unemployment for many Americans and cause U.S. companies to lose the opportunity to participate in the world's fastest-growing economy.
