In an exclusive interview with CNA, he said "We must keep the actual structures of the Turkish and Greek sides." He advocated "equal rights and equal representation according to the population." To a remark by CNA that the 18 percent of the population of Cyprus cannot have the 50 percent representation, Mimaroglu said he could not give any figures. Asked if he would recommend to the Turkish Cypriots to return to their seats in the legal House of Representatives, the Turkish MP said "As it is now the actual structure of northern and southern Cyprus cannot be made into one. It is not possible to make it to one." Advocating the making of a state in Cyprus for the two communities, he said it had to maintain "completely the actual structures of both sides." He recommended negotiations under U.N. auspices and remarked "We would like to see the two sides to have equal rights without any discussion." Mimaroglu made these statements to CNA after a press conference he organised for a four-member delegation of so-called Turkish Cypriot MP's. At the press conference, the "MP's" set out their views and claimed President Kliridhis had shifted from the original text of the U.N. package of CBM's. The "speaker" of "Turkish Cypriot Assembly" Ajarkan charged that the U.N. had amended their original proposals to appease President Kliridhis' demands. Asked by CNA whether the Turkish Cypriot side was at odds with the U.N., Ajarkan repeated the view that Denktas had accepted in principle the CBM's but these were altered and accused the U.N. for making repeated errors since 1964.
