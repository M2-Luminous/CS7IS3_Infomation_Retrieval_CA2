Although the content of the president's message has not been publicized, according to informed sources, the message was chiefly in connection with friendly ties and cooperation between Iran and Kuwait. Our country's roads and transport minister, who started his three-day visit by meeting the amir of Kuwait, has also met the Kuwaiti prime minister and has conferred with him about the expansion of bilateral cooperation in economic and political spheres. In this visit, Mr. Torkan will sign a maritime agreement between the two countries. The first shipping line between the two countries has been operating actively since February last year. The opening of an active shipping line between the two countries is in reality a new chapter in the process of consolidating economic and political bonds between the two Muslim and fraternal nations of Iran and Kuwait. In addition, the distinguished and unique geopolitical situation of Iran has made our country a major communications link between Muslim countries, in particular as Iran links Arab countries -- especially Persian Gulf littoral states -- to the newly independent Muslim countries of Central Asia. The expansion of cordial and fraternal ties between Iran and Kuwait is taking place at a time when there are vigorous attempts by a number of Western countries and their allies in the region to mar Iran's relations with its southern neighbors. However, the present state of relations shows that despite the wish of the enemies and their extensive political and propaganda endeavours aimed at creating distance between Iran and its neighbors, the present realities in the region prove that there exist many profound bonds, as well as common interests and objectives, the attainment of which is dependent upon the expansion of cordial relations between historical neighbors in the region.
