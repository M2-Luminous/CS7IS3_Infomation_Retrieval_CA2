FBIS TRENDS-25MAY94-CHINA-U.S. Beijing Continues Campaign for MFN Renewal Beijing Continues Campaign for MFN Renewal SUMMARY With the deadline for a U.S. decision on renewing most-favored- nation (MFN) trading status for China rapidly approaching, Beijing is sticking to its longstanding strategy of making gestures on human rights and publicizing compliance on other issues of concern to Washington while rejecting any formal linkage between MFN and human rights. Beijing has continued to warn of the negative economic consequences that might result from the Clinton administration's failure to renew China's MFN status and, resurrecting a tactic used during past MFN renewal debates, has highlighted the strategic consequences that could arise if MFN is not renewed. However, Beijing's efforts to present an image of progress in addressing U.S. demands are being undermined by leadership concerns about domestic stability and the adoption of measures to repress dissent that are at odds with the goals of China's campaign for MFN renewal. END SUMMARY Stepping up its efforts to influence the MFN debate as the deadline for renewal draws near, Beijing in recent days has sought to highlight its alleged progress in meeting U.S. human rights concerns, announcing the release of more jailed dissidents. On 13 May, for example, Xinhua announced a major gesture on human rights in reporting that Chen Ziming, who along with Wang Juntao had been serving a 13-year sentence for his role as an alleged ringleader of the 1989 pro-democracy movement, had been "released on bail for medical treatment." China had released Wang on 23 April and allowed him to go to the United States for medical treatment. In a similar concession to Washington on a high-profile dissident, Beijing, according to the independent Hong Kong daily The South China Morning Post, has resolved one of the "major blocked passport" cases and has given noted legal scholar Yu Haocheng permission to leave for the United States (12 May). In addition, Xinhua on 12 May reported that Zhang Ruiyu, who reportedly had been jailed in August 1990 for having "conspired to overthrow the government by means of religious activities," has been released "on parole." The next day, Xinhua announced that five more religious dissidents--Chen Zhumun, Yan Peizhi, Xu Zhihe, Cui Tai, and Zhang Li--have been released from labor reeducation institutions. According to the press agency, the five had been arrested between December 1991 and September 1993 for "disturbing social order and endangering public security by making use of religion." Compliance with Executive Order Conditions Beijing has also stepped up its efforts in recent days to demonstrate Chinese compliance on other MFN-related issues, while denying any linkage between these gestures and the MFN debate. On 19 May, for example, Zhongguo Xinwen She, Beijing's news service for overseas Chinese, reported remarks by a PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman that touched on a number of issues identified as areas of U.S. concern in President Clinton's May 1993 executive order on China's MFN status for 1993 and 1994. According to the report, the spokesman denied that Beijing is "jamming" Voice of America broadcasts to China, but noted that it has agreed to hold talks on "technical matters" regarding the broadcasts, "such as the questions of overlapping frequencies." --Prison Conditions. The spokesman also underscored Beijing's alleged progress on the question of prison visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). He said that China's talks with the ICRC were proceeding apace and that the two sides have "agreed" that the talks "furthered understanding and were very positive." Apparently seeking to polish China's image on the question of conditions in PRC prisons, Zhongguo Xinwen She on 20 May began a series praising the success of China's penal system. The first installment of the series cited Zhang Xiufu, a vice minister of justice, as touting China's success in "reforming" its criminals through labor, saying that China has "one of the lowest rates of recidivism in the world." Other installments have pointed to other alleged virtues of the penal system such as the supposedly enlightened treatment of "hardened" criminals at Shanghai's No. 147 prison with its "rich" sports and culture programs (21 May), the "humanitarian" treatment of foreign prisoners in Shanghai City Prison, who allegedly receive television sets, books, magazines, and a copy of China Daily (22 May), and the successes of China's "transformation through labor" policy (May 24). -- Prison Labor. Beijing has shown particular sensitivity to recent charges that China is exporting goods made by prison labor--perhaps because resolving the prison labor issue is one of the mandatory conditions of President Clinton's executive order. For example, China responded quickly and authoritatively to the 16 May release of a foreign-made film on the No. 2 Prison in Xinjiang. A spokesman for the "Judicial Department," in remarks carried by Xinhua the next daY, called the film a "fabrication" and denied the film's claims that the prison produces clothes for export. Two days later, a PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman took issue with claims by "a number of U.S. Congressmen" that China is continuing to export prison labor products to the United States, calling these remarks a "sheer fabrication" and saying that Beijing has acted in "strict compliance" with the Sino-U.S. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and the subsequent joint statement on implementation (Xinhua, 19 May) On 2O May, Beijing reiterated its earlier denunciations of the film in a statement from a "leading official" of the "Judicial Department" (Xinhua, 2O May). -- Tibet. Beijing has also taken special pains in recent days to address the question of Tibet--another area of U.S. concern mentioned in the 1993 executive order--by publicizing an interview with a spokesman for the United Front Work Department of the party Central Committee. Clearly meant for foreign audiences, the interview was published in the 16-22 May edition of Beijing Review, China's English-language weekly current affairs journal. In addition to claiming economic and social advances in Tibet, the spokesman laid out Beijing's longstanding policies on talks with the Dalai Lama. The spokesman underscored Beijing's willingness to hold talks with the Tibetan religious leader, asserting that China has made "genuine efforts" over the past ten years to hold talks with the Dalai Lama and insisting that such efforts will continue with "full sincerity and patience. Warnings on Consequences As the deadline for the MFN decision nears, Beijing has also ratcheted up its warnings of the negative consequences that might follow from a failure by the Clinton administration to renew China's MFN status. Meeting with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on 12 May, PRC President and CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin resurrected a threat used by China during past debates over MFN renewal, indicating that the failure to renew China's MFN status could have strategic consequences for the United States. According to a 12 May Xinhua account of the talks that day, Jiang underscored the "responsibility" borne by China and the United States as "two powers having a considerable influence on the world" and warned that "confrontation between the two countries "will do no one any good." Better relations, he said, will "benefit" the world and are "re9uired for world peace and stability." Not surprisingly, he also suggested that bilateral relations will "meet with difficulties or setbacks or even regress" if Washington persists in "stressing differences over ideology" and tries to impose "sanctions.and pressure." PRC Premier Li Peng delivered a similar message in his meeting with former U.S national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski on 16 May. Bluntly rejecting any linkage between MFN and human rights, he stressed that China will "not allow any country to impose its ideology or concepts of values" on China and will "never allow any other country to attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs." Declaring that "foreign statesmen will surely make mistakes" if they base their "understanding" on the words of a "tiny number of Chinese," he went on to indicate that the failure to renew China's MFN status would have strategic consequences as China's "development and growth" are an "important factor contributing to world peace." While reemphasizing the alleged risks in the strategic sphere, Beijing has also continued to warn of the negative economic consequences that could arise if MFN is not renewed. During his visit to the United States in early May, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, according to Xinhua, repeatedly warned of the potential for negative economic fallout. A 3 May Xinhua report, for example, said that Zou told U.S. businessmen on the 2d that a "long term stable and harmonious environment" is necessary for economic and trade cooperation. He reportedly went on to note that because of the annual debate over MFN, the United States-is "not as advantageously placed" as the Europeans and the Japanese, warning that there will be "serious damage" to the economics and trade of both countries if MFN is not granted. Providing further evidence of the potential for negative economic consequences, Chinese media continue to routinely quite American corporate executives concerning the losses their companies will face if China's MFN trading status is not renewed. Complications China's efforts to demonstrate progress on Washington's criteria for MFN renewal this year are being undercut by concerns about domestic stability that have led the leadership to take a number of steps that are at odds with Beijing's attempt to project an image of compliance. Even as China has been releasing some prominent jailed dissidents, Western media have been reporting that new arrests are being made. For example, on the same day that Xinhua announced the release of Zhang Ruiyu, the French press agency AFP reported that Yang Zhou became the fifth Shanghai dissident to be arrested in recent weeks (12 May). Moreover, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, during a 5-12 May session, amended the 1986 "Regulations for Controlling and Punishing Public Offenses," which judging by the text carried by Xinhua on 13 May, provides new legal justifications for detaining China dissidents. Outlook Now that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has put forward his assessment of Beijing's progress in meeting the conditions of the 1993 executive order, Beijing will probably refrain from any new steps that could negatively influence the President's final decision. However, as pointed out in a 23 May editorial carried by the PRC-owned Hong Kong daily Ta Kung Pao, China's domestic security concerns will continue to take priority over meeting Washington's requirements on MFN renewal. In an unusual public acknowledgement of the link between the leadership's preoccupation with social stability and the MFN issue, the editorial stressed that, while Beijing desires better ties with Washington, China will "not abandon-its sovereignty or sacrifice social stability to meet U.S. demands" to gain MFN renewal.
