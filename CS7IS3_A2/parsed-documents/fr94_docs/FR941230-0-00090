FR941230-0-00090 FR941230-0-00018 50 CFR Part 663 [Docket No. 941262&hyph;4362; I.D. 121294B] Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery; Emergency Rule To Provide for Interim ``A'' Limited Entry Permits AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Emergency interim rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: NOAA issues this emergency interim rule to amend the implementing regulations for the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) to relax the qualifying criteria for issuance of ``A'' limited entry fishing permits endorsed with the size of larger replacement vessels. This action is necessary to rectify immediately what NOAA has determined to be an inequity in the treatment, under the current regulations, of certain vessel owners with replacement vessels more than 5 ft (1.52 m) longer than the qualifying vessel that was replaced. The intended effect of this rule is to provide for participation in the Pacific Coast groundfish fishery by larger replacement vessels acquired prior to September 30, 1990 (and provided the vessel replaced was disposed of by that date), but whose owners were denied permits with an endorsed size for the larger vessel. DATES: Effective December 23, 1994, until March 30, 1995. Comments will be accepted through January 30, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to William Stelle, Jr., Director, Northwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, BIN&hyph;C15700, Seattle, WA 98115&hyph;0070; or Hilda Diaz-Soltero, Director Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 501 West Ocean Blvd., Suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213. Documentation supporting this emergency action is available at the Northwest Regional Office, NMFS, at the address above. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William L. Robinson at (206) 526&hyph;6140; or Rodney McInnis at (310) 980&hyph;4030. For further information on application procedures, phone (206) 526&hyph;4353. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NOAA issues this emergency rule under the authority of section 305(c)(1) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. An emergency rule that changes a fishery management plan is treated as an amendment to such plan for the period in which such regulation is in effect.
