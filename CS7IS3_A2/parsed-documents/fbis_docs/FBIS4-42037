Payments for Russian energy sources consumed 30 percent of those revenues. A SEM DNEY correspondent has interviewed Alyaksandr Tushynski, first deputy defense minister of Belarus. [Tushynski] First of all, I must make it clear that the Defense Ministry does not deal with the arms trade. According to the government's resolution, only three firms are allowed to conduct this kind of business. They look for partners and coordinate prices. Then, they submit a contract to our ministry, and if the products are included on an appropriate list, the Defense Ministry gives the go-ahead for the sale. Our responsibility is to prepare the equipment for sale. Anticipating your question, I will tell about the moral aspect of the arms trade. Many states do that. We are used to emulating the United States. So, the United States is currently holding the lead in the world's arms trade. Russia's defense industry has practically been dislodged from the former USSR's markets. Over the last five years, its exports have decreased five-fold, and they now amount to only $2 billion. [Kovaleva] Apparently, the Army is experiencing hard times, if servicemen have had to get involved in trade. [Tushynski] Exactly. Only 50 percent of money, which is essential to maintain the Army, was allotted for this year. Out of this sum, one must allocate funds necessary to dismantle conventional weapons in accordance with our international commitments. We plan to raise the remaining funds through commercial activities. Why should the Army keep its surplus weapons? We must sell them in time. No one will buy them in five years, and they will have to be scrapped. If we stopped trading, what would happen with the staff of the Test Range Equipment Plant, whose production is sold in Russia? There are many other enterprises that only profit from the sale of military equipment and weapons. [Kovaleva] The Defense Ministry is suspected of selling weapons to "hot spots." Are these suspicions substantiated? [Tushynski] I can certainly state that we deliver weapons only to countries which are not embargoed. You probably have in mind Alyaksandr Lukashenka's statement indicating that we have sold weapons to Croatia. This statement is groundless. All decisions concerning deliveries of weapons are made collectively at the governmental level, and they are coordinated with the Foreign Ministry, which has a list of states to which arms deliveries are allowed. There is a system of strict control, providing responsibility of all -- the KGB, the Interior Ministry, the Customs Committee, and the Defense Ministry. Moreover, an inspection conducted by competent bodies has revealed that all contracts were legal, and that they include certificates listing the final users. Still, if the military equipment has ultimately been resold, this weighs on the buyer's conscience. [Kovaleva] Russia is unable to conquer foreign markets. Can Belarus do that? [Tushynski] Many of our enterprises are already exporting their products. This is excellent equipment, and therefore, there is a huge demand for it. However, we must compete for markets. I will provide an example. Russia announced that it would deliver rocket technology and equipment to India. The United States did not wait: Sanctions were imposed on India, and the contract was not concluded. [Kovaleva] What does Belarus sell, and for what products is there the greatest demand? [Tushynski] To Russia, we sell products from the Test Range Equipment Plant, to Africa, South America, and other regions -- optical equipment produced by the BelOMO company, night vision equipment from Rogachev, tractors from Minsk... We plan to expand our markets. After all, during the Soviet Union, 360 people worked in the trade mission in India alone, moreover, two thirds of them dealt with arms deliveries.
