The conference also respectively made overall arrangements for reforming "these three systems." Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the regional party committee and chairman of the regional government, chaired the conference. Bai Enpei, deputy secretary of the regional party committee, made a speech at the conference. Yun Bulong, vice chairman of the regional government, relayed Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech made at the national organizational reform work conference and the CPC Central Committee and the State Council's circular on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's plan for party and government organizational reform. [passage omitted] Bai Enpei stressed: To change the government functions, we should make two key breakthroughs. First, according to the principle of separating government functions from enterprise management, we should realistically delegate to enterprises the decision-making powers that belong to enterprises so that enterprises will really become legal entities that are independent for management, responsible for their own profits and losses, and capable of developing and restricting themselves as well as main bodies for market competition. The government departments should mainly use economic and legal means and necessary administrative means to regulate and control markets and guide enterprises and will not interfere in enterprises' production and management or manage enterprises' affairs. Second, We should set up and perfect the macroeconomic regulation and control system and use more laws, policies, and economic levers to guide, regulate, and control markets so as to promote a sound operation of the national economy. Whether or not the government organs can smoothly change their functions depends on the changes of ideas. Changing functions and delegating powers to lower levels is essentially related to the readjustment of rights and interests. Leaders of all departments should have a common understanding about organizational reform. According to the requirements for setting up the socialist market economic system, we should proceed from the overall economic situation, adopt resolute measures, and ensure the changes of functions. Bai Enpei stressed: The reasonable distribution of office personnel is of vital importance to the organizational reform. The party committees and governments at various levels should overcome the feeling of fearing difficulties and be determined to achieve the reform in this aspect. Office cadres are the precious wealth of the party and the state, and talents are the most valuable resources. Therefore, we should regard the organizational reform as a favorable opportunity for developing talents resources and emancipating productive forces. We should not only pay attention to improving the office personnel structure and the personnel quality but also try every means possible to widen various channels to arrange these personnel. [passage omitted] Bai Enpei finally pointed out: After this conference, the region will comprehensively carry out the "reform of the three systems." The party committees and governments at various levels should pay high attention to this, strengthen leadership, carefully organize forces, and conscientiously implement the reform plan. I believe that our region will certainly achieve hoped for results in the "reform of the three systems" according to the party Central Committee's requirements. [passage omitted] Responsible persons of the Ministry of Personnel attended the conference. Present at the conference were responsible persons of the regional-level organs, departments, commissions, general offices, bureaus, and mass organizations. Also attending the conference were responsible persons of various league and city party committees, administrative offices, governments, and departments concerned.
