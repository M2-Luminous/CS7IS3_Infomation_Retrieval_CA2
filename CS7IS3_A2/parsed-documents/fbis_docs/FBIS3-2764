In a statement to mark the 35th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising in 1959 the Dalai Lama said: "I must now recognise that my approach has failed to produce any progress either for substantive negotiations or in contributing to the overall improvement of the situation in Tibet. Moreover, I am conscious of the fact that a growing number of Tibetans, both inside as well as outside Tibet, have been disheartened by my conciliatory stand not to demand complete independence for Tibet. Because of my statement, some Tibetans have come to believe there is no hope at all for the Tibetan people regaining their basic rights and freedoms. This, and the lack of any concrete results from my conciliatory approach towards the Chinese Government over the past 14 years, has caused disillusionment and underminded the resolve of some Tibetans." The Dalai Lama said that in his negotiations with China to try and "restore freedom, peace, and dignity" to Tibet he had always sought to be guided by "realism, patience, and vision." "For the past 14 years, I have not only declared my willingness to enter into negotiations but have also made maximum concessions in a series of initiatives and proposals which clearly lie within the framework for negotiations as stated by Deng Xiaoping in 1979 that `except for independence of Tibet, all other questions can be negotiated.' The ideas put forward in my Five Point Peace Plan for Tibet in 1987 and the Strasbourg Proposal in 1988 envisage a solution which does not ask for the complete independence of Tibet." On both occasions the Chinese government refused to enter into negotiations with the Dalai Lama. "The issue," he said, "is not my return to Tibet but the survival of Tibet's six million people, its culture and civilization. I have made it clear that the negotiations must centre around ways to end China's population transfer policy, which threatens the very survival of the Tibetan people, respect for Tibetan's fundamental human rights and entitlement to democratic freedom, the de-militarisation and de-nuclearisation of Tibet, the restoration of the Tibetan people's control over matters affecting their own affairs, and the protection of Tibet's natural environment. "I have always emphasised that any negotiation must comprise the whole of Tibet, not just the area which China calls the 'Tibet Autonomous Region.'" Many exiled Tibetans have been critical of the Dalai Lama's moderate stance over the years and what many have considered his appeasement of China. Tibet was incorporated into the People's Republic of China in 1950. Nine years later the Dalai Lama and up to 60,000 of his followers fled into exile in India after a bloody revolt against Chinese rule. The Dalai Lama has maintained that since China's "occupation" of Tibet 1.2 million people have died. Others have described China's rule over Tibet as tantamount to cultural genocide. "I had hoped that my middle-way approach would eventually create an atmosphere of mutual trust, conducive to fruitful negotiations, and exert a restraining influence on the repressive Chinese policies in Tibet," he said. "But the Chinese Government has rejected my overtures one after another and has consistently attempted to confuse the real issue. Meanwhile, the magnitude and gravity of the situation inside Tibet has dramatically escalated. "Developments in Tibet have been marked by an intensification of the Chinese policy of suppression, the marginalisation of the Tibetan people in their own country, the gradual extermination of our unique culture and religion, and the destruction and exploitation of Tibet's environment," he said. The Dalai Lama's initiatives for Tibet have been largely endorsed by the international community. China, however, maintains that Tibet is an integral part of the PRC. "I have left no stone unturned in my attempts to reach an understanding with the Chinese," he said. The Dalai Lama said he would "remain committed to finding a peaceful and negotiated resolution to the issue of Tibet." He called for increased international political and economic pressure on China to "resolve the problem of Tibet peacefully and amicably".
