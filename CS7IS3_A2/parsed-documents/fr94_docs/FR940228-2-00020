FR940228-2-00020 FR940228-2-00005 The Department's position is that, absent the rare case in which there is no narrative description of the subject merchandise, any TSUS or HTS numbers mentioned in the scope of an order are for reference only, and do not limit the scope in any way. The Department's position in this respect is supported by the fact that the scope description for each of the administrative reviews has contained a statement to the effect that the Customs classification numbers are provided for reference purposes only. However, the language used in the order to describe the products is ambiguous with respect to forgings, since forgings are not mentioned and there is no explicit indication of what products are included as unfinished parts. Moreover, while Koyo stated in its review responses that it did not report forgings, it is not apparent from these statements the form the imports took. As was described earlier, the term ``forgings'' covers a wide range of products. The question this scope inquiry poses for the Department is whether the instant forgings are advanced to the point that the Department considers them TRB parts. The ITC's Determination The International Trade Commission's (ITC) questionnaires in the investigation defined unfinished parts as ``*␣*␣* those that have been shaped sufficiently that they may be used only in the manufacture of tapered roller bearings.'' (p. 5). Likewise, the ITC considered whether to treat unfinished parts as separate like products in its final determination. It rejected Koyo's request to consider each of the following groups as discrete like products: 1. ``Precursor materials'' (i.e., unfinished forged rings) and ``finished bulk parts'' (i.e., rollers and cages) of tapered roller bearings; 2. Unfinished tapered roller bearing components (i.e._unfinished outer rings and inner rings); 3. Finished tapered roller bearings. (Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, and Certain Housings Incorporating Tapered Rollers, from Japan, Inv. No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;343 (Final), USITC Pub 2020, September 1987, p. 5). The ITC reasoned that all parts are destined to become complete, finished TRBs and that neither finished nor unfinished parts have commercial value except as components of TRBs. To the extent that the ITC considered the items in this list a single like product, this statement suggests that the ITC considered forged rings to be unfinished parts. The ITC also states in its final determination that: Unfinished bearing components are the cones, cups, and rollers that have been green machined and heat treated, but that require final finishing *␣*␣* Green machining is an industry term that relates to the machining operations performed on the raw materials prior to heat treatment for cups, cones, and rollers. (p. A&hyph;8) However, Timken points out that the ITC was discussing cups and cones made from tubing rather than forgings, and argues that the ITC's view that green machining is the first stage in the production process applies only to tubing. Timken claims that, in the bar-based manufacturing process Koyo uses, the first step in production is forging. This is consistent with an ITC footnote (p. A&hyph;8) that the forging process is used instead of green machining, indicating that at least some of the green machining necessary on rings cut from tube steel is not necessary on forgings. Although the ITC considered green machining to be the turning point in Timken's tube-based production process, the distinction is blurred when forgings are used. Since forging can accomplish some of the same results as green machining, the ITC's description of the production process does not necessarily imply that forged rings are outside the scope of the order. Diversified Products Analysis While stages of production can be helpful in determining when raw material becomes an unfinished part, the descriptions of the merchandise in the petition and the Department's determinations are ambiguous with respect to the question of whether these forgings are unfinished parts. The ITC's final determination, though not perfectly clear, points toward the conclusion that forgings are within the scope of the order. However, because there is some ambiguity, the Department considered it appropriate to analyze the Diversified Products criteria. The four additional criteria the Department considered in determining if forgings are within the order are listed at 19 CFR 353.29(i)(2): (1) the physical characteristics of the product; (2) the expectations of the ultimate purchasers; (3) the ultimate use of the product; and (4) the channels of trade.
