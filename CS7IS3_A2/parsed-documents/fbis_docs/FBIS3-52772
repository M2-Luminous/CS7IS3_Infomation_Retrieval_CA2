Among the victims of this policy have been even the Muslim countries. Afghanistan is one of them. Pak-supported religious fundamentalists did not allow any government to survive in that country. The victory of these fundamentalist forces there has brought about a never ending nightmare for the innocent Afghan population. The Afghan president twice protested against Pakistan's support to fundamentalist forces led by Hekmatyar Khan. But these protests have been replied with only economic aid. Egypt is another country which openly accused Pakistan of supporting those elements who wanted to destabilize the present government there. During his visit to Washington early last year, President Husni Mubarak had told President Clinton of the threat his government faced from fundamentalists trained in terrorist activities in Pakistan. The USA at that time was supposed to be keeping Pakistan under watch. It is not known what assurance Mr. Clinton gave to Mr. Mubarak. What we know, that after some months Pakistan was removed from the list of terrorism supporting countries. We also know that after the prime minister of Egypt, 'Atif Sidqi, escaped an attempt on his life last November made by a person who keeps on visiting Pakistan and Afghanistan. The name of this person is Mohammad (Makavi) who confessed to the FRONTIER POST of Peshawar last month that he was behind the attack on Mr. Sidqi's life. (Makavi) confessed that he has been fully involved in the war in Afghanistan and that he is a supporter of Hekmatyar Khan and opponent of President Borhanoddin Rabbani. His confession is vital, inasmuch as it clearly reveals that religious fundamentalists do not keep their activities confined to their own countries. This is something India has started facing in Kashmir. Like Egypt, Algeria, too, is faced with the threat to its stability from Pakistan-trained militants. The Algerian prime minister, Redha Malek, recently told newsmen that anti-government Algerians were getting training in Afghan-Arab camps in Pakistan. They were receiving money from external sources and that money was used for buying weapons in Western countries to be transported to Algeria for terrorist activities. Mr. Mubarak [name as heard] condemned both Pakistan and Sudan for their support to these elements and pleaded with Western countries not to allow these elements to use their soil for anti-Algeria activities. What some Muslim countries are facing at the hands of Pakistan today has been the experience of India. And what is happening in Kashmir is terrorism and human rights violation at the hands of these foreign- trained elements.
