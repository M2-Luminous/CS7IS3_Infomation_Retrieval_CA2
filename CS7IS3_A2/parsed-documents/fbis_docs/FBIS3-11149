Absent from the debate were: Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the Nationalist Republican Alliance, Arena, and Jorge Martinez Menendez, presidential candidate for the Unity Movement. This is the second of three scheduled presidential debates organized by Canal Doce Television in the 1994 Salvadoran presidential campaign and moderated by Mauricio Funes. Based on a drawing, Chavez is the first to speak. When asked what he would do to solve the problem of crime and provide public security in El Salvador, Chavez says he has a five-point plan to fight this problem. "We would first take security measures to protect citizens, and secondly, we would take judicial, corrective, and preventive measures. Finally, we would take measures to compensate victims. As for the police measures or measures to ensure the protection of citizens, a very important aspect is the rescheduling of the peace agreements in this area, which is so important for the peace agreements. I would not like to list the other measures for reasons of time and because I do not want to tire the television viewer," he says. Chavez adds: "We have to increase the number of policemen as a deterrent. Police presence is important especially if it is strategically distributed among the population. We have been pointing out since 1991, that there is a need to deploy 10,000 policemen at this time. We currently have nearly 6,000 civilian policemen, who graduated from the Public Security Academy." Chavez ends by saying: "We have the problem of private services to deal with, we have to fight impunity and corruption, and we need resources to satisfy our financial needs." The next candidate to answer the same question is Rodriguez. He says: "We believe the National Civilian Police, PNC, in view of the urgent need to implement the peace agreement, has been poorly trained. We believe the length of training was too short. A good policeman needs approximately two years to be well trained and he needs to be in a constant retraining stage to have a better awareness of the laws, procedures, investigative techniques, and human rights. We also believe that since the deadline is rapidly approaching, the National Police must hand over to the PNC all its equipment, weapons, transportation and communications equipment, and all other logistics supplies so as to immediately strengthen the PNC with the resources already in the country without the need to incur greater debts." Presidential candidate Zamora, when explaining the steps he would take to fight crime, says: "We must end the impunity given to organized crime by the government in our country and we must also draft judicial reforms." "We must support the deployment and development of the PNC. Those are the three major points of our public security policy." Zamora says that during the first six months of his government, the following measures would be taken: "We are going to completely review all the irregularities in the fulfillment of the peace agreements regarding the PNC. The UN Observers for El Salvador [Onusal] sent a letter to the UN secretary general pointing out all the ways in which this government has failed to comply with the real purpose of the PNC. Secondly, we also have to deploy the PNC before September. The Police Academy says it should be ready by September. We also have to completely reorganize the Interior and Public Security Ministry because starting in July, the PNC will be under the control of the Interior Ministry." Zamora also lists his three great national campaigns. "Our first campaign is against organized crime. Starting on 1 June and running through 31 December we have to take exemplary measures so that organized crime understands that if it violates the law, it will pay for it in our government. Our second campaign is the national disarmament campaign to collect all weapons of war in private hands and to register weapons. Remember that a law was passed in January to register all weapons in private hands within a 90-day period. This government has done nothing. An office to receive permit requests has not even been set up. We will have to extend the 90- day grace period and do it right so that our Armed Forces can really conduct this campaign promptly. The third campaign is the national campaign to clean up public administration. We are going to fight government corruption and contraband beginning on our first day in office." Dr. Rhina Escalante de Rey Prendes, the only woman candidate running for the Salvadoran Presidency, says she disagrees with the dissolution of the security corps and that "the logical thing would have been a gradual purge of the Treasury Police and the National Guard." She adds that if she wins the election she will review the peace agreements and propose to the United Nations that "as long as we do not have a well-equipped PNC with enough members, the present National Police should continue to operate, forgetting about this year's October deadline." She adds that "with an efficient police force and good cooperation from citizens, we should be able to improve justice administration to provide better guarantees to witnesses and accelerate the proceedings to prevent bureaucracy from discouraging citizens wishing to cooperate." Finally, Roberto Escobar Garcia agrees with Rey Prendes and says that "the sudden dissolution of the public security corps, the National Guard, and the Treasury Police left a terrible void in the country that has not been filled." He says that the PNC should be trained to prevent crime rather than repress it and that it must be turned into an auxiliary body within the administration of justice. Moderator Mauricio Funes then asks if the candidates think the National Police can operate without the security corps and if the current system should be kept. Chavez answers by saying that despite the flaws the peace agreements should be observed. "In this regard, the Armed Forces can help by conducting air patrols. We must evidently extend the disarmament law," Chavez says. As for transferring resources from the National Police to the PNC, Rodriguez Eigenhart says: "Foreign assistance to strengthen the PNC could be sought, but a greater budget for the PNC can be allocated in the national budget. Every time we talk about problems we only think about asking for foreign aid. Why not think about curtailing public expenditures so that we do not have to depend on what may or may not come from abroad?" When asked about the lack of security in the streets because of the absence of the security corps, presidential candidate Escobar Garcia says: "We have to create a strong link between the PNC and the Attorney General's Office. The former can prevent crimes from being committed, and the latter can conduct technical investigations after crimes have been committed." The National Police has to be strengthened as much as possible even though the foreign assistance that has been promised has not arrived yet, Escobar Garcia says. Chavez Mena talks about the importance of making deep judicial, constitutional, and criminal code reforms. "We have to classify the different types of criminals. We have to implement new punishment alternatives and insist on solving the impunity problem." He insists that the fundamental responsibility for any of the mistakes that may have been committed in the peace agreements lies with Arena's lack of responsibility. Finally, the candidates discuss problems of contraband, corruption, and the breakdown of moral values in the country.
