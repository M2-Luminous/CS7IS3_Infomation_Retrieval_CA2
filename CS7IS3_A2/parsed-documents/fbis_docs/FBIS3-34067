The second dialogue was held in January 1994 almost exactly a year after the first one. As in the first dialogue, for the second dialogue too the U.S. Institute of Peace brought together for three days some 15 unofficial people from India and Pakistan among whom there were four Kashmiris from the two parts of the State. The framework of the January 1993 dialogue was open-ended. It gave the impression that the U.S. was probing, if not promoting, the possibilities of an independent Kashmir, its security and autonomy jointly guaranteed by India and Pakistan. This impression was fortified in the subcontinent by the diplomacy of Ms. Robin Raphel, assistant secretary of State for South Asia, who added an edge to the conflict with her statement that the "entire State of Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory" and the accession of the State to India in 1948 did not change that position. The "concept paper" drawn up by the USIP for the January 1994 dialogue did reiterate that the "final disposition" of the territory of the State was still in dispute; however, it also made it clear that a resolution of the conflict in Kashmir could be attempted only within the existing political framework of the subcontinent. This important premise lent an air of reality to the discussions and promoted joint quests for ways out of the expensive bloody insurgency that has been savaging the Kashmir Valley since December 1989. The USIP framework paper made several other points that were both realistic and constructive. First, the conflict could be resolved only "over time" and "step by step" through a peace process that was still to be introduced. Secondly, the gradual, incremental peace process must start with a significant reduction in the volume of violence. Several measures were needed for this constructive opening of a peace process, and these had to be taken both by the governments in Delhi and Islamabad and the Kashmiri militants. The USIP document suggested that the militants take the first step with a unilateral ceasefire and that the Indian government respond to it with a strong and generous reciprocity in the form of releasing political prisoners, a thinning out of security forces, gradually handing over the charge of maintaining law and order to the State police and stopping all custodial deaths. In between these measures by the two sides to the conflict in the Indian part of the State, Pakistan stops all material aid to the militants. Violence must be ended as quickly as possible without weakening the security of the State. The participants agreed that the Kashmir issue had undergone a "significant" change with the outbreak of insurgency and Pakistan's involvement in it. The issue is no longer of exclusive domain of India and Pakistan or India and the people of the Kashmir Valley. In the new situation, "it is essential that the people of Kashmir are central actors" in a political process of conflict resolution "along with the governments and citizens of India and Pakistan". Implied in the foregoing sentence is recognition of three elements that make the Kashmir issue significantly different today from what it had been in the past. The conference document recognised that the Kashmiri people cannot be a single actor, because of the ethnic plurality of the population and its political division of the last four decades. There was also recognition of the fact that the conflict in Kashmir had to be resolved at several levels, each interacting with the other. This makes the peace process extremely difficult to build, and an eventual solution more complex than in the past. The two channels of dialogues as a prelude to negotiations link the governments of India and Pakistan on the one hand and the Indian government and the militants of the Valley on the other. In view of the emotional overloading of the Kashmir issue in both Pakistan and India, which makes it difficult for political leaderships to take initiatives that could run counter to widely held popular positions, unofficials have a role to play in bridging the gaps between the two governments. There are several channels of unofficial dialogues between Pakistan and India but none whatsoever between Indians and the militants of the Kashmir Valley. This is particularly unfortunate. To be sure, individual Indians outside the government, especially those working in the field of human rights and civil liberties, travel to Srinagar and meet with militant leaders or cadres individually or in small groups. What does not happen is an open-ended dialogue between Indian who can influence government policies and leaders of representatives of the militants. The USIP provides an opportunity once a year for several Indians to meet with a couple or so of Kashmiris who are in contact with the militants and can speak their minds with a certain credibility. The USIP conference also provides Indians with an opportunity to meet a couple of persons from Pakistan held Kashmir, and Pakistanis to converse with Kashmiris from the Indian part of the State. However, two meetings are nearly not enough to bind the participants in silken bonds of trust and confidence so that they can speak with openness and candour and do not have to repeat the "national" scripts. Especially when the participants change from one conference to the next. Only three of the Indians who joined the 1994 dialogue had attended the dialogue of the previous January. It was the same with participants from Pakistan. But why must Indians depend on an American institution to come face to face with spokesmen of the militants in their own part of the State of Jammu and Kashmir which they regard as an integral part of their country? Indian academic and other bodies must be able to bring together for a free exchange of views numbers [as published] of unofficial Indians and representatives of militants in Kashmir. If the militant bodies are in no mood to come to Delhi, a dialogue can be organised in Kathmandu. India and Pakistan cannot isolate themselves from the impact of the end of apartheid in South Africa, the Middle East peace process, the Anglo-Irish accord to resolve the 200 year-old conflict over Northern Ireland. Ms. Benazir Bhutto could not persuade the leaders of China to support the Kashmiri people's right to self- determination. India may be able to "live with" resolutions adopted at the UN or elsewhere criticising its human rights record in Kashmir. How long can it be indifferent to the status damage it suffers as a result of the continuing bloodletting in Kashmir? How long will it take the rulers of India to realise how the Kashmir conflict is gradually militarising Indian polity and undermining Indian democracy? The full-scale civil war in Afghanistan cautions external powers like the United States against the breakdown of political systems anywhere in South and Central Asia. Some militant groups in Kashmir talk openly about the establishment of a Caliphate spawning Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kashmir and the Islamic republics of Central Asia. This Caliphate concept is nourished by some of the fundamentalist groups fighting amongst themselves in Afghanistan. At the Washington meeting on Kashmir, the danger of reducing the State of Jammu and Kashmir to another Afghanistan was brought to the notice of all participants. This danger appears to be one of the factors that have prompted the USIP to suggest a resolution of the Kashmir conflict within the prevailing political framework in South Asia. India has a window of opportunity to bring the conflict under control and then translate it into a peace process. For this a number of unilateral initiatives on the part of the prime minister should be extremely effective. A short ceasefire will not cost India a tuppence but may gain it a lot. The release of several hundred political prisoners will be another similar gesture of peace. An envoy of the prime minister could then conduct confidential negotiations with the All Parties Huriyat Conference. To encourage a dialogue, the Kashmir police could be given greater law and order responsibility in areas where it can function effectively. At another, simultaneous level the talks with the Pakistan government need to be pursued with increasing seriousness of purpose. The aim should be to conclude a basket of accords easing the much-flawed relationship towards normalisation.
