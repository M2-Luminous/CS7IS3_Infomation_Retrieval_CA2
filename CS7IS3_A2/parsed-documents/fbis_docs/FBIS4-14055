He noted that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher might convey to Jordan's Monarch King Husayn such a U.S. position during their meeting in London today. At a news conference, al-Majali said that Washington is serious about reaching a solution to this issue, and that the United States has accepted Jordan's proposal to deploy observers from Lloyds Register at the Port of al-'Aqabah instead of inspecting ships at sea. However, he said that if the present situation continues, Jordan will adhere to its stand of suspending its participation in the peace talks. He noted that Syria supports the Jordanian stand on the siege on al-'Aqabah, and that a Syrian-Jordanian meeting will be held before the resumption of bilateral talks with Israel, which are scheduled to begin in early May.
