Any other reservation that the authorized officer determines appropriate to ensure public access and proper management of Federal lands and interest therein.

Upon publication of this notice in the Federal Register, the lands will be segregated from all forms of appropriation under the public laws, including the general mining laws, except for conveyance under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act and leasing under the mineral leasing laws. For a period of 45 days from the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register, interested persons may submit comments regarding the proposed conveyance or classification of lands to the District Manager, Bureau of Land Management, 435 Montano NE, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87107.

Comments on the classification are restricted to whether the land is physically suited for the proposal, whether the use will maximize the future use or uses of the land, whether the use is consistent with local planning and zoning, or if the use is consistent with State and Federal programs. APPLICATION COMMENTS: Interested parties may submit comments regarding the specific use proposed in the application and plan of development, whether the BLM followed proper administrative procedures in reaching the decision, or any other factor not directly related to the suitability of the land for cemetaries.
