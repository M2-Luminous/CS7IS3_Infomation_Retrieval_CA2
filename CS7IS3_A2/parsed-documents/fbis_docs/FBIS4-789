He had the clearest view of where the country is going and demonstrated he has the experience to get us there. He gave a performance which was decisive, showed his mastery of the facts, and was compelling in setting out the transformation that has taken place in the new national party. By contrast Mr Mandela, was generalised and sometimes vague. He dwelt too much on the past, and had very little to offer when it came to the hard questions about the economy. He was also more intent on scoring cheap debating points than addressing the real issues. It was alarming to see his finger-wagging style when he ran out of arguments. This election is about the future not the past. Clearly President de Klerk and the new National Party are the ones to lead us there.
