Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana today told journalists that there are "less trade barriers" following the agreements reached during the Uruguay Round. "Just as the political walls have fallen, the economic and trade walls are now falling," the Spanish foreign minister said before the opening ceremony of the fourth annual ministerial meeting of the EU and the Rio Group, the principal Latin American forum for concerted action. The meeting, which is taking place at the Latin American Parliament (Parlatino) headquarters, will end tomorrow with the signature of a 10-page declaration in which the discussion will be evaluated and the bases for a future inter-regional relation will be established. The Rio Group has expressed concern and rejection over the possible environmental, social, and political conditioning by the EU of Latin American exports. The Europeans and Latin Americans who agree that the dialogue between the two should be upgraded have asserted that mechanisms to solve future trade conflicts may be found in the recent GATT resolutions. Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio has told EFE that "an alarm must be set off" in face of the possible establishment of new trade obstacles. She nonetheless admitted that arbitration and problem-resolving instruments are envisaged by the GATT. Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said: "The GATT rules eliminate these fears since they create a trade order to counter protectionist practices." Regarding the attempted inclusion of a "social clause" on trade flow, Spanish Foreign Minister Solana expressed his wish that Europeans and Latin Americans reach "a joint position" within the organization that will soon replace the GATT, that is, the World Trade Organization. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim opened the meeting in Sao Paulo today. He said that despite some disagreements, the Rio Group is aware of the permanent goodwill of the EU to intensify the general system of international trade. The current circumstances, Amorim said, offer new opportunities to renew relations, adding: "We observe the temptation to adopt an hegemonic attitude, which is natural following the disappearance of the bipolarity" that prevailed in the past. Theodoros Pangalos, the alternate foreign minister of Greece and EU acting president, and European Commission Vice President Manuel Marin then spoke. Marin said that although Latin America has attained economic growth, financial balance, and the consolidation of its democratic institutions "it still has a pending subject: the accumulated social debt as a consequence of the economic adjustment processes." Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa defended a greater access of Latin American exports to the EU market and rejected any trade conditioning. He added that the increase of European exports to Latin America -- which amounted to 23 billion ECU's in 1993 -- contrast with the sharp decline of imports -- 22 billion ECU's -- when the trade balance was negative by 10 billion ECU's in 1990. The foreign ministers and delegates who participated in the first of the two work sessions today agreed on the need for a "quality improvement step" in the dialogue between Europe and Latin America.
