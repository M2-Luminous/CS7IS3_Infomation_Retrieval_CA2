At the present time, new relations have been established between Russia and China, they have acquired the nature of normal cooperation without the need for any kind of "further steering together" of the partners. This was stated by Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Federation minister of foreign affairs, replying to questions put by the ITAR-TASS correspondent on board the aircraft. The Russian minister returned to Moscow last night after an official visit to China. The minister pointed out the specific spheres of Russian-Chinese bilateral ties, in particular the development of cross-border relations, military-technical, and economic cooperation. At the same time he noted the "extensive field of unused possibilities" that also exists here. The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that possibilities exist for "harmonizing" the interests of two great powers, Russia and China, both on a regional as well as on a world level. Speaking of the prospects for a democratic movement in Russia, Andrey Kozyrev said that he does not think the resignation of Yegor Gaydar was a "necessity." He reported that he was very doubtful about this issue, something which he told Yegor Gaydar in a conversation. "I respect his personal motives, but from the point of view of the correlation of forces following the elections in Russia and the prospects for a democratic movement, I do not think that it was necessary to take such a step, he should have tried to work in the government and to defend his point of view," Andrey Kozyrev said. In his opinion, what was needed was to promote the strengthening of the democrats' position, especially after their relative defeat at the elections. The minister stressed that the President of Russia is at the present time a uniting force, a guarantor of the reformist transformations, during the implementation of which there are bound to be temporary lapses. Nevertheless, Andrey Kozyrev stressed that the deed had been done and he thinks that this development of events will somehow act as an incentive for the democrats to regroup somewhat.
