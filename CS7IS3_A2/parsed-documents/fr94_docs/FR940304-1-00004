ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) proposes to amend its post-loan regulations for telephone borrowers to ease borrower reporting requirements and further clarify existing REA policy.

DATES: Comments concerning this proposed rule must be received by REA or bear a postmark or its equivalent no later than May 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to Matthew P. Link, Director, Rural Telephone Bank Management Staff, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Electrification Administration, 14th & Independence Avenue, SW., room 2832&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;1500.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by OMB. Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed rule will not: (1) Preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule; (2) Have any retroactive effect; and (3) Require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification REA has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). The REA telephone program provides loans to REA borrowers at interest rates and terms that are more favorable than those generally available from the private sector. REA borrowers, as a result of obtaining federal financing, receive economic benefits which exceed any direct economic costs associated with complying with REA regulations and requirements. Moreover, this action liberalizes certain contract requirements by changing contract limits and allowing negotiation of fee schedules which further offsets economic costs. Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements In compliance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR part 1320) which implement the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) and section 3504 of that Act, the information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to OMB for approval. Comments concerning these requirements should be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, room 3201, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. National Environmental Policy Act Certification REA has determined that this proposed rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance The program described by this proposed rule is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, Rural Telephone Bank Loans. This catalog is available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9325. Executive Order 12372 This proposed rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation. A notice of Final Rule entitled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA and RTB loans and loan guarantees to governmental and nongovernmental entities from coverage under this Order.
