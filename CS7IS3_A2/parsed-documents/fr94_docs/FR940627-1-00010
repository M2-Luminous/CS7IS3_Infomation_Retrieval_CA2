FR940627-1-00010 FR940627-1-00007 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 73 [GC Docket No. 92&hyph;52; FCC 94&hyph;167] Reexamination of the Policy Statement on Comparative Broadcast Hearings AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule; solicitation of additional comments. SUMMARY: The Commission seeks further comments on its proposal to reexamine the criteria used to select among mutually exclusive applicants for broadcast facilities in light of Bechtel v. FCC , 10 F. 3d 875 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The intended effect of this proposal is to remedy any perceived defects in the existing system, to produce swifter more certain choices among applicants for new broadcast facilities, and to preserve the public interest benefits of making such choices. DATES: Comments must be filed on or before July 22, 1994; reply comments must be filed on or before August 8, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20054. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David S. Senzel, Office of General Counsel (202) 632&hyph;7220. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's second further notice of proposed rulemaking, GC Docket No. 92&hyph;52, adopted on June 13, 1994, and released June 22, 1994. The full text of the further notice of proposed rulemaking is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239), 1919 M Street NW., Washington DC. The complete text may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., Suite 140, 2100 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20037. Summary of Second Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making 1. In this notice, the Commission invites further comments on its proposal to reexamine and revise the criteria used to select among applicants for new broadcast facilities, set forth in Reexamination of the Policy Statement on Comparative Broadcast Hearings 57 FR 14683 (Apr. 22, 1992). 2. Numerous commenters, who responded to the Commission's notice of proposed rulemaking, stated their views as to (1) Whether the existing comparative criteria should be modified or eliminated; (2) whether the new criteria should be adopted; and (3) whether the Commission should adopt a point system with a tie-breaker to decide comparative cases. These comments are currently under consideration. 3. During this consideration, on December 17, 1993, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling that the integration criterion was arbitrary and capricious and therefore invalid. Bechtel v. FCC , 10 F. 3d 875 (D.C. Cir. 1993). In light of the court's decision, the Commission must eliminate integration as a criterion in the comparative evaluation. 4. The Commission believes that this proceeding provides an appropriate means of reassessing the comparative standards in light of Bechgtel. The Commission finds it desirable, in resolving this proceeding, to have comments specifically addressing the impact of Bechtel on the relevant issues for pending and future cases. 5. In particular, the Commission seeks comments on: (1) The nature of the criteria that should be employed in light of Bechtel , and the weight different factors should be given; (2) the procedural ramifications of applying a revised comparative analysis to pending cases; and (3) how any proposed revision of the comparative criteria could be structured to satisfy the kind of concerns expressed in Bechtel. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis An initial regulatory flexibility analysis is set forth at 57 FR 14683, 14684, (Apr. 22, 1992).
