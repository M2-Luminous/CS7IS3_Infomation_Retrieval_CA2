FBIS4-50590 "drchi097_n_94021" FBIS-CHI-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 Economic & Agricultural Supervision of South China Sea Fisheries To Be Strengthened Supervision of South China Sea Fisheries To Be Strengthened HK1905073394 Beijing CHINA DAILY in English 19 May 94 p 1 HK1905073394 Beijing CHINA DAILY English BFN [By Wang Yonghong: "South China Sea Fisheries To Face More Supervision"] [Text] China will increase survey work and strengthen supervision of fisheries in the South China Sea, an agricultural official said yesterday. "It is very important to safeguard the rights of Chinese fishermen in the area and protect the region's rich marine resources," said Zhuo Youzhan of the Ministry of Agriculture, which oversees the fishing industry. The heightened attention on the South China Sea comes after a recent fishery inspection of the Nansha Islands [Spratlys], the first conducted in the area since 1949. The 37 crew members, sent by the Ministry of Agriculture, returned to Guangzhou Port in Guangdong Province on May 10 after a 21-day exploration of 3,398 nautical miles. During the trip, they enforced maritime regulations and compiled a survey of fishery resources and weather patterns, said Zhuo, who is director of the Fishery Bureau. The data will provide information for the protection and future development of local marine resources as well as for the supervision of fishermen in the area, he said. The Nansha Islands, a traditional fishing ground for Chinese fishermen, are rich in eel, red porgy, reeves shad, prawn and other aquatic life. Every year more than 300 fishing boats enter the area from Guangdong and Hainan provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Nationality Autonomous Region. But the lack of proper supervision has led to repeated disputes over fishing territory, Zhuo said, adding that this is a top concern. It is important to develop the rich fisheries with foreign co- operation, he said, adding that China should increase seafood production to meet increasing home market demand and relieve fishing pressure in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea and East China Sea, which have suffered from overfishing in recent years. The population of favorite ocean delicacies such as croakers and hairtails there has sharply declined in recent years. China has ranked first in the world in seafood output since 1990, Zhuo said, and the per-capita consumption of seafood rose to 14.7 kilograms last year from 4.4 kilograms in 1979.
