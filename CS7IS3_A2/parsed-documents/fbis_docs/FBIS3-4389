People across the province have overcome difficulties and promoted overall economic and social development by further emancipating their minds, seeking truth from facts, seizing opportunities, earnestly carrying out reforms, and working in a down-to-earth manner. We have stabilized and strengthened agricultural foundation and promoted rural reform. We have accelerated the change of enterprises' management mechanisms, readjusted the economic structure, improved the construction of infrastructure projects, strived to broaden the scopes and fields of the drive to open to the outside world, and improved the structure and level of export- oriented economy. In light of new problems cropping up during the course of rapid economic development, we have followed the requirements of the central authorities to strengthen and improve macro-economic control. In addition, we have paid attention to the drive of deepening reform and opening wider to the outside world so as to gradually solve outstanding contradictions and problems in our economic life. As a result, Zhejiang has maintained a good momentum in sustained, rapid, and sound economic development. According to initial statistics, Zhejiang's gross provincial product reached 164.5 billion yuan in 1993, an increase of 25 percent over 1992. We have adhered to the principle of attaching equal importance to both spiritual and material civilization construction. We have formulated a provincial program for carrying out spiritual civilization construction. We have actively explored ways to build our party. We have conducted new elections for local people's congresses at provincial, city (prefecture), county, and village (township) levels. We have strengthened the style of thinking and work among our leadership and the construction of grass-roots party units. We are carrying out the current task of the anticorruption struggle in accordance with the plan of the central authorities and have achieved some initial results. The construction of a socialist democratic legal system has been strengthened. We have done a great deal to improve all facets of public security and achieved marked results. Thanks to common efforts made by the broad masses of cadres and people, Zhejiang's political and social situation is stable. Our economy and people's livelihood have been improved. We have achieved new results in all undertakings. On behalf of the Provincial CPC Committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee, provincial government, and provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I would like to extend my sincere thanks and highest respect to the broad masses of cadres, personages of all circles, and PLA personnel, armed police, and public security personnel who have worked hard on all fronts and made contributions to the drive of socialist modernization in our province. Li Zemin said: The year 1994 is crucial for the reform drive and economic development. This is also a year for conscientiously carrying out the goal and various tasks put forward by the Ninth Provincial CPC Congress. Our overall requirements are as follows: We should continue to take Deng Xiaoping's theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic line of the party as our guidance, comprehensively carry out the guiding spirit of the 14th National CPC Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the Ninth Provincial CPC Congress. We should accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy; maintain a good momentum for sustained, rapid, and sound economic development; maintain political stability; and promote overall social progress. In the new year, all our tasks must be subject to and serve the general goal of deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, promoting economic development, and maintaining stability. We should correctly handle the relationship between reform and economic development and stability. We should insist that development is the last word. We should promote economic development by depending on reforms and push forward reforms and economic development in an environment in which the economic, social, and political situations are stable. We should achieve long-term stability by conducting reforms and economic development. We should focus on economic development and switch our efforts to the track of genuinely enhancing economic performance. We should promote structural readjustment, technical progress, business management, and overall economic quality among our enterprises by conducting reform, reorganization, and transformation. Continued efforts should be made to give priority to increasing agricultural production and deepening rural reform so as to promote an overall economic development in rural areas. We should try every possible way to ensure the harvest of grain and other farm produce and to enhance peasants' incomes. We should actively and carefully push forward various reforms in accordance with the requirements of the central authorities, properly handle the relationship between all sectors, strengthen and improve macro- economic control, further change the management mechanisms of enterprises, explore effective ways to establish modern enterprise systems, attach great importance to cultivating and developing the market system, do a good job in promoting supplementary reform in social security, and ensure a fine order for economic operations. More efforts should be made to open wider to the outside world. We should try to increase the total amount and the quality level of export products. We should maintain a good momentum of expanding foreign trade and utilizing foreign funds. We should adhere to the principle of paying attention to spiritual and material civilization construction, conscientiously strengthen the building of the party, organize cadres and people to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and arm party members and the great masses of cadres and people across the province with the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics. In light of the guiding spirit of the provincial program for carrying out spiritual civilization construction and the 10th plenary session of the eighth provincial CPC committee, we should carry out spiritual civilization construction in a thoroughgoing manner, correctly handle various social contradictions, improve all facets of public security, strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and the legal system, unswervingly conduct the anticorruption struggle, further improve party work style, build a clean government, and extend every effort to maintain social and political stability. Li Zemin emphatically said: To carry out this year's work well, we should work harder and persist in the party's ideological line, characterized by emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts; in the party's basic work line of doing everything for the people; performing all tasks by relying on the people; and coming from the masses and going to the masses; and in the integration of the ideological line and the mass line of the party. In our practical work, we should listen to the opinions expressed by the people, try to understand their feelings, care about the problems of the people, truly solve the problems that have direct bearing on the interests of the people, show respect for the wishes of the people and their pioneering spirit, and properly guide and protect their initiative so as to give it full play. Only by closely relying on the people can we overcome all difficulties cropping up during the course of our progress and continuously push forward the undertakings of reform and national construction.
