"Slovakia ranks among the largest arms producers in the world and we have tanks, artillery, missiles and ammunition," he told a press conference. Meciar stopped over in Bangkok for about twelve hours as a guest of the Thai government to discuss bilateral relations. He had spent five days in China discussing trade. This is the first visit to Asia by a Slovakian prime minister since the republic officially seperated from Czechoslovakia in January 1993. According to Meciar, Slovakia's international trade volume has grown considerably. He said he was interested in signing two agreements with Thailand -- to avoid double taxation and to protect investments. "We welcome Thai investors," he said. Slovakia exports steel and chemicals and is in need of consumer products like canned food, he said. Opportunities also exist for foreign investors in the hotel and tourism sectors.
