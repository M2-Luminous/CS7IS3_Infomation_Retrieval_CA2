FR940606-2-00080 FR940606-2-00057 [Release No. 34&hyph;34126; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;47] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to Temporary Suspensions of Trading in Options May 27, 1994. On October 20, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to provide limited authority to Post Directors, Order Book Officials (``OBOs''), and under certain circumstances, Designated Primary Market-Makers (``DPMs''), to suspend trading in a class of options for a limited period of time. Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on November 9, 1993. 3 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. On April 11, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 4 This order approves the Exchange's proposal, as amended. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33131 (November 2, 1993), 58 FR 59500 (November 9, 1993). 4 Amendment No. 1: (1) Clarifies that only one five minute suspension of trading is authorized pursuant to the proposal; (2) defines who is a ``Post Director;'' and (3) deletes the DPM as one of the persons authorized to impose a temporary suspension of trading. See Letter from Michael L. Meyer, Schiff Hardin & Waite, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Office of Derivatives and Equity Oversight, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated April 8, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 6.3 (``Trading Halts'') to authorize, with respect to a particular class of options, the Post Director 5 or OBO to suspend trading in the options class for a period of time not to exceed five minutes whenever trading in the underlying security is halted. This limited authority may be exercised only if the trading halt in the underlying security is evidenced by an ``ST'' symbol (for an exchange-listed security) or an ``H'' (for a National Market security traded through the NASDAQ system) appearing on the class display screen that displays current market information for the underlying security, or if such trading halt is otherwise verified by the senior person in charge of the Exchange's Control Room. The proposed rule change applies only in the circumstance where there has been a trading halt in an underlying security, and has no application to ``circuit breaker'' trading halts under Rule 6.3A. 5 A Post Director is an Exchange employee at a trading post whose function is to assist the OBO and the DPM at each station at the post. Id. Concurrently with any suspension of trading pursuant to the proposed rule change, the responsible Post Director or OBO shall turn off the Retail Automatic Execution System applicable to the affected options class or classes. Additionally, the Post Director or OBO shall disseminate the designation 998&hyph;999 on the Exchange's quote reporting system, which indicates the option is not trading on the CBOE. Prior to the expiration of any temporary suspension imposed pursuant to the proposed rule change, the responsible Post Director or OBO is required to notify two Floor Officials in order to obtain a determination by them whether a trading halt in the effected options class should be declared under Rule 6.3(a). If the two Floor Officials determine not to halt trading, immediately following such determination it shall be announced to the crowd and trading (or a rotation in the option) shall in no event resume more than five minutes after the temporary suspension of trading was implemented. The Post Director or OBO may only invoke a single five minute suspension of trading pursuant to the proposed rule change. 6 6 Id. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5), 7 in that it is designed to protect the mechanism of a free and open market and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission finds that the proposal will protect investors and the public interest by enabling Post Directors and OBOs to temporarily suspend options trading promptly in response to verified trading halts in underlying securities. Pursuant to the current version of Rule 6.3(a), Floor Officials have the authority to halt trading in any options class for a period not in excess of two consecutive business days if trading in the underlying security has been halted in the primary market. The proposed rule change, therefore, merely bridges the gap that currently exists between the time that trading in an underlying security is halted and the time it takes for the Floor Officials to impose a trading halt in the related options class pursuant to their authority under Rule 6.3(a). Additionally, a temporary trading suspension pursuant to the proposed rule change can only be invoked once during a single occurrence of a halt in trading in the underlying security. If two Floor Officials determine not to institute a trading halt pursuant to Rule 6.3(a), or if a decision is not made by two Floor Officials within the five minute period, trading in the options class will immediately resume and will continue unless two Floor Officials subsequently independently decide to invoke a trading halt pursuant to Rule 6.3(a). Accordingly, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change protects investors and the public interest by providing a means for an immediate trading halt in those circumstances where Floor Officials would be likely to impose a trading halt pursuant to Rule 6.3(a). Moreover, because the conditions under which the five minute halt can be invoked are specific and objective, the Commission does not expect that the rule change will increase the likelihood of abuse in the implementation of trading halts. 7 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988).
