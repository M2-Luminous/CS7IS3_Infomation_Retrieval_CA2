Turning to the developments in Gorazde, the daily said that the aggression took place in the very presence of U.N. Forces who were stationed in the town as protectors of peace and security but did nothing to prevent the Serbs. It lashed out at the U.N. for not condemning the Serbs for their explicit breach of its approvals and stressed that such an indifferent attitude further emboldened the Serbs to continue their aggression. The criminal Serbs not only did not abide by any war regulations and attacked the defenceless people, but even deployed chemical weapons which are internationally banned, said the paper. It criticized the dual standards shown by the Security Council in connection with crisis in Bosnia and said that while the Council would hastily issue a statement for the death of a Zionist it would fail to show any reaction towards the genocide in Gorazde. The daily stressed that this proved once again that the Security Council has no desire to enforce its approvals or the internationally respected regulations when interests of the oppressed nations are at risk. The daily said that the U.S. statesmen, including President Bill Clinton, did not interfere in the issue because their interests were not involved. It also proved that the new world order, masterminded by the U.S., is nothing but giving a wider dimension to aggression in order to plunder nations and increase Washington's influence. The daily touched on the call by President Alija Izetbegovic for the resignation of U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and said this was the least measure expected in return for the procrastination the world body. The proper measure, said the article, is that the United Nations be dissolved since it is a tool in the hands of tyrant and oppressive powers who are supporting the criminals. The reality is that the oppressed nations have no way but to turn their back to the present international gatherings and try to establish a centre that would serve as a real forum for demonstrating the will of the nations, the daily noted. The takeover of Gorazde is the cry of death of the United Nations, it concluded.
