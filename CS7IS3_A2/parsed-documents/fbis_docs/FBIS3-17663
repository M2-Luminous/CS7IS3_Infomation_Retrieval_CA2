Belarusian Parliament Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb did not rule out the possibility that the request may be granted in the near future. This will allow belarus to attend the second conference of the Inter-parliamentary Union to be held in September as a full member. The announcement was made at a news conference in Minsk on Monday. Hryb spoke about the participation of a CIS Inter-parliamentary Assembly delegation in the first conference of the Inter-parliamentary Union in Paris. He noted that full membership of this organisation is very important for Belarus from the political point of view because it will enable it to draw the attention of the international community to its needs and problems, including the cleaning up of the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. Asked if he had discussed in Paris with Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Federation Council of Russia's Federal Assembly, the integration of the monetary systems of the two countries, Hryb replied in the negative. He noted that these matters are the prerogative of the executive bodies of power -- the governments of Russia and Belarus. Hryb voiced concern about the present situation which has paralysed industry and trade. "Further delays in this issue will do no good to either side. If it cannot be done this way, we must work out a new bilateral agreement -- a comprehensive treaty between the two states," Hryb said. He stressed that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has already made up its mind -- it has set up a commission led by First Deputy Parliament Chairman Vyacheslav Kuznetsov to work out such an agreement.
