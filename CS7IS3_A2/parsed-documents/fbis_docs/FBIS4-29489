Certain officers were accused of ordering troops to brutally suppress protesters demanding the ouster of non-elected prime minister Suchinda Khraprayun. After Gen Suchinda stepped down in disgrace shortly after the upheaval, several key military members were transferred to inactive posts, including former Army chief Itsaraphong Nunphakdi, ex-Air Force commander Kaset Rotchananin and former First Army Region commander Chainarong Nunphakdi. Many "professional" officers were promoted to key positions, replacing "political" officers. Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon Wongwanit is one of the so-called professional officers, although he's a graduate of the once-powerful Class 5 of the Chunlachomklao Royal Military Academy and a classmate of Gen Suchinda and Gen Itsaraphong. Gen Wimon has on several occasions reiterated his policy of non- interference in politics and has vowed to promote democracy. He clearly sides with the government in dealing with the current political situation precipitated by Chalat Worachat's hunger strike. "A person who fasts must die. If he does not fast he will not die. Being fed with saline solution is not a fast, and (Chalat) will not die," Wimon said recently. He has said the Army belongs to the King and the people. The Army is an agency of the government, so it must perform in line with government policy. In his statement on June 7, he reiterated that the Army would side with the elected government of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. This does not only mean the Army will throw its weight behind the government, but also implies there are still "insidious power seekers" in the Army, and Wimon realizes the fact and thus has to make his stand clear to them. These people want political changes which would be followed by transfers of officers who now hold powerful posts. It has been reported that some "brokenhearted" officers -- those whose careers were affected by the 1992 upheaval -- remain uncomfortable about their future. Many are officers who had close relationships with the old power clique in the Army. It's of little surprise then that these officers have felt uneasy since their bosses were transferred to inactive posts. After being promoted to the Army's top post, Wimon did not sweep clean the Army as expected by observers. That would have been acceptable to Army personnel. If Wimon did purge officers loyal to the old clique, there would have been chaos in the Army. Many officers who hold key combat posts, including commanders of divisions, regiments and battalions, remain loyal to the old clique. In annual transfers under Wimon's command, only a few officers regarded as subordinates retaining loyalty to the old power clique have been transferred to inactive posts. Many have, indeed, even been promoted to important positions. But the annual round of transfers in September will be another story. There are signs that there will be changes among commanders of combat units. Some officers loyal to the old clique have held key positions for too long because they have "immunity". And it's time for them to be transferred to inactive posts. This would break a systematical inheritance of power set up by graduates of Class 5 four years ago. When Suchinda was appointed prime minister, Itsaraphong succeeded him as Army chief. It was clear then that after Itsaraphong retired this year, the post of Army chief would go to Lt Gen Wirot Saengsanit, who will retire in 1996. And after Wirot, the heirs apparent are Chainarong and then Samphao Chusi. Commanders of key combat units were also affected. Chainarong's colleagues from Class 11 were put in control of important combat units. For soldiers, gratitude is an important professional virtue. It is no surprise then that many soldiers are still loyal to the old power clique that once rewarded them with key posts. For soldiers, gratitude is an important professional virtue. It is no surprise then that many soldiers are still loyal to the old power clique that once rewarded them with key posts. But in a recent reshuffle at the level of battalion commanders, which has not yet been publicly announced, there is a sign the best days of officers standing by the old clique are over, according to sources. Earlier this year, sources in an intelligence unit said certain Army officers had tried to approach an opposition party leader, who was tipped to be a strong candidate to become the next prime minister. The sources said they developed a decent relationship with the politician because they were backed by newspaper columnists close to the opposition party leader. During the May crisis, one graduate of Class 5 was not involved in the brutal crackdown on protesters, but his career was nevertheless affected. He was transferred to an inactive post at the Office of the Permanent Secretary of Defence. He was then a favorite candidate to succeed Itsaraphong as Army chief when the latter retires this year. The officer has wondered why he was targeted. His aides who were tipped to succeed him as Army commander were hurt too. The "power line" prepared for them had been cut and their way to the top blocked. The plans for the post of Army chief to go from Suchinda to Itsaraphong, then Chainarong and Samphao, could not be realized. Lt Gen Chainarong is now commandant of the Institute of Army Academics. Although he still has a chance to return to an active post, his path is not smooth. Chainarong's image has been tainted since the May upheaval. He's been accused of being directly involved in the bloodshed by ordering troops to open fire because he was commander of the First Army Region, which oversees the capital. Since the May incident, there have been attempts to regain power by the old power clique, who were suspected to be involved in a spate of violence in the South and elsewhere in the country. Sources in intelligence agencies said the violence was aimed at overthrowing the Chuan administration as soon as possible. This would open the way for them to regain power. The old power clique comprises the people who used to have political power and certain "undisciplined" officers. Certain officers believe that if former deputy Army chief Wirot, who is now deputy defence permanent secretary, comes back to succeed Gen Wimon, who is due to retire in 1995, the arranged power line would be in effect again. Wirot's reputation has not been tainted by the May 1992 events, but he was transferred to an inactive post because certain senior officers wanted to clean the Army of Wirot, a classmate of Suchinda and Itsaraphong. Senior officers also want to sever the line blocking the promotion of other officers. It is justified to promote Wirot to be Army chief succeeding Gen Wimon because of his clean image. Wirot is due to retire in 1996. Such a promotion could be realized only when there are changes in political power. There must be a prime minister and a defence minister who would agree to such a move. Certain powerful columnists are reportedly backing the old power clique, using their columns to justify campaigns to oust the government. Although leaders of the Armed Forces have repeatedly vowed that they would not stage a coup, some groups of people still fear that other officers would turn to the outdated method of power seizure. An opinion poll, conducted by Suan Dusit Teachers' College and publicized in May, showed that a lot of people disagree with military coups. The poll and Wimon's statement on June 7 have been regarded as a tool to stop the "underwater tide". The old power clique can do nothing at the moment because of the people's strong opposition to military coups. They have opted to conduct underground campaigns, recently spreading a rumour that a group of officers had travelled to Hong Kong to discuss the possibility of staging a coup. Officers who are also senators have tried to hurt relationships between the government and permanent officials, and between Chuan and Wimon. They want Chuan to lose confidence in Wimon, and Wimon to have sour relations with the press. But Wimon knows about the plans, and isn't about to fall into the trap.
