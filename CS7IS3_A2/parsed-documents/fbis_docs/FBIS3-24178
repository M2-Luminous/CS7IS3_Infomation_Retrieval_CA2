"We have a wealth of opportunity in Lithuania if we go after it. But the opportunity is opening up right now and it will be much more difficult to enter the market at a later point in time," [Reykjavik] MORGUNBLADID quoted the center's founders as commenting. Icelanders have been fairly diligent at developing the promising Baltic market since they became the first nation to recognize Lithuania's independence in 1991. Health firm Islenska Heilsufelagid is on the cusp of starting up production of pharmaceutical drugs in cooperation with the University of Vilnius, while film studio Mydaver Saga is producing animated films. In addition, Icelanders and Lithuanians have teamed up in a project to breed the Icelandic Horse.
