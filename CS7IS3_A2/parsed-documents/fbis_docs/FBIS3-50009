The Russian position seems to have modified, he said. When Moscow repaid the first half of its debt through the delivery of MiG-29 fighters last year, it was still unwilling to sell anti-aircraft missile systems to Hungary. S-300 is a long-range anti-aircraft missile system with parameters corresponding to those of the U.S. Patriots used in the Gulf War, Toth said. Now it is up to the Hungarian Government and Parliament to decide whether they accept the Russian offer, he said. Should they accept it, it is not yet clear how many systems Hungary would purchase. Nor does the Russian offer mention figures, Toth said. He added that the Hungarian Army was not thinking in terms of missiles but those of systems that include launching pads and other units as well. Reacting to the information carried in THE WASHINGTON POST that the "Visegrad countries (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary) have been allowed to purchase US weapons and military equipment," Toth said he supposed the U.S. had lifted its ban on the sale of "offensive-killing" weapons. This category is rather broad and comprises even guns and tanks, the Hungarian Defence Ministry official said.
