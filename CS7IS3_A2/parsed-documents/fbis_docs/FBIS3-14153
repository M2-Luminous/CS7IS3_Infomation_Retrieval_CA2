The Palestinian delegation is led by Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and the Israeli delegation is led by Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Amnon Shahaq. In a statement to correspondents before the negotiations, Dr. Sha'th said: We came here to avoid another massacre in Hebron. Uri Savir, Israeli Foreign Ministry director general and a member of the Israeli delegation, said: The delegation held extremely good negotiations in Tunis and we are continuing our negotiations in Cairo. Dr. Sha'th said that the Palestinian and Israeli delegations will try to reach agreement on international protection for the Palestinians living under occupation with a view to resuming the negotiations to implement the self-rule agreement in Gaza and Jericho first. These negotiations were suspended after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron on 25 February. Dr. Sha'th expected the Israeli delegation to provide answers to proposals made the day before yesterday in Tunis during the negotiations between the two delegations. He added: The negotiations in Tunis made some progress and we expect to hear what the Israeli delegation has to provide in the way of answers. Dr. Sha'th said: We want a speedy implementation of the UN Security Council resolution on protecting the Palestinians. Diplomatic sources in Cairo said that if an understanding is reached on the protection of the Palestinians in the occupied territory during the session of negotiations tonight, a meeting between Palestinian President 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres could be held during the next 24 hours to pave the way for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. There were reports that 'Arafat and Peres are expected to meet in Paris tomorrow, Thursday.
