"Practically, we created the legislative basis for development of the relations between two states." Aleksandr Chikvaidze denied the reports, some mass media spread, on the fact that there, at the negotiations, were determined the terms of the Russian troops' existence on the territory of Georgia -- 50 years. Aleksandr Chikvaidze said, "no terms were discussed at the negotiations." Speaking on the Russian military bases creation on the territory of Georgia, Mr. Chikvaidze said, "If only Georgia offers her territory for Russian military bases, she should get something in exchange. This question couldn't be solved without referendum, without Parliament's content. Yet some more rounds of negotiations are being expected." The eighth round of negotiations is expected by the end of June.
