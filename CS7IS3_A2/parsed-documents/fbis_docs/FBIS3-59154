If Bossi, who is the League's leader, says that he does not want to talk with us, obviously I acknowledge the fact." Everyone was waiting for him outside PPI [Italian People's Party] headquarters and, before meeting with the nonconfessional socialists of the UDS [Union of Democrats and Socialists] and the PRI's [Italian Republican Party] Giorgio La Malfa, he confronted the wall of journalists. Martinazzoli was sharp and unyielding and gave no glimmer of a hope of an agreement with the League. He issued a warning to Segni [PPI Chairwoman] Jervolino went still further, describing an agreement with the Pact leader as "very, very unlikely," attacked Bossi, and leveled charges at Berlusconi. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Martinazzoli, do you not think that there is some common ground between the PPI and the League? After all, Bossi too wants the next legislature to be a constituent one. [Martinazzoli] I regard it as an afterthought, a last-minute contrivance. To say that a legislature is constituent means absolutely nothing unless you specify in what way it will be constituent. [Correspondent] Do you still regard your dialogue with Segni as open? [Martinazzoli] That depends on Segni. [Correspondent] But is he still your candidate for the premiership? [Martinazzoli] Segni remains our interlocutor. We have granted him this possibility, but obviously Segni is no demiurge that can square the circle. Many have tried to do so, but nobody has succeeded. [Correspondent] Are you not afraid that your party will remain isolated? [Martinazzoli] The only danger would be if the new-born party were to decide to die. [Correspondent] But do you not think that a bipolar arrangement is now an obligatory option, with this electoral system? [Martinazzoli] What must be realized is that electoral rules are not a substitute for politics: They must be interpreted. It is Mr. Occhetto who invented this neurosis about a two-pole system, unfortunately; he is to blame. This restores old alignments, ancient controversies, obsolete arguments -- in other words, a complete mess. [Correspondent] You said that the program signed yesterday is not neutral with regard to political accords. [Martinazzoli] Political programs are not just any pieces of paper; indeed, they relate to the political forces that support them. [Correspondent] Do you mean that [League lower house floor leader] Maroni's signature is not enough and that Bossi's is needed, too? [Martinazzoli] I am not well acquainted with the League's rules. However, I see that Bossi called me a chicken thief. Perhaps that is the language of the new modern liberal democracy. [Correspondent] Will you now seek a political and electoral agreement only with Segni's Pact? [Martinazzoli] We said Saturday [22 January], and repeated yesterday, that we believe that alternation -- or, rather, the conditions for real alternation -- must be built around a polarity that is not a division between extremes. So we will continue our dialogue in the days ahead much more intensely than last week -- but not with vestiges, relics. [Correspondent] Did you expect the agreement between Segni and the League? [Martinazzoli] Frankly, I did not consider the possibility. [Correspondent] Did you expect the League to subscribe to Segni's program? [Martinazzoli] I do not see what the spectacular novelty is.... Throughout these past months I have observed that the League has an extraordinary capacity for change. Be that as it may, the League will be holding a congress shortly. We shall see what they have to say. [Correspondent] Is your rejection of the agreement not a repudiation for [PPI ideologue] Buttiglione, who is pleased about the Segni-Maroni meeting? [Martinazzoli] From his viewpoint, Buttiglione was right to be pleased. I too -- who am less of a philosopher than Buttiglione and therefore use a more direct language -- noted that the League had lost federalism along the way. So this is the reason for his satisfaction.... [Correspondent] The fact remains that Buttiglione was in favor of it, and Mattarella and Bindi against it. [Martinazzoli] Please do not ask me any more what Bindi thinks and what Formigoni thinks, and whether I will succeed in reconciling them. This, partly because if you were at the conference hall Saturday you will have seen who is in charge in this party -- and I say this without arrogance, though it has to be said from time to time. [Correspondent] Will there be another meeting with Segni, who has stated his willingness? [Martinazzoli]I should hope he is willing to meet with me. [Correspondent] Does it not worry you to see the moderate front so divided, compared to the compact progressive front? [Martinazzoli] What worries me is your distorted perception, because the left-wing front is by no means compact. What worries me is the fact that you all portray it as compact, and it rather irritates me. [Correspondent] Do you not think that this is all just a game to involve [Fininvest President] Berlusconi? [Martinazzoli] I do not know. My opinion is that Berlusconi entered the arena a while ago. He has encouraged the departure of some of my supporters, has issued ultimatums such as you would not give even to a waiter..., he has rewriten Italian history by arguing that Sturzo is to blame for having helped fascism. So I think he is fully involved. Perhaps he is something of a demiurge.
