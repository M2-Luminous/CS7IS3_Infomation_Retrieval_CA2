Bosnian Moslem and Croat troops, whose political leaders three months ago signed a U.S.-mediated federation agreement, continued offensive action in numerous areas of the former Yugoslav republic. Around the town of Orasje in the Posavina region of northern Bosnia, joint units of Bosnian Croats and regular Croatian Army troops made sporadic artillery attacks on Serb positions. Soldiers from the regular Croatian Army have been deployed in and around Orasje since the start of the Bosnian civil war in April 1992. The Bosnian Serb forces suffered no losses in the latest attack and did not return fire, Serb military sources in Brcko said early on Thursday. Bosnian Moslem forces opened mortar fire on Teslic, a town in northern Bosnia, wounding six civilians, including two children, Serb military sources said. The Moslems also launched attacks in a wide region around the northern Bosnian town of Doboj and the Borci region between Kalinovik and Konjic in eastern Herzegovina. Heavy Moslem artillery attacks were also reported around Kladanj in eastern Bosnia. Bosnian Serb sources reported that Moslem units opened fire in the Sarajevo region, firing mainly into Sarajevo's Serb residential areas of Ilijas and Hadzici.
