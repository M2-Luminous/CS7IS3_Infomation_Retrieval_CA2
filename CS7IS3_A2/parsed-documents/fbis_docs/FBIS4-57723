He explained that the law recognizes peasant and Indian communities and, by increasing the number of municipalities from 21 to 301 nationwide, "will better cover health, education, and development needs in previously neglected areas." Cardenas stressed the importance of the right to vote under the new Law to elect officials who have the welfare of Indian communities in mind and who are committed to their development. He promised to push through Indian demands in the National Congress and said that he agreed with President Sanchez de Lozada that, without the development of these communities, democracy will remain "crippled." Speaking on behalf of the Indian representatives, Vicente Pessoa, president of the Confederation of Indigenous People of Eastern Bolivia (CIDOB), affirmed his community's support for the Popular Participation Law if it responds to "specific demands" such as effective Indian participation in decisionmaking and management of the country, recognition of grass-roots organizations, and respect for traditional authorities and autonomy. Pessoa also asked that the Indian Law, which would guarantee Indian rights through succeeding administrations, be approved. The vice president responded that many of the concerns and principles of an Indian Law are already included in the Popular Participation Law and the Education Reform Law, soon to be passed in Congress. [Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS 20 Apr] URU INDIAN DEMANDS--Leaders of the Uru nation reject the government's new Popular Participation Law and instead have asked the government to reactivate the Integral Ethno-Developmental Plan launched in 1992 for the Uru, Ouechua, and Aymara communities. This plan aims at granting lands for agricultural use and raising of livestock, needed by these communities to "subsist and live with dignity," according to leader Juan Condori. He stressed his opposition to the government's Popular Participation Law, charging that "it is not true that it will serve the needs of the poorest." On the contrary, he said, this policy will "widen the gap between rich and poor."
