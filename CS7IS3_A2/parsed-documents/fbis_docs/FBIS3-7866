It has 28 seats in parliament, and, if an attempt is made to recall Vladimir Meciar's government, it will play a decisive role. In view of the continuing political crisis in Slovakia, MLADA FRONTA DNES asked SDL Chairman Peter Weiss for an interview. [Wolf] What do you think of the possibility that Prime Minister Meciar's government may be recalled? [Weiss] The reasons for such a step are clear. The prime minister's Cabinet demonstrates day in and day out that it is incapable of governing normally. On the other hand, the status of the possible broad-coalition government or, rather, the issue of whether it would have enough support in parliament is unclear. At the moment, we cannot count on the definite support of some of the deputies from the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), and, what is more significant, the opposition Hungarian Egyutteles movement has not given any clear guarantees that it will not attempt to blackmail the new government by making demands for its ethnic minority. Egyutteles is setting the kind of conditions that even a provisional government could not fulfill in the current situation. We concur in this with Carnogursky's Christian Democratic Movement. [Wolf] What kind of conditions is Egyutteles setting? [Weiss] For example, the adoption of the European Charter on Self-Administrations and the Charter on Minority Rights. I am not claiming that these issues cannot be dealt with later, but Egyutteles has to realize that, in the Slovak environment, which is strongly nationalized, no government can undertake such a thing. These issues must be resolved by the cabinet that will come out of the parliamentary elections. [Wolf] What is the situation at the moment? [Weiss] Negotiations are still taking place, and we have even tried to hold talks with the HZDS. However, Vladimir Meciar has made it clear that he does not want to negotiate. On the contrary, he has initiated a petition on holding a referendum. The aim of it is to expel from parliament those deputies who have left the HZDS and Slovak National Party Clubs. [Wolf] The prime minister has let it be known that he would like elections as soon as possible. Do you really think he wants early elections? [Weiss] I am beginning to think more and more that he does not. His plan is, in my opinion, to get the supporters of Milan Knazko and Ludovit Cernak out of parliament and to get into a situation in which he will again have a majority. Our party, however, is working on a proposal for the Constitutional Court, which has to say whether stripping a deputy of his mandate is possible. In my opinion, this is out of order just as it is out of order for a deputy to be held hostage by his party. As the chairman of the largest opposition party, I know what it is like to have a deputies' club at my disposal, but I would never be able to take a step that would deprive a deputy of his freedom. The question the HZDS wants to ask about mandates in the referendum can be interpreted as follows: If a deputy is expelled from his party, he loses his mandate. This could lead to a situation in which five or six party chairmen hold sway over parliament, and their deputies would be powerless. This kind of situation is absolutely unacceptable.
