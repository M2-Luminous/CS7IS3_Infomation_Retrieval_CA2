The difficulties Bulgaria encounters could be mitigated by improving the legal basis, preserving the real-term pensions and incomes, and improving the public regulating institutions to settle the conflicts between the different social groups, Prime Minister Berov said. This country needs a restrictive financial policy to curb the annual inflation rate, expeditious privatization of the state-owned units, and providing markets, notwithstanding the defence-oriented foreign policy of the European Union, the speaker said. However, the progress is unthinkable without preventive actions aimed against all signs of religious and ethnic hostility, without holding back the flow of immigrants from poorer countries, which pulls the crime rate up and calls for a variety of temporary law-enforcement measures, Prof. Berov went on to say. Political confrontation should be opposed, private traders should be encouraged to turn to production, the private medical practice and introduction of health insurance system with partial payment of medical treatment should also be promoted, and new agricultural laws should be passed to prevent the fragmentation of land, the speaker also said. The transition to a market economy showed that reforms are painful and will take longer than we initially believed, the Bulgarian prime minister said. At the session Prof. Berov met Finland's Prime Minister Esko Aho who showed deep interest in the progress of the economic reforms in Bulgaria. Mr. Aho evaluated in highly positive terms the achievements this country has made so far and the policy the incumbent government is pursuing. The two heads of state discussed the possibilities for establishing active business and economic relations between Bulgaria and Finland, the cabinets' Press Office said. Later Prime Minister Berov met Swiss head of Federal Department of Public Economy Jean-Pascal Delamuraz. The two agreed that the bilateral relations are developing actively but certain steps should be taken to overcome the decline in the commercial exchange. The Bulgarian prime minister met also with Sir Leon Brittan, member of the Commission of the European Communities, to discuss Bulgaria's joining the European structures. Later in the afternoon Prof. Berov met with outstanding representatives of international business circles and briefed them on the progress of the economic reforms in this country. The Bulgarian head of state touched upon the stumbling blocks in the period of transition to a market economy, the actions taken to improve the investment climate in this country, the major goals of the incumbent government's economic policy, the land reform. Bulgaria's policy in the Balkans was one of the key issues in the talks, the cabinet's Press Office said.
