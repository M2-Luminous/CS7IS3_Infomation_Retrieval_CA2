He described relations between the Visegrad countries as an expedient cooperation framework. He stressed that the question of whether or not it is a political or an economic bloc should not be overemphasized. What he considers to be more important is that cooperation has begun between these countries under a free trade agreement. Andras Takacs sums up further details of the interview. [Takacs] Prime Minister Peter Boross evaluated the past four years as being successful. He said that the government did not first and foremost concentrate on the elections, but worked according to a certain program. Asked about the foreign policy situation, the prime minister said: [Begin Boross recording] Recent international measures, restrictions, and other moves taken against little Yugoslavia have not changed the situation; they have failed to sort out the serious problem. A genuine government, a legitimate government -- I refer to the latest elections -- is working in Belgrade. It is natural that we have to be in contact with this government and have to establish a possible beneficial neighborly system of relations with it. [end recording] [Takacs] [passage omitted] Speaking about the economy, the prime minister described opinions -- according to which the country is in an even worse state than four years ago -- as lacking in seriousness. Our country's foreign currency reserves total $7 billion compared to $800 million four years ago. [passage omitted]
