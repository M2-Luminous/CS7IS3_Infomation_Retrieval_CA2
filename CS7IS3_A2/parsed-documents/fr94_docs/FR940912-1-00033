FR940912-1-00033 FR940912-1-00010 After carefully considering each of the above alternatives, the EPA selected process units as the basis for defining affected facilities for the proposed NSPS. This definition allows for routine equipment replacement and minor changes or expansions in existing facilities without subjecting either single emission sources or entire plant sites to requirements of the proposed standards. Providing for full coverage of all new process units will improve ambient air quality, the goal of standards implemented under section 111. Synthetic organic chemical manufacturing industry process units, which are defined as the equipment assembled and connected by pipes or ducts to process raw materials and to manufacture an intended product, include reactors and their associated product separators and recovery devices; distillation units and their associated distillate receivers and recovery devices; associated unit operations; and any feed, intermediate, and product storage vessels, product transfer racks, and connected ducts and piping. A synthetic organic chemical manufacturing process unit includes pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, connectors, instrumentation systems, and control devices or systems. E. Selection of Best Demonstrated Technology Section 111 of the Act states that NSPS ``shall reflect the degree of emission limitation and the percentage reduction achievable through application of the best technological system of continuous emission reduction which (taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, any nonair quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements) the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated.'' The technological basis for NSPS that meets these criteria is referred to as ``best demonstrated technology (BDT).'' In the standards development process for NSPS, BDT should be identified, the performance of BDT established, and a regulatory alternative selected that will require the use of BDT or an equivalent technology. There are two fundamentally different approaches to controlling VOC emissions from SOCMI wastewater sources. The first is a source reduction or waste minimization approach in which the emission reduction is achieved through a reduction in the quantity of wastewater generated and/or a reduction in the VOC content of the wastewater as a result of process modifications, modifications of operating practices, improved preventive maintenance activities, increased recycling, or segregation of VOC-containing waste streams. Waste minimization may be achieved through either source reduction or recycling. Source reduction involves the implementation of steps that reduce either the amount of wastewater generated or the amount of VOC contained in the wastewater streams. Recycling includes recovery and/or reuse of potential wastes. Within the SOCMI, there are several means of achieving the objective of either of these waste minimization alternatives. However, in relation to SOCMI wastewater, waste minimization techniques are, for the most part, process unit-specific, and the degree of emission reduction achieved depends on the operating parameters of the individual process unit. Because of a lack of adequate site-specific data regarding the waste minimization approach within SOCMI, the EPA was unable to develop reasonable estimates of the emission control efficiency of the waste minimization options achievable on a nationwide basis. For example, because pollution prevention activities such as process redesign are site-specific, it would not be practical or possible to stipulate specific requirements for the large number of chemical production processes subject to the proposed SOCMI wastewater NSPS. In addition, the EPA considers that elimination of pollution through material substitution will not be possible in all cases within the SOCMI because SOCMI products cannot be eliminated from use without adverse economic impact. Specifically, because the products of the SOCMI are used in the production of polymers, resins, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, etc., elimination of a SOCMI product would affect not only the SOCMI producer but also the downstream user of that SOCMI product. Many of the end-use products (e.g., resins, pharmaceuticals, etc.) could not be made from other materials. Thus, the EPA maintains that material substitution is better left determined by the marketplace than by mandate through a specific Federal requirement. Therefore, for the reasons cited above, no waste minimization options were included in the regulatory alternatives analysis for this NSPS. The EPA, however, believes that the SOCMI wastewater NSPS sufficiently encourages pollution prevention. For example, within the regulation's applicability provisions, there is an exemption from the control requirements of the rule for process units that generate wastewaters with small overall volatile organic quantities in the wastewater. Also, the regulatory criteria for identifying the wastewater streams that require control for air emissions are expressed in terms of action levels based on concentration and flow rate cutoffs below which controls are not required for the wastewater stream. An owner or operator may use any means, including process changes or material substitution but not treatment of the wastewater, to meet the criteria for either the small quantity process unit exemption or the concentration/low-flow cutoff. In addition, within the provisions for wastewater collection and treatment operations, there are compliance options that only specify a percent reduction of VOC emissions. Again, to comply with these options, an owner or operator may use any means, including process changes or recovery devices, to reduce emissions by the specified percent.
