Differences and contradictions are currently beginning to appear between large and small states, those which have the potential for raw materials and those who depend on shipments of the latter [words indistinct]. In light of this, the nature of Belarusian conditions for reforming the economy is quite specific; it cannot be understood without taking into account the role of the Belarusian economy in the single economic complex of the former USSR. Under the conditions of a centrally administered planned economy, huge enterprises were concentrated on Belarusian soil, engaged in the processing of raw materials and semifinished products, as well as the manufacturing of end products. Those enterprises used to be linked with suppliers in all regions of the USSR within the framework of a single national system. Then the collapse occurred and brought about a dramatic disruption in existing economic relations. As a result of this, the Belarusian economy found itself overnight in dire straits. Administrative levers have been, for the most part, lost, while the structure of market motivation has not yet been created. Unfortunately, economic reform, a need for which has matured in our society, actually turned into a curse word for many people, just as with the word perestroyka. Our numerous compatriots cannot psychologically accept reform, because who needs reform when it encroaches on the vital interests of the people? It is a well-known fact that territorial-ethnic conflicts on the territory of the former USSR, and not just conflicts but wars too, were primarily caused by the dramatic plunge in people's living standards. With regard to this, I would like to point out that certain politicians in our country, driven by unknown motives, are trying to transform economic reform into interstate conflicts and prevent natural civilized rapprochement between Belarus and Russia. As you know, ideological cliches -- which are absolutely alien to Belarusians -- are being used to block this process: Russia is depicted as an imperial state that is heading in a different direction. I want to state this with full responsibility: We have been carefully examining all new trends in the theory and practice of contemporary interstate economic relations. Yes, we, earlier than anybody else, assessed the so-called economic theories of our local opponents, who envision reorienting the Belarusian economy from the traditional union with Russia along the East-West axis, toward the allegedly new North-South axis, also called the Baltic-Black Sea belt. I would put it this way: The obsoleteness of this theory becomes evident given that as long ago as the turn of the 20th century the geopolitical senselessness of such views and their economic and political deficiency were proven, as well as the impossibility to implement this idea in light of the existing balance of forces in the world arena. Our economy's current problems and hardships were not caused by its internal incongruities, but rather by dependence on external factors. [passage omitted] We were finally demonstrated who feeds whom. We once used to holler that all the republics feed Russia. We were shown the contrary quite fast. We were trying to (?discuss) the Orsha defeat [reference to victory of Lithuanian-Belarusian troops over Russia in the mid-16th century]; meanwhile, our gas and oil supplies were cut off. It was not in 1500 or so that we lost or won that battle; we lost the battle now, following the economic sanctions that had been used against us. Let us not forget this. [passage omitted] Let us look at Europe, which has came close to creating the European Union in the form of a single state structure built on the basis of federalism. What do we see? We see the evident striving by European states to secure free movement of people, products, services, and capital. They have decided to adopt a common monetary unit, introduce single European citizenship, and (?form) the European Parliament. Thus, Europe, having lived through two world wars, has chosen a new path of development -- one of economic and political integration. We are actually dealing with the formation of a powerful integrated structure of a single European state. Nobody says that the expansion of supranational powers among the European structures will in some way limit state sovereignty. I am quite positive that in the near future we will also come to realize the prospects and actual advantages of the integration of the newly independent states, and find ways to achieve closer rapprochement. Otherwise, we will not survive. We will collapse. That is why I clearly state that as long as I am the head of the Belarusian Government, the latter will not change the course of integration with Russia, Ukraine, and other independent states. Yes, we support the economic union and the single ruble zone. The creation of supranational structures similar to the European Parliament may become a natural continuation of this process. At the same time, dear colleagues, I am not speaking about surrendering our Republic's sovereignty and independence. Simplicity and primitivism of such views on state construction, as represented by People's Deputy Lukashenka, are alien to me. The wheel of history can only roll forward and cannot be reversed. I will never, nor under any circumstances agree to surrender sovereignty and give up the state independence of Belarus. Never. I am sure, however, that the union will be revived in a new form and Belarus will enter it as an independent, sovereign state. Speaking of preserving our sovereignty -- for there is much criticism on this issue -- I want to point out that it is easy and simple to declare sovereignty. State sovereignty, however, must be protected. Without protection there can be no sovereignty. I am more than positive that if today we are left without Russia, no matter who is at the helm, we will be thrown 10 to 15 years back into the past, or even face economic collapse. Believe me, we calculated these things both on computers and by other means -- various options. Go to Europe? Who is admitted into Europe? Great Russia is not admitted into Europe! There are just promises and nothing but promises. All markets were divided long ago. Both oil and gas used in Europe come from Russia, and not from any other state. Shall we go to the West to buy Russian oil from middlemen at a higher price? No! We would rather look to the East. All products and raw materials will be supplied to Belarus duty-free. This will lower prices by 35 to 40 percent, lower productions costs, and retail prices, which swelled solely due to customs duties and not due to our inability to work. [passage omitted] Russia's economy is sick, but it is not dead and buried. Many times in its history Russia has surprised the world with the power of its spirit, with its might, and always risen up from the ashes. This time, these processes are also beginning in Russia. We are facing difficulties, but let us not dash aside; history, future generations, our conscience, and dignity would never forgive us this. [passage omitted] The Constitution adopted in March by our legislature preserved the vertical system of soviets. History has proven that this system corresponds to the national and political traditions of our people better than other variants. The history of the last two years has taught us what may come of neglecting those traditions. Workers and farmers have practically been pushed out of the soviets. Their voices cannot be heard there. They were replaced by photographers, archaeologists [reference to Popular Front Chairman Zyanon Paznyak], and Leopold cats with doctorate degrees [reference to former Supreme Soviet Chairman Shushkevich, who, like the cartoon character, often appealed for accord]. Whose interests these people represent, I do not have to explain to you. [passage omitted] Why do Paznyak and Shushkevich so furiously attack our union with Russia, accusing me of everything short of national treason? Despite their mediocre organizing skills and total lack of economic and technological experience, they understand all too well that there will be no place for them on the political field of the Belarusian-Russian union. However the provincial [word indistinct] of one of them and the taste for cushy executive jobs of the other, urge them to engage in adventurist irrational activities. That is not a big deal. We, the people who grew up in plants and factories, have strong nerves. We will withstand both ridiculous political aspirations and primitive slanders. [passage omitted]
