Various sources report this to have been a "meeting of selected intellectuals" aspiring for pure democracy and political ethics. However, this meeting used the language of gutter politics. As at all meetings of this kind, politicians are at pains to air their ideas and beliefs, while the audience is ready to hear the alternatives offered to them and choose between them. Some may approve of what a political group says, and some may not, because an audience has its own preferences on various issues; that is democracy. Unfortunately, the AD leaders, once so determined to defend diversity of opinion within the Democratic Party, did not permit any reply to the insults and deceptions they hurled into the auditorium. The result was that a 26-year-old man became the victim of a crime that was in any event intolerable. How was the quarrel that concluded in Gjovalin Cekini's murder provoked? Well known for their bombastic statements and deceptions, the AD leaders exploited the platform to spit venom against those who govern the Albanian state today. Not only this, but reports state that their desire to oppose everything that the Albanian state does today has led them into new political blunders. Thus, following (baseless) accusations that "today's rulers are sunk in corruption" (and it was G. Pashko who said this), or accusations against S. Berisha, the AD leaders came out in defense of Nano (they once voted against him). Nevertheless, it is said that the culmination earns with the statements made about Serbia. "We have neither ever killed the Serbs nor have they killed us." Meanwhile, "the democratic government tied us to the Muslims and spoiled our relations with our neighbors." It seems that the "bootlickers'" visit to Belgrade was not simply an aberration on the part of the AD's leaders. Imami said that "we went to Belgrade to avert war." Is it not a wonder that what the whole of Europe has not managed to avert was averted by the AD with the powerful assistance of N. Hoti? Anything can be done with the "youthful optimism" of the AD leaders and N. Hoti's cosmic intelligence. Annoyed by such statements, some of the people in the hall responded and objected. This also happened because the AD leaders did not reply to all the questions put to them in writing, and the police intervened. After the objections, the hall erupted in confusion. The irritated section of the audience, about half of it, who could no longer put up with the insults and deceptions about the "blank check," went outside. Meanwhile, others departed at the end of the meeting and followed, from the theater to the Radio Shkoder building, the person who had argued with the meeting's chairmen, hitting him. Some of the latter's friends were nearby, and a quarrel between the two sides broke out. One of them was armed, and fired at the victim in the course of the quarrel. Thus, a 26-year-old became the victim of the AD's hooligan politics. The responsible authorities must investigate this tragic incident. It seems that the deputies without an electorate have begun a campaign of deception in support of the call for new elections issued by the Socialist Party leaders. They have stated that they might win 15-20 percent in the next elections, but if they continue in this way they will only increase the number of their opponents.
