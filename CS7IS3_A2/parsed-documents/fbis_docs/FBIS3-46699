The Foreign Ministry, which handles the North Korean nuclear problem, is said to expect that Washington and Pyongyang will hold another working-level contact in New York this week to wrap up their negotiations. But ministry officials are taking the cautious approach as a last-minute glitch could develop in the U.S.-North Korean talks with a change in the ever unpredictable North Korean attitude. The Seoul Government began to undertake preparations for a working-level contact with North Korea for exchanges of special envoys, if and when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is able to send its inspection team to Pyongyang, following negotiations between the IAEA and North Korea. The government will work on plans for future inter-Korean ties, anticipating improvement in North Korea's relations with the United States and Japan in the event that the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved in the first half of this year. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Monday that his ministry will map out diplomatic countermeasures because there is a strong possibility that North Korea could improve its ties with the United States and Japan this year. The South Korean Government has said it would not oppose any improvement of relations between North Korea and the United States or Japan, but Seoul has, in actuality, coolly reacted to any such moves by its traditional allies, according to ministry insiders. The latest, prevailing way of thinking among Foreign Ministry officials is that Seoul has to work out a policy and consistently follow it since relations between Washington and Pyongyang could improve at an accelerating pace once the nuclear issue is cleared up at a third round of their high-level talks. Over at the National Unification Board [NUB], meanwhile, officials believe chances are great that the United States and North Korea will reach a complete agreement. Accordingly, they are preparing for conditions that Seoul could table at a working-level inter-Korean contact. But NUB officials are also "extremely careful" in their approach because there always is a chance that the North Koreans could throw a wrench in their negotiations at the last minute. Some of the most serious problems that, NUB officials believe, could come up in the inter-Korean working-level contact could be the purpose of the exchanges of special emissaries. The exchanges of special envoys have been discussed both by South and North Korea. But it has not precisely been defined what they will discuss once the proposed exchanges take place. One of the main topics South Korea wants them to discuss is simultaneous and mutual inspection of nuclear facilities. But the NUB officials expect that North Korea could very well counter their proposal with President Kim Il-song's so-called 10-point program that calls, among other things, for unification through federal system in which two Koreas have one state but two governments. There indeed are difference of views on the nature of mission of the special envoys, one NUB official admits. But North Korea, nevertheless, recognizes the need for exchanging special envoys, if only because it wants to realize the third round of high-level talks with the United States, he said. There is a strong possibility that South and North Korea could stand far apart even when they agreed to exchange special envoys. That is part of the reason NUB officials are at pains to provide viable proposals for simultaneous inspections between the South and North that could be supplementary to IAEA inspections, he added.
