FR940705-2-00147 FR940705-2-00090 Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;f&hyph;(2). If organisms are used that have a recognized potential for causing serious detrimental impacts on managed or natural ecosystems, their presence shall be indicated by a sign posted on the greenhouse access doors. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;f&hyph;(3). If there is a risk to human health, a sign shall be posted incorporating the universal biosafety symbol. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;g. Transfer of Materials (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;g&hyph;(1). Experimental materials that are brought into or removed from the greenhouse in a viable or intact state shall be transferred to a non-breakable, sealed, primary container then enclosed in a non-breakable, sealed secondary container. These containers shall be removed from the greenhouse facility through a chemical disinfectant, fumigation chamber, or an airlock designed for this purpose. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;g&hyph;(2). Supplies and materials shall be brought into the greenhouse facility through a double-door autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock that is appropriately decontaminated between each use. After securing the outer doors, personnel within the greenhouse facility shall retrieve the materials by opening the interior door of the autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock. These doors shall be secured after the materials are brought into the greenhouse facility. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;h. Greenhouse Practices Manual (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;h&hyph;(1). A greenhouse practices manual shall be prepared or adopted. This manual shall include contingency plans to be implemented in the event of the unintentional release of experimental organisms. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;i. Protective Clothing (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;i&hyph;(1). Street clothing shall be removed in the outer clothing change room. Complete laboratory clothing (may be disposable) including undergarments, pants, and shirts, jump suits, shoes, and hats shall be provided and worn by all personnel entering the greenhouse facility. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;i&hyph;(2). Personnel shall remove laboratory clothing when exiting the greenhouse facility and before entering the shower area. This clothing shall be stored in a locker or hamper in the inner change room. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;i&hyph;(3). All laboratory clothing shall be autoclaved before laundering. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2. Facilities (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a. Greenhouse Design (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(1). The maximum containment greenhouse facility shall consist of a separate building or a clearly demarcated and isolated area within a building. The need to maintain negative pressure should be considered when constructing or renovating the greenhouse facility. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(2). Outer and inner change rooms, separated by a shower, shall be provided for personnel entering and exiting the greenhouse facility. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(3). Windows shall be closed and sealed. All glazing shall be resistant to breakage (e.g., double-pane tempered glass or equivalent). Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(4). Access doors to the greenhouse shall be self-closing and locking. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(5). The greenhouse facility shall be surrounded by a security fence or protected by equivalent security measures. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(6). The walls, floors, and ceilings of the greenhouse shall be constructed to form a sealed internal shell that facilitates fumigation and is animal and arthropod-proof. These internal surfaces shall be resistant to penetration and degradation by liquids and chemicals to facilitate cleaning and decontamination of the area. All penetrations into these structures and surfaces (e.g., plumbing and utilities) shall be sealed. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(7). Bench tops and other work surfaces shall have seamless surfaces impervious to water and resistant to acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(8). A double-door autoclave, fumigation chamber, or ventilated airlock shall be provided for passage of all materials, supplies, or equipment that are not brought into the greenhouse facility through the change room. Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b. Autoclaves (BL4&hyph;P) Appendix P&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(1). A double-door autoclave shall be provided for the decontamination of materials removed from the greenhouse facility. The autoclave door, which opens to the area external to the greenhouse facility, shall be sealed to the outer wall and automatically controlled so that it can only be opened upon completion of the sterilization cycle.
