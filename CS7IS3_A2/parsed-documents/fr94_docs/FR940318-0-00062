FR940318-0-00062 FR940318-0-00012 (4) Preferred stock. Preferred stock is any stock (other than disqualified stock) that has a limited or fixed redemption price or liquidation preference and does not upon issuance have a right to participate in corporate growth to a meaningful extent. Preferred stock that is convertible into common stock is not treated as preferred stock if the conversion right represents, in substance, a meaningful right to participate in corporate growth. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), a right to participate in corporate growth is not established by the fact that the redemption price or liquidation preference exceeds the fair market value of the preferred stock. (5) Amount of indebtedness. Generally, the amount of indebtedness is the adjusted issue price of the indebtedness. Appropriate adjustments are made for accrued but unpaid stated interest. (See the example in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.) (6) Undersecured indebtedness_ (i) General rule. If an indebtedness is secured by property with a value less than its adjusted issue price, the indebtedness is considered to be two separate debts: a secured indebtedness with an adjusted issue price equal to the value of the property, and an unsecured indebtedness with an adjusted issue price equal to the remainder. Absent strong evidence to the contrary, the value of the property securing the indebtedness is presumed to be equal to the issue price of any new secured indebtedness received for the indebtedness plus the value of any other consideration (except stock or new unsecured indebtedness) received for the indebtedness. A valuation of that property by a court in a title 11 case is a factor in determining value, but is not controlling. (ii) Example. The following example illustrates these provisions: Example. Corporation X owes an indebtedness with an adjusted issue price of $100,000. The indebtedness is secured by certain property owned by Corporation X. Corporation X exchanges the indebtedness for $10,000 of stock and new secured indebtedness with an issue price of $70,000. Under paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, the indebtedness is bifurcated into a secured indebtedness of $70,000 (the issue price of the new secured indebtedness received in exchange therefor) and an unsecured indebtedness of $30,000 (the remainder of the adjusted issue price of the indebtedness). (e) Effective date. This section is effective with respect to any issuance of stock for indebtedness on or before December 31, 1994, or any issuance of stock for indebtedness in a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code) that was filed on or before December 31, 1993_ (1) Pursuant to a plan confirmed by the court in a title 11 case after May 17, 1994; or (2) If there is no title 11 case, pursuant to an insolvency workout in which all issuances of stock for indebtedness occur after May 17, 1994.
