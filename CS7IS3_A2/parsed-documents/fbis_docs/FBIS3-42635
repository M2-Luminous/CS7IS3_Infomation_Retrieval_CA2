The conference was attended by Andrey Kozyrev and a large group of Russian diplomats, as well as RF Minister of Internal Affairs Viktor Yerin, Deputy Minister of Defense Col-Gen Boris Gromov, and other high-level representatives of Russian ministries and departments, most of them deputy ministers. They discussed a broad range of military-political, economic, cultural, humanitarian, and other issues, analyzed the situation in the CIS and Baltic countries, examined current developments in the interaction of CIS states in different spheres, and presented legal assessments of the status of their fellow-countrymen in neighboring countries. The speech by the head of the Russian foreign policy establishment aroused considerable interest. The minister stressed that the CIS and Baltic states constitute the region of Russia's primary vital interests and offer colossal opportunities for the development of friendly and comprehensive relations. The defense of the rights of Russians in these nearby foreign countries was called the main strategic objective of Russian foreign policy. We have recently been able to achieve considerable mutual understanding with our immediate partners, including an understanding on the question of dual citizenship. Andrey Kozyrev called for the heightened effectiveness of existing and projected mechanisms of economic cooperation within the CIS framework and a strictly individualized approach in the creation of common currencies. (The minister did, however, praise the Russian-Belarusian agreement--Ed.) The need to maintain the Russian military presence in the sphere of Russian interests was underscored, but this does not apply to the Baltic states, although the minister has already been accused of planning this. This statement has evoked conflicting responses abroad. Moscow is already being asked for precise explanations. Washington is angry, and the Baltic states launched another of their traditional anti-Russian campaigns. (For the details, see yesterday's edition of SEGODNYA--Ed.) These worries seem excessive, however. People in Moscow are not planning to take any kind of unilateral steps in this direction, without considering the opinions of neighboring states. The fundamental principle of this kind of military presence is the mutual interest of the parties. In addition to bilateral agreements, the law of the Russian Federation "On Defense," which allows for the deployment of ground and naval forces outside Russia with the consent of parliament, can serve as the legal basis for stationing Russian troops abroad. Ideas about the problems of the CIS were then expressed by the Russian ambassadors, military leaders, and officials from RF law enforcement and financial agencies. All of them agreed that the Commonwealth is turning into a global factor now that it has gone through the complex initial phase of its establishment. They mentioned the diversified system of legal treaties within the CIS framework. The implementation of the Treaty on Collective Security has begun. There is a clear desire to restore the common economic zone on a market basis, but this will be a slow and gradual process: moving from the simple to the complex, from a free trade zone to a free market. Military-technical cooperation is being strengthened. The close coordination of the operations of foreign trade and customs agencies has begun. Joint measures have been taken to protect external borders. The idea of forming a group of collective forces to keep the peace in "hot spots" in the CIS is arousing increasing interest. Concern about the Russians in nearby foreign countries must remain a priority of Russian foreign policy. The establishment of a special federal agency for the protection of the interests of these Russians and the negotiation of a CIS convention on dual citizenship were suggested. The importance of drafting joint foreign policy initiatives for international and regional forums was acknowledged. Speakers did not ignore the urgent problems of the Commonwealth. Above all, these are the problems that are common to all of the new states: the recession, the mounting social tension, differences in the speed of economic reform, in budget, credit, and monetary policy, and in economic interests, and the absence of a single set of economic laws. They mentioned the attempts to build an economic union at Russia's expense, although this should be done on an equitable basis. Apparently, this will not be a simple task. Just in the past year, the CIS countries have received credits exceeding 500 billion rubles from the Russian republic budget, and the projected figure was over 800 billion. The republics still want to buy Russian raw materials at heavily discounted prices. A single payment union is essential, but the necessary legal and economic prerequisites for this are still lacking. Speakers expressed concern about the vulnerability of borders, with all of the ensuing negative consequences for Russia, particularly when citizens of third countries cross the border. Whereas 12 million people crossed the Russian border in 1913 and 2 million crossed in 1988, the figure last year was 35 million. Under these conditions, how can border security and border control be instituted? This would call for 500 checkpoints on the border between the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan, and all of the moral and political implications of this move also have to be taken into account. The activities of Russian diplomats in the CIS states were discussed in depth. Speakers mentioned the inadequate coordination of the actions of different Russian agencies, and the arrival of delegations from some CIS countries in Moscow without the advance notification and consent of the Russian side. Representatives from the ministries of defense and internal affairs, however, expressed satisfaction with their interaction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Speakers mentioned some of the difficulties involved in finding suitable work and living premises for Russian diplomatic representatives. In this sense, all of our partners are in a privileged position in Moscow. The principle of reciprocity should apply. The atmosphere of the Russian embassies also leaves much to be desired. There are considerable differences in wages, because the CIS has its own prestigious and nonprestigious "spots." All of these difficulties naturally stem from the insufficiency of funds. After the RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted its financial requests for embassies in the CIS in 1994, the RF Ministry of Finance cut the requested foreign currency allocations by 20 percent and ruble allocations by 17 percent. The diplomats' subsequent "discussions" with representatives of that ministry were futile. The financiers in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs then promised to find the necessary funds to extricate our embassies in the nearby foreign countries from their present pathetic state.
