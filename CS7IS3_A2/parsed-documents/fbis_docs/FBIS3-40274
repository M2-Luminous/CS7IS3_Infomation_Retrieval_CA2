This will be the first tranche of a loan earmarked for Slovenia in accordance with the transportation agreement signed last year between Slovenia and the EC and the financial protocol derived from this agreement, enabling Slovenia to receive an EIB loan of ECU150 million. Further cooperation between Slovenia and the EIB was also the topic of discussion between Gaspari and the EIB vice president. Gaspari was also received by Luxembourg Prime Minister Jacques Santer and thanked him for his help with Slovenia's inclusion in World Bank activities (Slovenia is in the so-called constituency with Belgium and Luxembourg). Drawing on Luxembourg's considerable experience with the steel industry, they also discussed the possibility of Luxembourg helping the Slovene steel industry, not with money but mainly with advice or engineering. The economy ministers of both countries are to meet as soon as possible for further discussions. As far as we know, today's talks were not related to the Slovene Government's decision to temporarily deposit the repayments of outstanding liabilities of Slovene debtors to the Consortium of Commercial Banks. As reported, this money is to be deposited in a special account at the Dresdner Bank in Luxembourg.
