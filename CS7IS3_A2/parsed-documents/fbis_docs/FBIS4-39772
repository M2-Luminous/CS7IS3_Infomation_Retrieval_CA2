Vasiliy Lipitskiy, chairman of the Social-Democratic Popular Party of Russia, told journalists that Baburin had made his move following the State Duma's vote Wednesday on the 1994 budget. Communist Party and Agrarian Party leaders Gennadiy Zyuganov and Mikhail Lapshin voted for the budget draft while Baburin rejected it. Baburin jointly with former Russian vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy, Zyuganov, Lapshin, Constitutional Court Justice Valeriy Zorkin and the Duma's Economic Policy Committee Chairman Sergey Glazyev founded the Concord for Russia opposition movement and attended last May's session of the movement's National Council. A week later he said in Novosibirsk, however, that the Russian All-People's League would not support Rutskoy, who could become the opposition candidate in the coming presidential elections.
