The protocol was signed for the Algerian side by the director general of foreign financial relations at the Ministry of Finance. This agreement would allow Algerian operators to obtain French-made pharmaceutical products for a period of three years. This agreement acquires a special significance because it comes at a time when Algeria is preparing itself for starting talks at the beginning of June with the Paris Club on rescheduling its general debts.
