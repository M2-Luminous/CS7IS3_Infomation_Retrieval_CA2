FR941222-0-00098 FR941222-0-00014 III. IPCS to Japan A. JFK Processing Facility Because of (1) the greater availability of direct air transportation to Japan from JFK International Airport compared with that available from other airports; (2) the efficiencies created by the Postal Service's being able to process all IPCS mail to Japan at a single facility designed for that purpose; (3) the efficiencies created by the Postal Service's being able to dispatch all IPCS mail to Japan from a single facility designed for that purpose; and (4) general operational and managerial considerations, the Postal Service has determined that all IPCS mail to Japan should be processed at, and dispatched from, a dedicated facility located at JFK International Airport (the JFK Processing Facility). If the plant at which the customer's packages originate is located within 500 miles of JFK International Airport, the Postal Service will accept the packages at the plant and transport them by truck to the JFK Processing Facility according to a schedule agreed upon by the Postal Service and the customer. If the customer's plant is located more than 500 miles from JFK International Airport, the customer will be required to present the packages to the Postal Service for verification at the plant and transport them as a drop shipment to the JFK Processing Facility according to a schedule agreed upon by the Postal Service and the customer. The Postal Service is imposing this requirement because the IPCS customer will be in a better position than the Postal Service to arrange for cost-effective air or long-haul surface transportation that meets the customer's package preparation schedule and other operational requirements. Although the Postal Service initially will require all IPCS mail to Japan to be brought to the JFK Processing Facility, the Postal Service specifically requests comments from customers regarding the need for an additional processing site in another part of the country, such as the Seattle or San Francisco metropolitan areas. B. Customs Forms Packages mailed to Japan through IPCS will not be required to bear customs forms when they are tendered to the Postal Service. After scanning the customer-printed barcode on each package and correlating it with the package-specific information transmitted by the customer, the Postal Service will print the necessary customs forms and then affix them to the customer's packages as part of the processing operation at the JFK Processing Facility. However, during the interim period in which the Postal Service and the customer are working together to establish the information systems linkages to enable the Postal Service to accomplish this, the customer will be required to prepare the necessary customs forms on its own and affix the forms to the packages before tendering them to the Postal Service. C. Delivery Options Within the framework of IPCS to Japan, the Postal Service will offer three delivery options: Express Service, Standard Air Service, and Economy Air Service. While the weight limit for Express Service and Standard Air Service packages will be 44 pounds, the weight limit for Economy Air Service packages will be 4 pounds. Express Service will be the fastest option and will provide tracking and tracing and insurance at no additional cost. The Postal Service will transport Express Service packages to Japan by air, where they will receive special handling by Japan Post and expedited delivery. Each package sent by this option must bear a label identifying it as an Express Service package (Label 11&hyph;B, Express Mail Service Post Office to Addressee, or an alternative label acceptable to Japan Post). Before or after scanning the customer-printed barcode on each package and correlating it with the package-specific information transmitted by the customer, the Postal Service will prepare the necessary labels and affix them to the customer's Express Service packages as part of the processing operation at the JFK Processing Facility. However, during the interim period in which the Postal Service and the customer are working together to establish the information systems linkages to enable the Postal Service to accomplish this, the customer will be able to use Express Service by preparing the necessary labels on its own and affixing the labels to the packages before tendering them to the Postal Service. Standard Air Service will be the next fastest delivery option and will provide confirmation of dispatch from the United States.
