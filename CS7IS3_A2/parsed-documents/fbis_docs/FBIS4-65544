In an interview with HANDELSBLATT, the president of the Karlsruhe Federal Constitutional Court emphasized that all current economic indicators were giving reason to be optimistic. Herzog cited three main reasons for his optimistic appreciation of economic developments in eastern Germany. On the one hand, he pointed to the experience gained by the West Germans after 1945. The dismantling of industrial plants constituted a "terrible blow" for the West German economy at the time. However, the effect was that the dismantled industrial plants were replaced by new, much more efficient ones. "The same will now take place in the new laender." In addition, Herzog pointed to the economy in the construction sector, which had picked up significantly over the past few months. "I am not claiming that things are developing in the same way as in the West after 1950. Yet, the fact is that the construction sector has always been the driving force for the economy in West Germany in the past few decades." Finally, the CDU/CSU candidate pointed to the increasing number of new enterprises that have been established in the new laender. An economy is working best when "it can rely on this grass-roots economy of small- and medium-sized enterprises and industries." Moreover, Herzog underlined the qualifications of the people in eastern Germany and their readiness to work hard. In many cases their knowledge went far beyond technical things. The knowledge of East European languages, which many people in the new laender possess, was still lying absolutely fallow. "If the markets in East Europe recover, there is a great potential for employment here. I think that we do not have to fear too much about the economic development in eastern Germany. It is certainly going to be a long haul but the upward trend is indisputable." Herzog commented most favorably on the role of the trade unions in German society. The reaction to the economic development, to the widening gap between economic developments and the labor market can be acknowledged only with words of praise, Herzog said. "I cannot judge whether this year's wage agreements are watertight to the last detail or what the future of the Volkswagen working week model will be. Yet, quite certainly one can say that steps in the right direction have been taken, and I have been following them with the greatest respect." The president of the Constitutional Court strongly criticized overregulation in the FRG. This was currently even obstructing a positive course for the economy. As everybody knows, the liberal law-governed state lives on the fact that the citizens voluntarily behave in the way they are expected by the law. Yet, if the legal system has become so intricate and complicated that even the most loyal citizens no longer know what they are expected to do, then this potential for loyalty is not utilized. The development of the FRG legal system has certainly also something to do with a certain German urge for perfectionism. Yet, the essential thing is that in the last few decades one has more and more abandoned the type of law "that only sets out the general direction." Lawmaking today increasingly often means to seek justice for individual cases and to produce an ever increasing number of special regulations. "I do not think that we can afford that in the long run. I would prefer a somewhat less exhaustive legal system that leaves a certain room for all parties involved -- including the administrative bodies." In this connection, Herzog pointed out that the Federal Constitutional Court has always been very open in this respect. He was sometimes wondering that the legislators were making relatively little use of the possibilities that have become possible under constitutional law. Regarding his chances in the election of the federal president, the CDU/CSU candidate said that he thought from the very beginning that his election was not "absolutely certain." Yet, at the moment he thought that his chances were bigger than those of the other candidates. Nevertheless, the race was still open. "I am preparing myself for both results." The question whether in the future the president should be directly elected by the people depends on the powers the office will be entrusted with, Herzog said, adding that he discussed this problem before in his commentary on the Basic Law. Under the Basic Law, the federal president has only limited powers, "one can say he is absolutely weak." Herzog emphasized that there was the danger that a politician might be elected with far more than 50 percent of the vote in a general election but lack the necessary competence. "I find this discrepancy between backing from the population and real powers to be too great." That way "full-blooded politicians" would "burn out." Herzog stressed that, according to the Basic Law, the federal president had to examine all laws and, if necessary, even withhold his signature if a law appears to be unconstitutional. He argued that all federal presidents refused to sign a document at least once. The Federal Constitutional Court is indeed the real keeper of the constitution, which is why all federal presidents have so far, quite rightly, only reluctantly made use of their right to withhold a signature in extreme cases. In this connection, Herzog pointed to a "fact" that, in his view, had gotten not enough public attention so far. If, in a law of 200 paragraphs, one paragraph is dubious under constitutional law, then the Federal Constitutional Court is able to pick out this paragraph and declare it void if asked to do so. Yet everything else in the law would stay the way it is. The federal president can only sign a law in its entirety or refuse to sign it. This was the real reason that the federal presidents were very reluctant in many cases to withhold their signature. Some presidents expressly emphasized in the past that they had reservations regarding the constitutionality of certain points of a law, but still wanted to put their signature to it to clear the way for Karlsruhe. "I regard that as a most reasonable practice that is basically consistent with the rulings of the Federal Constitutional Court." The discussion about shifting responsibilities from Bonn to the Karlsruhe Federal Constitutional court is looked at with certain skepticism by Herzog. "If I understand it right then this happened only once, namely in connection with the out-of-area missions of Bundeswehr units." The Federal Constitutional Court itself did not regard the discussion as being so "dramatic." He said he did not quite understand the criticism of politics in this connection. There are certainly examples for a shift in responsibilities, but there are only a few. Herzog noted that if he were elected he would mainly "do what in England they call warning, admonishing, and encouraging. The federal president will be well advised not to interfere in political controversies between the various camps." In addition, and in constant agreement with the Federal Government's foreign policy, particularly toward the outside, he has to do a great deal for "all things that make up the atmosphere." "I think that wherever the necessary political discussion is not conducted, it is also his job if not to set up programs at least to point to the issue," Herzog said.
