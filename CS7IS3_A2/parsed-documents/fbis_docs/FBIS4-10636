FBIS4-10636 "drlat073_r_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-073 Daily Report 14 Mar 1992 Peru Lack of Time for Electoral Process Discussed Lack of Time for Electoral Process Discussed 94SM0307A Lima SI in Spanish 14 Mar 92 pp 20-21, 73 94SM0307A Lima SI Spanish CSO [Unattributed article: "The Clock Does Not Work"] [Text] According to the law and the almanac, it is simply impossible to carry out the next electoral process within the time period planned by the government party. Some people have made erroneous calculations based on the closing date for the registration of candidates, which falls on 10 October 1994. They seem to be forgetting, however, that the elections must be convoked by 15 August at the latest. To make this possible, all of the electoral bodies for which the current Constitution provides would have to be installed. This cannot be achieved, even with the aid of Macuito. A detailed analysis of the steps that must be taken in order for the elections to be held in April of 1995 reveals that 281 court days, that is to say 13 months, are needed for the implementation of all of the electoral mechanisms required by the Constitution. Even if work is done at a forced-march pace, full steam ahead, and allowing no respite, 157 court days--that is to say seven and a half months--would be needed. In the first case, assuming a normal rhythm, the electoral requirements would be met by about April 1995. This is why the general elections, according to the electoral law in effect--Law 23903, Article 2--are to be held "on the second Sunday in the month of April in the year prescribed for the renewal of the executive and legislative branches." In the second case, the electoral apparatus would be complete by October. As we have noted, this presumes accelerated work, which might possibly complicate the situation. In any case, the parties and fronts would have only six months in which to wage their electoral campaigns. Now then, according to Article 1 of Law 23903, "The president of the Republic will convoke general elections at least eight months prior to the date on which they are to be held." This means that the convocation must be issued by 15 August, at the latest. Can this be done when the electoral bodies prescribed by the Constitution have not yet been established? Can the candidates for the presidency of the Republic or for the parliament accept the convocation under these conditions, when, for example, it is not known how the process of appointing the National Judgeship Council of the Magistracy was handled? (It will be remembered that in accordance with Article 182 of the new constitution, "The head of the National Electoral Procedures Office is appointed by the National Judgeship Council for a renewable period of four years." It is the duty of that official, this same constitutional article says, "to organize all of the electoral and referendum procedures and those of any other type of popular consultation, including their budgets, as well as to design and draft the ballot forms. He is also responsible for providing the documents and other materials required for the voting process and for publicizing its results." To obtain a more accurate idea of how troublesome and slow the mechanisms conceived by the constituents of the New Majority and Cambio 90 (Change 90) are, it suffices to note the prescribed procedure for the appointment of the National Judgeship Council. The Council has seven members, whose election is more complicated than the designation of the mandarins in Imperial China. One member is elected by the Supreme Court; another by the Higher Prosecutors' Council; another by the members of the national colleges of attorneys, by secret ballot; and two by the members of the other professional colleges, by secret ballot. One member is elected by the rectors of the state universities, and another by those of the private universities. It should be added that some colleges have their own specific procedures for the election of delegates. The bylaws of the College of Engineers, for example, provide for a period of 90 days. The steps involved in the election process in the colleges of professionals are oppressively slow. The normal period would be one day for the approval of the internal electoral calendar, 10 days for the publication and dispatch of the electoral calendar to the Departmental Electoral Commissions, 30 days for the checking of the census registers; eight days for coordination with the departmental electoral commissions on the design and color of the ballot forms, one day for the registration of candidates, two days for the publication of the names of the candidates, two days for the disqualification of candidates, two days for the decisions on disqualifications, two days for appeals against the decisions, one day for the final decision on disqualifications, another day for the drawing to allocate numbers to the candidates, another day for the publication of the announcement of the qualified candidates, 15 days for the dispatch of ballots to the departments, one day for the election process, 10 days for the receipt of the departmental balloting reports, 10 days for the national tallying process, and one day for the installation of the National Judgeship Council. In all--heavens above!--89 days. Three months. In the event of a forced march, the process might be compressed into 57 days. But that is all. One is tempted to say, in the words of the refrain, "Clock, you don't keep time." Impossible Either Way Stage I involves the drafting of the organic laws, and the procedures required are discussion and approval of the draft and laws pertaining to the electoral system and the National Judgeship Council and their promulgation and publication, as well as the electoral committees of the colleges of attorneys and other professionals. The normal procedure would take 91 days, or if the steps were accelerated, 48 days. Stage II involves the election of the members of the National Judgeship Council, and the procedures required include drafting the electoral calendar, polling the colleges, registration of the candidates, disqualification, etc., and installation of the Council. The normal procedure would take 99 days, or if the steps were accelerated, 57 days. Stage III involves the appointment of the heads of the ONPE and the RENIEC, and the procedures required include selection and evaluation of the candidates and appointments. The normal procedure would take 31 days, or if the steps were accelerated, 15 days. Stage IV involves the organization of the ONPE and RENIEC, and the procedures required include establishment of the internal regulations, the requesting of materials and personnel, the transfer of resources and equipment, and the reassignment of JNE [National Election Board] personnel. The normal procedure would require 60 days, or if the steps were accelerated, 37 days. Thus all four stages together would require 281 court days normally, or with acceleration, 157 court days, representing 13 months and seven and a half months, respectively. The five preceding paragraphs describe the various steps in the entire process, and the result is equally discouraging. Except for those who think that all the preparations have already been made, and that on the basis of the political situation, it is impossible for Fujimori and his military entourage to abandon government power in an ineffably exquisite democratic fashion. In the opinion of these skeptics, the government party does not care one whit that the opposition candidates would not have time enough to wage a real electoral campaign. What Should Be Done? An unrelenting analysis of the time periods required shows that the country will be faced with a dilemma. Either the elections will have to be postponed, or a formula for compromise making it possible to hold elections in accordance with the law and the Constitution must be found. In this connection, a proposal put forth by Roger Caceres, a congressman, appears to provide a means of salvation. The proposal made by Caceres, which has been given support by Enrique Chirinos Soto and has received the provisional approval of the government party majority in the Constitutional Commission of the CCD, would put the electoral process in the hands of the National Election Board, for this one time. The Board would take over the functions of the National Electoral Procedures Office and the Civil Identification Registry. Even Gilberto Siura voted for the proposal in the Constitutional Commission, although he explained that he only did so to speed up the process of getting the text referred to a plenary session of the CCD. On the other hand, it is reported that Carlos Torres y Torres Lara, the president of the Commission, exclaimed recently: "I believe that we have s...d this up!" At least he recognizes the fact.
