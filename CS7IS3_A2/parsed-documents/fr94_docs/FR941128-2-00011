FR941128-2-00011 FR941128-2-00008 Based on our analysis of the petition and subsequent amendments, we have made certain adjustments to the petitioner's FMV calculation as follows: (1) We disallowed all factors valued using the petitioner's own costs; (2) We recalculated factory overhead and SG&A expenses to account for certain energy and inventory expenses excluded from the petitioner's calculation of COM; (3) We disallowed an amount included by the petitioner for scrap loss because this cost was already included in the cost of steel. Fair Value Comparisons Based on a comparison of USP and FMV, the petitioner's alleged dumping margin, as revised by the Department, is 55.69 percent. Initiation of Investigation Pursuant to section 732(c) of the Act, the Department must determine, within 20 days after a petition is filed, whether a petition sets forth an allegation necessary for the initiation of an antidumping duty investigation, and whether the petition contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegation. We have examined the petition for drawer slides from the PRC, as amended, and have found that it meets the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether imports of drawer slides from the PRC are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value. If this investigation proceeds normally, we will make our preliminary determination by April 9, 1995. International Trade Commission (ITC) Notification Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of this action and we have done so. Preliminary Determinations by the ITC The ITC will determine by December 15, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of drawer slides from the PRC are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Pursuant to section 733(a) of the Act, a negative ITC determination will result in the investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigation will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b). Dated: November 21, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
