The U.S. official arrived at Pizarro's home [presidential palace] at 1025 with U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams. Three important issues were discussed during the meeting: the consolidation of democracy, the strengthening of human rights, and cooperation in the struggle against drug trafficking. After labelling as positive the meeting with Watson, the president reiterated that the 5 April [1992] measures had been necessary to prevent Peru from being totally undermined. Here is what President Fujimori said: [Begin recording] On the democracy issue we have clearly pointed out that the Peru that existed before 5 April 1992, had no future. There was a need to take emergency measures to prevent Peru from being totally undermined. I have mentioned previously that this was a process that subsequently took place in Russia; unfortunately, as we all well know, there were many victims. Here, one-year plus, I would say instead that we have rescued democracy. This is an issue that has been widely discussed. The second issue was in regard to the strengthening the defense of human rights. On this we have been categorical, I have made myself very clear here. What human rights are we talking about when terrorist violence overwhelmed the whole community and life was not worth one cent here? True, there are some isolated cases [of human rights violations], but now there is true respect for human rights. [end recording] [passage omitted]
