Bosnians welcome this show of force. Alain Lamassoure, the French minister delegate of European affairs said this morning [on Radio Monte Carlo] that the bombing of Serb positions should be extended if the latter were to continue their attacks on the Gorazde safe haven. The carrot and the stick must be used, Lamassoure added.
