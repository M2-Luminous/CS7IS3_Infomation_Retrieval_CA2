FR941116-0-00197 FR941116-0-00023 One commenter requested clarification of the pricing of replacement commodities as described in §51&hyph;6.13(a). The Committee has revised the provision to make it clear that the fair market price is the one set for the replacement commodity, not the price for the commodity being replaced. Another commenter objected to the substitution of the word ``recently'' for ``previously'' in the description of a replacement commodity in §51&hyph;6.13(a) as one ``which has not been recently procured.'' The commenter recommended the use of a specific period of time in this context, such as ``one year.'' The Committee believes this recommendation would make the provision unnecessarily restrictive, particularly if a one-year limit were adopted, and would deny the Committee the flexibility it needs to respond to individual circumstances. One commenter objected to the term ``other variations'' in new §51&hyph;6.13(b), which extends Procurement List status to additional sizes, colors, or other variations of a commodity on the Procurement List if these similar commodities have not been recently procured. Another commenter, on the other hand, applauded this additional size, color, and variation terminology as clarifying the scope of what a Procurement List commodity is. Like the ``essentially the same'' concept discussed earlier in this notice, the Committee considers the language in §51&hyph;6.13(b) which the commenters have noted to be an important part of defining the scope of a Procurement List commodity in the new Government procurement environment. The term ``other variations'' is necessary to reach items which are essentially the same as Procurement List commodities where the difference cannot be defined in terms of size or color. Consequently, deletion of the term from §51&hyph;6.13(b) would deny the Committee the flexibility it needs to carry out its mission. A commenter suggested that the Committee regulations should contain a provision allowing contracting officers to terminate for default nonprofit agencies which fail to perform as required, and/or to apply liquidated damages in such instances. Because of the differences in the JWOD Program from competitive contracting, particularly the statutory mandatory source requirement, the Committee has long used an alternative method of resolving contractor performance problems. This method is set forth in Part 51&hyph;6 of the Committee's regulations, and includes a dispute resolution procedure which involves the central nonprofit agency concerned in situations which cannot be resolved between the nonprofit agency and the contracting officer, with a right of appeal to the Committee, as well as a purchase exception procedure which affords the contracting activity relief from the mandatory source requirement in cases where the nonprofit agency truly cannot meet the Government's requirements. The Committee has also allowed price reductions and other consideration in return for late deliveries, in appropriate circumstances. In light of the existence of these procedures, which have worked well over the years to minimize disputes and speed their resolution, the Committee does not believe that the approach suggested by the commenter would be an improvement, and it would deny the Committee the flexibility it needs to make its program run effectively. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this revision of the Committee regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the revisions basically update and clarify program policies and procedures and do not essentially change the impact of the regulations on small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to this regulatory revision because it contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements as defined in that Act and its regulations. Executive Order No. 12866 The Committee has been exempted from the regulatory review requirements of the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Additionally, this revision to the Committee's regulations is not a significant regulatory action as defined in the Executive Order.
