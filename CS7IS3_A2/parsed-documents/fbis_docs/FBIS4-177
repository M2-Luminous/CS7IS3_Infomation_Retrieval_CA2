FBIS4-177 "drafr064_c_94030" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 4 Apr South African Press Review for 4 Apr MB0404115294 MB0404115294 BFN [Editorial Report] BEELD Full Security Force Deployment Needed for Elections -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 29 March points out in a page-8 editorial that "the chaos and bloodshed in the center of Johannesburg is the last straw." "Regardless of who is responsible for the tragedy, such lawlessness cannot be tolerated. The decision by obscure so-called traditional Zulu leaders to call a protest meeting in the city center at short notice and without proper liaison with the police and other interested parties was stupid and irresponsible...but that does not give ANC members or whoever it was who fired on the marchers from surrounding buildings the right to act in this manner." "In the future, the government, together with the Transitional Executive Council, must take firm action to prevent a repetition of such events. A great responsibility also lies with political leaders to discipline their supporters and stop unnecessary shows of strength." "Peace-loving and law-abiding South Africans -- and they are by far in the majority -- demand that in the remaining weeks before the election the security forces be deployed in their entirety in order to protect the democratic process." Threats by Nuclear Experts `Unforgivable Blackmail' -- "Certain experts who were involved in South Africa's nuclear weapons program are now threatening to expose secret information if they are not given good retrenchment packages. That is unforgivable blackmail, and destroys any sympathy which they could have received for losing their jobs," states a second editorial on page 8 of BEELD. "South Africa's nuclear weapons program was conducted mainly during the time when the country was an outcast from the international community." "In normal circumstances and with the wisdom of hindsight a different course could have been followed, but that is now of purely academic interest because the country wisely chose not to proceed with the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Those who now seek to strike gold through blackmail ought to be prosecuted." RAPPORT Singling Out KwaZulu-Natal Questioned -- The Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 3 April comments in a page-20 editorial on the state of emergency that was declared in kwaZulu-Natal, saying that "serious questions remain unanswered. For example, whether a `free and fair election' will be at all possible." "But one of the most important questions remaining is why only kwaZulu-Natal was singled out for such drastic action. This week, the Johannesburg city center was the scene of events the likes of which one sees regularly in the media reportage on Sarajevo...but no state of emergency was declared." "Why have other dangerous target areas been excluded?" "Is kwaZulu-Natal more dangerous than Transkei, where it has long been suspected that hit squads launch their attacks from? And where the Transkei leader recently informed the National Party that they can conduct their election campaign but only from inside armored vehicles? This selectivity makes people wonder." Election Approaching Amid Crises -- In her column on page 21 of RAPPORT, Anne-Marie Mischke writes: "`It is not easy to rule a country in a transitional period like this.' True words, spoken by the man who ought to know, President F. W. de Klerk, in reply to a question about whether he is still in control." "But that is putting it mildly. Since the start of the year the government has had to deal with one crisis after another. Just look at the Zulu march through central Johannesburg earlier this week in the wake of the previous week; the crisis involving the police generals and the Goldstone report; events in Bophuthatswana and Ciskei; the prison uprising over the right of prisoners to vote...." Aggravating the situation is the question of where power lies -- with the Transitional Executive Council or the government. The ANC "is so convinced of a massive election victory that it behaves with limitless self-confidence," which has created the "feeling among many that a kind of vacuum has developed, with the old almost past but the new not quite in place yet. It is as though everyone wants to find a gap, challenge authority, strike, demand, march. Perhaps that is why even the police generals last week used the opportunity to growl back at the state president." "Should the transition have been handled differently? No one can really speak out on the matter one way or the other." Now "it is a matter of pinching one's eyes shut and hoping it passes quickly. There is no turning back."
