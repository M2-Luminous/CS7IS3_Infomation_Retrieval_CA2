"(North Korea) definitely has nuclear arms," Ozawa said during a morning television interview. Ozawa, one of the main architects for the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, however, did not give any evidence to back up his statements about the North's suspected nuclear arms development program. "It (North Korea) is an unbelievably fanatical society," Ozawa said. "There will be a battle to see who inherits power after Kim Il- song. There might be an upheaval on the Korean peninsula," he said.
