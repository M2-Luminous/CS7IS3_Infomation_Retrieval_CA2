The reform of personnel system must be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, and closely centered around the main theme of economic construction. We must establish a personnel system in compliance with the demands of market economy. The implementation of the state civil service system is aimed at establishing a socialist cadre administration system with Chinese characteristics, strengthening and invigorating government operations, improving government personnel's quality and efficiency, and making the government's personnel administration system scientific and legal. Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: While focusing on promoting the civil service system, we must vigorously carry out personnel system reform in institutions and enterprises.
