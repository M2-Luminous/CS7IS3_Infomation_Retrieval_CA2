Now, only 16 high-ranking military officers who are still finalizing the details of an agreement on their surrender remain in Lima. Meanwhile, in Caracas, Retired Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias, in his second day of freedom following 26 months in prison, placed a wreath at the National Pantheon and later held a news conference at the Caracas Athenaeum. Jose Marcano filed this report. [Begin recording] [Marcano] Commander Chavez greeted the crowd gathered at the gate of the National Pantheon before heading to the Caracas Athenaeum, where he answered all questions posed by domestic and foreign reporters. Chavez answered the simplest to the most complex questions with poise and self-control. In terms of economics, he only made a brief analysis and criticized the eight plans implemented by the democratic administrations. According to Chavez, the Sosa economic plan does not offer alternatives for employment and investment. Politics is Chavez's priority at this time, but he said he must first resurrect Bolivarian ideology and the commitment to obtain power. For the time being, Chavez said he will push for the convening of a constituent assembly, taking advantage of the fact the 4 February events are still fresh in people's minds. This, he said, would be the best way to enter the political scene. Chavez explained he made no promises to Dr. Caldera's Government in exchange for his presidential pardon. He admitted there are differences among the members of the 200 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement, and he said he will work to unify it and turn it into a political movement that defends the interests of the people, without creating a [word indistinct] structure. [Chavez] We are ready to assist the government as much as possible. The only thing we can do is to make recommendations. For example, when we stand up and call for a constituent assembly, we are making a recommendation. I ask the government of Dr. Caldera to heed this recommendation. Instead of giving Congress constituent powers, as I believe some sectors and even the president himself have suggested, we believe this would be a mistake because those responsible for the national crisis have become entrenched in Congress. Are we going to give them more constituent powers so they can finish destroying what we have left of our fatherland? No. Let us call the people to a constituent assembly. This is a recommendation we are making to the government. We hope the government heeds our call. If the government wants to talk to us, we are ready to talk to the government. [end recording] Commander Chavez today presided over various activities in the western part of the capital. Tomorrow he will visit Sabana Grande Boulevard and Chacaito, and in the evening he will leave for his home state of Barinas, where he will meet with his fellow citizens.
