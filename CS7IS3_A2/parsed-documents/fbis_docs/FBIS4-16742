INTERFAX correspondents report that this decision was taken at the session of the Chechen Government on Friday [15 April]. In an interview with INTERFAX the Chechen president's aide Soltmurat Apazov said that this means raising the status of talks to the level of inter-state ones. According to the Chechen president Djokhar Dudayev, the step was taken to regulate the relationships between the two states. As it has become known to Interfax, the matter was discussed in telephone talks between the Dudayev and his representative in Moscow. This emphasizes the fact, said Dudayev, that the Chechen Republic does not consider itself the subject of the Russian Federation.
