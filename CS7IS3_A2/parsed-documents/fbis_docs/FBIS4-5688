On the 11th of April Japan-based formations of assault planes and pursuit-assault planes flew to the U.S. Airforce bases in South Korea. Earlier, on the 10th, F-15s, F-4s, FA-18s, AV-8s, EA-6s and other types of warplanes based in Japan and the Pacific were deployed in South Korea. In another development, on April 10 and 11, C-5 supercolossal strategic transport planes and C-130 and C-141 transport planes loaded with a large number of troops and combat equipment landed in a U.S. Airforce base in South Korea from the U.S. mainland and Pacific bases and the airlifted troops and equipment were deployed in operational theatres. The Korean people and People's Army are watching with sharp vigilance the war preparations of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets. They will mete out a stern punishment to the enemy, if he ventures aggression.
