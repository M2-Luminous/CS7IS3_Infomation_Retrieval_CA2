It was the hardest year for the Georgian people, when the fate of Georgian statehood was hanging in balance. Political cataclysms, rampant separatism, internal disorder, and betrayal had a negative effect on the country's agriculture, which was in difficulties because of both objective and subjective reasons. The country's industrial potential dwindled so dramatically that it can now produce at only 20 percent capacity. Social discomfort and peoples' hardships reached a critical limit. Yet 1993 was the year of Georgia's salvation. It was the year of bravery of Georgia's sons and the halo on the ascension of Georgia's soul. It was the year of true democracy, the victory over an attempt to establish neo-Bolshevism, and the final turn toward the irreversible process of Georgia's unity. Georgia's Cabinet of Ministers believes that the practical measures carried out in 1993 for minimally accommodating the social security of the socially insecure strata were not enough. We are hoping to use all of our efforts and resources to resolve this issue next year. I would like to tell you that as of 1 February wages will rise considerably. You know that as a result of the head of state's efforts and through his immediate participation, many countries around the world extended a helping hand to us and alleviated our situation considerably. This aid will continue, but we can be saved only if Georgia's economy is restored and if it starts to function at full force. The prospect for this has become a reality as a result of the agreements signed in Ashgabat. Serious investment in the republic's economy by individual concerns and firms is emerging. The only indespensible condition for a full functioning of the country's potential abilities is, of course, stabilization. Georgia's cabinet of ministers will do its best to secure stability in 1994. I would like to assure you that a battle against mafia clans and organized crime will be stepped up even more. The New Year will enter everyone's homes in several hours. May it carry peace, kindness, and happiness for all of you. I wish you a Happy New Year. Otar Patsatsia, prime minister of the Republic of Georgia.
