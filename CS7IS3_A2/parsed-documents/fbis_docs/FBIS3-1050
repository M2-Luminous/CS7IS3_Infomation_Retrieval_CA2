The party had been granted an extension until eight this morning to submit its adjusted list of candidates to the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] but failed to do so. The chairman of the party, Mr. Sampie Styger, said he'd received a telephone call from the party leader, Dr. Lucas Mangope, informing that it was not possible to draw up the list of candidates as people were afraid to stand because of intimidation. A spokesman for the IEC said the commission was still awaiting official communication from the party. Until then their initial registration would stand. If advised of the intimidation the IEC would ask their monitors to investigate and report to the commission.
