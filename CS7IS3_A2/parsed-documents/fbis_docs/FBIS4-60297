Following is the text: Brother struggler Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and commander in chief of the Armed Forces; brother members of the Presidential Council: In the name of your brothers and sons -- the valiant fighters, the protectors of the revolution, unity, and democracy, who are holding out at all the positions of honor and sacrifice across the unified Yemeni state -- we take pleasure in extending heartfelt congratulations on the advent of the blessed 'Id al-Adha and on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the Yemeni merger, whereby our people rehabilitated Yemen's history and which embodies their ambitions for a dignified, decent, and free life. Our country is going through delicate circumstances as a result of secessionists and apostates in the Socialist Party leadership sparking off war against our people and the valiant members of the Armed Forces. Members of the Armed Forces are thus having to cope with the manifold task of protecting unity and democracy and consolidating constitutional legality and deterring the forces of secession and rebellion that want the homeland to lapse into the pre-22 May 1990 era and to wreck the unity for which our people have striven for so long and which they have come to regard as the noblest and dearest national objective for which worthy martyrs have fallen. Your sons and brothers have, over the past two weeks, fought the battle of honor and dignity in defense of unity and democracy against the remnants of the gang of apostasy and the forces of injustice and aggression that have consistently plotted against our people's accomplishments to advance personal ends that, thanks be to God, have come to nothing. The defenders of the sanctity and every inch of Yemeni territory reiterate their genuine loyalty under the fluttering banner of the eternal Republic of Yemen. They renew the pledge to your dedicated political leadership and to their people that they will ever be up to their heavy national responsibilities. They will be prepared to sacrifice their souls for Yemen, for its pride, stability, and prosperity so that it can take its rightful place in the community of nations. We reiterate that the Armed Forces in these decisive moments are better prepared than ever to protect the country's sovereignty and the gains for the immortal Yemeni revolution, most of all unity, democracy, and constitutional legality. We give our word to God and the people to safeguard these accomplishments against the meddling of hatemongers to the last drop of our blood. Once more, please accept our heartfelt congratulations. We wish you every success in spearheading the developmental and democratic drive. Many happy returns of the 'Id.
