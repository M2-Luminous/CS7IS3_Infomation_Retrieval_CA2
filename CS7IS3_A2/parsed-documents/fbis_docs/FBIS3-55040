Konnov; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] [Konnov] A great deal has changed, both in our own country and in the countries of the former socialist camp. The stormy debate about who owes whom more has subsided. The bombastic statements about proletarian internationalism and fraternal assistance have disappeared. What remains is business as usual. In this respect the Vietsovpetro Russian-Vietnamese joint venture has stood the test of time. Established a decade ago, it produced its first oil in 1986. And recently workers were being congratulated in the terse language of posters on the achievement of having extracted 20 million tonnes of oil. The banner slogans may look somewhat naive and old-fashioned today, but they must not obscure the main point: An entire community of Russian oil workers is living and working in the south of Vietnam. Oil extraction is helping to pay Vietnam's debts. And yields are rising. A new floating rig is being readied for dispatch here. It is intended for the White Dragon deposit -- the richest oil deposit on Vietnam's south coast.
