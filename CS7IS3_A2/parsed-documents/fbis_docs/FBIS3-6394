Police said the two seamen, one 19 and the other 20, of the Yokosuka U.S. Naval base, were suspected of attacking an employee of a local public office as he was returning home around Wednesday midnight. The 31-year-old victim told police that three black men approached him on the pretext of asking directions, sprayed him with a mace-like substance and then punched him in the face. Police said the two arrested men were among a group of three persons who fled when they were approached. One of the three escaped pursuit. The 20-year-old was identified as Bernard Constantine, a petty officer, second class. The name of the 19-year-old was not released because of his status as a minor. An investigation is continuing to see if the arrested seamen are linked to two muggings on Wednesday night perpetrated by a group of three black men.
