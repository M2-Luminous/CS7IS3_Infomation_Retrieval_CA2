"Dozens of tanks, troop transporters and missiles are concentrated in the Shabwah region," a congress spokesman told the press here. Military units based in the north have not moved any of their missiles, he insisted, despite allegations to the contrary from the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), which operates in the south and whose leader, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, is in conflict with Salih. The YSP said that southern-based units along the former border had seized a shipment of 40 anti-aircraft missiles from the north. But the GPC spokesman charged that such reports were designed "to camouflage troop movements (from the south), deceive public opinion and divert attention away from the refusal of the YSP to sign (an) agreement in Amman this Sunday." The draft agreement was aimed at ending a dispute over the administration of the country that has plagued Yemen since last August. Despite the political unification of the north and the south in May 1990, the armies from the two regions have never merged. The GPC spokesman accused the YSP of "setting new conditions, revealing its intention of going back" on the accord, which was reached January 18. Salih and al-Bid were due to sign the agreement in Amman on Sunday, Arab diplomats in the Jordanian capital said Wednesday, but Yemeni officials warned it was unlikely the two sides would be ready by then. A member of a mediation committee, 'Abdallah al-Jifri, predicted that the accord would probably be signed "just before Ramadan," the Moslem month of dawn-to-dusk fasting expected to start around February 12.
