In a letter, Silva refutes the statements made by influential U.S. Senator John Kerry against the Colombian Government and legal system that were published in THE WASHINGTON POST. The ambassador said: The Colombian Government has made enormous sacrifices to defend its democracy, so it is hasty to say that Colombia is a narcodemocracy. Referring to the Cali Cartel's alleged control over some areas of the economy and media, Silva said organized crime tries to infiltrate certain areas, just as it does in the United States, but the government and legitimate businessmen in those sectors do not tolerate it. Another part of the letter stated: The abolition of extradition is a sovereign decision made by the Constituent Assembly, elected by the people. In conclusion, the ambassador admited that the government has and will continue to have differences with the prosecutor general, but he emphasized that government branches cooperate and are independent.
