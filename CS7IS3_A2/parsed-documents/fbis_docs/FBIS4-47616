(Jerusalem AL-NAHAR 25 Mar 94) West Bank Journalists Expect Heavy Censorship Under Self-Rule West Bank journalists believe that the new Palestinian authority will heavily censor the West Bank-Gaza press under self-rule. According to Al-QUDS journalist 'Ali Jiddah, "Very regrettably, I say that in the coming phase, the Palestinian press will not be in better condition than its current condition.... I say this by virtue of my full awareness of the Palestinian forces' miserable history of democratic action. Moreover, the incoming government will focus its efforts on cementing and entrenching the mainstays of its rule, which necessarily means that it will try to curb the voice and echo of the forces that are likely to pose a threat to this government and to its authority.... especially since the statements of some Palestinian officials point in this direction. I particularly note Hakam Bal'awi's statement on how the opposition will be dealt with in the future." Journalist Ghazi Bani 'Awdah comments: "I don't believe that press conditions under the self-rule government will be fundamentally different from the current conditions. All signs indicate in one way or another that oppression and persecution will be the lot of any voice or pen that writes about real issues and that doesn't sing the praises of autonomy....Let us learn a lesson from the recent expulsion of Hijazi, a journalist, from FILASTIN AL- THAWRAH and from numerous other incidents." Majid 'Aruri from Sanabil Press Bureau in Ramallah says: "Autonomy will employ its authority to prevent the emergence of any voices that criticize autonomy. This task will be easy in the absence of a press union body capable of confronting this policy. The union body (the Journalists League) is controlled and dominated by the group supporting self-rule, even though it incorporates other parties. However, these parties' role is ineffective and not influential." According to journalist Hani al-'Isawi from AL-QUDS, "If there is a press under self-rule, it will be a yellow press, i.e., government press, solely. It is feared that whoever violates this (rule) will be pursued. Therefore, there will be no need for a special press censor, because all agencies under autonomy will be in the service of government propaganda solely." (Jerusalem AL-BAYADIR AL-SIYASI 26 Feb 94) National Institutes Office on Merger With PLO Dr. Samir al-Tamimi, head of the Office of National Institutes in Gaza and the West Bank, says that PLO institutions and those in the West Bank and Gaza Strip will merge during the transitional period. He listed the most difficult aspects of the merger as: 1) Determining the positions of local organization and their leadership (personality conflicts are feared). 2) Changing institutions from personal fiefdoms (which he says is predominant) to organizations of common concern. 3) Financial difficulties (from which the institutions currently suffer). 4) Proliferation of similar institutions which provide the same services (they must have unified national institutions). Dr. al-Tamimi said that he is trying to get a study done on how these institutions will be merged, and he expects that his office will meet with the PLO to plan the merger at some point in the future. He pointed out that West Bank and Gaza institutions are the foundational institutions, and that the external institutions are its branches. He said that the idea of forming the Office of National Institutes sprang from the need to have a centralized office to oversee and organize cooperation between local institutions and PLO institutions. Previously, al-Tamimi said, local institutes suffered from a lack of direct contact with the PLO. In addition, there were many institutes doing similar work under different names, which he considers a waste of time and money. He divided West Bank-Gaza institutes into the following categories: cultural, authors, journalists, arts, women, students, charitable, teachers, clubs, youth, workers, educational, engineers, refugees, refugee camps. (Jerusalem AL-NAHAR 19 Mar 94) Plan for Industrial Zone in Nabulus Husam Hajjawi, the head of the Nabulus Chamber of Commerce, announced at the Chamber's most recent meeting that steps are being taken to establish an industrial zone in Nabulus. Hajjawi said that the need for a Nabulus industrial zone arises from the high price of land in the area which has hindered industrial investment, and the 60 percent-plus unemployment rate among the city's workforce. He said that the cost of constructing the industrial zone will be between $15 and $20 million, according to preliminary estimates, and that contact has been made with European and American investors. The European Union has said it will finance a portion of the zone's expenses, and American Near East Refugee Aid (ANERA) is reportedly prepared to offer $1 million immediately for the implementation of the first phase of the project. According to Hajjawi, building and engineering industries are the most important industries for the zone in view of the anticipated construction activity during the transitional period, when it is expected that at least 150,000 to 180,000 housing units will be built. This will necessitate factories for such products as electrical wiring, cable, aluminum, and doors. Hajjawi acknowledged that there will be stiff competition from Israeli industries, and that Palestinian workers will need training. He said that a plan is being drawn up to create specialized training institutes in cooperation with West Bank universities and institutions. The Nabulus Chamber of Commerce has encountered some difficulties with the Israeli Government regarding plans for the industrial zone: The Israelis have required that the zone's administration be run by the private sector and not by the public sector, thereby delaying implementation of the project. However, Hajjawi said, many investors have agreed to participate, and efforts continue to establish a zone run by the public sector.

Jordanian Cooperation Organization employees remain on the job in the West Bank, and the organization continues to task them with a substantial amount of work, which they continue to do. (Jerusalem AL-NAHAR 22 Mar 94) Population Study Compares Number of 'Martyrs,' Births in Gaza According to a study done by researcher Rishad al-Madani, there were approximately 207,600 births in Gaza between the time the intifadah began in 1987 up through the end of 1993.
