We need not only reforms, but also cooperation with other parties." It seems that his remark indicates that Hata decided he has no choice but to seek cooperation with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] over the issue of the draft for redrawing single-seat electoral districts for the House of Representatives and other issues to approve the fiscal 1994 budget, which is the most urgent task. On his responsibility as a person who appointed former justice minister, the prime minister stated: "By doing some soul-searching regarding the past history, Japan will candidly apologize for what it did and teach next generations. We will show our resolve by exerting efforts to prevent tragedies like war."
