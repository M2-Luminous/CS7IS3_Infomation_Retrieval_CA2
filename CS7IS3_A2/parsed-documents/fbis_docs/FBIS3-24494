V. Lesnikov, V. I. Pustovoyt, A. A. Khrimyan; UDC 621.373.826] [Abstract] A method for determining the quantum effectiveness of photo-detectors is described. This method is based on the analysis of the photocurrent dispersion fluctuations with a priori specified statistics of the radiation field. Thus, the spectral sensitivity of the photo-detector can be determined with a single electron formation process of the photocurrent. A device for experimental determination of the effectiveness of a silicon photodiode FD-7K was constructed. Its block diagram is provided and the experimental procedures are described. Light- emitting diodes AL-307 and AL-107, with _l_[.sup]max[/]=0.67 and 0.95 ï¿½m, respectively, were used as sources of radiation. Before determining the quantum effectiveness of the photo-detector, curves of the shot current dispersion for different radiation intensities were first obtained, and are shown in a graph.
