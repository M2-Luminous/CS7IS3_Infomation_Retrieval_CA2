He then gave a news conference. From Geneva, Roy Brunton. [Brunton] Max van der Stoel has been special rapporteur on Iraq for three years. This report, he said, is a landmark. For the first time a Commission report has named two individuals and accused them of holding, quote, the most responsibility of a special and individual nature for serious human rights violations, unquote. The two persons named are Iraqi President Saddam Husayn and his cousin 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, the minister of defense. Both men hold several other positions in the hierarchy of power in Iraq. In addition to accusing them of crimes against the peace, such as the invasion of Kuwait, the report says that serious violations of human rights against the population of Iraq, both in times of war and peace, involved crimes against humanity committed under and pursuant to their orders. As an example it cites the use of chemical weapons against numerous Kurdish communities in northern Iraq. Max van der Stoel was asked whether he thought President Saddam Husayn ultimately should stand trial for crimes against humanity. [Begin van der Stoel recording] One thing is clear, that is the responsibility, that the concentration of power is such that there is no decision of any importance for which he doesn't (?currently) have direct responsibility. To give you one example, in 10 days during the [word indistinct] campaign he signed 500 death sentences, so that shows that he has a very direct responsibility and the whole structure is such that the real power is concentrated in the so-called Revolution Command Council, and in the Revolution Command Council President Saddam plays the key role and in fact the decisive role. [end recording] [Brunton] The report says President Saddam Husayn must be considered directly responsible for the Iraqi population's present suffering, this due to his refusal to comply with the UN Security Council resolution under which Iraq would export oil with some of the proceeds being used for purchase of imported basic necessities. It also accuses him of being responsible for driving the population out of the southern marshes by depriving them of the means to sustain themselves as a result of the draining of the marshes in which they have lived for generations. Among annexes to the report are copies of official letters sent to the authorities as routine. One refers to an illiterate nine-year-old girl blamed by officials for subversive activities with a warrant issued for her arrest. Another letter concerns the killing and decapitation of a mentally retarded man described as an Iranian agent. The letter says the squad that killed him took his head to the General Directorate of Security. Roy Brunton, Geneva.
