Fujii was replying at the day's session of the House of Representatives budget committee in response to an opposition questioner, who pressed him to account for the money from the Enyu- Kai, an association of salt wholesalers, whose business is under the supervision of the Finance Ministry. Fujii said, "the money was a gratuity for my services, as I retired from a post in the industry association." The finance minister said he worked for the body "since 1976 or 1977," and that he returned the money "so that it would not trigger misunderstanding." The questioner, Takashi Fukaya of the Liberal Democratic Party, said that Fujii contravened a legal obligation to report to tax authorities the acceptance of the money "as personal income." Fujii earlier said he reported the money as an untaxable political donation to the Home Affairs Ministry. He said his two officially registered political fund-raising organizations received the money last August. The Enyu-Kai is an affiliate of the Association of Salt Dealers' Cooperatives, to which Fujii had served as a longtime adviser. It acts as a "political organization" for salt wholesalers. Fujii said, "there is nothing wrong in the fact that money exchanged hands between these political organizations." Fujii, now a key figure in Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] spearheaded by Ichiro Ozawa, a chief strategist of the ruling coalition, was an LDP legislator until last June, when he and dozens of other LDP lawmakers renounced the scandal-tainted party to form Shinseito. The YOMIURI SHIMBUN, the nation's largest-circulating daily, reported on Tuesday that the industry body gave the donation in congratulating him on being given the post of finance minister in a cabinet formation last August.
