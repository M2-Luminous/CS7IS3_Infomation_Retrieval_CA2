It seems the Foreign Ministry is concerned about a breakup of the cooperative system with the United States, which may take place during the final stage of the U.S.-North Korean negotiations. The Government's Position The government opposes the U.S. proposal to turn the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula into an international treaty. That is, the government contends that because the joint declaration of denuclearization signed in 1992 is not a treaty between countries but an agreement signed within the nation, the government does not need to turn it into an international treaty. The government believes the issue of North Korea constantly keeping nuclear reprocessing facilities, even after adopting the joint declaration of denuclearization, should be resolved through North-South dialogue. In other words, the government believes that the government should persuade North Korea to destroy the nuclear reprocessing facilities through the Joint Nuclear Control Committee and, then, abide by the joint declaration of denuclearization. A government official explained that "the U.S. proposal to turn the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula into an international treaty is a result of considering North Korea's demand for a guarantee that a nuclear preemptive strike on the DPRK will not take place." That is, there is a possibility that because North Korea indeed regards as serious a nuclear threat from the United States and others, it may stick to nuclear development. Thus, in order to ease North Korea's threat, it is necessary for the nuclear-possessing countries to promise not to conduct a nuclear attack on North Korea. Government officials have analyzed that the United States is intending to supplement the weak points of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) by turning the joint declaration of denuclearization into an international treaty. The current NPT regulations stipulate that NPT member countries can have nuclear reprocessing facilities and inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are only required of the plutonium produced from the nuclear reprocessing process. Accordingly, if the joint declaration of denuclearization is turned into an international treaty, North and South Korea cannot have nuclear reprocessing facilities so suspicions of nuclear development on the Korean peninsula will be fully abolished. There was a (Tulatert) protocol signed by South American countries, including Brazil and Argentina, in 1967 in which the nuclear-possessing countries acknowledged the contents that had been agreed upon by the relevant countries. At that time, when the South American countries resolved not to develop and possess nuclear weapons, they called on the nuclear- possessing countries, including the United States, to acknowledge the guarantee of refraining from a nuclear attack on them. Thus, the nuclear-possessing countries turned the agreement into an international treaty through a protocol. It can be said that the United States has tried to apply this precedent to the Korean peninsula. Reaction From the Academic World Scholars generally oppose the U.S. proposal to turn the joint declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula into an international treaty. Dr. Chon Song-hun from the Institute of National Unification said: "To turn the declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula into an international treaty, the nuclear issue of the Northeast Asian countries surrounding the Korean peninsula, including China and Japan, as well, should be discussed simultaneously." Dr. Chon stressed that "either the whole Northeast Asia area should be denuclearized or nuclear-possessing countries should clearly assure that they will not launch a nuclear attack against North and South Korea." Professor Yun Tok-min from the Research Institute of Diplomatic and Security Affairs, too, insisted: "If North and South Korea are to declare to the world that they will not possess nuclear reprocessing facilities permanently, all Northeast Asian countries should also clearly promise that they will not possess nuclear reprocessing facilities." Concerning the nuclear reprocessing facilities in North Korea Professor Yun also stressed that "this problem should be solved according to the principle of solving problems between the North and the South." Professor Yi Sam-song from Hallim University said that from a long-term perspective nuclear reprocessing facilities should be completely eliminated from the Korean peninsula. He said that nuclear reprocessing facilities themselves are synonymous with a nuclear waste processing plant and that, therefore, there is a high possibility of creating environmental pollution. He also said that due to the development of the technology of nuclear energy, there is a high possibility of developing substitute fuel, which is more stable and efficient than plutonium extracted through the nuclear reprocessing process. Professor Yi said, however, that we should prudently consider the fact that the issue of abolishing reprocessing facilities on the Korean peninsula should be settled in consideration of the appropriate process to be taken and of mutuality [sanghosong]. What professor Yi insists is that the issue of abolishing nuclear reprocessing facilities on the Korean peninsula should be pushed ahead in combination with the issue of denuclearizing the whole Northeast Asia area after the nuclear negotiations, which are being held between North Korea and the United States, reach a comprehensive solution. In other words, in its negotiations with North Korea the United States should, first of all, discuss the issue of abolishing nuclear reprocessing facilities after it has cleared North Korea's apprehensions of a security threat. Only through such a process, can the joint declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula be developed into one which declares that the countries surrounding the Korean peninsula, such as China and Japan, should not possess nuclear reprocessing facilities. In conclusion, many scholars hold that the issue of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula should be solved in accordance with the principle of solving problems between North and South Korea, without destroying the potential for possessing nuclear reprocessing facilities in case of need in the future.
