It was only after some time that they found out that the program was not being broadcast because the transmitters in Velke Kostolany and Poprad had been switched off. Slovak Telecommunications issued a statement explaining the reason for the cutoff. Vladimir Ondrovic, director general of Slovak Telecommunications, gave more details at a news conference this afternoon. [Begin Ondrovic recording] I was invited this Monday, 14 March, to the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Public Works, where I was presented with a document that said that Slovak Telecommunications was suspending transmission of RFE broadcasts via transmitters in Velke Kostolany and Poprad. The document was entitled "Cessation of a Contract or Cancellation of a Contract." This cannot be a cancellation of an agreement because there is one more transmitter, the one in Presov transmitting at 14 kilowatts. This transmitter is continuing transmissions and has not been switched off. [Vladimir] Zeman, director of [the ministry's communications] section, asked me to sign this document and send it to RFE. He did so verbally, I received no written instruction. Director Kuban, who is in charge of all transmitters, be they for radio, TV, or RFE transmissions, was also present. I have to admit that both of us signed the document at that very moment. Mr. Zeman then told me that he would consult Minister Hofbauer on 14 March over the matter and that the document would then be presented to the government, where he would want to have it approved. On Monday afternoon at about 1400 GMT, Mr. Zeman came with other documents or, rather, with the same documents, which had not been signed but had been printed anew. He wanted us to sign these documents. I personally told him that I would not sign this document and that I would not send the fax to RFE. And that was what happened. I called the executive [of Slovak Telecommunications] at 1600 GMT. The executive discussed the matter, and we decided that this would harm Slovakia and that we would not issue an order to switch off RFE. Yesterday--that is, on 15 March--I was summoned to the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Public Works. Director Kuban was summoned as well. I was showed a document on recalling the director of Slovak Telecommunications from his post. [as heard] Exactly at the same time, Kuban, who is the director of a branch of the telecommunications directorate, was shown a letter of appointment authorizing him to direct Slovak Telecommunications. After having received this document, Mr. Kuban began to take steps, and, without any instruction to do so, of his own will, he had the transmission of RFE broadcasts switched off last night. I recalled Mr. Kuban from his post as director of a branch of the telecommunications directorate at 0720 GMT this morning in this very room. Subsequently, I issued an instruction to switch the transmission of RFE broadcasts on again.
