During a recess just a few moments ago, conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso held a briefing [preceding word in English] on the first day's work. During this first day, the conference heard a speech by Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of Cuba's parliament, on Cuba's current political institutions. Later, Abel Prieto, president of the National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists, made a speech. Prieto commented on the culture, on being Cuban, and on things Cuban [la cultura, cubanidad, y cubania], a topic that is at this very moment being discussed behind closed doors. About the discussions that took place following the lecturers' speeches, spokesman Alfonso stressed to the press: [Begin Alfonso recording] I would like to point out here something I think is important for you to know about: the tone of respect and high-mindedness of that discussion. I think that discussion was really -- and I have a certain amount of parliamentary experience on which to base what I am going to say -- exemplary as to civility and depth of ideas. It could best be described as a discussion characterized by mutual respect, with everyone who spoke there expressing his opinion freely. A number of questions that are for the first time -- at least as far as I know -- being discussed, were spoken about in a totally open and frank manner. The climate was extremely relaxed, respectful, and of high quality regarding both the level of ideas and the nobility of aims. As far as I am concerned, in my opinion, it is an excellent beginning to this conference. [end recording] Miguel Alfonso confirmed that nine Cubans spoke during the morning -- Cubans who, among other topics, brought up the possibility of maintaining a Cuban identity despite the fact that one lives outside Cuba and who expressed concern over certain problems of corruption that might be brought about by the economic changes being made in Cuba. According to Alfonso, the speakers said that the U.S. blockade is the key element for understanding the current situation on the island and the need to eradicate that blockade. Lastly, they urged the Cubans inside Cuba to understand the emigres; and the emigres, in turn, advocated not forgetting the Cubans on the island. Last, Miguel Alfonso brought the list of participants up to date. There are already 210 emigres on that list, among them 156 who live in the United States, who approved drawing up an official directory of the conference, but with a private character, to be circulated only among the participants and the secretariat [not further identified]. That is all we have right now, Cesar. In just a few moments, journalist Maria Elena Alonso will make a collage of the participants' impressions during this first day of work, and Zenaida Costales will present an exclusive interview with one of those exiled in the United States. Roberto Cavada wishes you a good evening, Cubans.
