Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna: [Begin recording] According to a report to be submitted to a special Board of Governors' meeting on the result of the North's nuclear facilities inspections, it has been revealed for the first time that the IAEA conducted a non-destructive analysis, involving neutron and gamma measurement to grasp the substance and replacement timing of the spent fuel rods of the 5-megawatt reactor's spent fuel storage. Regarding this, nuclear experts analyzed that when things are taken together from the recent inspection results, North Korea has replaced some nuclear fuel rods since last February. North Korea had maintained that it has not replaced the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor's fuel rods. They said the result of the analysis of the nuclear fuel rod counter [kyesugi] which watches the movement of the spent nuclear fuel will prove this. The report stressed that the continuity of the inspection can be maintained only when inspections of the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor are resumed after six weeks. The report also revealed that an IAEA inspection team was restricted from making inspections -- such as extracting samples and wastes of nuclear materials, and measuring radioactivity -- from the six major facilities -- including a plutonium refinery facility inside the radiochemical laboratory, a nuclear waste storage, a reprocessing facility, and a radioactivity gas filtering device [kicheyogwasisol], thus hinting that North Korea has supplemented the indoor facilities of the reprocessing facility for the last year.
