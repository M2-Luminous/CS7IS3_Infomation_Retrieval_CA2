The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper front-pages a series of articles on this event with the general heading "Feat of the Besieged Leningrad is an Immortal Symbol of Courage and Staunchness". "True, veterans of the battle of Leningrad and Leningraders who lived through the siege, do not look, to our great shame, like victors decorated with laurel wreaths. The state and society are not very lavish with signs of attention to them," the newspaper continues. "Paying great homage to them, let us be worthy of their feat." The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper writes about the musical comedy theatre which worked in Leningrad almost during all the 900 days of the city's siege. The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper devotes the entire front and a considerable part of the second page to reminiscences of besieged Leningraders as well as to photographs depicting those difficult years. "Reminiscencing the Leningrad siege," writes retired naval captain Leopold Sirotkin, "I ask myself: could we withstand a similar situation today, following all changes of the recent past in our country? I cannot find an unequivocal answer. The situation in our country has changed very much." The IZVESTIYA writes about a recent trip to the city of Oryol (central Russia) by Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. The newspaper notes that the premier's trip to Oryol "in close company with main opponents of ousted Yegor GaYdar (former vice-premier) and Boris Fedorov (former finance minister) looked like a political demonstration" against the background of the still uncomplete drama of forming a new cabinet and resolute ousting "antagonists of easy distribution of budget funds". At the same time, IZVESTIYA continues, the concluding speech by Chernomyrdin at a conference on the revival of central Russia, which took place in Oryol, "threw into confusion the uninitiated, since Chernomyrdin praised the policy pursued by Gaydar and Fedorov ousted from the cabinet". The same newspaper features Fedorov's interview with IZVESTIYA and the INTERFAX news agency. He points to the absence of sufficient powers to conduct "his own financial policy" as the main reason for his refusal to take the post of finance minister in the renewed cabinet. The former minister claimed that "it would be impossible to raise production" in the conditions of galloping inflation which is already forecast. The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper prints an extract from former vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy's book "Collapse of the Power", describing political life in Russia in 1993 and the tragic October events in Moscow. The newspaper reproduces Rutskoy's photograph at the Lefortovo prison printed in IZVESTIYA on Wednesday. The same newspaper carries an interview with Aleksandr Gorbovskiy, a high-ranking official from the committee for conventional problems of chemical and biological weapons. He writes that Russia has not violated any treaties on chemical weapons, adding that it is no less difficult to destroy these weapons than to develop them. Replying to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, Vladimir Kazimirov, special representative of the Russian president on Nagorno-Karabakh, stresses that the main thing now is to prevent internationalisation of the Azeri-Armenian conflict in that region, which has deteriorated over the past few days.
