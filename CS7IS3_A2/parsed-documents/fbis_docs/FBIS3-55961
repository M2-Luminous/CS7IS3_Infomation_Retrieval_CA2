President Algirdas Brazauskas announced that he has sent a letter to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner which, referring to the 23 December 1993 resolution by the Lithuanian Seimas, officially requests that the Lithuanian Republic be admitted in NATO. Obviously this decision has crystallized under pressure from opponents of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party and by Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the right-wing forces. Day after day he has harshly criticized the country's authorities for the vagueness of their stance in respect of joining NATO. But they reacted to this with caution. Talk centered more on the need to agree positions with Latvia and Estonia, where Russian troops are still present, and on a well-balanced political process. Lithuanian Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas declared recently that the issue of the country's membership any political or military organization should be decided by the people via a referendum, and not by the president or the Seimas. Obviously, the results of the elections to the Russian State Duma have forced amendments. It was on the back of an anti-Kremlin feeling that V. Landsbergis once managed to gain significant political advantage in Lithuania. Now, against a background of the strengthening of those very same feelings, right-wing political parties and movements are again gaining strength. At the third congress of the "Union of the Fatherland" party, led by V. Landsbergis, it was stated outright that the main threat comes from Russia and the ruling party is prepared...to fall into its embrace economically at first, and then politically. Actually, on many political issues the authorities and the opposition in Lithuania follow one and the same lead. If nothing else, proof of this is offered by the letter from the republic's Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys, sent, evidently in support of the statement by A. Brazauskas, to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. P. Gylys expresses the thought that NATO is a guarantor of Lithuania's security. The minister's concern is roused in particular, in his words, by the large concentration of Russia's Army in Kaliningrad Oblast. Lithuania would like to draw the international community's attention to the need to demilitarize this region. P. Gylys is also concerned that, in the wake of Russia's parliamentary elections, its foreign policy may become "more nationalistic and aggressive toward the Baltic states...." Certain forces in Lithuania do not conceal their geopolitical sympathies. A curious episode occurred not so long ago during a meeting in the small city of Skaudvile between its inhabitants and officials from the "Union of the Fatherland" and "Sajudis." It voiced in particular the idea of the threat to Lithuania's interests if its officers are trained in Ryazan. A proposal emerged: Surely it is better to send them to NATO countries or directly to the Pentagon. But then somebody asked: And what will happen if they are recruited by the CIA? "So be it," exclaimed the leader of the Skaudvile branch of "Sajudis." Incidentally, on the subject of the CIA, the Lithuanian press has revealed a sensational discovery that a CIA residence operates semi-legally in Vilnius, and a specific address has even been named. Emotion aside, Lithuania's political will has been expressed. Admittedly, it is doubtful whether NATO will give a positive response straight off, without considering the interests of Russia itself.
