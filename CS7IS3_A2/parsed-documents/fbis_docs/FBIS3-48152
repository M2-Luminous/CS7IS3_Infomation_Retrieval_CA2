North Korean and senior Australian officials have held secret talks at Australian Embassies in Jakarta and Bangkok, and the federal government has informed the United States, Japan and South Korea. "But those talks have really essentially been about whether we should talk," Bilney said. No decisions have been made about formal dialogue, which would be contingent upon three conditions, the Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Satisfactory progress must be made in the implementation of International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] safeguards and Australia "strongly supports" the U.S. negotiating stance on the nuclear issue, the statement said. Australia would never play a "solo role" in putting relations with Korea at a normal footing and so progress would also be necessary in North Korea's relations with South Korea and the United States, it said. Australia would also respect a call from North Korea's three adversaries not to reestablish ties. Restoring ties relies strongly on whether North Korea will comply with U.S. pressure to allow international inspectors into its nuclear facilities. Australia reportedly wants North Korea to rejoin the world community's economic and political affairs and would therefore be sympathetic to Pyongyang's reported proposal. "North Korea...is an isolated country, and one can only speculate that perhaps it's feeling that isolation more now," Bilney said. The Australian Government has considered inviting a senior North Korean Government official to visit Australia later in the year to initiate a stronger dialogue between the two countries. While the step was entirely unsolicited, there were a number of possible reasons why Australia was approached, including the close relations with North Korea's main adversaries, the U.S., Japan and South Korea, the statement said. Other reasons could include the fact that Australia currently chairs the IAEA Board of Governors and maintains a strong non-proliferation stance on nuclear weapons, the department said, adding that there have been sporadic contacts between Australia and North Korea in recent years. Relations between Australia and North Korea were severed in 1975 when the militant Communist government reacted to Australia's backing of South Korea in the United Nations by abandoning its embassy in Canberra and expelling Australian diplomats from Pyongyang.
