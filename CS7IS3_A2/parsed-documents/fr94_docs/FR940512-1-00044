FR940512-1-00044 FR940512-1-00010 All of the proposed provisions in proposed subpart E regarding the enforcement of statutory requirements that centers must meet are designed to ensure due process and fairness. In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has added language to clarify the intent of proposed §366.50. Section 725(c)(2) of the Act requires that the governing board of a center must be composed of a majority of individuals with a significant disability. The statutory definition of an individual with a significant disability is limited to individuals who are receiving or who could benefit from receiving IL services. If the statutory definition is used to determine membership on the governing board, those individuals with a significant disability who already have gained their independence, either through the receipt of IL services or on their own, could not be part of the majority of the governing board. Therefore, the Secretary has added language at the end of proposed §366.50(b) that would modify the definition of an individual with a significant disability for purposes of this proposed section only. The proposed definition would permit those individuals with a significant disability who already have gained their independence, either through the receipt of IL services or on their own, to be part of the majority of the governing board. Part 367 Proposed part 367 contains regulations regarding the OIB program, authorized by chapter 2 of title VII of the Act. In addition to incorporating the definitions in proposed §364.4, proposed §367.5 includes the statutory definitions for ``older individual who is blind'' and ``independent living services for older individuals who are blind.'' Pursuant to proposed §367.21, the Secretary would use the selection criteria in proposed §367.22, which are based on §75.210 of EDGAR, to evaluate applications for discretionary grants under section 752(b)(1) of the Act. In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has increased the value of ``Plan of operation'' from 20 to 25 points and decreased the value of ``Likelihood of sustaining the program'' from 15 to 10 points in proposed §367.22(b) and (h), respectively. Pursuant to proposed §367.23, the Secretary also would consider the geographic distribution of projects in awarding these discretionary grants. The Secretary believes that it is important to have this program operate in as many States as possible, and this proposed provision would give the Secretary the flexibility to accomplish this purpose. Finally, proposed §367.41(a)(1) would incorporate section 752(g) of the Act that gives the designated State agency discretion to operate or administer the OIB program or projects under Part 367 through grants to public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations. In addition, proposed §367.41(a)(2) would incorporate section 752(i)(2)(A) of the Act that gives the designated State agency discretion to operate or administer the program or projects under Part 367 either directly or through grants, as permitted by section 752(g) of the Act and §367.41(a), or contracts. The general authority to operate or administer the OIB through grants or contracts given to States in section 752(i)(2)(A) of the Act is overridden by the specific language in section 752(g) of the Act limiting a State's authority to award grants only to public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations. Because Congress could have added contracts to section 752(g) or deleted the very specific reference to public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations in section 752(g), proposed §367.41(a)(2) permits a State to contract only with individuals, entities, or organizations that are not public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations. However, proposed §367.41(b) would permit States to use assistance contracts awarded by a State (which are similar to subgrants), but not procurement contracts, in a manner consistent with 34 CFR 366.32(e) through 366.32(g). Executive Order 12866 Assessment of Costs and Benefits These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering these programs effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. The Secretary also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.
