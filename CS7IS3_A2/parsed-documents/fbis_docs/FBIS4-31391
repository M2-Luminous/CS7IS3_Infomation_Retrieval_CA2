Some of the reasons why we undertook to form the new party of Independent Croatian Democrats [HND] were the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the functioning of the law-governed state, the activity of the parliament, and the autonomy of the judiciary. We did not like the structure of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union], which has been turned into a bureaucratic organization that does not beat with a democratic pulse. Our move can only promote democracy, provided there is reason and the country is not pushed into crisis. This can only help Croatia to become more recognizable as a democratic society," Stipe Mesic explained the most recent political ferment for all NEDELJNA BORBA. [Paripovic] How do you perceive the behavior of the HDZ and the president himself, Dr. Tudjman, following your move and that of Josip Manolic, president of the Chamber of Zupanijas? [Mesic] The HDZ has had trouble coping with that basic postulate of democracy that people think differently about different problems. And when we were unable to fight for our positions within the party, we went public. That is why proceedings were immediately instituted to dismiss Mr. Manolic. I do not know how many deputies signed the motion for my dismissal. That is already pass now. That is deja vu: An order is issued from the president's office, and everything is set in motion. That is not a feature of democratic societies. Relations in parliament are different because of the new party's establishment, and we have proposed that we sit down and reach an agreement on the leadership of the parliament. This cannot be done through pressure. [Paripovic] Did you expect reactions of that kind, which, as you say, are those familiar from the time that is now behind us? [Mesic] I can say that I did expect it. As more and more time has passed, the party has hewed more and more to the model of the one-party system and has begun to beat with that pulse. This is not satisfactory to us. On the contrary, we have begun to shut ourselves off not with a Berlin Wall, but a Balkan wall. The president's office has been turned into a power center. It is possible from there to manipulate all the moves in parliament, even to decide on the choice of judges. Or indeed the name to be given to some club. That is not the president's affair. [Paripovic] What are the sources of that kind of behavior? Does it come from President Tudjman or from the people who surround him? [Mesic] Certainly there are several reasons. One is certainly the people around the president. They only became acquainted with him as the chief of state, while I, instead of their deference, have always presented my opinion to Tudjman without calculating whether he will take to it or not. The people around him have been telling him what they thought he wanted to hear. That is why he has been drawing the wrong conclusions, since the information he based them on was wrong. To some extent the fault is surely also his. [Paripovic] How do yo assess the position of Franjo Tudjman? Since the move by you and Josip Manolic has he been uncertain what course to take, or "standing firm on his feet"? [Mesic] I think he is not taking the right steps as soon as he moves against parliament. A war between the executive and legislative branches does not benefit democracy. In addition to preserving the position of the parliament, we also want to preserve the Office of the President, but only within the limits allowed him by the Constitution. [Paripovic] Is it your assessment that you can remain at the head of the Croatian parliament? President Tudjman was explicit at his regular news conference that that post is reserved for a representative of the HDZ? [Mesic] That will depend on the balance of power or an agreement among all factors in the parliament. If we agree to let that post go to the HDZ, we will let it go, but this cannot be settled over the telephone, not by gathering signatures, by raising an uproar. That is the Bolshevik syndrome. [Paripovic] How do you see the destiny of the government? [Mesic] The government has our support for the present. It has solved the problem of inflation. [Paripovic] What if the opposition should gain the upper hand in the parliament? [Mesic] Everything depends on how the government behaves. [Paripovic] What are the things you have against President Tudjman and the HDZ in connection with the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Mesic] There are several culprits to blame for that war, and Milosevic is the biggest. He calculated that with war he could achieve those objectives of creating an expanded Serbia which were not achieved earlier. Those who wanted an expanded Croatia played into his hands. Through the Serbs in Croatia, which Bora Jovic told me were our problem and we should "do what we like with them," the fuse of war in Croatia was ignited although there were assurances that Serbia was interested in only 66 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The only way to achieve that was to escalate the war in Bosnia and in Herzegovina. And then we had problems in the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina, since if a Serbian republic was being created, so let's also create a Croatia in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Herzeg-Bosna was created with flags, its army, its government... as a response to the Serbian side. We opposed such moves, since it means disintegration of an internationally recognized entity. [Paripovic] You are probably aware of more detailed information, but you do not wish to speak of it. Can we, then, deal in suppositions? Did Dr. Tudjman consent to the offer of 66 percent of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Serbs? [Mesic] I think not. [Paripovic] Did that agreement include resettlement of Serbs and Croats? I would recall for you just two almost identical such movements of population of both Serbs and Croats in which both suffered. I am speaking of the Croats who left Ilok and environs and the Serbs who left western Slavonia? [Mesic] As soon as the talk turned on humane resettlement of population, I saw a great danger there. When we see what has happened, then it is clear that Milosevic had Cyprus in mind as a model. He went against everything that was non-Serb with brutal force in order to clear out a space to make expanded Serbia. He counted on there being pressure on the Serbs from the other side. He did not take a risk in that respect, but he longed for that. Whether there was an agreement about that I do not know. That is another of the questions history will answer for us, but the fact is that the aim was to create ethnic borders. [Paripovic] You have raised quite a few of those issues -- the issue of the money which the diaspora has been paying and which has disappeared, the question of apartments.... Do you think that Seks and others who obtained apartments for a song will simply pay for that or return them? You have raised the issue of the Mafia and its connection to the authorities, profiteering, murders.... You said that "they" are true Sisters of Mercy compared to "these." Do you think you can work that out? [Mesic] Yes. The money from the diaspora went into certain accounts. Balance sheets have to be drawn up, so that we can see how much was spent for what. Distribution of apartments has been discontinued, and this must be worked out as part of the operation of the law-governed state, just like everything else that has been raised as an issue. Unlawful acts must be detected by those who are paid to do that. The Mafia began in Sicily as a political movement against the French. But the French departed long ago, and the Mafia has remained. I hope that this one in Croatia will be much shorter-lived. [Paripovic] Will your moves have an effect on Dr. Tudjman and his autocratic way of governing the country, and will you remove some of the manifestations of power which even a monarch would not be ashamed of: the presidential aircraft, the yacht and, they say, the immense wealth of the entire Tudjman family? [Mesic] I assume that Dr. Tudjman is a realistic politician. Realistic because he came to power precisely by respecting certain realities. That is why I think he will take the new realities into account. He must realize that our moves do not represent a destabilization of Croatia. Accordingly, if he draws the lessons from all this, it will be better both for him, and also for democracy and for Croatia. [Paripovic] Is Defense Minister Gojko Susak one of the stumbling blocks between Manolic and you on the one hand, and not just the two of you, and President Tudjman on the other? [Mesic] Yes. I think he is incompetent. [Paripovic] But Tudjman continues to keep him close to his side, and he refers to those demanding his dismissal as "petty politicians." These days there are people in Croatia who interpret Tudjman's keeping Susak close by his side even as a possibility of dictatorship? [Mesic] I do not believe in solutions outside the institutional framework. The European environment would hardly put up with that. Someone would have to stand behind such a move, just as someone has always stood behind every military dictatorship introduced up to now. Everything is clear concerning Susak. His resignation is being demanded. It does not interest us that he perhaps may have offered his resignation to Tudjman when they were playing tennis or over coffee. We want the resignation debated publicly, which does not mean that he must offer his resignation publicly after the debate. [Paripovic] Why has Minister Susak become so dear to Tudjman's heart? [Mesic] That I do not know. [Paripovic] There is talk of a Herzegovinian lobby? [Mesic] I think that there is a bit of exaggeration here about that Herzegovinian lobby. In every war people emerge who through their connections make it possible for others and themselves to get rich. The talk about the Herzegovinians began following several real cases of that kind, but there are "very good profiteers" among the Slavonians, those from Lika, the Dalmatians, and the Istrians. [Paripovic] According to an assessment which need not be accurate, your parting of the ways with the HDZ should have occurred at the last party convention, where differentiation of what are provisionally referred to as "right" and "left" wings became evident? [Mesic] So far the HDZ has responded to two historic challenges -- the first was leaving the communist system and the second formation of the Croatian state. It now faces a new challenge -- what kind of state that should be. Here the HDZ is not responding effectively enough. That division into "left" and "right" is artificial, and when anyone wanted to discredit us, then they simply referred to us as "on the left." It is not about that, but about who favors the law-governed and democratic state and who does not. Here the HDZ should draw the new lessons, not resort to Bolshevik models of the harangue, or bus in those who call us "heretics" and call for them to deal with us. That is not good for the HDZ, since it is now "tackling the external and internal enemy." That does not disturb us, and I am sorry that we recognize certain strivings in the HDZ which aspire to totalitarianism. Some people have grabbed up all the goods of this world, and they are not waiting to have those goods in the other world. They would like to set certain things in cement. The firm hand suits them at present, since any democratic thrust could take quite a bit of that back from them. [Paripovic] Your mention of cement has given me my cue: Are you ready to take some of the responsibility in all this upon yourself for certain moves? Surely you are not taking it for granted that many will treat you with kid gloves in the session of the parliament? [Mesic] They have never treated me with kid gloves. Even since 1963. I was in prison in Stara Gradiska, because I did not agree with the totalitarian system. Those totalitarians are now emerging once again. Those who persecuted me then are now orthodox members of the HDZ. But I will not mention names, since we have an agreement to that effect. There will not be any kid gloves, but I am not afraid of that, since the arguments are on our side. We have on our side public opinion in spite of Vrdoljak's television. And when you talk about cement, than I know that you are referring to the story that I wanted to buy my daughter a cement plant. She wanted to mortgage her house to go into that business, but that was abandoned. I have only what I have earned, and I have not gained anything from this regime. [Paripovic] You say that public opinion is also with you. Can you conclude from that that the people are fed up with this regime? [Mesic] The people are never completely satisfied with their state. And that is a good thing. But the people are bothered by those who are abusing the state. There is no danger of the state being destabilized. On the contrary -- the mafiosi will be destabilized and exposed. [Box, p 10] I Will Not Cut a Deal With Tudjman [Paripovic] Have you had contacts with President Tudjman, and can it be said that a deal is being cut? [Mesic] I have had talks with two representatives who came on the president's behalf. A third was supposed to come, but he went away on a business trip. What they are offering is bilateral talks. We are offering the opposition on the one side and the HDZ on the other, since now we belong to the opposition. I think that bilateral bargaining does not come under consideration now -- that is the message I sent back to the president. Positions should not be held onto jealously. I was not born in the position of president of the parliament, nor need I remain there. In the HDZ, and this is what their propaganda says, they are thinking that this is a power struggle. If that were the case, I would just go sit down alongside Tudjman, since under the Constitution I am his deputy, and for me personally everything could come up roses. But I am not dealing with my personal problems now. I want Croatia to be a democratic country. [Box, p 10] "Agreement" Concerning the War [Paripovic] What were Franjo Tudjman's motives in negotiating with Milosevic at Karadjordjevo if he did not also have a desire for some expanded state? [Mesic] Through Bora Jovic I proposed that we sit down together, he and Milosevic, Dr. Tudjman and I, and attempt to avoid war. An hour later Bora told me that he had passed on everything to Milosevic and the latter had agreed to the proposal. I passed that on to Tudjman, but I soon learned that only Tudjman and Milosevic would meet. I do not know what they agreed on, but we have seen how processes developed and how the war escalated.
