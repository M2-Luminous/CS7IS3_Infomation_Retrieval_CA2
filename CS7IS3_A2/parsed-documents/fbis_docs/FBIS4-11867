The office of Faysal al-Husayni, the PLO mainstream group Fatah's chief in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said three battalions of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) would "start their mission immediately" on arrival. One thousand former PLA fighters drafted in the police force will arrive in the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border post with Egypt. The other 500 will arrive in the West Bank town of Jericho over the Allenby bridge from Jordan. The office added that a first group of Palestinian exiles would start to return on Tuesday, signaling "the start of the return of all the Palestinians expelled since 1967," when Israel seized the territories. Israel and the PLO are close to agreeing on the deployment of up to 10,000 Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Saturday. "An accord on the number of policemen should be concluded during meetings of the PLO and Israeli security committee" which begin in Cairo on Sunday, Sha'th said in the Egyptian capital. The talks would also focus on "preparations for the deployment" of the police and security arrangements for Jericho and Gaza. "I don't think there is currently a problem on the number of policemen, which will be around 10,000," Sha'th said. Under a security accord signed in Cairo on Thursday, Israel and the PLO agreed that 160 foreign observers would be deployed in the mosque massacre town of Hebron and a first contingent of Palestinian police would be sent this week.
