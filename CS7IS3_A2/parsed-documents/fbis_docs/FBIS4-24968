The national work forum on bonded zones was held in Tianjin. After giving a briefing on the sustained, rapid growth of our foreign trade, Li Lanqing fully affirmed the achievements of the bonded zones since they were introduced more than two years ago. He said: The bonded zones were a result of our efforts to draw lessons from current international practice -- including the advantages of bonded warehousing, export processing zones, and other administrative models -- as well as a new kind of pilot project for opening up China's economy under prevailing national conditions. Over the past two years, the bonded zones have demonstrated their unique advantage and played a positive role in attracting foreign investment; exercising the functions of export processing, transit trading, and warehousing; promoting convergence of the domestic and international markets; spurring on regional economic development; and other areas. The bonded zones' unique position, advantage, and demonstrative effect are increasingly pronounced in the overall pattern of China's opening up to the outside world. Since 1991, our nation has approved the establishment of 13 bonded zones covering a total area of 17.62 [as received] square kilometers. Most of these bonded zones have been put into operation. By the end of March 1994, these bonded zones have approved the establishment of a total of 5,813 enterprises involving $8.8 billion in investment and handled the import and export of goods worth $1.74 billion. Li Lanqing pointed out: Although the bonded zones have achieved great results, there remain many unstandardized and flawed practices in our bonded zone system as compared to current international practice and these practices have restricted healthy development of our bonded zones. He proposed solving these problems from two aspects. First, we should have a correct understanding of and give full play to the three basic functions of bonded zones. In other words, we should give full play to their export processing function, try hard to develop their international transit trading function, and give active play to their function in providing trade services such as warehousing and commodity display. Particularly in bonded warehousing, it is necessary to, in the light of domestic demand, properly and purposefully store up agricultural chemicals, petroleum products, and other important commodities for use as contingency supplies. These basic functions are the bonded zones' major distinctions from economic development zones and special economic zones. Second, we should further standardize and improve bonded zone administration. The present administrative system of most bonded zones calls for further improvement. A bonded zone should be a specially designated zone under the supervision and jurisdiction of customs and be regulated mainly by the customs and bonded zone administration committees instead of all kinds of administrative and law enforcement organs. Furthermore, the administrative rules and regulations for bonded zones are not complete or standardized. So far, there has yet to be a unified and complete set of rules and regulations for the 13 bonded zones across the nation, and this has hampered their healthy development. Li Lanqing especially stressed: All bonded zones should study and draw up their own development direction and strategy based on individual characteristics and conditions to give full play to their overall relative advantage and spur on regional economic development. He said: If we are to bring about healthy and orderly development of bonded zones, we must standardize administration. Generally speaking, we should refer to current international practice when standardizing bonded zone administration and build our bonded zones into a point of convergence and a mixture of the international and domestic markets to gear business operators directly to the needs of the grand international market. With the exception of commodities under state import and export bans and rationing, goods and capital may flow freely between the bonded zones and the international market. It is necessary to exercise effective and tight control over the flow of goods and capital between the bonded zones and other parts of the country in strict accordance with stipulations by relevant state policies, to build the bonded zones into a new model for developing an externally oriented economy with complete institutions, simple and convenient formalities, quality services, and highly effective and tight administration. To this end, we should stress the following principles: Reform the administrative system for bonded zones; simplify the customs' supervisory and administrative formalities and enhance self-discipline among business operators; suit monetary policy for bonded zones to their peculiar needs; employ advanced technology to improve administrative means and strengthen administration; and pay particular attention to resolutely cracking down on unlawful smuggling activities. In conclusion, Li Lanqing emphatically pointed out: In issues related to bonded zones, we must properly handle matters that should be handled and firmly refuse to do things that should not be done. We must do good things properly and never spoil them. After the meeting, Vice Premier Li Lanqing visited the ongoing "1994 Export Commodity Fair of Tianjin, China" in the company of Tianjin Municipal CPC Secretary Gao Dezhan and Mayor Zhang Lichang and held an informal discussion with the heads of trading delegations from various localities on existing problems in foreign trade. Li Lanqing also inspected the Tianjin Customs and had lunch at the canteen together with customs personnel.
