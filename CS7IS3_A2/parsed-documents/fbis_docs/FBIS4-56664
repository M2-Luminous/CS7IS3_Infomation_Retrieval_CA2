The British news agency, Reuters, reports that Haitian businessmen are worried that the extreme right is about to install a new de facto government. They report that they [not further identified] have asked for the return of Robert Malval as prime minister, a post he left with disgust last December. They believe that having a legitimate leader in this post could fill the temporal vacuum and reduce the necessity to fill it. Someone close to Malval refused to confirm or to deny the speculation, stating that any approach might be be considered. I cannot reject that, this official said. Depending on how it is presented, Malval would have to wait and see of what the offer consists. [passage omitted]
