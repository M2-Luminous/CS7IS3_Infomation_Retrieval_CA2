Subpart C_Administrative Offset §179.301 Scope of regulations. These regulations apply to the collection of debts owed to the United States arising from transactions with OPM other than those involving payments made from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (the Fund), or where a request for an offset from OPM's administrative accounts_other than the Fund_is received by OPM from another Federal agency. Regulations for other agencies to request OPM's Retirement and Insurance Group to recover a debt from the Fund are provided at subpart R of part 831 and subpart D of part 845 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations are consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards on Administrative Offset issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office as set forth in 4 CFR 102.3. §179.302 Definitions. Administrative offset, as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1), means withholding money payable by the United States Government to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a debt the person owes the Government. Person, includes a natural person or persons, profit or non-profit corporation, partnership, association, trust, estate, consortium, or other entity which is capable of owing a debt to the United States Government except that agencies of the United States, or of any State or local government, shall be excluded. §179.303 General. (a) The Director or his or her designee, after attempting to collect a debt from a person under section 3(a) of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3711(a)), may collect the debt by administrative offset subject to the following: (1) The debt is certain in amount; and (2) It is in the best interest of the United States to collect the debt by administrative offset because it is less costly and speeds payment of the debt; (b) The Director, or his or her designee, may initiate administrative offset with regard to debts owed by a person to another agency of the United States Government, upon receipt of a request from the head of another agency, or his or her designee, and a certification that the debt exists and that the person has been afforded the necessary due process rights. (c) The Director, or his or her designee, may request another agency that holds funds payable to an OPM debtor to offset the debt against the funds held and will provide certification that: (1) The debt exists; and (2) The person has been afforded the necessary due process rights. (d) If the 6-year period for bringing action on a debt provided in 28 U.S.C. 2415 has expired, then administrative offset may be used to collect the debt only if the costs of bringing such action are likely to be less than the amount of the debt. (e) No collection by administrative offset shall be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than 10 years unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering and collecting such debt. (f) These regulations do not apply to: (1) A case in which administrative offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute. (2) Debts owed to OPM by other agencies of the United States or by any State or local government. §179.304 Notification procedures. Before collecting any debt through administrative offset, a notice of intent to offset shall be sent to the debtor by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the most current address that is available to OPM. The notice shall provide: (a) A description of the nature and amount of the debt and the intention of OPM to collect the debt through administrative offset; (b) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of OPM with respect to the debt; (c) An opportunity for review within OPM concerning OPM's determinations with respect to the debt; and (d) An opportunity to enter into a written agreement for the repayment of the amount of the debt.
