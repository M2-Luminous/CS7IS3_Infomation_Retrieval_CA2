Paavo Vayrynen, the battling party chairman, had laid down his arms for the time being and had voluntarily relinquished control. His stunned enemies and critics almost respected him. Esko Aho, the new party chairman, held his victory jubilation under control. The vanquished, Eeva Kuuskoski, Seppo Kaariainen, and Olli Rehn, held their disappointment under control, but, then, they had been able to participate in showing how broad and strong the party leadership was. A resounding electoral victory awaited just a few months down the road. Being in the party was pure bliss. Less than four years later all has vanished: the glamour, the radiance, the vitality, the will to win. The stars have dimmed, the faces have grown haggard, the citizens are enraged, and the party leaders, both old and new, are at each other's throats. After the defeat in the presidential elections, the mud at the bottom bubbled to the surface; laboriously covered up conflicts, feelings of personal grudges, dislikes, and disappointment began to surge out with irresistible force. In the final analysis, the changing of the guard in the Center Party during the sunny summer of 1990 did not, after all, occur completely, smoothly, and nicely. The changing is only now taking place, and it is happening tortuously and slowly. Two lions cannot indefinitely be kept in the same doghouse. Inch by inch Esko Aho, the prime minister and party chairman, is pushing Paavo Vayrynen aside, out of the party nucleus, which has grown too small for these former friends and allies. The battle has been waged in secret for a long time already, in fact from the very moment that the Center Party gained its great parliamentary election victory and thereby laid the cornerstone of Paavo Vayrynen's long enduring dream: a nonsocialist cabinet. Vayrynen realized very quickly that Aho intended to play first fiddle at every possible occassion. Aho was entranced by his role as prime minister. When Finland's economy collapsed, the prime minister was snatched away by the whirlwinds of crises, and Vayrynen was deprived of the support he had expected for his great plans. He had left the party in good hands that were to bear him all the way to the presidential manor; but then what happened? Oh, Vayrynen was allowed into the nonsocialist cabinet, as a foreign minister. He had wanted to be the minister of the treasury. Aho took care of the country's economy and especially took care of his own public image. Vayrynen also expressed his own views on economic policy, but met with disapproval. Even those who actually agreed with him disapproved of his rocking the boat. Relations Become Icy Relations between Aho and Vayrynen iced over completely one year ago, during the winter that Vayrynen tried to topple the now hated nonsocialist cabinet and to engage the Social Democrats into joining the government and sharing responsibility. At that time Vayrynen was helped by Seppo Kaariainen, the chairman of the party's parliamentary group, current minister of commerce and industry, whose tolerant broad-mindedness, as befits a Savo man, made contact with all groupings possible. But nothing worked. Aho was supported by the president and survived. The cabinet withstood the crisis, and Vayrynen, who had hoped to become prime minister, departed. He was able to take no one with him, even though word had spread as far and wide as Sodankyla that Martti Pura, the minister of agriculture, would stomp off and follow his lord and master out the cabinet door. The entire operation proved to be harmful to Vayrynen. He was permitted to conduct his presidential campaign as he saw fit. Aho did not appear to much care how the Center Party candidate fared. He stubbornly remained in the background. His support could, at best, be described as formal. Vayrynen's hopes were crushed already in the first round of the presidential elections. Even during the very last meters before election day he had tried to be convincing about his Finnish wisdom, sense of humor, and relaxedness. The expensive television advertisements proved to be wasted investments, as Vayrynen, after the election, spewed accusations in all directions. The "criminal" media and the chilly attitude of the party leadership both received their share. A Plan Emerges Once he had recovered, Vayrynen, in his purposeful way, began to arrange new positions for himself. He desired a politically significant duty for the remainder of the tenure of the current Eduskunta. He believed that he and his support base could be of use in parrying off the defeat threatening his party in the next election. Vayrynen had no desire whatsoever for comforting words and head-stroking. He was offered a cabinet post. That wasn't good enough. He was offered the politically insignificant deputy chairmanship of the parliamentary group. That wasn't good enough. What Vayrynen wanted was the chairmanship of the parliamentary group, a position with influence. Unfortunately the position was already filled, so, to realize his wishes, Vayrynen had to do some arranging and planning. The plan actually emerged quite easily and was easy to implement. Kalevi Mattila, the parliamentary group chairman, would just move over to the deputy chairmanship, and, bingo -- the way would be open for Vayrynen to the chairmanship. He would certainly be the unanimous choice, for who could doubt Vayrynen's credentials? This construction began to shake badly when one of the available cabinet posts went to the "wrong" person. Anneli Jaatteenmaki of Lapua took the position that the Vayrynen camp's scheme had designated for Seppo Pelttari, a sheriff from Lapland. With a fury arising from desperation the Vayrynen camp attempted to hold on to their plan, but, surprisingly, Vayrynen and his supporters found that the very tokens of their little game had risen up against them. Mattila decided that he wanted to remain as parliamentary group chairman after all. There was to be no further discussion on the theme that he, supposedly, had for a long time already, actually wanted to be deputy chairman. That could now be the post for Pelttari and Lapland, as some sort of compensation for the cabinet post that he had lost in the selection process. Prime Minister Esko Aho had realized what Vayrynen was up to. Little Game Turns Into Nightmare A trivial-seeming token game gained unprecedented dimensions. The question was no longer: Who is the chairman of the parliamentary group? The question now was: Who is really in charge of the party, the present chairman or the former one or both? The men drifted into a battle of wills in which apparently neither wants to give up. Prime Minister Aho has staked all of his authority into this game. At this point Vayrynen has little beyond his steel-hard will to place in the game. In earlier political arm-wrestling matches, Vayrynen has been able to take advantage of his party chairmanship, and up until the very last few weeks, he was protected by his presidential candidacy. As an ordinary, rank-and-file member of parliament he hardly holds any trump cards. As such he cannot even threaten to resign. This elimination game has now been played in public for about a week, and no manner of conciliation seems to be arising between the men. In public Aho tries to present an image of a party leader who is against no one, but for each and every one. Nevertheless, Vayrynen's back is against the wall, even though that wall is padded. People have become accustomed to regard Vayrynen as a man who never gives up. He will strike back if someone hits him. During the dramatic twists of the parliamentary chairman struggle, Vayrynen's supporters warned that Vayrynen on the loose is one dangerous man. Nevertheless, Aho appeared to be prepared to take that risk, even though the party can ill afford to become embroiled in a divisive power struggle. Vayrynen now needs to reassess how he can use his own prestige and support, and to what ends these will suffice. It appears that Aho has gained the upper hand. Vayrynen has expressed in every possible way that, at age 47, he does not in any way at all want to become a political old-timer, whose ramblings others can scarcely bear to listen to. Unless the knot snarling relations between Aho and Vayrynen is opened, Vayrynen needs to seek a new impetus for his political future from the parliamentary elections. The prospects are not rosy. It appears that the Center Party is headed for disaster in the coming parliamentary elections regardless of whether Aho and Vayrynen are feuding or at peace. They stand to easily lose more than 10 seats in the Eduskunta, unless the Social Democratic express train to victory somehow derails.
