FBIS4-4724 "dreas065_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-065 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 North Korea Foreign Ministry Spokesman Views UNSC Statement Foreign Ministry Spokesman Views UNSC Statement KCNA Carries Spokesman's Comments SK0404050994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0452 GMT 4 Apr 94 SK0404050994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["DPRK FM Spokesman on DPRK's Position on UNSC `Presidential Statement'" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Since the United States has opted the one-sided way to put pressure on the DPRK, reversing all its commitments with the DPRK, we cannot but normalize our peaceful nuclear activities frozen unilaterally for DPRK-USA talks, said a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry in a statement released Monday. Noting that the United Nations Security Council [UNSC] on March 31 published its "presidential statement" imposing an unreasonable demand upon the DPRK, the spokesman said: It is obviously contrary to the purpose and principle of the UN Charter that the UN Security Council whose mission it is to guarantee world peace and security discussed our issue on the basis of the unreasonable and prejudiced "conclusion" of the Board of Governors of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] that the "scope of noncompliance with the safeguards agreement has expanded". If the UN Security Council is truly to discharge its mission, it should take issue with the United States which is gravely threatening peace and security of the Korean peninsula with huge nuclear weapons, laying obstacles to the solution of the nuclear issue, and the South Korean authorities, its henchmen. It must not go unnoticed that the UN Security Council unreasonably took issue with the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear activities, while turning a blind eye to the countries which are hell bent on a dangerous nuclear gambling under the patronage of the United States. This shows that the UN Security Council is playing into the hands of the United States in executing the latter's hostile policy of stifling the DPRK, applying double standards. This time the UN Security Council sympathized with the United States' hostile policy against the DPRK by including the question of compliance with the safeguards agreement in the "presidential statement", disregarding the essence of our "nuclear issue" on purpose. The effect of the safeguards agreement has virtually been at a standstill from the moment when the DPRK temporarily suspended the effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) for talks between the DPRK and the United States. The call for compliance with the safeguards agreement and additional inspection, therefore, does not make sense at all for the DPRK now in a publicly recognized special status. We have consistently maintained the steadfast policy of independence and correct lines in external relations and never changed our once clarified position. The UNSC should first take a measure to set right the unreasonable act of the IAEA Secretariat in expanding the scope of partiality against us, kowtowing to big countries, before demanding an additional inspection of us. The IAEA Secretariat must make a due apology for its acts in further widening the scope of partiality, openly joining force with the United States in its intrigues against the DPRK. We will surely call the IAEA Secretariat to account for expanding partiality against us stage by stage, instead of making an apology. Now, the United States is becoming all the more undisguised in its moves to step up a campaign for international pressure on our republic by setting in-motion the Board of Governors of the IAEA and the UNSC. Since the United States has opted the one-sided way to put pressure on us, reversing all its commitments with us, we could not but normalize our peaceful nuclear activities unilaterally frozen for the DPRK-USA talks. The United States and the South Korean authorities are intending to escalate the campaign for pressure on us with the UNSC "presidential statement" as the starting-point, but it can never work with us. The more desperately the United States and its followers try to stifle the socialist system of our own style, the more immensely the might of the singlehearted unity of our party, people and People's Army will increase. It is our unshakable will and policy to answer strength with strength, dialogue with dialogue. The United States' hostile policy of stifling the DPRK is sure to end in failure. Consistent is our stand to seek a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue.
