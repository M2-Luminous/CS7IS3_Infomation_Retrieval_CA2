Churkin was speaking after a two-day meeting with his Estonian counterpart Raul Malk, which was held in pursuance of the accord reached during Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's recent meeting in Tallinn with Estonian President Lennart Meri. Churkin said the problem of the Russian military pensioners residing in Estonia remained in the centre of negotiations between Estonia and Russia, and expressed the hope that "a new page, and probably even a new chapter" will open in Russian-Estonian relations thanks to this and other forthcoming contacts. Churkin said his talks in Tallinn centered around the withdrawal of Russian troops and the dismantling of Russian atomic reactors in the training centre for Russian submarine power plant operators in Paldiski. Churkin expressed confidence that the sides would reach an agreement which would be "realistic and rule out any tension in relations between the two countries". As concerns the Russian military pensioners residing in the republic, Churkin expressed the confidence that the agreement on their fate will "also be realistic and meet the world's highest standards in the field of human rights".
