FBIS4-29517 "dreas118_q_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-118 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 AUSTRALASIA Australia Envoy's Criticisms Pose Challenge to Ties Envoy's Criticisms Pose Challenge to Ties BK1606150494 Sydney THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW in English 3 Jun 94 p 1 BK1606150494 Sydney THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW English BFN [By Peter Gill and Bill Pheasant] [Text] Indonesia's ambassador, Mr. Sabam Siagian, has warned that Australia could become a "stagnant, inward-looking, sulking" country, just as the federal government is embracing its northern neighbor in a new, closer relationship. The comments are a direct challenge to the government's efforts to move Australia closer to Asia, and drew a sharp response from the minister for foreign affairs, Senator Evans. Mr. Siagian, speaking to a group of business leaders in Melbourne, said cooperative ventures would help Indonesia become a "modern, outward-looking country", but cooperative linkages, I believe, are also beneficial for Australia. "At least they are helpful to overcome the tendency to remain an isolated, comfortable island of western civilization down under, thus becoming a stagnant country." "A stagnant, inward-looking, sulking Australia definitely is not in the interests of a dynamically growing Indonesia." In response, Senator Evans strongly denied Australia was stagnant or sulking. Through a spokeswoman, he said last night: "It looks like either the reporter or Sabam got his tenses mixed up: we are no longer stagnant and inward-looking, and we have never been sulking." The tough critique by Mr. Siagian came as Senator Evans was warmly talking up a new relationship with Indonesia in response to a parliamentary committee report on the relationship between the two countries. Senator Evans said sensitivities in the relationship would remain over issues such as human rights, but closer ties were manifest in events such as a big trade and cultural promotion scheduled this month in Jakarta. Eight ministers, including the prime minister, Mr. Keating -- who has invested much of his foreign policy credibility in Australia's relationship with Indonesia -- will attend the Australia Today: Indonesia '94 exercise. The significance of Mr. Siagian's comments yesterday are the reflection they contain on the success the federal government has achieved to date in its quest for a closer relationship with Asia. Mr. Siagian was speaking at the launch of an association between the Australian legal firm Minter Ellison Morris Fletcher with Makarim & Taira S, a leading corporate law firm and trade consultancy in Jakarta: "I do hope that this cooperative venture between the two legal firms will help in some way in establishing a good relationship between our two countries, but also provide a significant contribution to the increasingly solid ballast as an underpinning for the expanding and deepening relationship between Indonesia and Australia." Earlier, Senator Evans told parliament: "We are poised to enter a new phase in our relations [with Indonesia]." "We can build on our gains so far, and we must take advantage of the momentum for taking forward the relationship which now exists." A senior lawyer with Makarim & Taira S, Mr. Nono Makarim, told the assembled lawyers and company directors that Australia needed to learn from Japanese economists such as Saburo Okita that industrialized countries had to leave basic manufacturing to developing countries. Mr. Makarim said Indonesian government and business leaders had adopted the ideas of Saburo Okira, "who said 'developed countries ... if you want to continue growing, go in the direction of the sophisticated industries, of the technology-intensive industries, and leave the simple industries for the developing countries'. That was very attractive and they believed that." Mr. Makarim warned that Australia's protection of its manufacturing industries could affect the bilateral relationship between the two nations.
