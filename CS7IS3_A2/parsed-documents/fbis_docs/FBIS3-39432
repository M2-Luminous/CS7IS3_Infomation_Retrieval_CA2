Haider claims to be the "secret chancellor" already, because your government is only carrying out what he has always demanded. [Vranitzky] I am amused by his glib remarks. Is he the secret chancellor? I do not know and I do not care what Haider does secretly. Yet those who are secretly great people usually collect tin soldiers or sail boats in the bath tub. The truth is Haider is a traditional politician. He has been telling the same old story for many years. He has simply not broken with the right-wing fringe. He has not even been able to give up certain National Socialist elements, like the "employment policy of the Third Reich." There are people who say that this is his problem. I claim this is not his problem but his program! [Wachter] Haider has accused the government of adopting political measures on the immigration issue that he has been proposing for a long time. [Vranitzky] By deluding us about his goals, he has repeatedly adopted anti-immigrant positions. If he says that we must slowly send the guest workers home to create more work for Austrians, his proposal is either not well thought out, or he is not familiar with the employment situation. Let me give you an example: If a factory exports its goods mainly to East Europe, and if the systems are collapsing in Russian and Ukraine so that we can no longer sell anything there, he will still not sell anything even if he sends 20,000 workers home. [Wachter] Haider has stated scornfully that he wants to take over your job in 1998, hinting that you are no longer very active. He described himself as the chancellor for the next millennium. [Vranitzky] Well, this is the third element of his story. He is constantly talking about becoming chancellor -- always with a certain delay, as in a poorly dubbed film. He first wanted to become chancellor in 1990 when he nominated the unfortunate Norbert Gugerbauer as head of the FPOe. Now he wants to become chancellor again -- but not before 1998. Thus, he was defeated twice on the issue of chancellor. [Wachter] You pushed Haider out to the margin of politics in 1986. [Vranitzky] I did not do that. I merely distanced myself from him. [Wachter] Okay, you distanced yourself. What went wrong as far as the political strategy is concerned, if Joerg Haider, from whom you distanced yourself, is now your strongest rival and challenger? [Vranitzky] Nothing went wrong. Quite the contrary. Day in and day out, he proves that the distancing was necessary and that I made the right decision in 1986. [Wachter] Haider wants to focus on the immigration issue in the election year. [Vranitzky] After the letter-bomb attacks, all five party chairmen agreed to observe a 12-point list concerning language and political culture. The goal was to prevent extreme forms of political debate. Haider was one of the first to break the rules. Thus, one can hardly expect him to observe a high standard of politics. Yet only naive people will be surprised about that. [Wachter] The election campaign will probably be dominated by "social liberality" versus "the cult of personality and a society where one succeeds by elbow-jostling." [Vranitzky] Yes, exactly. We will stress our efforts to safeguard Austria's attractiveness as a business location, particularly our endeavors to ensure full employment. [Wachter] At 300,000 unemployed? [Vranitzky] Well, particularly at a time when unemployment is rising, we must strongly reject elbow-jostling. Social scientists discovered a long time ago that there are people in society who are losers or who consider themselves to be losers. Haider's strategy is to address these people. We will tell them clearly: We understand that you are susceptible to arguments from this corner. Yet do you understand that you will not be offered a solution from there, that your incomes will not be increased, that there will be no social improvement, and that jobs will not become safer. [Wachter] Let us talk about the elections. Will we go to the polls in June? [Vranitzky] No, there are no such plans whatsoever. [Wachter] The Austrian People's Party [OeVP] has hinted it wants to leave the government and go into opposition if its gap with the Socialist Party of Austria should increase (10 percent difference in 1990). What would this mean for you? [Vranitzky] Nothing for the time being. The OeVP will continue to be our coalition partner until the elections. Then talks will be held. By the way, the OeVP has never officially announced it plans to go into opposition. There are only voices within the party who advocate such a step. The OeVP will have to think about that and make a decision. [Wachter] At what "red" intensive care unit will the "black" patient be treated after the elections to keep it alive? [Vranitzky] One cannot wage an election campaign for two parties at the same time. [Wachter] Are you worried about the position of the OeVP? [Vranitzky] I do not want to give advice or recommend anything to a coalition partner through the media. As the federal government and as parties, we must do two things: We must prove we are able to do our job and we must be acceptable to the voters. [Wachter] If the OeVP should no longer be wiling to form a coalition with you, you can only cooperate with the Liberal Forum or the Greens, or with both. There have been reports you would consider such a constellation too unstable, that you would not be willing to lead such a coalition, and you would withdraw from politics. [Vranitzky] Negotiations on the future government will be held after the elections. I will not comment on this issue now.
