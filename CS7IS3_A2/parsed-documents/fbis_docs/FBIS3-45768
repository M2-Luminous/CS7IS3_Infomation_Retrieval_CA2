The Qaidam Basin, one of the country's three major inland basins, covering an area of about 200,000 sq km, has 33 salt lakes in it. The salt reserves of various kinds and reserves of minerals are estimated to have a potential value of more than 10,000 billion yuan. With the intensified use of advanced technology for processing and production over the past years, more than 50 processing and production enterprises, which have not long been established there, now turn out a dozen kinds of edible salt, as well as producing scores of quality chemical salt products. Products of these enterprises now sell well in 23 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions across the Chinese mainland, with the annual output value reaching 350 million yuan. The Qaidam Basin has also been cooperating with an Israeli company for the building of a project on a cooperative basis, with the purpose of further tapping resources buried in salt lakes in the basin. The cooperative project, with an intended annual production capacity of 800,000 tons of potash fertilizer, will raise the present production capacity of 200,000 tons of potash fertilizers of the entire basin to one million tons when the project is finished in 1997, according to local officials.
