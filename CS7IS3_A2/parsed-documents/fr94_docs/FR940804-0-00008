FR940804-0-00008 FR940804-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Part 4 [T.D. 94&hyph;62] Vessels in Foreign and Domestic Trades AGENCY: Customs Service, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the Customs Regulations to include Malta in the lists of nations which permit vessels of the United States to transport certain articles specified in section 27, Merchant Marine Act of 1920, as amended, between their ports. This amendment will provide reciprocal privileges for vessels of Maltese registry. Customs has been furnished with satisfactory evidence that Malta places no restrictions on the transportation of certain specified articles by vessels of the U.S. between ports in that country. EFFECTIVE DATES: The reciprocal privileges for vessels registered in Malta became effective on May 27, 1994. This amendment is effective August 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Barbara Whiting, Carrier Rulings Branch, at 202&hyph;482&hyph;6940. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 27, Merchant Marine Act of 1920, as amended (46 U.S.C. App. 883), provides generally that no merchandise shall be transported by water, or by land and water, between points in the United States except in vessels built in and documented under the laws of the United States and owned by U.S. citizens. However, the sixth proviso of the Act, as amended, provides that upon a finding by the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to information obtained and furnished by the Secretary of State, that a foreign nation does not restrict the transportation of certain articles between its ports by vessels of the United States, reciprocal privileges will be accorded to vessels of that nation, and the prohibition against transportation of those articles between points in the U. S. will not apply to its vessels. In accordance with the Act, the Customs Service has listed in ยง4.93(b)(1) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.93(b)(1)) those nations found to extend reciprocal privileges to vessels of the United States for the transportation of empty cargo vans, empty lift vans, and empty shipping tanks. Those nations found to grant reciprocal privileges to vessels of the United States for the transportation of equipment for use with cargo vans, lift vans, and shipping tanks; empty barges specifically designed for carriage aboard a vessel; empty instruments of international traffic; and certain stevedoring equipment and material, are listed in ยง4.93(b)(2) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.93(b)(2)). The authority to amend this section of the Customs Regulations has been delegated to the Chief, Regulations Branch. Finding By letter dated May 21, 1994, accompanied by a copy of a communication from the Embassy of Malta, the Department of State advised that Malta places no restrictions on the transportation of the articles listed in the Act by vessels of the United States between Maltese ports. On the basis of information received from the Department of State and the Embassy of Malta, it has been determined that Malta places no restrictions on the transportation of the articles specified in section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, as amended (46 U.S.C. App. 883), by vessels of the United States. Therefore, appropriate reciprocal privileges are accorded to vessels of Maltese registry as of May 27, 1994. This document amends the regulations accordingly. Inapplicability of Public Notice and Delayed Effective Date Requirements Because this amendment merely implements a statutory requirement and involves a matter in which the public is not particularly interested, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), notice and public procedure thereon are unnecessary. Furthermore, for the same reasons, good cause exists for dispensing with a delayed effective date under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1). Inapplicability of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 This document is not subject to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). That Act does not apply to any regulations such as this for which a notice of proposed rulemaking is not required by the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. ) or any other statute. This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in Executive Order 12866. Drafting Information The principal author of this document was Janet Johnson, Regulations Branch, U. S. Customs Service. However, personnel from other offices of the Customs Service participated in its development.
