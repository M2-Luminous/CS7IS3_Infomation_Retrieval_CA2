How are you going to deal with this? [Kono] It is important for us to promote budget deliberations. In the past, an administration was always to blame for a delay in budget deliberations. This time, however, I want the government and the ruling parties to show a sincere attitude to the promotion of deliberations. I want to push deliberations as much as possible during the 38-day period from the start of the Budget Committee session on 23 May until the end of Diet session. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Will your party submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet? [Kono] I think we will because this administration does not represent the people's will at all and it holds only 40 percent of the total seats in the House of Representatives. But, since there are several opposition parties, I don't know whether it would be good for us to act alone, though there is no doubt that we will submit the no-confidence motion. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] When would be the right time to submit the motion? [Kono] It is necessary to pass the budget because it is related to people's livelihood. Therefore, we must promote budget deliberations. But whether or not we will submit the motion right after the budget is approved is a different issue altogether. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you think the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] would win a general election if it was held now? [Kono] I think we would definitely win. We are always ready to contest an election. But we want to hold it under the single-seat electoral district system, if possible. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Which electoral system--the single-seat or the multiseat system--would give the LDP an advantage over other parties? [Kono] The single-seat electoral system would give us the greatest advantage. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is expected that if your party submits a no-confidence motion after the bill for redistricting electoral constituencies has been submitted to the Diet, the ruling parties as well as some LDP members will criticize the party, saying it is attempting to "kill political reform." [Kono] The LDP has never said we would force the government to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a general election. We only said we cannot trust this cabinet. The redistricting bill can be submitted even after the cabinet has changed. I rather think some people will start asking if we should allow a minority ruling cabinet to redraw the electoral districts. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the LDP's relationship with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]? [Kono] Although the LDP is the No. 1 opposition party, we do not have a majority. It is natural that the LDP will cooperate with several parties if we want to have decisive power. Since the LDP and the SDPJ are the major opposition parties, we want to cooperate with SDPJ, whenever possible, on Diet matters that could result in the overthrow of the current administration. But this is possible only if both parties share the same perception of the current political situation. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] But there is a large gap between the policies of the two parties. Will it become an obstacle to cooperation? [Kono] It could become an obstacle. We need further discussions within the party as to whether we should start policy consultations with the SDPJ immediately. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] How about the LDP's relationship with Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger Party]? [Kono] I think that psychologically, the SDPJ and Sakigake have something in common. But as far as policies are concerned, there are more similarities between Sakigake and the LDP. Since Sakigake is saying it will "not join the cabinet but support the coalition until the budget is approved," we may not share with Sakigake as many views as we do with the SDPJ in dealing with Diet matters during budget deliberations. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you think Sakigake could be a partner in coordinating policies? [Kono] I think so. [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Since you have been giving priority to the issue of avoiding another split within the party, there is a criticism both inside and outside the LDP that you have failed to drastically reform the party. [Kono] I think there is a big difference between the current LDP and the old LDP, which had Mr. Ichiro Ozawa (Shinseito secretary general) and other people as its members. Mr. Ozawa used to shut himself up in the office of secretary general with people who are now Shinseito members. My LDP is entirely different. Mr. Michio Watanabe once said we needed a "reform tantamount to forming the party." I think he is right. But I also think we have done a good job in revising the seniority system, in which certain favors were given to party members depending on how many terms they served in the Diet and which factions they belonged to. Though I would not say the revision was done perfectly.
