This applies first and foremost to the qualitative improvement of a number of elements of the strategic nuclear forces, including battle management systems, communications systems and automated command-and-control systems at the tactical level, several types of precision weapons, electronic warfare systems, servicemen's personal gear and equipment, and the creation of a multirole fighter-bomber. However, the results of all this work are under threat in 1994 because of the drastically deteriorating situation as regards the financing of defense needs. As your IZVESTIYA correspondent was told in conversation by specialists from the Defense Ministry Committee for Military-Political Policy, if current financial trends are maintained a complete stoppage of work on creating new armaments systems can be expected. Resources today no longer suffice even to pay the wages in scientific research institutes and design bureaus carrying out defense orders.
