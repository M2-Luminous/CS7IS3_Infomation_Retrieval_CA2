The Rabin response was sent to 'Arafat through a Palestinian mediator. Earlier this week the prime minister said 'Arafat's letters dealt with issues relating to the autonomy agreements and problems that have arisen in the territories. Qol Yisra'el's diplomatic correspondent says it appears the issues include the closure on the territories, and clashes in Hebron between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers and civilians.
