The government decided earlier Monday to send Matsunaga, the trade representative for external affairs, to Marrakech for the signing of a new global trade pact concluded under GATT. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said the government is still considering sending Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata to Morocco for talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on the possible resumption of stalled bilateral trade negotiations. Takemura said the government wants to reach a quick decision on whether Hata should be in Marrakech at least on Friday, the final day of the four-day GATT meeting. Hata, however, may not be able to undertake the trip amid the domestic political turmoil triggered by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's decision to step down. Matsunaga will also attend a quadilateral meeting of Japan, the United States, Canada and the European Union, expected on Wednesday, and will deliver a speech at the GATT meeting on Thursday if Hata is unable to go to Morocco, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said. Saito also indicated that Matsunaga will meet Kantor in case Hata is unable to go to Morocco.
