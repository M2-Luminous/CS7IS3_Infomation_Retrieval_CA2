Pr." in San Cristobal; date not given: "`It is Better To Die Fighting Rather Than Die of Dysentery'" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] [Text] San Cristobal -- He was one of the few with his face covered and armed with a machine gun. He was the only non-Indios. As he spoke, he took a pipe out of his pocket and slipped it into the opening of his balaclava. He expressed himself clearly as an intellectual would when speaking to simple people. He is definitely Mexican but his accent was unrecognizable. A Japanese-eyed girl wearing a black balaclava stood by his side during the entire interview. [L'UNITA] Commander Marcos, you captured San Cristobal on 1 January. But who are you? [Marcos] We are part of the Zapatist Liberation Army [name as published] and we demand the resignation of the federal government and the formation of a new transitional government that will set August 1994 as the date for free and democratic elections. We demand that the principal requests of the peasants from Chiapas for bread, health, education, autonomy, and peace, be resolved. The Indios have always been at war because up to now the war was always waged against them, but now it will be war for the Indios and the whites. In any case, they will have the opportunity of dying fighting rather than of diarrhea, the way the Indios from Chiapas normally die. [L'UNITA] Have you any relations with peasant political organizations? [Marcos] We have no relations with any type of open organization, our organization is solely an armed and clandestine organization. [L'UNITA] Have you sprung up out of nowhere, all of a sudden? [Marcos] We have been preparing ourselves in the mountains for 10 years now. This movement is not improvised. We have been maturing, thinking, learning, and we have reached this decision. [L'UNITA] Do your requests have a racial, ethnic connotation? [Marcos] The managing committee is made up of Tzotil, Tzetal, Chol, Tojolabal, Mam, and Zoque Indios, the principal ethnic groups in Chiapas. They all meet and in addition to asking for democracy and representation, they ask for respect, the respect that the whites have never given them. Primarily here in San Cristobal, the whites [coletos] are very insulting and discriminatory toward the Indios in everyday life. Now the whites respect the Indios because they see them with weapons in their hands. [L'UNITA] What do you think the government's reaction will be now? [Marcos] The government's response does not worry us to the same extent that the response of the people, the Mexicans, does. We are interested in knowing what example this occurrence will produce, what effect it will have on the nation's conscience. We hope that something will happen, not only in terms of an armed battle, but in every sense. We hope that this masked dictatorship will end. [L'UNITA] Do you not put your trust in the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] as an opposition party in the forthcoming elections? [Marcos] It is not so much in the political parties that we have no faith as in the electoral system. The Salinas de Gortari government is an illegitimate government, the result of fraud, and this illegitimate government can only give rise to illegitimate elections. We want a transitional government that will call new elections but with a contest that is really fair and equal, offering the same conditions to all the political parties. In Chiapas 15,000 Indios die each year from diseases that can be cured. This figure is similar to that caused by the war in Salvador. Here, if a farmer with cholera goes to a field hospital, they send him away to prevent people saying that there is cholera in Chiapas. In this movement the Indios that are part of the Zapatista army want to have talks with their own people primarily. They are are the real interlocutors. [L'UNITA] Excuse me, but you are not an Indios. [Marcos] You must understand that our movement is not a local Chiapas movement, but a movement that embraces the whole country. So are the people, who come from other states, as I do. There a people from Chiapas fighting in other places. We are Mexicans and that is what unites us, together with our demand for liberty and democracy. We want to elect our real representatives. [L'UNITA] But do you not fear strong repression now? [Marcos] American Indians have been the vitims for repression for 500 years. Perhaps you refer to the sort of repression typical of South American regimes. Well, this South American style of repression is the Indios' daily bread. Ask the Indios living on the outskirts of San Cristobal. [L'UNITA] What development would you consider successful? [Marcos] We would like other movements from all over the republic to join ours. [L'UNITA] Must they be armed? [Marcos] No, we are making a broad appeal: We are also addressing people from civil, legal, open movements. [L'UNITA] Why have you chosen 1 January and the city of San Cristobal de Las Casas? [Marcos] The managing committee made that decision. It is clear that the date coincides with the TLC (free trade treaty), which is a death sentence for the Indios. The coming into force of the treaty represents the start of internationalized destruction. [L'UNITA] What do you think reaction abroad will be? Are you not afraid that the United States may intervene as it has done in other parts of Latin America? [Marcos] Previously the United States used the excuse of the Soviet Union; it feared Soviet infiltration in our country. But now, what can it think of a movement that is only asking for social justice? It can no longer think that we are being manipulated by foreigners or that Moscow is funding us, since Moscow does not exist any more: Ask Yeltsin. The Americans must realize that we are fighting for what everybody wants, for what the Europeans themselves wanted. Didn't the people in Germany and Italy rebel against dictatorship? Is it therefore unreasonable for the Mexican people to rebel as well? The North Americans are much to blame for the situation that you can see, the state of poverty of the Indios and their great hunger for justice. The entire social system in Mexico is based on injustice toward the Indios. The worst thing that can happen to a human being is to be an Indios, with the heavy load of humiliation, hunger, and poverty that he must bear.
