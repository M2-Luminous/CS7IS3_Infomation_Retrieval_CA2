He said that if Ukraine did not pass its strategic bombers to Russia on acceptable terms this year, they would simply turn into scrap metal. He also noted that even now many of these planes would hardly be able to take off and that all of the maintenance facilities were located in Russia. He said he did not know anything about forthcoming talks with Ukraine on the transfer of the bombers to Russia. He also noted that Russia and Ukraine had not yet come to terms on the sum which Russia is to pay for the bombers. He said that the 8 billion dollars claimed by Ukraine was unacceptable. Russia is ready to write off 217 billion rubles from the Ukrainian debt for the Russian energy and fuel in exchange for the bombers, he stated. Ukraine has 42 heavy strategic bombers.
