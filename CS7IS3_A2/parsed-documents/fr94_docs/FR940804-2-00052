FR940804-2-00052 FR940804-2-00024 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Oak Ridge Operations; Determination of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i), it intends to issue on a noncompetitive basis a grant to Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, to continue providing academic training and sufficient on-the-job training to interns to enable them to function as professionals in environmental remediation and waste treatment resulting from the decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. The period of performance for the grant will be three years. The estimated cost is $833,973. First year funding will be $150,000. procurement request no.: 05&hyph;940R22343.000. project scope: Vanderbilt University's May 27, 1994 application is for continuation of effort begun on a previous grant. This internship program provides six people a year with the proper academic training and sufficient on-the-job training to enable them to function as professionals in environmental remediation and waste treatment resulting from the decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. The grant, which supports the Student Assisted Remediation Program in Environmental Management, plays a major role in meeting the objective of providing young, trained personnel to enter the fields of environmental remediation and waste treatment. At the end of the first year of academic work, the students are assigned for three months to a DOE-owned contractor-operated facility or to a DOE prime contractor to gain first-hand experience in the field. To date, most of the graduating students have chosen to work in the areas for which they have trained, thereby meeting the primary objective of the program. In view of the nation's environmental consciousness related to cleanup of Department of Energy facilities, it is clear that the increase in the number of skilled personnel trained in environmental remediation and waste treatment as a result of the Vanderbilt University Internship Program will aid in strengthening the Department's position of assuring that contaminated site are properly decontaminated and decomissioned in an efficient and timely manner. In order to maintain continuity of a long-range program that began in 1984, eligibility for this award is restricted to Vanderbilt University.
