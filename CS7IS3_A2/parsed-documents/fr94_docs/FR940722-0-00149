FR940722-0-00149 FR940722-0-00019 (1) The information previously filed is over one A4 (21 cm x 29.7 cm) or 8.5 x 11 inch (21.6 cm x 27.9 cm) page in length, and all information referenced therein is current and accurate in all significant respects under §1.65 of this chapter; and (2) The reference states specifically where the previously filed information can actually be found, including mention of: (i) The station call sign or application file number whenever the reference is to station files or previously filed applications; and (ii) The title of the proceeding, the docket number, and any legal citations, whenever the reference is to a docketed proceeding. However, question on an application form which call for specific technical data, or which can be answered by a ``yes'' or ``no'' or other short answer shall be answered as appropriate and shall not be cross-referenced to a previous filing. (d) In addition to the general application requirements of Subpart F and §§1.2105 of this Chapter, 24.813 and 24.815, applicants shall submit any additional documents, exhibits, or signed written statements of fact: (1) As may be required by these rules; and (2) As the Commission, at any time after the filing of an application and during the term of any authorization, may require from any applicant, permittee or licensee to enable it to determine whether a radio authorization should be granted, denied or revoked. (e) Except when the Commission has declared explicitly to the contrary, an informational requirement does not in itself imply the processing treatment of decisional weight to be accorded the response. (f) All applicants (except applicants filing FCC Form 175) are required to indicate at the time their application is filed whether or not a Commission grant of the application may have a significant environmental impact as defined by §1.1307 of this Chapter. If answered affirmatively, the requisite environmental assessment as prescribed in §1.1311 of this Chapter must be filed with the application and Commission environmental review must be completed prior to construction. See §1.1312 of this chapter. All broadband PCS licensees are subject to continuing obligation to determine whether subsequent construction may have a significant environmental impact prior to undertaking such construction and to otherwise comply with §1.1301 through 1.1319 of this Chapter. See §1.1312 of this Chapter. §24.814 [Reserved] §24.815 Technical content of applications; maintenance of list of station locations. (a) All applications required by this part shall contain all technical information required by the application forms or associated Public Notice(s). Applications other than initial applications for a broadband PCS license must also comply with all technical requirements of the rules governing the broadband PC ( see Subparts C and E of this Part as appropriate). The following paragraphs describe a number of general technical requirements. (b) Each application (except applications for initial licenses filed on Form 175) for a license for broadband PCS must comply with the provisions of §§24.229&hyph;24.238 of the Commission's Rules. (c)&hyph;(i) [Reserved] (j) The location of the transmitting antenna shall be considered to be the station location. Broadband PCS licensees must maintain a current list of all station locations, which must describe the transmitting antenna site by its geographical coordinates and also by conventional reference to street number, landmark, or the equivalent. All such coordinates shall be specified in terms of degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude. §24.816 Station antenna structures. (a) Unless the broadband PCS licensee has received prior approval from the FCC, no antenna structure, including radiating elements, tower, supports and all appurtenances, may be higher than 61 m (200 feet) above ground level at its site. (b) Unless the broadband PCS licensee has received prior approval from the FCC, no antenna structure that is located either at an airport or heliport that is available for public use and is listed in the Airport Directory of the current Airman's Information Manual or in either the Alaska or Pacific Airman's Guide and Chart Supplement, or at an airport or heliport under construction that is the subject of a notice or proposal on file with the FAA and, except for military airports, it is clearly indicated that the airport will be available for public use, or at an airport or heliport that is operated by the armed forces of the United States, or at a place near any of these airports or heliports, may be higher than: (1) 1 m above the airport elevation for each 100 m from the airport runway longer than 1 km within 6.1 km of the antenna structure. (2) 2 m above the airport elevation for each 100 m from the nearest runway shorter than 1 km within 3.1 km of the antenna structure. (3) 4 m above the airport elevation for each 100 m from the nearest landing pad within 1.5 km of the antenna structure. (c) A broadband PCS station antenna structure no higher than 6.1 m (20 feet) above ground level at its site or no higher than 6.1 m above any natural object or existing manmade structure, other than an antenna structure, is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. (d) Further details as to whether an aeronautical study and/or obstruction marking and lighting may be required, and specifications for obstruction marking and lighting, are contained in Part 17 of the FCC Rules, Construction, Marking and Lighting of Antenna Structures. To request approval to place an antenna structure higher than the limits specified in paragraph (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the licensee must notify the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on FAA Form 7460&hyph;1 and the FCC on FCC Form 854. §§24.817&hyph;24.818 [Reserved] 24.819 Waiver of rules. (a) Requests for waiver. (1) A waiver of these rules may be granted upon application or by the Commission on its own motion. Requests for waivers shall contain a statement of reason sufficient to justify a waiver. Waivers will not be granted except upon an affirmative showing: (i) That the underlying purpose of the rule will not be served, or would be frustrated, by its application in a particular case, and that grant of the waiver is otherwise in the public interest; or (ii) That the unique facts and circumstances of a particular case render application of the rule inequitable, unduly burdensome or otherwise contrary to the public interest. Applicants must also show the lack of a reasonable alternative. (2) If the information necessary to support a waiver request is already on file, the applicant may cross-reference to the specific filing where it may be found. (b) Denial of waiver, alternate showing required. If a waiver is not granted, the application will be dismissed as defective unless the applicant has also provided an alternative proposal which complies with the Commission's rules (including any required showings). §24.820 Defective applications. (a) Unless the Commission shall otherwise permit, an application will be unacceptable for filing and will be returned to the applicant with a brief statement as to the omissions or discrepancies if: (1) The application is defective with respect to completeness of answers to questions, informational showings, execution or other matters of a formal character; or (2) The application does not comply with the Commission's rules, regulations, specific requirements for additional information or other requirements. See also §1.2105 of this Chapter. (b) Some examples of common deficiencies which result in defective applications under paragraph (a) of this section are:
