They will meet in Washington once again before the vice ministerial-level meeting set for 24 and 25 January. The insurance sector belongs to the priorirty area in the framework talks, and the two governments are required to come up with a report on it before the Japan-U.S. summit on 11 February, but it is likely that the negotiations will drag on till the last moment. The two countries confronted each other over three points: 1) the substance of the objective criteria; 2) the participation of Japanese firms in the U.S. market; and 3) the scope of areas where the government power is supposed to reach. The three points are all those related to the countries' basic stands in the framework talks. Even though the United States insists it is "not seeking to set market-share targets on the premise of taking retaliatory actions," it demands that shares comparable to those in the industrialized nations (G-7) be cited as one of the accepted objective criteria, while Japan is opposed to it. The Japanese delegation insisted that the "cited market share will become de facto numerical targets." Japan also insists that the Japanese companies' access to the U.S. insurance market should be included in the talks, but the United States is opposed to it.
