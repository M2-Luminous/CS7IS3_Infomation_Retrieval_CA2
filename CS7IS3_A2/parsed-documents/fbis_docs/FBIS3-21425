The genesis of the Kashmir problem is rooted in its history and the events of the last 40 years. It is a complex problem, which the Czech republic is observing from the outside, he said. He clarified that this was the political stand of his government. Mr Havel said that he could not offer any personal views on Kashmir and the allegations of human rights violations, since he had not been to the state to personally see the realities. If he had the time and the opportunity to visit Kashmir and see things for himself it would be possible to make an assessment of the validity or otherwise of international accusations against India of human rights violations in the valley. The official position of the Czech republic on Kashmir is that the matter is an internal affair of India and Pakistan and the problems should be resolved through mutual negotiations on the basis of the Shimla agreement of 1972. Playwright, philosopher and dissident-turned-establishment politician, the Czech President chafes under the burden of office. He confessed that the most unpleasant part of being a head of state was to have to repeat several times over the same words at different fora. For a wordsmith, who has described his paradox as "I write mercilessly sceptical" pieces, repetition must be agony. The demands on his time to perform public duties eats into his pursuit of art. Mr Havel said that writing had become a victim of his political career. While the horrors of "criminality, hatred among nationalities, suspicion, racism, deliberate lying, politicking in an unrestrained struggle for purely partisan interests, a hunger for power, unadulterated ambition" had receded in the Czech republic, the dangers lurked under the surface. These spectres were rampant outside the Czech republic, Mr. Havel said. There was xenophobia, fanaticism and violence against which the struggle for morality and responsibility and conscience would have to be waged. Mr Havel said that there were basic human rights that would have to be protected. As head of state, he would use the opportunity to further the cause of human rights. The global yardstick for human rights would have to be forged out of the inherent truths in every religion, which fundamentalists in their own self-interest had perverted to serve their fundamentalist cause. These inherent truths which were the essence of every religion would have to form the basic foundation of a global yardstick for human rights. Mr Havel said the virus of truth was an analogy he had used to describe the dissident movement against the totalitarian regime in former Czechoslovakia. Battling ethnic conflict and violence generated by hatred between nationalities required a different remedy. Truth was weak against the accumulated bitterness of ethnic conflict and violence, he said. Mr Havel spent part of the morning visiting Mother Teresa and handed over a cheque for the Missionaries of Charity. He visited the Kalighat temple as well.
