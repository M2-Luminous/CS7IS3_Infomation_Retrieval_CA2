HURRIYET has ascertained that Bilgin Unan, deputy under secretary at the Turkish Foreign Ministry, informed Russian officials in Moscow last week that the peacekeeping force to be deployed in Azerbaijan must be established by international units. He said: "Russia cannot be the only country to deploy troops in Azerbaijan. Turkey will also deploy its troops if Russia sends its military forces to that republic." Stressing that Turkey will accept no solution that will allow Armenian forces to be present in Azerbaijan, Unan reiterated Ankara's view that the solution must come within the framework of the CSCE Minsk Group's effort. Russian officials have insisted that their country's plan must also be effected in parallel with the Minsk Group's effort. Unan responded by saying that a comprehensive solution must be found to resolve the dispute. According to the Turkish officials' impression, Russia will keep trying to impose Moscow's plan on the Baku administration. The plan calls for the deployment of Russia's troops in Azerbaijan. It has been ascertained that Ankara, considering the possibility of President Aliyev agreeing to Russia's plan, regards the Azerbaijani People's Front and former President Abulfaz Elchibey as a second force guaranteeing opposition in that republic to Moscow's intention.
