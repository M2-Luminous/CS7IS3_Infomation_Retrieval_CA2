This will be the highest "advisory" organ serving the Political Bureau, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the State Military Commission when they formulate policies and handle important issues at home and abroad; it will be led by the Political Bureau and be directly responsible to the Political Bureau, the State Council, and the CPC Central Military Commission. Wan Li and Gu Mu Suggest Establishing a "Staff Headquarters" of the Party, Government, and Army News from Zhongnanhai: A central-level "staff headquarters" of the party, government, and army is imminent. It will be the highest "advisory" organ serving the Political Bureau, the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, the State Council, the CPC Central Military Commission, and the State Military Commission when they formulate policies and handle important issues at home and abroad. According to information, the idea of establishing such a consultative organ was first proposed to Deng Xiaoping by Wan Li and Gu Mu after the Eighth National People's Congress. At that time, thought was given to inviting some retired party, government, and army officials to join the organ. Deng Xiaoping thought it was a good idea to establish such an organ but did not agree with the idea of inviting retired persons to join it. He raised five points: First, the organ should play a role in assisting work and proposing strategies; second, it must be led by the Political Bureau; third, members should be strong and experienced and they must include some comrades from the Political Bureau Standing Committee and the Central Military Commission; fourth, no old and retired persons should join it because it must not have the nature of the Central Advisory Commission; and fifth, the work and functions of the organ are to be completely internal. "CPC Central Committee Policy Consultation Office" To Consist of One Office and Six Groups In the middle of August, the Political Bureau discussed the membership composition and work nature of the planned "CPC Central Committee Policy Consultation Office" (another suggestion was that it should be called the "Policy Leadership Office). It was decided that the office should be located within the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and that 80 senior and middle-ranking cadres should be transferred from the CPC Central Committee; the State Council ministries, commissions, and offices; and the CPC Central Military Commission to participate in the work. Thereafter, the Political Bureau thought that the organ should not be too clumsy and in principle they should all hold the posts concurrently and no duties or titles will be created for them. It was initially decided that the idea should lead to the establishment of one office and six groups. One office: The CPC Central Committee Policy Consultation Office. Six Groups: First -- party affairs work group; second -- economic construction work group; third -- social work group; fourth -- national defense work group; fifth -- international relations work group; and sixth -- planning work group. Fifteen Incumbent Senior Party, Government, and Army Personnel Will Participate in the Work Since 15 November, active work has been done to prepare for this organ. According to information, 15 incumbent senior party, government, and army personnel are participating in the work, including Qiao Shi, Hu Jintao, Zou Jiahua, Zhang Zhen, Yu Yongbo, Wang Ruilin, Tao Siju, Ceng Qinghong, and Qi Huaiyuan. Qiao Shi, Hu Jintao, Zou Jiahua, and Zhang Zhen will participate in the work of the office. It has been alleged that during the period of the Third Plenary Session, Jiang Zemin once disclosed the message that, after discussions and studies by the Political Bureau, it has been initially decided that a CPC Central Committee Policy Consultation Office will be established, led by the Political Bureau; the office will be directly responsible to the Political Bureau, the State Council, and the CPC Central Military Commission. At the senior level, some people think that such a move will cause things to overlap and make the already redundant central organ even more redundant. Some people express support for the establishment of this "general staff headquarters," saying that it can play a liaison role between the party, government, and army, and offer plans and strategies on the macrofoundation incorporating the party, government, and army, to assist the central leadership in formulating policies and handling important issues at home and abroad.
