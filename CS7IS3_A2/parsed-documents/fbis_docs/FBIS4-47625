FBIS TRENDS-13MAY94-IRAQ Baghdad Media Modify Tactics, Retain Hostility to Kuwait Baghdad Media Modify Tactics, Retain Hostility to Kuwait SUMMARY Iraqi media, evidently with an eye to future UN Security Council reviews of the sanctions against Iraq, have avoided since mid- March some of the most flagrant express ions that they had previously used to convey Baghdad's nonrecognition of Kuwait. Nevertheless, Iraqi officials and media have continued to express hostility to Kuwait in other terms. END SUMMARY Since 11 March, monitored Iraqi media have not been observed to refer to Kuwait as "the 19th governorate" or to use other expressions, such as calling the Kuwaiti Government "the rulers imposed on Kuwait," that until then had appeared frequently in the media, especially in the daily Babil, which is owned by President Saddam Husayn's son 'Udayy. The last monitored use of such an expression occurred in a 10 March Babil article by Saddam's press secretary 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin, in which he repeatedly referred to Kuwait as "Kazimah," the name Iraqis gave to Kuwait City during the period of Iraqi occupation. Nevertheless, Iraqi media have continued to indicate nonrecognition of Kuwait and contempt and hostility toward its leaders in other terms. -- With one notable exception, Iraqi media have not been observed to refer to the Kuwaiti Government as "the Government of Kuwait" since August 1990. Instead, they have been observed to refer to the Kuwaiti amir and heir apparent nearly always without their titles and by their first names only, and to treat "the Kuwaiti rulers" with consistent disdain, in accordance with Saddam's declaration that these rulers have "lost every legitimate right to rule" (INA, 18 January). The exception was a statement made last month by National Assembly Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih, who used the expression "the Government of Kuwait," but only in a negative context of charging this government with failing to convey Iraqi proposals to the Kuwaiti parliament (Iraqi News Agency [INA], 16 April). (See Note 1) (Note 1) In a transparent propaganda move, National Assembly Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih said that the Iraqi National Assembly is ready to discuss "all outstanding issues" with a delegation from the Kuwaiti parliament and to convince it that the charges that Iraq holds Kuwaiti nationals captured during the occupation are 'exposed lies and fabrications." Apparently seeking to drive a wedge between the Kuwaiti Government and parliament, Salih proposed that an Arab mediator conduct "shuttle tours" between the Iraqi and Kuwaiti parliaments "so as not to allow the government officials in Kuwait to drive things toward the worst, as they did before 2 August 1990" (Iraqi News Agency [INA], 16 April). The offer was roundly rejected by the speaker of Kuwait's National Assembly (Kuwait radio, 19 April). -- On 11 April, an article in the Ba'th Party daily Al-Thawrah accused "the al-Sabah [the Kuwaiti ruling family surname] rulers" of "squandering wealth, mortgaging sovereignty, and doing away with security." It castigated them for making military agreements with an "enemy" [presumably the United States, although Kuwait has also signed agreements with Russia, the United Kingdom, and France], failing to "atone for their great sins," and "being hostile to Iraq and buying other people's hostility to Iraq." -- On 21 April, an Al-Thawrah editorial characterized past and present stands of "the Kuwaiti rulers" as "selfish, mean, introverted, incomprehensible, and arrogant." It urged "honest men in Kuwait" to "confront the Kuwaiti rulers' suspect course" because they allegedly "continue to be the ones who determine when and how to provoke or permit the provocation of wars and seditions and guarantee placing the region into the wolf's mouth, as leader President Saddam Husayn said on 17 July 1990." (See Note 2) (Note 2) In a speech broadcast by Baghdad radio that day, Saddam said that "the United States wants an increasing strategic reserve . . . primarily to control the instigation of wars, strife, and all that would put the wolf at the region's throat" -- In the same context, as recently as 8 May, the Information Ministry's English-language daily Baghdad Observer accused "the Kuwaiti regime" of working together with the United States and Saudi Arabia "to destabilize the security and political situation in Yemen" (INA). Dual Line Illustrating Baghdad's equivocation on Kuwait's status, Iraqi officials occasionally have made statements implying that Iraq no longer claims Kuwait, but these have appeared only in foreign interviews and press conferences, not in domestic media. For example: -- According to a Jordanian paper, Iraqi Information Minister Hamid Yusuf Hammadi said at a press conference in Yemen on 16 April that "Iraq has long dropped its claim to sovereignty over Kuwait as the 19th governorate" (Al-Dustur, 17 April). Monitored Iraqi media merely quoted Hammadi as saying it was a "distortion to link the sanctions to the issue of Kuwait" (INA, 16 April). -- According to the text of an interview with an Austrian daily, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz said that "for the [Iraqi] government, the Kuwait issue is finished," but insinuating that the Iraqi people will continue to view Kuwait as part of Iraq, he added, "one cannot stop people from thinking whatever they want to think" and "one cannot erase historical facts" (Der Standard, 11-12 May). Even when addressing foreign audiences, however, Iraqi leaders have never recognized the UN demarcation of the Iraq-Kuwait border. Asked in an interview with Paris Radio Monte Carlo whether Iraq will recognize the border with Kuwait if the embargo is lifted, Speaker Salih said: "Until 2 August 1990, we considered Kuwait a state . . . . When we accepted Resolution 660, I think that implicitly meant recognition. But, if we are asked, after all that happened to our people, to be lenient to our people's enemies -- who insist on harming us -- of course, this puts us in an embarrassing position" (25 March). Background Since the spring of 1991, the Iraqi regime has been maneuvering between two incongruous positions, claiming on the one hand that it is fulfilling the terms of the UN resolutions while, on the other hand, condemning these resolutions as unfair and defending as legitimate and proper the policy course that led it to invade Kuwait. Thus, in June 1991, Hammadi stated that Iraq's acceptance of UN Security Council Resolution 686 -- which requires Iraq to immediately rescind its annexation of Kuwait -- "has not changed" (INA, 3 June 1991). Hammadi was seeking to minimize the damage of a statement by Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan that it is "still our opinion" that Kuwait is "part of Iraq" and that "if history repeats itself, we will still act in the same way" (interview in Amman Sawt Al-Sha'b, 27 May 1991). Baghdad has never accepted UN Security Council Resolution 833, which requires it to recognize the UN-demarcated border between Iraq and Kuwait. In a letter to the UN secretary general on 21 May 1992, then Foreign Minister Ahmad Husayn laid the foundation for Baghdad to contest the boundary at an opportune moment by declaring that the UN demarcation deprived Iraq of its "historical and geographical rights," harmed its "vital interests," and was "imposed" on it by "force and political blackmail" (INA, 1 June 1992). He added that "the people of Iraq will never accept" the demarcation and cited with approval claims in non-Iraqi media that the demarcation decision is a "time bomb" that contains "the seeds of another war." Responding to demands by UN Security Council members that Iraq announce its recognition of the UN-demarcated border, Deputy Prime Minister 'Aziz implicitly rejected Resolution 833 by stating in a letter to the UN Security Council that only if the sanctions and the no-fly zones are removed, will it be possible for Iraq to discuss its border with Kuwait "in accordance with the rules regulating relations among states as cited in the UN Charter and the Arab League Charter," but obviously not in accordance with Resolution 833, which requires acceptance of the demarcation precisely to avoid any further dispute (Baghdad radio, 17 March). Implications imply Iraqi nonrecognition of Kuwait is aimed at further eroding international support for the sanctions. Nevertheless, the expression of hostility toward Kuwait in other ways, as well as Iraq's failure to accept Resolution 833 and repeatedly voiced claim that the issue of Kuwait has nothing to do with lifting sanctions, suggest that the present Iraqi regime does not intend to recognize the UN-demarcated Iraq-Kuwait boundary and hopes to challenge it at an opportune moment. Recent media treatment of Kuwait also suggests that Iraq will not recognize the Kuwaiti Government so long as it believes that its strategy to lift the sanctions can succeed without such recognition.
