FR940817-1-00031 FR940817-1-00011 (K) Record of Meetings: In accordance with FACA's requirements, FRA would keep a record of all Committee meetings. This record would be placed in the public docket for this rulemaking. Meetings of the Committee would generally be open to the public. (L) Consensus: The goal of the negotiating process is consensus. FRA proposes that the Committee would develop its own definition of consensus, which may include unanimity, a simple majority, or substantial agreement such that no member will disapprove the final recommendation of the Committee. However, if the Committee does not develop its own definition, consensus shall be unanimous concurrence. (M) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Final Rule: The Committee's first objective is to prepare a report containing a notice of proposed rulemaking, preamble, and economic evalutation. If consensus is not obtained on some issues, the report should identify the areas of agreement and disagreement, and explanations for any disagreement. It is expected that participants will address cost/benefit, paperwork reduction, and regulatory flexibility requirements. FRA would prepare an economic assessment if appropriate. FRA would issue the proposed rule as prepared by the Committee unless it is inconsistent with statutory authority of the agency or other legal requirements or does not, in the agency's view, adequately address the subject matter. If that occurs, FRA would explain the reasons for its decision, or would modify the proposal in a way that allows the public to distinguish modifications from the original proposal. The Committee would reconvene to review comments received in response to publication of the proposed rule and would negotiate to produce a recommended final rule. FRA would issue the recommended final rule as prepared by the Committee unless it is inconsistent with statutory authority of the agency or other legal requirements or does not, in the agency's view, adequately address the subject matter. If that occurs, FRA would explain the reasons for its decision, or would modify the recommended final rule in a way that allows the public to distinguish modifications from the recommended final rule. (N) Key Issues for Negotiation: FRA has reviewed correspondence, petitions, injury data, existing railroad operating practices, and has engaged in extensive dialogue concerning the protection of roadway workers. Based on this information and rulemaking requirements, FRA has tentatively identified major issues that should be considered in this negotiated rulemaking. Other issues related to roadway protection not specifically listed in this Notice may be addressed as they arise in the course of the negotiation. Comments are invited concerning the appropriateness of these issues for consideration and whether other issues should be added. 1. Are devices available that may be used to reduce the risk of danger to roadway workers? If so, how do these devices work and what are the costs associated with them? 2. Are there appropriate procedures or operating practices that may be instituted effectively to reduce the risk of danger to roadway workers? If so, what are the costs that will be associated with implementing these practices and procedures? 3. Are there appropriate training programs that may be given to reduce the risk of danger to roadway workers? If so, at what intervals should they be taught? Also, what are the costs and the time associated with such a program? 4. Are there peculiar topographical, environmental, and operational conditions that must be considered in developing a program to reduce the risk of harm to roadway workers? What are the specific conditions, and how do they vary from one region to another, and from one railroad to another? What would the cost for this program be? 5. Should any program developed vary according to the size of a railroad? If so, explain why such variations are necessary and how the programs should differ. 6. What recordkeeping and reporting requirements, if any, should be instituted to advance the safety of roadway workers? What is the amount of time and cost involved with these requirements? 7. What enforcement procedures should FRA utilize to ensure compliance with any rule developed? 8. Aside from the obvious benefit of providing safer working conditions and so reducing the risk of injury and death for roadway workers, are there additional benefits (both monetary and non-monetary) that will result from the implementation of a rule concerning roadway workers? 9. Do any railroads currently have internal operating practices that address the intended purposes of this negotiated rulemaking? If so, please provide the background for implementation of these practices, and a description of their effectiveness. Also, what were the costs and benefits associated with implementing these practices? IV. Public Participation FRA invites comments on all issues, procedures, guidelines, interests, and suggested participants embodied in this Notice. All comments and requests for participation should be submitted to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Room 8201, Washington, DC 20590. Issued this 11th day of August 1994. Jolene M. Molitoris, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20078 Filed 8&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;06&hyph;P
