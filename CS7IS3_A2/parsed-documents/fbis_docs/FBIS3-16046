In an interview with ITAR-TASS he described as groundless today's reports that agreements were signed at the meeting. Such claims, he said, pursue purely propaganda motives, and Azerbaijan is passing off as fact its versions of a regional peace settlement. Ararktsyan recalled that at the meeting various suggestions were made regarding a cease-fire and peace guarantees, which could be based on the CSCE's Vienna timetable, Russian proposals, and also other possibilities.
