The scenario looks like this: According to the poll "We and Our Time," conducted by the Independent Institute of Socioeconomic and Political Research, along with the International Center of Support of Entrepreneurship, the majority of respondents -- 40.9 percent -- think that socialism is the most appropriate social system for Belarus. Capitalism is supported by 31.6 percent. At the same time, 52.8 percent think that private ownership is economically more efficient. Only 29 percent favor social ownership. Some 11.7 percent support a rational combination of private and social ownership. Emotions caused by nostalgia for "the best, the most humane in the world" will likely dominate people's minds for a long time to come. In connection with this, we would like to learn what social order our current leaders are building in our state. It is high time to clarify this provocative question.
