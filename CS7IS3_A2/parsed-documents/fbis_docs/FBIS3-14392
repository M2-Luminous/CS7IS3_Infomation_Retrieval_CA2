It appears that the United States is not content with its full bias toward Israel and with guaranteeing its military superiority over all the Arabs. Not content with impeding -- for three weeks following the massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron -- a Security Council resolution condemning the massacre and providing protection for the Palestinian people, it wants to reward the killers by declaring that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. Such a grave declaration attributed to the U.S. President is a precedent in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The official stance of every U.S. Administration -- Republican or Democrat -- as evidenced by documents has stipulated that the status of Jerusalem and its future can be decided only within the framework of negotiations between all the parties and as part of the final, comprehensive, and just settlement in the Middle East. This stance has been in force throughout recent years, since the establishment of the State of Israel. Now, with a frankness that can only be envied, the U.S. President comes to declare his new stance that Jerusalem is the unified capital of Israel. He then pledged to impede any Security Council resolution condemning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre if it included or even hinted that Jerusalem is part of the occupied Arab territories. This U.S. stance was confirmed after Washington refused to agree to a clause in the Security Council resolution issued the day before yesterday pointing out that Jerusalem is an occupied Palestinian territory. It appears that President Clinton, whose popularity has started to wane at a time when he is suffering from the "Whitewater" scandal in which he and his wife are accused of using their influence to profit and avoid paying taxes, wants to win over the Jewish pressure groups in the United States. So he has shown no regard for the feelings of Arabs and Muslims, not to mention their legitimate rights. And why not? The Arabs have been deprived of everything, even the ability to protest. And why not, when the peace efforts are stalling and have resulted in nothing more than retreats and concessions by the Arabs to Israel in return for endless U.S. rewards to Israel from the Arabs' pockets and at the Arabs' own expense? [passage omitted] This U.S. stance on Israel and the massacre that the whole world condemned is not simply one of a complete defense of Israel, but also one of pressure on the Palestinian leadership to return to the Oslo Agreement and the negotiations and abandon any popular demand to amend the Oslo Agreement or propose new items on the agenda. Warren Christopher told the Palestinian president quite clearly: Return to the negotiations unconditionally. He wants the Palestinians to surrender to Israel unconditionally. It remains for us to say: Don't these changes in the U.S. stance require a call for an emergency Arab summit at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo to face a stance that not only affects the Palestinians, but also the entire Arab nation? If an Arab summit is not held now when the Arab-Israeli conflict is entering a critical stage, then when can such a summit be held? All the Arab regimes, not just the Palestinians, are responsible for halting the slide in the Arab stance.
