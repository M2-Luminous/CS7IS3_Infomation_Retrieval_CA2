FR940124-1-00083 FR940124-1-00009 Section 667.1␣Scope and Purpose. The purpose of the State Postsecondary Review Program is to strengthen State oversight of institutions participating in the title IV, HEA programs through the development of State standards for those institutions, and State review of referred institutions using those standards. States will be reimbursed by the Secretary for developing these standards and conducting these reviews. However, a State will not be required to incur any cost or carry out any activity if the State will not be reimbursed for that cost or activity. Several negotiators were concerned that SPREs had the authority under the SPRP to select any institution for review. Reviews by a SPRE are limited to those institutions that currently participate in the title IV, HEA programs that the Secretary or a State identify as meeting one or more of the review criteria in section 494C(b) of the HEA, and those institutions a State has reason to believe are engaged in fraudulent practices. As provided in section 494C(a) of the HEA, a State must request approval from the Secretary before it may conduct a review of an institution the State determines either meets a statutory referral criterion or is engaged in fraudulent practices. If the Secretary approves the State's request or does not disapprove that request within 21 days, the SPRE may conduct a review of that institution under this part. Although the standards that a State develops will be used for the purpose of reviewing referred institutions under this program, nothing in this part or in the statute authorizing the SPRP, title IV, part H, subpart 1 of the HEA, precludes a State from using these developed standards for determining whether to grant a license to or otherwise authorize an institution to provide postsecondary education in the State. However, if a State reviews nonreferred institutions under the standards developed for the SPRP, reviews of those institutions will not be reimbursed. Moreover, the State may not take an action against nonreferred institutions under the SPRP. Section 667.2␣Definitions. Education and general expenditures . The proposed definition of this term was copied from the statutory definition set forth in section 312(a) of part A of title III of the HEA. Part A of title III authorizes the Strengthening Institutions Program. Professional program . The definition of a professional program applies directly to the review standards described in sections 494C(d)(8)(A) and (14)(C) of the HEA and §§667.21(11)(1) and (18)(iii), respectively. The Secretary proposed to define a ``professional program'' as an undergraduate or graduate educational program that prepares individuals for an occupation, if that occupation_ (1) Is listed in a Federal educational program classification manual; (2) Requires at least an associate degree to qualify for entry; (3) Involves the independent practice or application of a defined or organized body of competencies that is unique to the occupation; and (4) Is formally recognized and regulated under a national or State licensure, accreditation, or permit system. Several negotiators argued that many educational programs that would satisfy this proposed definition of a ``professional program'' would also satisfy the proposed definition of a ``vocational program''. Those negotiators believed that, for purposes of developing standards under the SPRP, there should be a clear distinction between the classification of these programs. Vocational program . The definition of ``vocational program'' applies directly to two review standards a State must develop under section 494C(d) of the HEA and §667.21 of these regulations. Under the first standard, described in section 494C(d)(7) of the HEA and repeated in §667.21(a)(10), if an institution offers a program that is designed to prepare students for gainful employment, the State must develop a standard to determine whether the tuition and fees charged for that program by the institution are reasonable given the amount of money that a student who successfully completes that program may reasonably be expected to earn. Under the second review standard, described in section 494C(d)(14)(C) of the HEA and repeated in §667.21(a)(18)(iii), if an institution offers vocational or professional programs, the State must develop standards to determine if those programs are successful as measured, in part, by the placement rate of the graduates of those programs.
