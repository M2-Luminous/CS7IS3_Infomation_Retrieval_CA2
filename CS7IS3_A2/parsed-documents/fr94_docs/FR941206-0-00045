FR941206-0-00045 FR941206-0-00008 As stated in its ``Statement of Basis, Specific Statutory Authority, and Purpose,'' Colorado's intent to apply proposed Rule 3.02.1(7) to industrial, commercial, or residential developments is consistent with the rationale set forth in the Federal regulation preamble. On this basis, and because the proposed rule otherwise includes the same requirement as the Federal regulations to excuse the permittee from bond liability for implementation of features of an alternative postmining land use that are beyond the control of the permittee, the Director finds that proposed Rule 3.02.1(7) is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2). The Director approves the proposed rule. b. Rules 3.02.1(7) and 3.03.1(3)(e), Requirements That Performance Bonds for Approved Alternative Postmining Land Uses of Industrial, Commercial or Residential Must Be Sufficient To Reclaim the Site to a Condition Capable of Supporting the Premining Land Use and Be Held Throughout the Applicable Liability Period Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.02.1(7) to require that a performance bond, for an approved alternative postmining land use of industrial, commercial, or residential, must be sufficient to reclaim the site to a condition capable of supporting the premining land use, should the alternative postmining land use prove to be infeasible in the event of bond forfeiture. Colorado also proposed to revise Rule 3.03.1(3)(e) to require, for areas with an alternative postmining land use designation of industrial, commercial, or residential, bond coverage throughout the applicable liability period that is sufficient for the regulatory authority to return the land to its premining land use in the event of bond forfeiture. There is no specific counterpart in the Federal program to Colorado's proposal that a performance bond, for lands with an approved alternative postmining land use of industrial, commercial, or residential, be sufficient to reclaim the land to the premining land use. However, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.133(a) and 817.133(a) require that land be reclaimed to the premining land use or to a higher or better land use. If, due to bond forfeiture, the alternative postmining land use cannot be implemented, then the requirement to return the land to the premining land use, as proposed at Rules 3.02.1(7) and 3.03.1(3)(e), is consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.133(a) and 817.133(a). Furthermore, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(a)(1) and 800.14(b), require, respectively, that (1) bond liability shall be for a period which is coincident with the operator's period of extended responsibility for successful revegetation or until reclamation requirements of SMCRA, the regulatory program, and the permit are achieved, whichever is later, and (2) the amount of bond shall be sufficient to assure the completion of the reclamation plan if the work has to be performed by the regulatory authority. Colorado's proposal at Rule 3.03.1(3)(e) is consistent with the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(a)(1) and 800.14(b). Based on the discussion above, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 3.02.1(7) and 3.03.1(3)(e), concerning bond coverage sufficient to return lands with an approved alternative postmining land use of industrial, commercial, or residential, to the premining land use in the event of bond forfeiture, are no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(a)(1), 800.14(b), 816.133(a), and 817.133(a). The Director approves the proposed rules. 5. Rules 3.02.2(4) (b) and (d), Adjustments of Bond Amount Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.02.2(4)(b) to specify that the requirements for the Division to provide a written decision and public notice apply to any adjustment, not just an increase, in the bond amount. Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.02.2(4)(d) to specify that a request for bond reduction (1) must be submitted with evidence demonstrating that the reduction is warranted due to a reduction of proposed affected acreage, change in mining or reclamation methods, or other documented factors which reduce the cost of future reclamation, (2) must be submitted in the form of a permit or a technical revision, and (3) cannot be based on reclamation performed, which must be requested as a bond release under Rule 3.03. There is no Federal counterpart to Colorado's proposal at Rule 3.02.2(4)(b) that the Division issue a written decision and provide public notice regarding adjustments in bond amounts. The counterpart Federal regulation to Colorado's proposed Rule 3.02.2(4)(d), at 30 CFR 800.15(c), provides that a permittee may request bond reduction based upon submission of evidence to the regulatory authority proving that the permittee's method of operation or other circumstances reduces the estimated cost for the regulatory authority to reclaim the bonded area. The Federal regulation further provides that a reduction in bond amount involving cost estimates and undisturbed land shall not be considered a request for bond release.
