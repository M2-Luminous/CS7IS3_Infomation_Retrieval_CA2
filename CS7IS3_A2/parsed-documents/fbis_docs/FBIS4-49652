Building a nationwide economic information network is an objective requirement that must be fulfilled as China is establishing its socialist market economy, and it is also a natural outcome of the development of modern telecommunication and computer technology. The gradual establishment of the socialist market economic structure has generated an increasingly urgent demand for the processing, handling, transmission, and exchange of economic information. On the one hand, the socialist market economic structure demands that all kinds of commodity markets and production element markets be vigorously developed and that enterprises plunge into the market. While the market needs to operate in light of updated and reliable information, enterprises also count on quick and accurate information sources for survival and development amid market competition. The so-called invigoration of markets means invigorating the circulation of material, financial, and human resources and achieving a rational combination of production elements. And to invigorate the circulation of material, financial, and human resources, one depends on rapid and highly efficient circulation of information. Smooth transmission of information can substantially increase the rationality and effectiveness of circulation of human, financial, and material resources, which is of great significance to increasing the efficiency of economic operation and the labor productivity of the whole community. On the other hand, to establish a socialist market economic structure, the state must exercise strong macroeconomic regulation and control. In this connection, the state organ in charge of economic management must have timely and accurate information about conditions of economic operation across the country. If it is poorly informed of market operation condition, and if it exercises macroeconomic regulation and control in light of lopsided, outdated, or even wrong information, trouble will arise. Thus it can be seen that to run a socialist market economy one must depend first on a sound legal system and second on a quick and efficient economic information network. The progress of modern electronics and telecommunications technology serves as a powerful technological impetus to establishing an economic information network and speeding up the process of economic information transmission. The integration of telecommunications and computers has greatly increased the practical value of information, expanded the range of applications of information processing, and given rise to a series of modern telecommunications and information services modes, such as long-range data processing, on-line data base indexing, electronic data exchanges, electronic mailbox, and video imaging. This technological progress has offered all fields, especially industrial and commercial enterprises, an opportunity to reform their production management mode and increase their labor productivity and competitive power by applying modern telecommunications means. At the same time, it has also opened up a market full of vitality. The business of telecommunications as a trade is no longer confined to basic telecommunication services alone, such as telephones and the telegraph, with interpersonal telecommunications as their principal feature, but has been extended to high-level telecommunication services which include man-machine and computer telecommunications. To cope with specific circumstances in China, the Chinese Government has established the task of creating a nationwide economic information network. This is an important policy decision to speed up establishment of a socialist market economic structure, expedite the process of economic information transmission, and narrow the gap between our country and developed countries. Our country's economic information network is composed of information resource and communication networks. The information resource network denotes all the information banks and information application systems established by all the related economic information suppliers and users, while the information communication network links together all information resources and application systems through the development of network communication platforms [wang lu tong xin ping tai 4986 6424 6639 0207 1627 0669] on the basis of public telecommunication networks of the state. Different types of information application systems will also be developed in the future to suit the needs of various economic sectors. The presentation and implementation of the task of building a nationwide economic information network will remarkably advance the process of economic information transmission in our country, therefore it is of far-reaching historical significance to economic development and social progress in our country. 2. China's state-run public telecommunication network, growing at a high speed over the past 10 years or more, has prepared a basic network for the establishment of economic information communication network. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, especially over the past 10 years, China has speeded up the pace of development of telecommunication services. The growth rate of the country's telecommunication service capacity outdid the economic growth rate for the first time in 1985, and the telecommunications sector has kept on growing faster and faster since then. Now in the Eighth Five-Year Plan, the growth of telecommunication services further accelerates. In 1992 and 1993 alone, the net increase in telephone exchanges was 6.83 million lines, the net increase in long-distance call circuits was 121,000, and the operation capacity increased by 40.4 and 49.5 percent in these two sectors respectively. As 22 optical fiber trunk lines, 20 digital microwave trunk lines, and 20 large- and medium-sized satellite telecommunication ground stations are scheduled to be put into operation during the eight five-year plan, a large-capacity digital transmission trunk line network linking all the cities at and above provincial capital level in this country will initially take shape in the next two years. During the ninth five-year plan, the system capacity and coverage area will continue to expand, and a nationwide large-capacity digital transmission trunk line network mainly consisting of optical fibers will basically be built. While the optical fiber digital network was developing rapidly, phase one of the nationwide bundled [fan zu 0433 4809] public exchange data network (CHINAPAC) extension project was completed in September 1993. Now the network covers 267 cities, including all the cities at and above the provincial capital level, linked with 20,000 terminals each operating at a transmission speed of 65 kilobits per second. Inter-transmitter repeat circuits [jie dian ji jian de zhong ji dian lu 4634 7820 2623 7035 4104 0022 4949 7193 6424] are deployed according to operational capacity, and so far more than 100 circuits have been installed. Now 18 domestic information system group subscribers have signed contracts, thus being linked up with this network, and starting rendering data telecommunication services. And cross-network link has also been established between this network and 37 bundled exchange networks of 20 foreign countries. Phase one of the nationwide high-speed digital data trunk network (DDN) [quan guo gao su shu zi shu ju gu gan wang 0356 0948 7559 6643 2422 1316 2422 2207 7539 1626 4986], which is to link up 21 provinces and municipalities, will be put into operation by July this year. The main use of this network is to provide all information systems with permanent or semi-permanent special digital circuits operating at different speeds. Phase one of this project consists of 776 circuits operating at the high speed of 2 megabits per second and 2,600 circuits operating at a lower speed. Meanwhile, mobile telecommunication services have also been developing very quickly in our country. On the eastern and southern coast and in some central provinces, cellular mobile phone networks have covered all cities and counties. Now there are 700,000 mobile phone subscribers, and a nationwide cross-network link is being established. With some 7 million radio telephone paging subscribers, China has now become one of the countries with the most telephone pagers. After more than 10 years' investment, the country's public telecommunication networks have developed substantially either in scale and capacity or in terms of technical standards. This is an important achievement as a result of the state's industrial policy adjustment, which has not only eased the shortage of such basic information transmission facilities as telephone, telegraph, and facsimile, but also laid down a foundation for the development of a nationwide economic information network. 3. The building of the nationwide economic information network requires close cooperation by all sectors concerned, and the integration of telecommunications, electronic computer technology, and information applications. The building of a nationwide economic information network is a social system engineering project which involves different sectors. This network is built on the basis of the existing national telecommunication network and will capitalize on almost all modern telecommunications technology, including high-speed transmission, wide-band exchanges, network management, and transmission monitoring and control. It will use a large quantity of products of the modern electronics industry, as well as computers and related software technology. It demands a thorough understanding of the application environment and of operational requirements on the information system. And it also requires highly standardized telecommunication procedures, technical standards, and information formats. All these can only be achieved through close cooperation among the telecommunication sector, electronics industry, and information system applications sector. On the one hand, we must arrange for an appropriate division of labor, make the best use of existing technical conditions and material resources, and avoid duplicate efforts. On the other hand, we must arrange for different sectors to complement each other, make up each other's deficiencies, work together to solve key problems, and strive to build up a nationwide economic information network as soon as possible. The postal and telecommunication service sector is responsible for building the infrastructure of the country's telecommunication networks and providing telecommunication services to all economic sectors. It must be eager to meet the country's urgent needs, and closely cooperate with all departments concerned to speed up the building of the nationwide economic information network. We are now still far from fulfilling the target of supplying basic telephone services across the country, yet we are facing an increasingly urgent demand for economic information telecommunication services in the wake of the establishment of a market economic structure. Such a circumstance has posed a severe challenge and an opportunity for development as well. Therefore, we must proceed from market demand and vigorously intensify data telecommunications as well as information system telecommunications that are geared to the needs of major subscribers, while making further efforts to extensively provide general telephone services. We must give comprehensive consideration to the need for a nationwide economic information telecommunication network and different economic sectors' demands for information telecommunication services, properly map out a telecommunication service development plan, further step up the construction of high-capacity digital trunk line transmission networks mainly built with optical fiber cables, speed up the building of public telephone networks, bundled public exchange networks, digital data networks, and mobile telecommunication networks, to provide a highly efficient high-capacity information transmission channel and a reliable telecommunication platform in support of the "Gold Bridge" [jin qiao 6855 2890], "Golden Gate" [jin guan 6855 0595], "Golden Card" [jin ka 6855 0595], and various other information processing systems.
