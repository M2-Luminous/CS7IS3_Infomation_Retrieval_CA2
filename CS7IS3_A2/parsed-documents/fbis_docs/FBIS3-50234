What are your first impressions? [Mukhtanov] Our first discussion was primarily related to the budget of the Ministry of Defense. It is clear that the means allocated by this draft for material supply are insufficient, not to mention any import of or orders for equipment, weapons, and spare parts for our defense industry. Our military-industrial complex could produce to the tune of roughly 10 billion leva. If all you have at your disposal is 800-900 million leva for aircraft, vessels, artillery, missiles, and radar equipment -- what will you do first? Import something or commission the local defense industry to produce something? It is obvious that the army cannot commission any orders for the military-industrial complex. [Spiridonov] Was your attention directed only at the defense budget? [Mukhtanov] We also discussed the budget of the "State Reserve and Military Stocks" Main Administration. This administration has not received what it needed in the last few years, either. On the other hand, material supplies whose expiry date has been reached have been taken out of the stocks. This is a very important state system, which, like all other systems, is continuously being destroyed. It would not be able to function in the case of a natural disaster. There is an even greater danger that it would not be able to function in the face of a military threat. In this context the budget suffices only for the current maintenance of the warehouses, and the expenditure on wages, heating, and telephones. The system needs 233 million leva just for its maintenance. The draft budget allocates 210 million, while the system needs more than 2 billion leva to restore the most necessary elements. [Spiridonov] The draft budget is not the first sign of the military-industrial complex's problems. [Mukhtanov] The idea that was vested in parliament's decision of last summer to maintain a state policy on the issue of mobilization readiness and the military-industrial complex still has no clearly marked dimensions. Soon we will be demanding a meeting with the Interdepartmental Council, because so far nothing has changed. There are still not enough people who could work and analyze the information. The old decisions from last summer have not been implemented, no new decisions have been made, and the parameters of the military-industrial complex have not been outlined. Obviously, a lot of work lies ahead. [Spiridonov] The financial means that were allocated are insufficient, but, nevertheless, are there no reserves? [Mukhtanov] I implied a certain unused reserve, but let us not fully specify it. Most private business is making good profits, but so far most of the tax burden has been carried by the state structures. Private business remains on the sidelines. This business should be charged with commitments to our defense and security, because the army also protects the interests of those people. We will try to discuss this issue. However, we lack practical experience in this sphere. We have passed the Tax Administration Bill. Obviously, now the Accounts Chamber Bill must be adopted and then mechanisms must be created for private business to pay specific customs charges, taxes, and other fees. [Spiridonov] Nevertheless, is 800-900 million leva too little? [Mukhtanov] There is nowhere a specific budget for the defense industry. We are discussing the Defense Ministry budget, which is supposed to cover orders for the military-industrial complex. When the budget is 800-900 million leva, while the needs amount to 17 billion leva, it is unthinkable to speak about any orders. Furthermore, the complex has military-technical property, which the army needs, but does not have any money to purchase it. If the army had the necessary budget, both it and the military-industrial complex could benefit.
