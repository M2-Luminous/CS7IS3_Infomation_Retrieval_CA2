Sources say that the two Libyans intended to offer financial assistance to some members of the outlawed Ennahda movement in Tunisia. Libyans arriving from Tunisia say that the Tunisian authorities have begun to subject Libyans traveling across Tunisian territory to thorough search measures, and that some Libyan travelers are forced to stand for many hours at checkpoints on the border between the two countries. [passage omitted] Well-informed sources say that the ICO, whose headquarters is in Tripoli, is linked to a Libyan organ. The organization, which publishes THE JIHAD magazine, performed several activities in Africa, especially in west African states, under the cover of Islamic preaching. The organization owns several facilities and buildings in Libya. This is not the first time Tunisian-Libyan relations have experienced coolness as a result of the links between the ICO and the outlawed Ennahda movement. Dr. al-Sharif, who is in charge of the organization, intervened with Tunisia as Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's envoy to secure the release of some Ennahda and ICO prisoners. After the embargo was imposed on Libya, the organization's name was changed to the Call College [kulliyat al-da'wah], but its activities have continued in the same manner. [passage omitted]
