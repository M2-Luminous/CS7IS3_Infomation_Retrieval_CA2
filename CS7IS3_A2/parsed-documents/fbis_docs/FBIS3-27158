The Serbs have also withdrawn most of their heavy weapons to areas 20 kilomaters away from sarajevo, and 23 of the 41 Serb positions have been dismilitarized, he added. Nine other Serb positions have been supervised by UN military observers and the rest will be inspected by UN Commander General Michael Rose and the Commander of UN Forces in Sarajevo Andre Sulairu. The Muslims also surrendered 45 heavy guns to UN forces, Aikman said. The UN secretary-general's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, declared in Zagreb that air strikes against Serb positions are unnecessary. However, U.S. President Bill Clinton and NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said NATO's threat remains in effect. They stressed that any side opening fire or refusing to withdraw heavy weapons will be subject to NATO force. Although the possibility of air strikes has temporarily faded, the military threat remains as NATO aircraft continue to closely monitor the situation in Sarajevo.
