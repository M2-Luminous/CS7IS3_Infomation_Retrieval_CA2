The facilities were taken over from the National People's Army of the GDR, and most of the radioactive material has come from those stocks. "A considerable part" of the material was also stored there by the GDR Ministry for State Security. The material consists of "sealed radioactive sources," mainly of the Cobalt 60 radionuclide. The Bundeswehr was looking for ways of using this material, it was stated.
