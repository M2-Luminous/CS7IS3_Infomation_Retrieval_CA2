New guidelines on the procedures for transferring the shares of government corporations and companies, setting their prices, and selling them for installment payments were approved by the Economic Council. RESALAT's economics correspondent reports that yesterday afternoon Mas'ud Rowghani-Zanjani, vice president of the republic and chief of the Plan and Budget Organization, gave a press conference in which he discussed the new guidelines on the procedures for transferring the shares of transferable corporations and companies belonging to the government and government organizations and companies, and for setting their prices and selling them for installment payments. He discussed Article 4 of the measure enacted by the Council of Ministers concerning the transfer of the shares of government companies, whose priority has been given to the stock market. He said: According to this article, other methods may also be used for the transfer of the shares. The vice president of the republic said: In the last four years basic and important steps have been taken with regard to the transfer of the shares of government companies, but we have not yet reached the desired point. Various steps must be taken concerning the stock market to increase its efficiency. Rowghani-Zanjani emphasized the need to expedite the process of privatization. He said: In this area the government has required the Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs to prepare guidelines for the transfer of shares outside the stock market. RESALAT's economics correspondent reports that the measure enacted by the Economic Council concerning the transfer of shares, setting their prices, and the procedure for selling them for installment payments, which will go into effect on 1 Farvardin next year [21 March 1994], reads as follows: The base price of profitable producing companies (with the exception of agricultural and industrial and service companies and companies that have shown losses in the three years prior to transfer) is determined by dividing the net pretax profit by the rate of capital return, taking into account the factors affecting the company's adjusted profits, as well as the effects of the secondary factors that adjust the base price of the company's shares. It is necessary to note that the rate of capital return is equal to the effective rate of profits on long-term capital five-year bank deposits (15 percent) in addition to 5 percent. Likewise, the finished cost of development projects and the cost for the completion of semicomplete or operable projects that went into operation less than a year ago will be recalculated, adjusted by the foreign exchange cost at the current price of foreign exchange and also adjusted by the rial costs using the wholesale price indicator announced by the Central Bank or an expert, and after confirmation by the company's general assembly, the difference obtained in the recalculation will be added to the base price of the shares. The transferring organization is required, prior to transferring the shares, to repay the debts having to do with the funds collected from the Treasury for development projects, or it must reach an agreement with the treasury on the procedure for that repayment. Likewise, in cases designated by the official in charge of the organization making the transfer, to facilitate the transfer of the shares where a cash transfer is not convenient, the transfer may be done via installment payments. It is necessary to note that installment sales are possible only when the buyer or buyers are seeking to buy all the transferring organization's shares at one time. Installment sales for general purchase applicants, other than the workers and managers of each company, will be conducted as follows: If 30 percent of the price of the transaction is paid in cash, the balance will be paid in installments over a three-year period. If 40 percent of the price of the transaction is paid in cash, the balance will be paid in installments over a three and one-half years. Likewise, if 50 percent of the price of the transaction is paid in cash, the balance will be paid in installments over a four-year period. Likewise, to create means for the transfer of the shares of government companies to the managers and employees of these units, this measure says: If the employees and managers of the company wish to purchase the shares and if they are on an equal footing with other buyers, may pay 20 percent of the price of the transaction in cash and pay the balance in installments over a four-year period. In the case of an installment sale, the price of the transaction consists of the cash price of the sale of the shares in addition to the banking system's profit on an installment sale in the industrial sector. The guidelines on the procedure for the transfer of the shares of government organizations and companies state: The base price for the sale of the shares must be confirmed by the minister in charge of the organization transferring the shares, and then it must be printed in an advertisement. The advertisement of the transfer of the shares must be published in at least two high-circulation domestic newspapers. In addition to that, if necessary, as determined by the transferring organization, the announcement will also be made by the Voice and Vision organization or other information delivery methods. The transferring organizations are also required to make the appropriate arrangements for the transfer of the shares. The decision on whether to transfer the shares by auction, negotiations or sale on the stock market will be made by the minister in charge of the transferring organization. Of course, with regard to companies that have been accepted on the stock market, priority in the transfer of the shares will be given to the stock market. These guidelines emphasize the publication of information concerning the shares sold on the stock market, via negotiations or through competitive bidding, so that at the time of the transfer information must be given by the transferring organization to those wishing to buy shares, such as the name and subject of the company's activities, the number of transferable shares and their percentage of the company's total shares, an announcement of the status of the remainder of the company's shares including the percentage of shares owned by other shareholders, specification of the place to obtain forms and related information, an announcement of the date the shares will be offered in the stock-market hall, the base price, the method of selling the shares in small lots or all at one time, any other kind of information or conditions the transferring organization deems it necessary for buyers to know, and an announcement of readiness for visits to the factory by applicants wishing to visit. Based on this report, at the end of this press conference the chief of the Plan and Budget Organization excused himself from answering questions. To the question from RESALAT's correspondent concerning the sharp rise in the price of foreign exchange, he replied: I do not give interviews.
