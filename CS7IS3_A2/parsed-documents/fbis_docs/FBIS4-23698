Addressing a news conference, Mr. Manuel said that this did not mean that existing contractual agreements with neighboring countries like Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland in the Customs Union will have to be neglected. Existing structures like the Customs Union and the Preferential Trade Agreement with Zimbabwe would not necessarily be changed or phased out. Mr. Manuel said emphasis in this exercise will be on consultation and on the harmonization of existing and new trade links. Mr. Manuel said South Africa was almost certain to join the Southern African Development Community, SADC, during the organization's summit meeting in August.
