"The United States cannot solve the whole world's problems, and must not become the world's policemen," the President said defensively in response to questions from almost 100 journalists. "But we have the obligation to join other countries to alleviate suffering and restore peace." Clinton went on to illustrate American strategy in the various hot spots, acknowledging that he had made some mistakes and underestimated some problems, but highlighting the consistency of his foreign policy doctrine. However, he did not manage to free himself from the memory of his two predecessors, Richard Nixon and George Bush, who seemed to be haunting the platform at the Jimmy Carter Library, where the interview took place. Until the very end, Nixon severely criticized the international choices made by the White House under the Democrats. Shortly before his death, he sent Random House Publishers the manuscript of Beyond Peace, in which -- referring to 15 months of Clinton Administration -- he wrote that "if the United States wants to continue to lead the world, it must first decide it wants to do so, and then take the necessary measures to move from words to deeds." Bush, who achieved victory in the Gulf war, is the living proof that the United States still has the strength to impose peace and defeat aggression within the new international order. Therefore, he is a nagging figure for Clinton, because he reminds him of the fact that a drastic, energetic solution is theoretically possible also in Bosnia, as suggested yesterday by Margaret Thatcher in an article published in the NEW YORK TIMES under the title "Stop The Serbs. Now. For Good." Haunted by Nixon and Bush's specters, but unable to express a full-fledged international leadership doctrine of his own -- which, anyway, at least so far, has not been among his priorities -- Clinton tried to highlight, on the one hand, some of the White House's successes (such as the Middle East agreement, the ratification of NAFTA, the dismantling of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal) and, on the other hand, the limits of American action in the critical areas. In such areas -- he said somewhat hesitatingly -- the United States cannot act as a "police force," but rather, must build consensus, and act jointly with the international community. Bosnia is a case in point: Clinton admitted that the situation in the former Yugoslavia was much more complicated than he had thought during the electoral campaign. He blamed to a large extent Bush's procrastination, and said that he had done "his best." He then summarized the American position: "yes" to the possible use of NATO aircraft to defend the six safe areas, and extending this to Brcko, the Serbian town at the center of a strategic corridor which may become the scene for the next battle between the three armies; "no" to direct American intervention "which would run the risk of prolonging the war"; "yes" to lifting the arms embargo for Muslims and Croats, although Europeans are opposed to this. It was precisely over the Bosnia issue that the debate in Atlanta went through its tensest moment. CNN Sarajevo correspondent Christiane Amapour tauntingly requested an explanation for American hesitations. Clinton lost his temper: "Come off it, madam! What hesitations?" "Undoubtedly," he then explained, "I underestimated the difficulties involved in building a coalition and reaching an agreement within NATO. Of course, I would have preferred Europeans to align themselves with my positions. But I must also respect their opinions and their experience in that area." This latest remark seemed to be reserved for home consumption. In fact, requests for unilateral American action -- aimed, in particular, at rearming the Muslims -- are snowballing in Congress. Clinton wished to warn of the dangers involved in such a move, which could turn against the United States in the future. He tried to draw a distinction between situations where U.S. vital interests are at stake -- and where, therefore, acting alone is justifiable -- and situations where it is only a question of upholding the general principle of peace. Speaking of China, Clinton seemed to favor a compromise on the civil rights' issue, which he had previously linked to the extension of the preferential nation clause. Furthermore, he promised South Africa financial aid to the tune of $600 million. As regards Haiti, he did not rule out American military intervention. However, it is unlikely that these summary expressions of decisiveness on international matters, as broadcast by Ted Turner's CNN, will succeed -- within the next few days -- in changing the opinion of Americans: 41 percent of them, compared to 40 percent, say that they disapprove of Clinton's foreign policy.
