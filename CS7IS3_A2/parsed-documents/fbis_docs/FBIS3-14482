[Sha'th] Good evening, Sa'id. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, has the Palestinian side received an Israeli reply to the Palestinian proposals on the number of Palestinian policemen and international observers who will enter Hebron? [Sha'th] We have not yet received any replies on these figures. All that we have received is the telephone conversation which Major General Shahaq held with me. He told me that he will lead the Israeli delegation that will come to Cairo tomorrow in order to complete the talks on Hebron security. Shahaq said: It is better for us to bring our information to Cairo in order to complete this instead of conveying it via telephone or fax. Naturally, we understand this, but we hope that the Israeli delegation will bring something that will enable us to achieve security in Hebron as a prelude to achieving security for all Palestinian citizens in the occupied Palestinian territory. This is the path that will allow the completion of negotiations on Gaza and Jericho. If this does not happen, we will not have learned anything from the hard lesson represented by the Hebron massacre. This lesson requires us to emphasize measures that will prevent the recurrence of such massacres. As you know, the situation in Hebron has been extremely tense since the massacre. Thus, we cannot delay the implementation of the Palestinian measures represented by the Palestinian police force, and the UN measures, represented by the international observers, as well as the Israeli measures, whose implementation is urged, in order to provide security for the Palestinians in Hebron and other territories. This is an important and vital issue, and I hope the Israeli delegation will bring a reply on this issue. [Mu'addi] In your conversation with Maj. Gen. Shahaq, did you feel that there were positive signs and that it is possible to achieve an agreement tomorrow on the security arrangements in Hebron? [Sha'th] I have not received any clear information, apart from what I have said. It all depends on what the Israeli delegation brings tomorrow, which, I hope, will be positive. I also hope that the Israeli cabinet has decided on something that will respond to the Palestinians' security needs, particularly in Hebron. This will open the way for the completion of negotiations. Without this, we will spend the whole time in Cairo on Hebron security. [Mu'addi] The PLO has demanded the deployment of Norwegian, Egyptian, Russian, and U.S. observers. Has Israel agreed on this demand? [Sha'th] As was published and said, Israel is now supportive of deploying international observers in Hebron in implementation of Security Council Resolution 904, which provides for deploying these observers in all occupied Palestinian territories in order to provide security for the Palestinians in these territories. Naturally, we agree on the Norwegian observers without reservations; they sponsored the peace process, and they are still making great efforts to maintain this process. We, however, want the important states--which are participating in the peace process and supporting both the Palestinian police and the coming Palestinian authority; namely, the donors [preceding word in English], including, of course, the cosponsors of the peace process, Russia and the United States, and also Egypt, which is playing an important role in the peace process, as well as Norway and other European states--to support both security and peace, and this is the reason why we proposed these particular states. [Mu'addi] When will the vanguards of the Palestinian policemen arrive in Hebron, Jericho, and Gaza? [Sha'th] Once there is agreement on the measures on Hebron security, the Palestinian police and the international observers will immediately move to Hebron. A few days after we begin the Gaza-Jericho negotiations, the vanguards of the Palestinian police will head for Gaza and Jericho. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, the last question is: Has the Palestinian side received a reply on your proposal to the Israeli side on repatriating Mustafa al-Natshah, the former mayor of Hebron? [Sha'th] This issue has not yet been discussed, and no specific names have been proposed. Mustafa al-Natshah, also known as Abu-'Umar, is necessarily the elected mayor of Hebron, and thus he carries popular and electoral weight. This issue, however, has not yet been discussed on the negotiating table. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, in Cairo, thank you very much. [Sha'th] Thank you.
