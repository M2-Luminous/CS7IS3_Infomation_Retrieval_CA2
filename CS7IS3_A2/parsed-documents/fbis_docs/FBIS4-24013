COSATU said that among other things it wanted to know who was responsible for the murder and disappearance of trade union members during the apartheid regime, and for the explosion at COSATU House. COSATU said that Gen. van der Merwe's criticism was suspect after the attempt by the head of the SANDF [South African National Defense Force], Gen. George Meiring, to obtain a court order against the publication of covert army operations. It is reported that the minister of justice, Mr. Dullah Omar, has indicated that the truth commission will go ahead despite Gen. van der Merwe's opposition.
