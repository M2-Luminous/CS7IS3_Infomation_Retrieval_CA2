According to statistics issued by the provincial statistics bureau, the birthrate of the whole province in 1993 dropped to 14.08 per thousand, and the natural growth rate fell to 6.95 per thousand. Population increase rate was more than 50 percent lower the average rate in the 1980's. Since last year units at all levels and various localities have conscientiously summed up their previous experiences. On this basis, they have increased the weight of family planning work,and enhanced the scientific level of the work. From the highest organizations down to the grass roots, a series of guiding principles, policies, and measures which suit the present situation have been formulated. The provincial CPC committee and government have strengthened their leadership over family planning work and provided systematized guidance for various prefectures, autonomous prefecture, cities and counties, and signed relevant contracts with governments at all levels. They assess and examine their goal-direct management responsibility system every year. They closely link the results of family planning work with the achievements of leaders at all levels, main party and government leaders in particular. They also link leaders' responsibility with their obligations and power. Thanks to persistent efforts to carry out propaganda and education on family planning work over the past few years, in addition to the gradual development of old-age pension and insurance undertakings in rural area related to economic growth, peasants have also markedly changed their concept on child births. Some 97 percent of peasants maintain that it is best to have one or two children. Among those babies born in 1993, 80 percent were the first child, and only 2 percent were third children or more.
