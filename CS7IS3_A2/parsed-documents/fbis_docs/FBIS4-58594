The responsible source said the report was totally untrue. The source also rejected the report of the television's first channel yesterday evening quoting a military spokesman of the Defense Ministry and the leadership of the General Staff of the movement of the 'Abbas, Taysir, and Milhim Brigades toward the former border areas in Shabwah. The source said this report was not only completely untrue but was aimed at obfuscating the continuing military reinforcements of the forces of the ruling family in Sanaa, being provocatively sent to the former border and toward the military units transferred from the southern to the northern governorates after unity, in accordance with the design to pounce on unity and democracy by attacking the active and generous forces standing in the way of the adventurist al-Ahmar family's plan to impose military rule.
