To fulfill these tasks, it is necessary to take four measures as follows. 1. Increase inputs into agriculture and the rural economy by a fairly large margin. The budgeted investment in capital construction as well as the funds and bank loans set aside to aid agriculture should also be increased. Specific arrangements must be made with respect to planning and monetary and financial matters. 2. Increase grain and cotton purchase prices. When new grain goes on the market in 1994, the guaranteed price for grain will begin to go up by a fairly large margin. The measures for increasing the price of cotton ordered by the state will also be published in time. 3. Improving the special grain reserve system. It is necessary to lower domestic market prices of grain and promote steady growth in grain production through adjusting the amount of grain purchased and sold and utilizing the swap market mechanism for grain at home and abroad. Efforts should also be made to establish market risk funds for grain, to protect the peasants' interests to arouse their enthusiasm for production, and to guarantee the normal operation of the special grain reserve system. And, 4. Establish banks whose sole function is to make low-interest loans for agricultural development. This is an essential measure to ensure that we have sufficient funds for purchasing agricultural and sideline products. We should step up specific preparations for the establishment of such banks. Plans for rural reforms -- such as developing diverse forms of collectivized agricultural services, setting up cooperative and joint stock economic entities, reforming the system of supply and marketing cooperatives, and reforming certain management systems to promote developments of small towns -- should be formulated and implemented step by step. The central leader pointed out: As peasants constitute the main segment of China's population, the problem concerning agricultural development is of vital importance to the overall situation. Whether there is comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery and whether there are good harvests in agriculture all have a direct bearing on prices and the people's daily life. Rapid economic growth depends on opening up rural markets, but the latter depends on developing the rural economy and increasing the peasants' income. Over the past few years we have enjoyed successive bumper harvests and a sustained development of the rural economy, but the comparative efficiency of grain production has declined; the gap between the prices of agricultural and industrial products has widened; and the peasants' income has grown rather slowly. We must take effective measures to solve all these problems.
