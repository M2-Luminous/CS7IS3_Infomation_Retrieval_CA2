The following answer this question: Sergey Shakhray, Russian Federation [RF] Government vice premier and leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord: If there were no political confrontation in society, if it had traditions to ensure the automatic operation of the Constitution, and if the mechanisms of juducial power were in operation, there would have been no need to devise this document. But we have a very acute form of political confrontation, a profound socioeconomic crisis, and a lack of institutions of power, including judicial power, capable of defending civil rights and peace in society. There is therefore no alternative to the Treaty on Social Accord. Petr Filippov, head of the RF Presidential Administration's Information Support Administration: It would be the height of naivete to expect the Treaty to be signed by all the opposing forces. The Treaty is a text that will enable public opinion to identify those people who are in fact in favor of settling disputes by means of civil war. If there are two major political camps in the country that switch to hostilities without finding a compromise, that is a catastrophe. But Russia is not threatened by that situation today. However, if the chance of accord is missed, that will postpone and complicate the positive economic changes in the country. Economist Pavel Bunich: A host of reservations can be made about the text of the Treaty, but they can be made throughout life, till the end. The Treaty is a fairly realistic basis for further work. Georgiy Satarov, RF presidential aide: Any democracy has two foundation stones. The first one being the Constitution and the laws, the second -- political culture and political traditions. Permanent mechanisms for accord will train us in normal political culture. When we speak of the Treaty's tasks, we bear in mind the second foundation stone, which is based on democracy and the culture of seeking accord and compromise.
