FR940722-0-00076 FR940722-0-00018 Section 420.117␣Program Monitoring and Reporting This section includes grant monitoring and reporting requirements. The frequency and content of progress and financial reports specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) are identical to those contained in the governmentwide common grant management requirements and 49 CFR 18.40 which is referenced in paragraph (a). Paragraph (e) requires FHWA approval prior to publication of reports that document the results of work performed with FHWA planning and research funds. A State may request waiver of this prior approval requirement. The reference to the Federal-aid Project Agreement (Form PR&hyph;2) in the first sentence of paragraph (e) has been deleted since Form PR&hyph;2 is being revised and the contents of the cited provision for prior approval of reports are included in this paragraph. Several commenters believe that these reporting requirements are contrary to the concept of delegation of program management responsibility to the State which should be allowed to determine how to monitor its research program; FHWA review and approval should be limited to assurance that an adequate monitoring process is in place and is being used to guide the State's program; and, if a State truly has responsibility for managing its own program, the State should determine the needed frequency of reporting for adequately monitoring projects. Another commenter recommended that an annual report should be adequate and that the reporting format should be kept simple. These grant reporting requirements are not new and are standard governmentwide grant reporting requirements that replaced more comprehensive requirements that were in 23 CFR part 420 prior to 1990. These reports are necessary for the FHWA to perform its grant oversight responsibilities. Progress and financial reports that include the specified information must be submitted at least annually. The FHWA field offices may require more frequent reports, but not more than quarterly, unless the State is determined to be a high-risk grantee in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 18.12. The reporting requirements are for the work program (i.e., grant), not for individual ``projects/studies.'' The progress reports previously required in 23 CFR part 511 for individual research studies are no longer required. Progress on individual studies would be addressed in the overall work program report. A State may establish additional reporting procedures that meet its needs for individual studies. Similarly, another commenter stated that §420.117 requires an increased level of reporting activity and that the interpretation and administration of this section could produce some very demanding requirements. This commenter also questioned who would establish and approve performance goals, and what level of detail would be required. As indicated above, this section is unchanged from the existing regulation and does not require increased reporting. The level of reporting will only be greater for a State or subrecipient if the State or subrecipient was not in compliance with the existing requirements. One commenter recommended that the reporting provisions be flexible enough to allow monthly reports if agreed to by the agency and the subrecipient. As mentioned above, the FHWA may require more frequent reports, but may not require submission of reports more than quarterly unless a recipient or subrecipient is determined to be a high risk. A State may establish the frequency of progress and financial reports for its subgrantees, but is encouraged not to impose more burdensome requirements than those imposed upon the State by the FHWA. One commenter stated that the requirement in §420.117(c) that reports from subrecipients be submitted no more than 90 days after the end of the reporting period does not allow sufficient time to complete the audit of the work program, especially when the MPO has elected a 2-year cycle for the audit to be performed. It was suggested that the 90-day requirement be deleted and the timeframe be determined by the State with approval of the FHWA. The commenter is confusing grant audit requirements with grant reporting requirements. In accordance with governmentwide common grant management requirements, final progress and financial reports for a grant (i.e., the annual/biennial work program) must be submitted within 90 days of the end of the grant period. If the later financial audit, which covers the MPO's fiscal year and typically is not completed until a year after the end of the grant period, necessitates adjustments, the grant may be reopened or adjustment may be made to a current grant, as appropriate. With regard to the statement that an MPO has been operating under a 2-year cycle for financial audits, in accordance with the OMB Circular A&hyph;128, Single Audits of State and Local Governments, audits must be performed annually unless a constitutional or statutory requirement for less frequent audit was in effect by January 1, 1987. One commenter stated that the requirement that a State must request a waiver of prior approval of report publication is an unnecessary and demeaning retention of FHWA authority; the State should have sole responsibility and authority to publish reports that follow accepted editorial formatting for electronic data base management and retrieval purposes; and the use of a report as evidence of work performed and approval for publication are two separate issues and should not be combined. Another commenter stated that FHWA approval of reports prior to publication is inconsistent with the intent of allowing States flexibility in managing their own programs.
