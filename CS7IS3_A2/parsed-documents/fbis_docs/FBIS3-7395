Kim Yong-won, chairman of Jindo Corp., and Kim Chae-sop of Youngchang Akki Co., a leading musical instrument maker, left for China yesterday. Chairmen Pak Yong-kon of the Doosan Group, Chang Chi-hyok of the Kohap group and Yi Chun-yong of Daelim Industrial Co. are scheduled to fly to China today. Bigger names including chairmen Chong Se-yong of the Hyundai group, Kim U-chung of the Daewoo group, Kim Sok-won of the Ssangyong group and executive vice chairman Cho Kyu-ha of the Federation of Korean Industries will follow in their steps this weekend. Their visits are in the form of individual, personal trips as Chongwadae banned them from accompanying President Kim to show the severance between power and business. But all of them will join the president at two dinners in China, officials said. Their headlong rush reflects their high hopes that Kim's visit may clear the way for closer economic and business ties with China, a socialist giant and emerging economic power. It contrasts with the presence of a few businessmen during his Japan visit. Hyundai will move vigorously to get the Chinese central government to approve its plan to establish a joint venture company in Dairen capable of producing 300,000 autos a year. It will also lobby Beijing to win a bid for the construction of a 1.5 billion-dollar multipurpose dam in Hainan, a Hyundai executive said. Hyundai, Korea's largest conglomerate with interests ranging from construction, to autos, is studying the feasibility of participating in a 20 billion-dollar project to build a dam on the Yangtse estuary. Daewoo expects that it will sign a contract to set up a 1.5 billion-dollar auto assembly plant in a joint venture with a Changchun, northern China, company with an annual production capacity of 300,000 units. Daewoo has already presented a letter of intent in regard to that project under which it hopes to begin producing engines and other components in 1996 and fully-assembled cars two years later, according to its spokesman. The Samsung and Lucky-Goldstar groups are leaning toward the telecommunications service area as China is considering Korea's total digital exchange system as the model for its network. The Sunkyong and Ssangyong groups hope that the presidential visit, which entails various levels of talks between Cabinet ministers, ranking officials and businessmen, will be a boon to their projects. Sunkyong and Ssangyong, the fifth and sixth chaebols, are seeking the Chinese government's go-ahead to their plans for a 1.5 billion- dollar oil refinery in Shenzen and a huge cement plant capable of producing 600,000 tons, respectively.
