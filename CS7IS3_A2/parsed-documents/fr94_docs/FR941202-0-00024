Section 32.72 is revised to read as follows: §32.72 Manufacture, preparation, or transfer for commercial distribution of radioactive drugs containing byproduct material for medical use under Part 35. (a) An application for a specific license to manufacture, prepare, or transfer for commercial distribution radioactive drugs containing byproduct material for use by persons authorized pursuant to Part 35 of this chapter will be approved if: (1) The applicant satisfies the general requirements specified in 10 CFR 30.33; (2) The applicant submits evidence that the applicant is at least one of the following: (i) Registered or licensed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a drug manufacturer; (ii) Registered or licensed with a state agency as a drug manufacturer; (iii) Licensed as a pharmacy by a State Board of Pharmacy; or (iv) Operating as a nuclear pharmacy within a Federal medical institution. (3) The applicant submits information on the radionuclide; the chemical and physical form; the maximum activity per vial, syringe, generator, or other container of the radioactive drug; and the shielding provided by the packaging to show it is appropriate for the safe handling and storage of the radioactive drugs by medical use licensees; and (4) A label is affixed to each container of a radioactive drug to be transferred for commercial distribution. The label must include the name of the radioactive drug or its abbreviation, quantity of radioactivity, and date and time of assay. For radioactive drugs with a half life greater than 100 days the time of assay may be omitted. In addition, the label for the syringe or syringe radiation shield must also contain the clinical procedure to be performed or the patient's or the human research subject's name. Furthermore, the label, or the leaflet or brochure that accompanies the radioactive drug, must contain a statement that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved distribution of the byproduct material to persons licensed to use byproduct material pursuant to 10 CFR 35.100, 35.200, or 35.300, as appropriate, and to persons who hold an equivalent license issued by an Agreement State. The Commission's labeling requirements are independent of requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); one label is acceptable to NRC provided that it contains all of the information which NRC requires. (b) A licensee described by paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (iv) of this section: (1) May prepare radioactive drugs for medical use, as defined in 10 CFR 35.2, provided that the radioactive drug is prepared by either an authorized nuclear pharmacist, as specified in paragraph (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, or an individual under the supervision of an authorized nuclear pharmacist as specified in 10 CFR 35.25. (2) May allow a pharmacist to work as an authorized nuclear pharmacist if: (i) This individual qualifies as an authorized nuclear pharmacist as defined in 10 CFR 35.2,
