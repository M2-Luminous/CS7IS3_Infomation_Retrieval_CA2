A spokesman for the Zhejiang provincial government said here today that the forum will be attended by agricultural officials and experts from 18 countries in Asia, Africa and South America as well as 120 representatives from 28 Chinese provinces. The forum will be jointly sponsored by the United Nations Development Program, the Chinese State Science and Technology Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. China launched the Spark program in 1986. To date, nearly 50,000 projects have been carried out, covering 85 percent of the rural counties. The projects have resulted in many new agricultural and industrial technologies in rural areas and contributed greatly to rural economic growth. Zhejiang Province has been especially successful in implementing the Spark program. From 1986 to 1993, the province launched 3,346 Spark program projects, yielding 22.4 billion yuan in output value. Among the 3,346 rural enterprises which implemented Spark projects, more than 1,000 had their products exported, earning foreign currencies worth 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. While 15 of these enterprises are producing an annual output value of more than 100 million yuan, most of the enterprises have improved their product quality, performances and efficiency. Zhejiang has, through Spark projects, trained 650,000 farmer technicians. Through the Spark projects, the province has also introduced new species of crops, animals, vegetables and fruit. The Spark program is now developing toward high and new technology and export-oriented industries.
