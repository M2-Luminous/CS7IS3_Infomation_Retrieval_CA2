FR940128-0-00049 FR940128-0-00020 47 CFR Part 73 [MM Docket No. 93&hyph;103; RM&hyph;8206] Radio Broadcasting Services; Minetto, NY AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission, at the request of Francis G. Toce, allots Channel 293A to Minetto, New York, as the community's first local aural broadcast service. See 58 FR 26089, April 30, 1993. Channel 293A can be allotted to Minetto in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements, with respect to domestic allotments, with a site restriction of 10.9 kilometers (6.7 miles) northwest, at coordinates North Latitude 43&hyph;24&hyph;40 and West Longitude 76&hyph;36&hyph;40, to avoid a short-spacing to the pending application for Channel 294C3 at Copenhagen, New York (BMPH&hyph;930310IB). This allotment is short-spaced to Station CJBC5F, Channel 292B, Peterboro, Ontario, and to vacant Channel 293A at Brockville, Ontario, Canada. However, Canadian concurrence has been received for the allotment of Channel 293A as a specially negotiated allotment, since Minetto is located within 320 kilometers (200 miles) of the U.S.-Canadian border. With this action, this proceeding is terminated. DATES: Effective March 10, 1994. The window period for filing applications will open on March 11, 1994, and close on April 11, 1994.
