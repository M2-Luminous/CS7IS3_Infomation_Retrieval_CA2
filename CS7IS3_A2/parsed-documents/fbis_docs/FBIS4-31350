Vladimir Nikolic reports. [Begin recording] [Nikolic] The festivities were attended by Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic, Federal Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, Federal Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic, members of the federal, republican, and city councils of the Federation of Associations of Veterans of the People's Liberation War [SUBNOR], and the military attaches of the British, French, and Russian Embassies in Belgrade. Although he was invited, the military representative of the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade failed to show up. [passage omitted] After the gathering ended, we asked Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic to assess this year's celebration of the Allied operation. [Jovanovic] According to my feelings for history, this should have been the place to reaffirm -- in a very graphic and demonstrative way -- the unity in the struggle against fascism and all forces that participated in the struggle against fascism should have been here. That is why the back door invitation, so to speak, (?extended) to the SUBNOR representatives is not how the Yugoslav victims -- fighters against fascism -- deserve to be treated by the allies of yesterday, who have now become our opponents. On the other hand, not inviting Russia as the successor of the former Soviet Union is not very convincing. [Nikolic] We also asked Minister Jovanovic to comment on the progress of the Geneva negotiations so far. [Jovanovic] Everything is clear, everything is on the table. What we have been saying for a year, if not longer, has finally come to light. The Muslim side in Bosnia -- or more precisely, its fundamentalist leadership -- simply does not want the end of the war or peace. It wants war, or the peace that it would achieve through war. This means they are insisting on a unitary Bosnia and the full domination of the Croatian-Muslim element over the Serbs in Bosnia. [end recording]
