IFP sources told SAPA on Tuesday the meeting was "routine" and while it would discuss the latest constitutional developments and a possible general conference to decide on its stance towards elections, final decisions would probably be made only later this month. IFP central committee member Walter Felgate said the Freedom Alliance -- which includes the IFP -- met on Monday to draw up a response to a government and African National Congress [ANC] document on the current deadlock with the alliance. The response had been sent to the ANC and government on Tuesday morning and would be made available to the public as soon as a reply had been received. He said the IFP could hold a special conference to decide its election stance only "once we have the best we can negotiate in hand". The party's decision to participate in elections could not be made by the central committee alone but needed a special conference to canvass grassroot support. A special conference planned for this weekend was postponed in light of the January 24 parliamentary sitting, where amendments to the interim constitution could be approved. IFP elections campaign political director Peter Miller said a special conference to decide on whether or not to contest elections would depend on the outcome of ongoing discussions on the interim constitution. "The special conference is the ultimate policy decision-making body of the party. If it is necessary to meet it will. Obviously the need for it to meet will be influenced by what happens in the coming weeks." IFP national spokesman Ziba Jiyane said the special conference might even be held after the January 24 parliamentary sitting, once "we know what the constitution ultimately contains".
