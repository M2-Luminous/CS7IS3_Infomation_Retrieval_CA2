[Abreu] I have not decided yet. I am working as if I were staying until the end of this administration. There are a lot of things I still want to do and promote. I am not contemplating retiring from the service, unless there are political reasons. For the time being we have not made any decision. There is no job incompatibility. We have to be careful about the negative influence of partisan activities on the Foreign Ministry because this portfolio is an instrument of the country's foreign policies. [EL PAIS] Many people mention June.... [Abreu] We have no date. That is just speculation which sometimes spreads in the very special climate of the Foreign Ministry. We do not have any dates or definitions. They will appear at the right time. We are working as if we were staying until 1 March 1995. However, a political decision or internal definitions by the president of the Republic might interrupt the mandate any time. He said very clearly: Ministers are the fuses in the fusebox of the executive branch. [EL PAIS] Will the issue of the common external tariff system be defined in June? [Abreu] Yes, 30 June is the deadline for a definition. Technical studies have already defined 80 to 85 percent of the issue. Some issues like petrochemistry, informatics, and capital goods are still pending. We have still to decide the degree of protection Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay will have with respect to third countries, not based on a model of imports substitution or the idea of creating a fortress, but to achieve a dynamic insertion into other integration schemes. [EL PAIS] This means that the level of common external tariffs will be low. [Abreu] Exactly. This is why Uruguay established 20 percent as the maximum tariff. Who would have thought four, five, or six years ago that we would be considering such a low tariff level, particularly when our countries installed an important protectionist system for their industries and other activities, that sometimes went over 100 percent. The process shows that the concepts of economic opening and integration have become compatible and have replaced previous integration concepts which promoted the model of import substitution and contemplated very high tariffs to protect internal industries. [EL PAIS] But there has been a move to impose other obstacles to integration, even within Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. For instance the consumer defense code approved in Brazil or the quality controls or technical norms established by Argentina. Has this problem been insufficiently resolved, that is, if we want to prevent the lifting of new shields behind old economic borders? [Abreu] That is a good question because it shows that beyond the political willingness there are interests and situations oriented to hinder this process of trade liberalization. Each country and each economy has interest groups defending its own situation by pressuring to maintain privileges and protect its interests. They want to maintain their markets and avoid being exposed to competition where quality and price might displace them from consumers' preference. All obstacles are used. Obstacles can be administrative, on quality, and now--for instance through GATT--on issues like the environment. "Social dumping," which in some ways is justified, can also hide protectionist intentions. That is what we permanently do. We not only denounce these obstacles, we work on them because the main enemy of integration and the forces used to liberalize trade is the failure to fulfill deadlines. This failure is sometimes caused by interests, or political or circumstantial decisions which sometimes have more power than obligations. The importation of subsidized products, or dumping, will hurt those involved in these processes. [EL PAIS] How did Uruguay take [Brazilian President] "Itamar's [Franco] Initiative" to create a Latin American free trade zone by 2010? [Abreu] Uruguay's integration strategy is clearly defined. We understand that all integration mechanisms in Latin America, including NAFTA, are modular and complementary. We support the idea of discussing all these integration processes to prevent them from becoming islands or broadened import substitution models. We conceive them as complementary efforts leading to a hemispheric free trade zone. We do not see the Andean Pact, the Group of Three, NAFTA, or even the Brazilian proposal as being against or incompatible with our regional integration scheme, Mercosur. [EL PAIS] But they are all different.... [Abreu] Yes, they are all different and have different priorities. We believe--and we have said this more than once--that Uruguay bets on two things: Political realism and legal security. Realism tells us that Uruguay must recognize that there are processes in the world that will not wait for us to change before becoming effective. Therefore, we must adapt to those changes, as in the case of NAFTA, or the new forms of commercial relations currently materializing in the developed world. But that realism must be made compatible with legal security, which means credibility in the different integration processes in which we participate. We should not let ourselves be guided by anxiety or wonder. We should not join new integration models, leaving aside what we are creating--projects that are already at an advanced stage. We will take note of all proposals as long as the other Mercosur member countries recognize that the priority is to consolidate this process. We should finish building our Mercosur free trade zone, with its known exceptions, and then, in due time, attack the exceptions. We must approve a common external tariff system in order to fulfill our treaty requirements. We must also approve norms on institutional structures, certificates of origin, and regulation on the different exceptional regimes that are today listed in the subregion, such as the free trade zones and the "draw back" [preceding two words in English] temporary admission mechanisms. All these should be put together in a package supposing strength and clarity to fulfill the obligations among the four partners. We are willing to take note of all other integration processes, but not to deactivate one process to activate another. [EL PAIS] But Uruguay--President Lacalle said this recently--will present a proposal at the next Mercosur presidential summit to broaden the "4+1" concept [George Bush's proposal involving the four Mercosur member countries plus the United States] to "4+3" [Mercosur plus the United States, Mexico, and Canada]. Here is something new. Is this not a change in the integrating strategy? [Abreu] Nothing will change because Uruguay has clearly and sharply supported NAFTA and has said that the agreement between Canada, the United States, and Mexico is positive from the point of view of international trade. It is a module to complement existing integration schemes. Within this framework, Uruguay is proposing the famous reform of Article 44 of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) to grant legal security to these schemes, so that events might not replace the law, and the norms regulating our trade relations might be adapted to this reality. This is the reason behind the expression realism with legal security. When we encourage and take note of this integration process we also say that we are encouraging other complementary articulations with the United States within the framework of the "4+1" Treaty, but also within the framework of a "4+3" Treaty so that NAFTA and Mercosur can negotiate bilaterally within the "4+1" scheme, which is a negotiating and consultation agenda. [EL PAIS] Will Uruguay's proposal eliminate the permanent problem created by Argentina "flirting" with NAFTA? [Abreu] All that is part of the anticipation, I would say a political anticipation which does not have an exact legal foundation or anything concrete from the political viewpoint. These expressions have a certain projection but no basis. The important thing here is that the Asuncion Treaty establishes that relations between Mercosur member countries and other countries must be jointly undertaken. That is a legal obligation. [EL PAIS] In other words, that is the only way in.... [Abreu] Of course, there are no other possibilities, except for natural country to country talks. At the time of definition, however, our idea is to respect the Asuncion Treaty so that the four countries can relate to other integration systems through Mercosur--that is, as a block, as it was done with the United States through the "4+1." The definition of a common external tariff system will follow this principle of negotiating as a block, which will be our point of reference and will characterize our relations with other states. [EL PAIS] How will you resolve the problem of "social dumping" within Mercosur? Uruguay is one of the hardest hit by the problem. [Abreu] First we must define how to handle the "social dumping" problem. There is a proposal that will be discussed within the framework of the GATT talks in Morocco. The proposal was presented by developed countries which are only now analyzing the fact that low salary levels will influence costs and product prices, which will give underdeveloped countries an advantage over countries with higher salary levels. We cannot understand this as a protectionist measure. We must seek to level different salary levels so that salaries and competitiveness increase at the same time. We cannot increase our competitiveness by depressing salaries, because that will affect workers' well-being. [EL PAIS] The trend of every process of regional integration has never been to bet on a reduction .... [Abreu] Precisely. This situation stems from the fact that there are heavily populated countries with abundant labor and relatively low wages. Obviously, this has a bearing on prices. We have to take extreme care, however, to defend our wage levels so that once we enter into competition with others, wages will go up rather than down. Uruguay plays a very important role on account of its location and social structure. We have partners like Brazil, where labor is cheaper and less qualified. It is also true that each country has to put its comparative advantages to good use in order to achieve a dynamic insertion in foreign markets. As we have better qualified labor, we must try to specialize in things that will take advantage of market niches, in which quality will be our main advantage. These issues have to do with countries' strategies, but they should be considered from the viewpoint of social awareness in the true sense of the word, instead of using them for commercial purposes disguised as protection mechanisms.
