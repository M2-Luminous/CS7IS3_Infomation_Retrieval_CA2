In this extensive territory that comprises five provinces, thousands of tractors and trucks that have been paralyzed because of the lack of fuel and spare parts or as a consequence of the recent transformations that have taken place in agricultural industry will be properly maintained to prevent their deterioration and to ensure operation when circumstances permit. Contacts have been made between delegations of the Ministry of Agriculture in Matanzas, Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, Sancti Spiritus, and Ciego de Avila, so that, in the near future, classes can be held to demonstrate the proper maintenance of agricultural equipment.
