To meet this objective, that province is struggling to overcome the deep crisis affecting its output and local economy. Havana Province, with 600,000 inhabitants, 5 percent of the country's productive soil, and a somewhat significant industrial and scientific output, will have to stimulate substantial improvements in agricultural commodities to nearly 3 million people. During a recent conversation between Hiram Gonzalez, head of the provincial government, and the diplomatic corps accredited in Cuba, a conversation to which PRENSA LATINA had access, he cited efforts to increase food and vegetable harvests, milk and egg supplies, and sugar and tobacco production. In order to better explain these issues, Gonzalez cited the impact caused by the difficult situation through which the island is going as a result of the U.S. economic blockade and the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe. For example, Gonzalez mentioned the death of more than 100,000 heads of cattle as a result of the shortage. He also cited the significant drop in egg and milk production also due to the inability to obtain half a million tons of needed fodder. Despite the fertilizer and fuel shortages, Havana believes it can produce more than 12.5 million quintals of food and vegetables during the current year, 3 million quintals more than what was obtained during 1993 and which could result in an improvement in the food supply to the people, in addition to the production of 50 million liters of milk. According to disclosed information, it is expected by encouraging cooperative agriculture production through state assistance it will be possible to ensure an increase in harvest yields via a smaller work force and less technical measures. Concurrently, the increasing cattle mortality rate has been decreased by simply changing pasture systems. The province is working to meet its sugar production targets as well as its tobacco surplus. It has also announced the use of five large cold storage plants and the completion of 36 scientific-productive plants already in operation. Despite all these setbacks, the provincial government has cited the fact there are no unemployed teachers or students without a school in Havana. In addition, the infant mortality rate stands at 9.9 per thousand infants born. Adopted measures to ensure the continuation of these advances, and as a result of the lack of more than 400 medications in Havana drugstores during 1993, include the production of more than half a million doses of byproducts from herbal medicine [derivados de la medicina verde], the use of which has been greatly encouraged. According to an announcement made by Gonzalez, industrial production is in a depressed state, the reactivation of which will depend on foreign investments in certain sectors. Havana is also relying on specialized companies, such as in cement production, electrical energy, ceramics, and aluminum, among others, in addition to sugar factories. We are under extreme pressures and experiencing significant shortages, but we also have some very dynamic options to solve these problems, the provincial leader explained to the foreign diplomats. In conclusion, Havana's task is just one aspect of the efforts the entire country is undertaking to deal with the most complex phase of its history.
