We hereby reproduce a very compact summary of that government platform, copies of which have been given to journalists and community leaders. Creation of Jobs; Professional Training The unemployment rate is worrisome in Panama. The great majority of the people agree that the solution of this problem concerns everyone. From an economic point of view, this problem can be solved by stimulating investment in fields that can create a large number of jobs on a short-term basis. A steady long-term growth rate is also required. The Solidarity Party hereby wishes to describe some of its government platform's basic considerations for solving this problem. -- To stimulate the growth of a truly untraditional, private-public, commercial development banking, which would give impetus to the evolution of the economy's informal sector and protect and stimulate this sector to give rise to the establishment of small-scale entrepreneurs as a means to create jobs on a large-scale basis. -- The private commercial development banking, which should be state subsidized in the shortest possible but indefinite time, should guarantee the least expensive money for a quick replacement of the existing industrial park in the framework of technological renovation and efficient industry, which can be competitive in the international market, in the understanding that market opening and economic integration are the next century's great challenges. -- To protect and stimulate the securities market as an alternate source of inexpensive financing for local and foreign investors. -- To present a plan for the rapid professional and technical education and training of Panamanian men and women so they can aspire to worthy and well-paid jobs. -- To turn the National Institute for Professional Training, INAFORP, into a complex technical training center for science, technology, services, and tourism. To provide this training center with a central information office, which would study the regional and overall demand for manpower and its qualification levels. The institute's plans and programs would thus meet the employers' needs and the population's urgent need for permanent, well-paid jobs. -- To transform education, as soon as possible and with the appropriate technological knowledge, to meet the need for qualified labor required by the economy, thus enabling Panamanians to hold jobs created by local and foreign private investors. -- To develop and implement a comprehensive program to stimulate local and foreign investors throughout the country, and to exploit the most important assets that have reverted and will revert to Panama through the fulfillment of the Panama Canal Treaty. Most of the revenue brought by the exploitation of reverted assets will be redistributed in the rest of the country, thus giving all Panamanians the economic benefits to which they are entitled. -- To update, as soon as possible, all of the sea port and airport infrastructures to increase efficiency, security, and the international trade confidence in Panamanian services. To make sure that the Panamanian labor force is the most capable and reliable for local and foreign investors in the international market. -- To increase the state's investments in basic infrastructure for development and training aimed at private investment with methods that can create many jobs. -- To build and maintain accesses to tourism development centers. To remove all obstacles that stand in the way of investors. To have flexible fiscal legislation and government financing to train Panamanian workers so they can work efficiently and earn good salaries in the sector. -- To divert economic and financial resources to guarantee the employment of a large number of workers. We have resources, that are envied by other countries, which we are not being exploited and which could make development possible for the greater good of all, underlining several tourism variants, such as ecological tourism, shopping tourism, beach tourism, historic and ethnic tourism. -- To develop and improve the quality of the small arts and crafts industry, which supports tourism. The benefits that the sector receives should also reach these craftsmen so they can develop into small but competitive enterprises. -- To take urgent measures to reduce our limitations in the international market, particularly in the Central American market, and at least make ourselves felt in two important production factors, that is to say, fuel (oil by-products), taking international prices into consideration and lowering the current tax as much as possible, and debating the current energy rate and production costs because these factors hamper competitiveness in the international market. Public Security and Crime We are experiencing a dramatic situation, where crime, drug trafficking, and the judicial system's weakness, which results from scandals and the public's distrust of the system's capability to administer justice honestly and ethically, are harming the Panamanian people's social and public security to very dangerous degrees. Since crime is essentially the result of three basic factors, the economic and social situation, the public security level, and the moral value system, we intend to carry out the following: -- First of all, and through the democratic system, we will incorporate all Panamanians into a great plan for national salvation, economic and social development, tolerance, and true reconciliation because by raising our social and economic expectations we all will be prepared to defend our social and political institutions, which represent our genuine aspirations. -- Drug trafficking in Panama is the result of the metamorphosis of the drug market in Europe and North America, particularly the United States. Dealing with this problem, however, does not depend exclusively on the country's willingness but on a firm cooperative alliance with the international community. For this reason, we will coordinate programs with other countries to eradicate criminal organizations, drug traffickers, drug consumers, and drug distribution networks. -- Without delay, we will reformulate and implement a national and public security policy and make the administration of justice expeditious. -- In the various international organizations, we will help strengthen our society spiritually with development outlooks and opportunities based on a new, fair, and democratic world order. Drug Consumption The increased use of drugs and their deleterious effects on a traditionally peaceful and civilized society are notorious in Panama. For this reason, Solidarity proposes: -- To combat crime through education. This means carrying out a program aimed at active and potential criminals, increasing their opportunities for work as well as culture, so they can be placed in the labor market. To devise instruction programs for police authorities to let them know that we will combat this scourge through education, work, and culture, thus helping put an end to misery and hunger. -- To coordinate with all sectors of the country, particularly with the media, a campaign against the culture of violence which, disregarding traditional peace and good habits, attempts to take root in Panama, encouraging and stimulating crime. -- To strengthen the Attorney General's Office and the Judicial Branch to correct its vulnerability. -- To integrate in a single organization all services in charge of stopping crime, including civic institutions. -- To reinforce the border police, the National Air Service, and the National Maritime Service through adequate training, equipment, resources, and supervision so they can confront drug trafficking organizations successfully. -- To create the community police, incorporating the community and its representative organizations in the prevention of crime. Justice and Community Most of the time, criminal cases in the community are treated as police cases by corregidores, who lack the proper scientific approach and training to deal with the complex problem of the origin and evolution of crime. Because of this, Solidarity proposes the following: -- To train corregidores in properly handling this problem, supporting them with interdisciplinary professional teams in charge of instructing the Panamanian family to prevent, rather than punish, crime by reinforcing the family institution. -- To transform the national prison system to rehabilitate criminals. The system should respect human rights and effectively reincorporate into civilian society the citizens who have served their sentences. Transportation and Communications Several studies carried out on this will determine the possible solutions to the problem of transportation and means of communications, establishing a strategy of expanding the network of highways that would solve the vehicle traffic problems in Panama City into the next century. The possibilities that this network might be built based on a toll system and with private and mixed enterprises facilitates the option for solving the vehicle traffic problem that is becoming unbearable. There are economic and social problems and, particularly, the family-related problems that the vast majority of the public transportation users must endure. This is because users must spend up to three hours before and after work commuting for no reason other than the huge traffic congestions. Therefore, we propose the following: -- Recover the national highway network whose maintenance has been neglected, mainly the Transisthmian Highway, and widening two additional highways. To continue expanding the four lanes on the Pan-American highway with views to turning it into a freeway all the way to Chiriqui. To build the Colon-Cocle highway, Chepo-Darien highway, and the Bocas-Chiriqui highway. -- To develop a network of highway communications in the central provinces in order to guarantee an incentive for production. -- In the metropolitan area, to build the Northern Corridor, the Southern Corridor, or the Coastal Corridor. To develop a broad and scientific program of traffic signs, traffic lights, widening of streets and avenues, vehicles bypasses, and pedestrian bridges. With the participation of private enterprise in these projects, we will be able to generate thousands of jobs which the Panamanians anxiously await. -- To organize a staggered schedule of public office hours and persuade private enterprise to join the same in order to prevent traffic congestion and peak hours in public transportation. -- To carry out a broad campaign that seeks to change the mentality of the drivers. In order to do this, it is important to guarantee the participation of the government, civic clubs, and the media. There must be a great crusade for the ethical and courteous behavior of the population. -- A large amount of the everyday problems that contribute to traffic congestion are due to the attitude of the drivers, who do not practice common courtesy when they drive. Statistics show that the lack of driver education or not practicing established norms entail sorrow and mourning for many homes. Therefore, it is necessary that formal education incorporate highway education into its program as a required subject. The Canal and Use of Reverted Areas The current world outlook indicates the continued importance Panama has in communications, transportation, and world trade. Therefore, we must assign priority to the process of transition toward the control, management, defense, and administration by Panama over the Canal and the reverted areas, which are our country's greatest asset. Solidarity proposes: Strengthening the governmental institutional mechanisms in charge of following up the implementation of the Panama Canal Treaty, and granting the administrative and technical support that are required by the Panamanian representatives on the Board of Directors and the various binational organizations.
