This statement, which he made to SAWT AL-SHA'B, is contrary to what was reported by news agencies and some papers that a security accord was recently signed between the Jordanian and Palestinian sides. Mahmud 'Abbas, also known as Abu-Mazin and a member of the PLO Executive Committee, said--in a telephone interview SAWT AL-SHA'B conducted with him in Tunis--that the Palestinian leadership had discussed the draft security accord prepared by the territory, border, and security committee, which is considered one of the most important committees of the Joint Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Committee and which was formed before the Palestinian-Israeli accord was signed. He added that the Palestinian leadership sent the draft security accord to Major General Fahkri Shaqquraq, chief of Palestinian intelligence, who is currently in Amman. [passage omitted]
