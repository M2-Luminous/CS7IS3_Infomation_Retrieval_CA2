This was disclosed in a Monday interview with INTERFAX by a high-ranking official at the Russian Foreign Ministry. The G-7 summit in Naples at the beginning of July is the deadline before the foreign ministers of Russia, the USA, Britain, France, Germany, Greece and Belgium must get together, the official said. The diplomat hopes that technical matters can be resolved in a matter of days and the working schedules of ministers coordinated. "There is a more difficult problem, though. All possible actions of each of the conflicting Bosnian sides must be predicted", he said. The international community should have something in store, if one or both conflicting sides reject the plan approved during the first ministerial meeting. Under the plan Bosnian Serbs should get 49 percent of the territory and the federation of Muslims and Croats 51 percent. The Russian diplomat felt that Geneva would again host the ministerial meeting. "The leaders of the conflicting sides will evidently also be invited to Geneva. It is not clear, however, whether they are going to attend the meeting or whether the ministers will find another way of communicating with them", the official said.
