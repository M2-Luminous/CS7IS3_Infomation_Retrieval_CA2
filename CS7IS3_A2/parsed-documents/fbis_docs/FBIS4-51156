Aside from discussing economic issues with Beijing, he will conclude with the Chinese side a final agreement on authorizing the latter to manufacture Sukhoi Su-27 fighters. According to a source in Beijing, China is discussing the issue of transferring manufacturing techniques for Su-27 fighters. Beijing is very likely to gain the license. While meeting with high-ranking Beijing leaders, Chernomyrdin will probably finalize the move. The mainland has purchased 26 Su-27's from Russia and an order for another 26 Su-27K's is under negotiation. Apart from matters related to the Su-27, Chernomyrdin will reportedly discuss cooperation between the two countries in the hi-tech field, including cooperation in the hi-tech defense area. Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy Russian prime minister and head of the Russian side of the "Russian-Chinese Economic, Trade, Scientific, and Technological Council," yesterday called upon Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission. Though both sides did not disclose the specific contents of the meeting, it is believed that they must have touched upon arms deals. Shokhin is responsible for trade with China, while the arms deal is part and parcel of bilateral trade. Shokhin came to Beijing to attend the "Russian-Chinese Economic, Trade, Scientific, and Technological Council" meeting due to open on next Tuesday. The meeting is scheduled to be held once a year, but it has been 18 months since the last meeting. In the first quarter of this year, the bilateral trade volume dropped by 43.5 percent compared with the same period last year. The coming meeting is designed to clear away obstacles hindering the expansion of bilateral trade. [passage omitted]
