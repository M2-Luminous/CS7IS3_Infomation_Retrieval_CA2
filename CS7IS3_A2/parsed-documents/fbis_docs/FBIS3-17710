Aleksandr Zvyagintsev, chief of the Russian General Prosecutor's Office Information Center, announced in an interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA that we will have to await the results of investigations being carried out by the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Prosecutor's Office. Aleksandr Grigoryevich noted that the press has nothing to fear with regard to libel charges -- it has simply carried out its professional duty. Those who circulated these false stories prior to their publication in the press should bear the responsibility.
