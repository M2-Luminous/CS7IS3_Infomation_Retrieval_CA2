The Dutch guests were welcomed by Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and his wife, Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien and other senior officials. Dutch Ambassador to Vietnam Mr. Dave Ader was also on hand. This evening, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and his wife gave a reception in honour of the Dutch guests. On this occasion the Army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN runs an article expressing the Vietnamese Government and people's gratitude to the Dutch Government and people for their support to the national construction in Vietnam, especially their humanitarian aid in various healthcare projects for the Vietnamese people. `The Dutch Government and non- governmental organisations have granted help to Vietnam's healthcare and education under various forms: financial and technical assistance, and donation. The Dong Ha hospital in the central province of Quang Tri was built with Dutch assistance. In addition, a number of healthcare programmes such as malaria, TB, leprosy, immunisation, drinking water have also received assistance from the Netherlands. Together with its assistance to the Amsterdam High School in Hanoi, the Dutch Government has granted scholarships for hundreds of Vietnamese students to study in the Netherlands. In 1993 alone it gave vietnam some USD 20 million as aid, not accounting the assistance through the European Community and various UN bodies. `The Netherlands also decided to exempt Vietnam's debt service payment which was worth about USD 1.4 million, and was one of the countries who agreed to delay Vietnam's time of payment for its arrears at the donors' conference on Vietnam in Paris last year. At present, the Netherlands ranks ninth among foreign investors in Vietnam with a capital totalling more than USD 283 million, and is the second largest EC country which is carrying out ever broadening investment in the country. The paper also recalls the Netherlands growing cooperation with Vietnam in many fields, i.e. oil and gas, air service, harbour building and enlarging, water management, food processing industry which have led to the signing in 1993 of the Vietnamese-Dutch agreement on investment encouragement and protection and of the establishment of the Vietnamese-Dutch dredge joint venture.
