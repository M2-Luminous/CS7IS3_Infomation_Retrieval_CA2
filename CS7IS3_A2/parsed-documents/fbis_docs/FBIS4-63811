It was expected that a final document would be signed by the heads of the governments of Russia on the dividing up of the fleet, however the issue of dividing up the infrastructure remains unresolved. As reported by ITAR-TASS, it is a question of coastal fortifications, artillery and depot premises, and even of servicemen's flats in Sevastopol. Thus, Chernomyrdin and Zvyahilskyy could not sign any kind of final document. The Black Sea Fleet is independent and is capable of rebuffing any provocation relating to it. Any unilateral actions with regard to the fleet are unlawful. This was stated today by Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. He stressed that Russia is not indifferent to the situation in Crimea and, if that area becomes entangled in a military conflict, it could lead to civil war.
