The point is that either the amended document should be restored to its original form or certain elements that we consider satisfactory should be added to it. Denktas said that after his meeting with Kliridhis tomorrow, Clark will probably bring certain answers to the Turkish Cypriot side. Asked if elements satisfactory to the Turkish Cypriots will be added to the package, Denktas said: I do not know. We will see tomorrow. Denktas pointed out that the UN officials are insisting on their proposals while the Turkish Cypriots are insisting on their own views. He stressed that the Turkish Cypriot side made certain flexible proposals during the talks and will wait for the results. Replying to another question, Denktas said the element of time is still being stressed in the talks. He said: According to the UN officials, tomorrow is the last day, but if they see any encouraging signs, they will probably stay another couple of days.
