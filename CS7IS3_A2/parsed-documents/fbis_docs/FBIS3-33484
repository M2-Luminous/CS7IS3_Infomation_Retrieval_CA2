The candidates were presented in the Pasos Perdidos Hall of the Chamber of Deputies. The speaker is Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez, whose name is at the top of the list. Alvarez said: "Our candidates want to guarantee that the new Constitution will strengthen democracy, establish new rights, and recover a judicial system totally independent from political power." He criticized the administration of President Menem, and did not spare the Radical Civic Union; he spoke of the "ethic submission" of this political party and of the need for the Grand Front to become an election alternative in the district. Indeed, one paragraph of the document released yesterday states: "We will be the only alternative to the single party system that seeks reelection through the Menem-Alfonsin pact." After reading the document, Alvarez presented the candidates. The second name in the list is Anibal Ibarra, councilman and former prosecutor, followed by Deputy Graciela Fernandez Meijide and lawyer Raul Eugenio Zaffaroni. Given the public activity of Ibarra and Zaffaroni, Alvarez said that the Grand Front "seeks to struggle in the assembly in favor of a system of justice really independent from Menemist corruption." Next on the list are Eduardo Barcessat, Adriana Puiggros, Alicia Oliveira, a former member of the CELS [Center for Legal and Social Studies], and Jose Miguez Bonino, from the Permanent Human Rights Association. Alvarez described Puiggros as an "expert on education and science." He took the opportunity to criticize the Olivos pact, saying: "That pact has also forgotten education, which is why we included it on the list," he said. [passage omitted]
