But the early morning bomb injured no-one. It exploded under the car of Andreas Kharalambous who had parked outside his home. The homemade dynamite bomb extensively damaged Kharalambous' Metro and his daughter's car which was parked nearby. The windows of his house were also smashed in the explosion which could be heard all over Limassol. Kharalambous is chief health inspector for the Limassol municipality. He had no idea who was responsible for the attack, adding that he had no differences with anyone and had never been threatened. But police spokesman Andreas Kariolaimos said officers were investigating whether the attack could have been due to professional differences. Other police sources said suspicions are aimed at one specific person working with Kharalambous. Attempts to secure an arrest warrant against the suspect have failed, said the source, due to insufficient evidence.
