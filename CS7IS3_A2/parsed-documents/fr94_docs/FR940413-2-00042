SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Agency has issued Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) documents for the pesticidal active ingredients listed below. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended in 1988, EPA is conducting an accelerated reregistration program to reevaluate existing pesticides to make sure they meet current scientific and regulatory standards. The data base to support the reregistration of each of the chemicals listed below is substantially complete. EPA has determined that all currently registered products subject to reregistration containing these active ingredients are eligible for reregistration. List A - Case 0632 ␣␣␣Barium Metaborate Monohydrate; Case 0577 ␣␣␣Methiocarb; List C - Case 3084 ␣␣␣Lithium Hypochlorite; Case 3070 ␣␣␣Ethanolamine; List D - Case 4015 ␣␣␣Bromine; Case 4064 ␣␣␣Mineral Acids; Case 4072 ␣␣␣Peroxy Compounds; Case 4097 ␣␣␣Vegetable and Flour Oils; To request a copy of any of the above listed RED documents, or a RED Fact Sheet, contact the OPP Pesticide Docket, Public Response and Program Resources Branch, in Room 1132 at the address given above or call (703) 305&hyph;5805. All registrants of products containing one or more of the above listed active ingredients have been sent the appropriate RED documents and must respond to labeling requirements and product specific data requirements (if applicable) within 8 months of receipt. Products containing the other active ingredients will not be reregistered until adequate product specific data have been submitted and all necessary product label changes are implemented. The reregistration program is being conducted under Congressionally mandated time frames, and EPA recognizes both the need to make timely reregistration decisions and to involve the public. Therefore, EPA is issuing these REDs as final documents with a 60&hyph;day comment period. Although the 60&hyph;day public comment period does not affect the registrant's response due date, it is intended to provide an opportunity for public input and a mechanism for initiating any necessary amendments to the RED. All comments will be carefully considered by the Agency. If any comment significantly affect a RED, EPA will amend the RED by publishing the amendment in the Federal Register.
