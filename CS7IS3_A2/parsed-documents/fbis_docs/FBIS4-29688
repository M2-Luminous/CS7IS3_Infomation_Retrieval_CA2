He seems to be concerned with the possibility that if the Social Democratic Party [Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ)] carries out prolonged consultations with the ruling coalition parties without reaching any conclusions before the current Diet session comes to an end (on 29 June), it will become impossible to submit the no-confidence motion, or even if it were submitted, the LDP alone cannot have it adopted. Therefore, in setting a time limit, the LDP intends to urge the SDPJ to make its decision on going along with the LDP policy.
