This project, which uses new-generation domestically made digital fiber optic communications equipment developed by MPT's Wuhan Institute of P&T Science, will employ the 1B1H encoding format suited to China's needs. The project employs a number of advanced technologies, including VLSI circuits and thick-film circuits, integrated digital signal processing/computer techniques, and miniaturized, low-loss, high-reliability equipment. Each system, in addition to the 1920 circuits provided in the main channel, can furnish an additional 1200 circuits (an increase of 62.5 percent capacity) via application of the ``H'' code. The Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou buried optical cable project, funded by a loan from the Asian Development Bank, employed international tenders. After sharp competition, the contract was awarded to MPT's Meishan Communications Equipment Plant.
