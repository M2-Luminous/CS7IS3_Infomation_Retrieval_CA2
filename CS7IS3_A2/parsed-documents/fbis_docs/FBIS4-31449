The message was presented to the Slovak Premier in Bratislava on Wednesday by MSZP acting Deputy Chairman Imre Szekeres. In an interview with MTI's correspondent after the hour-long meeting with Moravcik, Szekeres said: "The meeting was extremely constructive. I detailed the probable essentials of the foreign policy of the new Hungarian government: that we shall strive for European integration, for settling our relations with neighbouring countries, and for ensuring the rights of the Hungarian minority living outside the borders of Hungary". "I also said that though the new government will be the government of 10.5 million Hungarians, it will feel responsibility for the fate of the Hungarian minority living beyond the country's borders." "We consider it important to open talks on the basic agreement between the two countries as soon as possible, and for these to lead to success as early as possible." "There are two major issues from our point of view: recognizing the inviolability of the borders, and mutual ensurance of the rights of Hungarians in Slovakia and Slovaks in Hungary." "I also informed Prime Minister Moravcik that the new Hungarian government will hold talks about the debated issues of the Gabcikovo power plant on a professional, rather than an ideological basis." Jozef Moravcik also met the press. He said he had told the MSZP delegation that the Slovak Government considered the election manifesto of the Hungarian socialists very interesting, "as it holds out the promise of successful bilateral cooperation." "We agreed that the foreign policy concepts of our countries are identical as regards basic aims, but that settling bilateral relations now requires firmer steps," Moravcik said.
