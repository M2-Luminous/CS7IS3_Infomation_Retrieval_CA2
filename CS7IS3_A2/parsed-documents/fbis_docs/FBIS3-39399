Kliridhis was speaking after a lengthy National Council meeting today to discuss the substance of the Cyprus issue and the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. The president said there were some differences in views and that some people suggested disengagement from the CBM's while others said we should discuss them but on the basis of some principles. Answering questions, Kliridhis said that when he attends the talks, his goal will be to discuss those points that the UN secretary general refers to as the basic points in his set of ideas. He said he expects Butrus-Ghali to announce these points tonight. DISI [Democratic Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis said we are now facing decisive developments for the future of the country, so our side must move carefully. On the handling of the discussion of the Cyprus issue, Matsis said there has been a noteworthy change with the European Union observer's intervention and presence at the talks. He continued: We believe that the observer's reports, as his orders say, should be in line with European law. Matsis added that DISI is determined to support the president during this decisive course for the Cyprus issue so as to hold talks in the most effective manner. AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] Secretary General Dhimitrios Khristofias said that when the president decided to participate in the proximity talks he should have manipulated the discussion to include the substance of the Cyprus issue. Khristofias said that AKEL has no intention of covering up the faits accomplis created by the president, adding that AKEL interprets any reference to the substance of the Cyprus issue as a return to discussing Butrus-Ghali's ideas. DIKO [Democratic Party] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou reiterated that he considers the CBM's as unacceptable and very dangerous. He said: We are afraid that if the CBM's are implemented they will form the basis of an overall Cyprus solution. He added that the measures solve the illegal regime's problems and therefore Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side have no reason to pursue a reasonable Cyprus solution. The DIKO chairman said disengagement from the measures is necessary, adding that his party made suggestions on how the president should handle the issue. Socialist party EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis said he pointed out ways to disengage from the measures, adding that all the prerequisites exist for a return to discussing the substance of the Cyprus issue. He said he believes the contrasting views expressed in the National Council strengthen the president's negotiating position.
