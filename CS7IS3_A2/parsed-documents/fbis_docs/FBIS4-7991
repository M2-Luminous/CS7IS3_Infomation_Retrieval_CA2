Fire raging in one of the warehouses is threatening to spread to other buildings, which could have serious consequences. The residents of Sesvete have, therefore, been urged to go to shelters, and everyone should avoid going to Sesvete -- particularly drivers, because roads through Sesvete will be closed. The residents of Dubrava near Sesvete, as well as of the surrounding villages have also been warned to be cautious and not stay in the streets but seek shelter in houses or basements. Mr. Sindicic, on duty in the Zagreb police station, has confirmed this talking to Gordana Cukon. [Begin recording] [Sindicic] There have been a series of explosions of stored powder in Duboki Jarak in the Sesvete area, and we are asking residents to move to a safe distance to avoid casualties. Everyone should protect themselves. They should not stay on the road but move to a safe distance. There should be no panic. This is not an attack. The situation is under control, and it will probably (?calm down) in 10 to 20 minutes. [Correspondent] Have the explosions stopped? [Sindicic] Not yet, and we cannot estimate when they will stop. When they stop, there will be no more danger. The most important thing is to inform the residents to stay away, not to panic, and that this is not an attack. [end recording]
