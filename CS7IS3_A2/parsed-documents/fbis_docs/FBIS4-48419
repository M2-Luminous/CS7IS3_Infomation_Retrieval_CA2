Mr. Assanga has appealed against the disciplinary council's decision and the difference is expected to be settled for good at the next party congress. The council, which met in Bamenda, capital of the Northwest Province, accused Mr. Assanga, the movement's second in command, of having tried to approach the government for possible SDF participation in a national union government. SDF Chairman John Fru Ndi has, since the multiparty presidential elections in 1992, opposed the participation of his party in such a government. Fru Ndi, who stood in those elections, contested President Paul Biya's reelection.
