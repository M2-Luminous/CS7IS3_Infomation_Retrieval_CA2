FR941202-2-00118 FR941202-2-00077 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA Docket No. 94&hyph;004; Notice 3] Highway Safety Programs; Conforming Products List of Screening Devices To Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice publishes the first Conforming Products List (CPL) of devices that conform to the Model Specifications for Screening Devices that measure alcohol in bodily fluids (59 FR 39382). EFFECTIVE DATE: December 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. James F. Frank, Office of Alcohol and State Programs, NTS&hyph;21, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh St., SW., Washington, DC 20590; Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;9581. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: On August 2, 1994, Model Specifications for Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids were published in the Federal Register (59 FR 39382). In these model specifications, NHTSA recognized industry efforts to develop new technologies. These specifications establish performance criteria and methods for testing alcohol screening devices using either breath or other bodily fluids to measure alcohol content. NHTSA established these specifications to support State laws that target youthful offenders (i.e., ``zero tolerance'' laws) and the Department of Transportation's initiative to prevent alcohol misuse. Employers are reminded that evidential breath testing devices are still required for screening under DOT's regulation on Alcohol Misuse Prevention, 49 CFR Part 40. Screening devices are not authorized for use under Part 40 until DOT amends its regulation. Alcohol screening devices have been submitted to NHTSA for testing and were evaluated at the Volpe National Transportation System Center in Cambridge, MA. This first publication of a Conforming Products List for alcohol screening devices reports on five (5) devices that were evaluated and found to meet the model specifications for alcohol screening devices cited above. Three of these five devices are sold under two different names (see CPL below). The Conforming Products List, which lists models that were submitted and determined to meet the model specifications, and the manufacturers who submitted them to NHTSA for testing, appears below:
