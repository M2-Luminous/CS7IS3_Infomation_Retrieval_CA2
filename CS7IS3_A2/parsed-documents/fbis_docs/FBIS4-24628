Dong Jun has the second part of our series on prisons in China: [Recording begins with a Chinese song fading into Dong Jun's voice in English] This song was written by inmates in the (?Xiyuan) Prison; the lyrics express not only regret for the past, but also determination to become a better person. Singer Li Haibo has been here for five years. He was found guilty of forgery and embezzlement in 1989. Now he is a member of the New Life Song and Dance Troupe in the prison. Fifty other inmates are also members of the group. Li Haibo said the correction officials believe music cures the wounds in the prisoners' hearts. [Li is briefly heard speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation] It may sound impossible that one can learn music in jail, but we are doing it. Music has been a good influence on me. I believe if I always try my best and perform well, the government will reduce my sentence. [Dong] There are altogether more than 3,000 inmates in this prison. Besides the song and dance troupe, many prisoners have joined art classes to learn sculpture, painting, and handicraft making. Others study computer science, accounting, and English. The prison administrator said they had been organizing these activities for 11 years in the hope that prisoners can benefit from them in the future. However, the main activity for the inmates is labor. It is believed that through labor, the prisoners will form good work habits and the sense of discipline and cooperation. In the (?Xiyuan) Prison, inmates make clothing. Twenty-year-old Wang Jiang is serving a four-year sentence for burglary. Our reporter talked with him, while he was making prison uniforms in the factory. [Reporter] Is this hard work? [Wang is briefly heard speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation] It's OK, not very harsh. [Reporter] How many hours do you work everyday? [Wang] Eight hours a day. [Reporter] What do you think about working in prison? [Wang] It's very good for me. I was spoiled by my parents and hated work. But now I know what life means; it will do me good when I go back to society. [Dong] Mai Lianhua is the warden of the prison. He said the meals of the inmates are scientifically arranged. [Mai is briefly heard speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation] We pay a lot of attention to the nutrition of the food. We are supplying vegetable, meat, and other staple food according to the needs of the body. [Dong] Mai Lianhua said there are five dishes provided for each meal. Everyday, the menu is put up for the prisoners to see. Most of them have regular meals; male inmates over 60 and female over 55 can enjoy special meals. Muslims have their own cafeteria. Everyone will receive a special meal on his or her birthday. However, the rooms for the inmates here are rather crowded. Built in 1901 by British colonizers, the prison is (?already) small, and Shanghai is well-known for its housing problems. In this city of 12 million, even law-abiding citizens don't have a big enough place to live. Twenty-two-year-old Xie Ying has been an inmate here for three years. [Xie is heard briefly speaking in Mandarin fading into English translation] The food here is alright. The room is very small; there are two people who share one room. It's OK. We can take a shower everyday in the summer. [Dong] There's a warden hotline in the prison. Inmates may call the warden when they have problems. They can also write to government offices if they think they are being treated unfairly. A psychological counseling office has also been set up for the inmates. It opens twice a week. The prisoners' conversations with doctors are kept confidential. Eleven foreign convicts are also inmates here. They are from Britain, the U.S., Germany, Pakistan, and Myanmar [Burma]. Most of them are convicted of drug-related offenses. They study Chinese laws and language while in jail. Some of them teach the Chinese inmates English. Their living allowances are 20 percent higher than a Chinese prisoner and all of them have their own cells. (Lachlan Campbell) is from the United Kingdom. He was sentenced to 15 years for marijuana trafficking two years ago. He has learned how to make artistic masks while in prison. When asked if he's being treated fair, (Campbell) had this to say: [(Campbell)] For sure, for sure. One hundred percent sure. The treatment here is very fair. With the warden, with the education [words indistinct] They always try to help us. At the beginning we weren't sure, but when warden comes out with Mr. Dong and Mr. (Jin), they always offer assistance. Now that we understand it, we have been here two years, now we understand it. [Dong] (Lachlan Campbell) also had this to say to his family: [(Campbell)] I want to say to my family that I hope to see you in the not so distant future. Thank you. That would be very nice and tell them that I'm in good health and I play regular football. We have lots of football competitions and I enjoy playing football very much. [Dong] For all the prisoners, going home is their biggest wish. The prison is a place for them, not only to repent and correct their mistakes, but also to prepare for the new life in the future. For China Radio International, I am Dong Jun. [end recording]
