No contracts for the supply of weapons or ammunition have been concluded since the start of the Rwandan conflict. Egypt has suspended the delivery of weapons contracted prior to the outbreak of the conflict in Rwanda, the source added. The source made this statement to comment on reports broadcast by the Rwandan Front's radio that Egypt has recently sold 33 tons of weapons worth $765,000 to the Government of Rwanda. The responsible source concluded his comment by saying that what has been delivered under earlier contracts preceded the outbreak of the conflict and was part a commercial deal concluded with Rwanda, similar what has been done with other countries. The implementation of the remainder of the contract was suspended immediately after the outbreak of the internal conflict in Rwanda. The source added that Egypt is eager to stop the bloodshed in Rwanda and halt anything that may subject the Rwandan people to further destruction.
