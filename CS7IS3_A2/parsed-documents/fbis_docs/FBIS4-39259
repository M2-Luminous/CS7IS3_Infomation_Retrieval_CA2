He mentioned that the Tiraspol officials are keeping in touch with Crimean leaders, but, in his opinion, these contacts are a matter of routine. According to the state secretary, the Simferopol authorities, despite rumours, have not asked for support from Tiraspol. Referring to the notion of creating a union of unrecognized states, suggested by the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh, Valeriy Litskay stressed that the Tiraspol officials had not been officially requested to enter this union. "We had not been offered documents such as the statute or the program of the union. Our position concerning the Union of Unrecognized States will depend solely on the contents of such documents," mentioned Litskay.
