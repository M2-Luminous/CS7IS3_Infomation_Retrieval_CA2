Kurdish customs officers and military personnel said Friday the Kurdish authorities registered more than 1,000 refugees in the border town of Zakho on March 11, but 1,000 more arrived later in the month. They were staying in tents and ruined Iraqi Kurdish villages. Muhammed Mikho, a Kurd from the village of Gevere in southern Turkey, told AFP the Turkish authorities prevented cars from entering or leaving the village and the Kurds could not take sick people to hospital. "No food reached our village. We could not provide our children with fruit or vegetables throughout the winter," he said. He was staying in a tent near the Turkish border with his wife and eight children. Just before Sunday's Turkish municipal elections "soldiers came into the village, hit us, tortured our women and threatened to kill all of us," Mikho said. The soldiers' actions prompted Kurdish families to leave Gevere. The Kurdish authorities, who have controlled the Iraqi side of the border since March 1991, said they had not decided how to handle the new influx. The refugees insisted on international protection and rejected plans to move them into a camp, saying they were "afraid of the Turkish secret services," Kurdish officials in Zakho said. Turkish representatives maintain a contact office in Zakho. A refugee from Sibeli village said the Turkish Kurds feared cross-border raids by Turkish helicopters, and wanted to keep their places of refuge secret. Other refugees said the Turkish military did not let them take any property with them and they had not yet received any aid. As discussions continued in Zakho over the establishment of a refugee camp, Kurdish police who refused to be named said they were not sure whether they would be able to protect refugees in a camp against "attacks from the Turkish secret services."
