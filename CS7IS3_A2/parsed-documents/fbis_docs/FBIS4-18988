The Foreign Ministry has told Spanish Television that this bombing was of a limited warning nature and has the support of the Spanish Government, which is always in favor of UN resolutions being fulfilled. We have just received some statements made by Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas, who, apart from confirming Spanish support for NATO's action, said that the Spanish soldiers serving with the United Nations are in no danger. The Spanish soldiers are fulfilling their missions with complete normality away from the bombing. [Begin Vargas recording] Therefore, what has been done is to extend to that town the threat that was issued at the time for Sarajevo, although in the latter case at the last moment it was not necessary to carry out the threat. I think this was a correct decision and shows that the United Nations is adamant that the agreements should be respected, the resolutions should be applied, and that the conflict bit by bit should be channelled along the road of negotiation. It is a combination of negotiation supported by force. And I repeat that the most important way is the political way, the way of negotiation, but if at times it has to be reinforced with the use of force then I think that this is reasonable.
