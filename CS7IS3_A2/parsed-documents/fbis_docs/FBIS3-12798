Dr. al-Agha said that those steps are in no way sufficient and do not represent serious measures vis-a-vis the size of the tragedy that has taken place. He added that the release of a few hundred prisoners has no connection with any serious steps, especially as the prison term of most of those prisoners was about to end. As for the Palestinian leadership's stance toward the painful massacre and the steps that it has taken, Dr. al-Agha said that the Palestinian leadership's response is somewhat acceptable and is epitomized by suspending the talks until two basic conditions are met. They are: 1. Placing the settlements issue as a top priority on the agenda and, ultimately, evacuating the settlements and disarming the settlers. 2. Imposing international protection, with UN supervision, in the occupied territories to ensure that the Palestinians live in peace and security.
