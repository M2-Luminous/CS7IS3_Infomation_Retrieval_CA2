[Hulkova] Intensive working meetings are under way at Prague Castle. At the moment President Vaclav Havel is in talks with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. President Havel has already had talks with [Slovak President] Michal Kovac and [Polish President] Lech Walesa. The foreign ministers' talks were being held at the same time. Of course, the Partnership for Peace is the center of attention. Responding to the question by Czech Radio as to whether any issues remain open, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said that there are a number of open issues since the Partnership for Peace is a program that, by its nature, is an open one. I hope that this is the space that we will fill in by our activity and that this activity -- not only ours but also the activity of the 16 NATO countries -- will result in our soon becoming a component part of NATO that brings together countries with whom we are close by our civilization, history, and values, said the Czech foreign minister for Czech Radio. [Polish Foreign Minister] Andrzej Olechowski said that the Polish side considered the Partnership for Peace to be a very important contribution to European security, and that he perceived the project as innovative, constructive, and optimistic.
