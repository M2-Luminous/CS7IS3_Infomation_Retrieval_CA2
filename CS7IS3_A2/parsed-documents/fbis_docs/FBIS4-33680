The Ibero-American Justice Ministers Meeting in Cartagena is analyzing judicial cooperation, measures to fight organized crime, and family welfare. The goal is to put law and justice to the service of integration through cooperation accords. [Andres Martinez, Colombian minister of justice; identified by caption] "Integration can be devoid of content if it is not accompanied by precise judicial norms. Normative dispersion can become an acute obstacle for progress in the field of integration." Regarding this meeting, Cuban Justice Minister Carlos Amat pointed out Cuba's potential contribution to the meeting. [Amat] "We have brought the example of our organization regarding subjects that I believe are extremely important: the family; the problem of abandoned children; the problem of adoption. These issues are included in the summit. We have significant experience in these fields." Amat also spoke about the interest that these issues might spark among participants in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. [Amat] "The repercussions these might have lie basically in acceptance by the states involved in the results of this work, the search for a common denominator in the legal and legislative character to make law the guiding force in relations among countries, and of course, to seek by this path a strengthening of ties and greater integration, which is the end goal." Cuban Ambassador Jesus Martinez described the relations between the two nations as satisfactory. He made these statements during a solidarity meeting with Cuba held in Barranquilla and attended by representatives of unions and the Colombian Workers Federation. [Martinez] "The Colombian Government has taken the step of reestablishing ties with Cuba. It seems to us that it is only fair that we see this step as positive." Cuba and Colombia reestablished diplomatic and commercial ties in October 1990, and between January and April 1994, Cuban imports topped the list of Colombia's imports. These exports have grown 16-fold in this quarter and totalled $21 million. Colombia imports Cuban steel, salt, generic medicine, vaccine, and biotechnology products. Regarding negotiations for Colombian oil, Ambassador Martinez explained: [Martinez] "The procedure is established. There is political will, but as of now, there is no accord to conduct this type of project. We do think that either now or later, by direct purchase or through oil refining, we have the technical conditions and possibilities to develop this type of relation." During the meeting, the Colombian union leaders expressed interest in the Cuban reality and their support for Cuba. [Unidentified speaker] "Viva socialist Cuba! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva socialist Cuba! [repeats] [Crowd: Viva!] Down with the economic blockade of Cuba! [Crowd: Down with it!] Viva the unity of the Colombian people! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva the unity of the Cuban people! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva the solidarity of the Cuban and Colombian peoples! [Crowd: Viva!] Fighting united! [Crowd: We will win!] Fighting united! [Crowd: We will win!] [repeats].
