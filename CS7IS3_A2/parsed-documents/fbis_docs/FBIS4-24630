Strictly speaking, the expression cultural market can be defined in a broad as well as a narrow sense. In a broad sense, cultural market refers to the performing arts, cinema, painting, audio-visual products, entertainment, books, newspapers, and magazines. In a narrow sense, cultural market mainly refers to books, newspapers, magazines, audio-visual products, and entertainment. At present, the narrow-sense cultural market has been the subject of discussions by an increasing number of people because of the existence of many salient problems related to books and other publications, audio-visual products, and entertainment. China's cultural market has enjoyed rapid and full-bloom development over the last decade. The cultural market as a whole is brisk, orderly, healthy, and thriving. An expert in the area of culture summed up the Chinese cultural market at present in the following manner. He said a brisk, orderly, healthy, and thriving cultural market broadens investment opportunities. A pattern marked by state, collective, individual, and foreign investment has begun to take shape in China. A consumption structure that is rich and varied in form and conditions not only greatly enriches urban and rural citizens' cultural lives, satisfies the masses' different cultural tastes and demands, but also promotes the further development of cultural undertakings. In conclusion, he said a booming cultural market helps culture to play its aesthetic, educational, and cognitive functions, as well as create a very flexible environment for economic construction. However, one should also see to the serious loss of balance that is plaguing the cultural market. The loss of balance can be seen in the following areas. The regional imbalance involves a large gap which is developing between economically-developed and undeveloped regions and between urban and rural areas. The lack of balance in overall arrangements involves performance market shortages and oversupply on the entertainment market. The lack of balance in the quality of performance is characterized by a reversal of the pyramid of first, second, and third-rate performances and by a situation wherein entertainment spots for the general public have turned into the preserve of a few. The loss of balance in cultural content is characterized by the predominance of outside over indigenous culture. Although the aforementioned phenomena are still developing, we need to pay close attention to them and correct them through working out quick macro-control measures. Particularly worth pointing out is the negative side of the cultural market. People in some localities are engaged in the illegal production and marketing of pornographic books, newspapers, magazines, audio-visual products, of providing sex services on the entertainment market, and of using video-game machines for gambling purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a more forceful and effective measure to thoroughly cleanse these negative phenomena from the cultural market. Of course, it is not right to close the windows just because a few flies have flown into the room. The proper thing to do is to install screens on the windows to prevent the flies from coming into the room and to build a tight management network. Relevant departments have done a lot of work in this regard and they are now working toward the goal of establishing a rational cultural structure and of improving cultural laws and regulations. As the adoption of the abovementioned measures are far from enough, we need to adopt further measures to plug all the loopholes. What is needed most now is to energetically and strictly enforce the law and to deal with the "flies" without mercy. While going all out to "cleanse" the cultural market, we should also devote great efforts to promote the culture, to help create conditions for great works that eulogize the main trend of the times, as well as to use creative works that are popular with the masses to throw away dirty mud, to cleanse muddied water, and to occupy the high ground of the cultural market.
