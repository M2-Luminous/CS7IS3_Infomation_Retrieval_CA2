Could you be more specific? [Oleksy] It sounds rather conceited, but we can say that Poland and the Czech Republic should not only take from Europe; they also have something to give. There is the potential ability to develop, for instance. The Western countries are facing recession, unemployment, and overproduction. I partially subscribe to the thesis that dynamic development is not to be expected in the West but, rather, in Central and East Europe. It is also a question of a certain orthodoxy, which is quite pronounced in our countries because the transformation requires it. This can be linked to the transparency of our politics and its suitable interpretation. We can also prove how strong the bond is between social intentions and the pragmatic decisionmaking in the economy. Finally, there is also the phenomenal experience with the system of real socialism. This experience is not only bad but also good, in the sense that we know how it should not look. [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Would you care to comment on the proposed solution of the Polish debt to the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic? [Oleksy] It is a debt of $85 million, of which $65 million is the share of the Czech Republic. Prime Minister Klaus gave his support to the concept that these funds will be used on the basis of a jointly drafted plan for the development of the infrastructure and ecology in those regions of the Czech Republic that border Poland. I consider that very reasonable. [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] The Polish ambassador to Prague comments very favorably on the "economization of Czech foreign policy." What do you think? [Oleksy] It could be referred to by another term, too--the subordination of foreign policy to economic goals and interests--and that is something I have been trying for in Poland for a long time. I believe that, after 1989, there was a period in Polish foreign policy when it was necessary to concentrate on building a new "contractual infrastructure." We have succeeded in this task. Today Poland needs politics to serve, above all, economic interests. Every country--and it applies even more to the small ones--must be able to calculate its economic interests and advocate them in the framework of the worldwide economic game.

(Oleksy) Negligible--we meet with the social democrats only at international actions. We have not had any contacts with your communists for a long time. However, we do have very close contacts with Peter Weiss's party in Slovakia.]
