At the beginning of the session, Finance Minister Ho Te read a report compiling National Assembly deputies' views on the bill. Then, Ly Tai Luan, deputy head of the National Assembly Legislative Committee presented the full text of the revised bill on tax levied on the transfer of rights on land usage after receiving National Assembly deputies' opinions. The bill on the transfer of rights on land usage consists of seven chapters with 29 articles. The National Assembly continued to contribute opinions before passing each chapter. In the morning session, the deputies contributed many opinions on some articles, especially article eight regulating tax rates for the transfer of agriculture land -- particularly rice growing land -- for other purposes. Somebody suggested raising the tax rate from 40 percent to 50 percent in order to protect the decreasing amount of agriculture land. However, somebody else proposed that the tax rate for the transfer of agriculture land to build industrial projects should be reduced because a high tax would discourage entrepreneurs from building industrial projects in rural areas. Some opinions suggested that the National Assembly should only regulate a tax scale and the government and the National Assembly Standing Committee are empowered to set concrete tax rates for each projects built in rural areas. In the afternoon, after the Law Drafting Committee amended some articles as suggested by the deputies, the National Assembly passed the entire bill on the tax levied on the transfer of rights on land usage. Also in the afternoon session, National Assembly Vice Chairman Dang Quan Thuy reported on Comrade Mai Thuc Lan's application to resign from the positions of member of the National Assembly Standing Committee and head of the National Assembly's Economic and State Budget Committee for other official duty. The National Assembly voted in secret on Comrade Mai Thuc Lan's application. Tomorrow, the National Assembly will have an all-day break. On Monday, it will continue its work in the conference hall.
