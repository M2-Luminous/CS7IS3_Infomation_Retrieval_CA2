The recurrent theme of the conference has been the continuing policy and practice of genocide not only on the territory of the former Union, but also in other regions of the world. Video documentaries have been presented to the forum dealing with acts of mass genocide in Tajikistan, Ingushetia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Abkhazia, and Bosnia, as well as historical materials on the spiritual and physical destruction of the people in Chechnya. At the end of the conference's second day a speech was made by Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of the Chechen Republic-Ichkeria, who demanded the continuation of the Nuremburg trials for the organizers and ideological inspirers of the policy of genocide on the territory of the former Union in the present stage. Impunity engenders new crimes, Dudayev said. Touching on the stance of the international community, the Chechen president noted with regret that it remains an indifferent observer of the evil deeds being committed against peoples all over the world. Dudayev declared the complete bankruptcy of the United Nations, an illegitimate body in which authority is illegally usurped by a narrow group of political clans in the person of the so-called five permanent members of the UN Security Council. This situation contradicts the fundamental interests of the international community, Dudayev said. The president of the Chechen Republic-Ichkeria appealed to the states and countries of the world to recognize all the riches and resources of the planet as the exclusive property of the most high, and the right of all peoples to use these resources without regard to state borders and formations. In particular, Dudayev proposed as a first step that a water supply line should be laid from the icy peaks of the Caucasus to the Middle East, where water is the main cause of instability, bloodshed, and war. Today the conference will end its work after adopting a number of fundamental documents.
