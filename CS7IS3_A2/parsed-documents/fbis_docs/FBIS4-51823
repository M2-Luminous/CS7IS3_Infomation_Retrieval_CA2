Security Council [UNSC]. "It is very important to make clear Japan's determination," Owada told Japanese reporters four days after presenting his credentials to U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. He said Japan would try to achieve the objective without antagonizing other countries. "The sentiment in the U.N. and the world community is that Japan should play a more active role," he said. Owada also said it is "very important" for the U.N. to engage in peacekeeping and other related activities, adding there is still room for Japan to do more within its peacekeeping cooperation law. Owada, father of Crown Princess Masako, took up his U.N. post on April 28, replacing another career diplomat Yoshio Hatano.
