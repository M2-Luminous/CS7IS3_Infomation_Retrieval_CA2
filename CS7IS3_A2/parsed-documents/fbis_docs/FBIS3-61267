Sheynis by Tatyana Sukhomlinova; place and date not given: "`Pygmalion' Is Disappointed With `Galatea.' Viktor Sheynis Believes That the Election Statute Has Flaws"] [Text] Despite Viktor Leonidovich Sheynis being a quite prominent political figure, here are a few words about our interlocutor. Until the late 1980's, the door to politics was closed to a person with his political views. Science, which he engaged in with great pleasure, became the only area for self-accomplishment. Had it not been for "perestroyka," everything would have developed as it had.... His first experience in entering politics occurred much earlier, when he wrote a small work about Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956. This work of the young graduate student was designed for what was later named samizdat, but ended up in the KGB first. As a result, he was expelled from the graduate school and worked as a borer at the Kirov Plant for six years.... As the former chief of the parliamentary working group for revising the Election Statute, he perceives the experience of the last election campaign in a philosophically calm and politically calculated manner. [Sukhomlinova] An ancient story about the relationship between the creator Pygmalion and the result of his inspired and tormented labors, Galatea, has been implemented anew...in the course of the last election campaign. How do you evaluate your "Galatea," the Election Statute? [Sheynis] Alas, this lady has turned out to have flaws.... The Election Statute has advantages and, unfortunately, obvious disadvantages. I consider the introduction of a mixed voting system to be the main accomplishment; under the system, half the deputies are elected on a proportional basis from the lists of electoral associations to which political parties and other organizations belong. They objected to me, as a rule in a demagogic manner: Why give preference to parties at a time when in our country they do not even amount to parties in the greater scheme of things. I believe that they will not appear here until we have multiparty elections in the country. After all, only the "party of a new type" engaged in everything from ideological conditioning of the working people to the distribution of all kinds of benefits. For their part, parties which exist in the environment of a democratic country mainly "work" for elections. [Sukhomlinova] Therefore, we may hope that the process of asserting a modern power structure has begun.... However, why was precisely this provision, whose potential is obvious, very difficult to "push through?" [Sheynis] The reasons are many. I will give one of them. All of this is unusual to us, and new things are, as a rule, rejected. Opponents suggested that we first conduct an experiment and see what happens: to elect 10 percent of the deputies the way we proposed, and 90 percent--the old way, in single-seat districts. In conjunction with this, I recalled an old joke: At one point they became concerned here about the poor condition of street traffic. They sent a delegation to England to gain advanced experience. Upon its return, they concluded: Indeed, street traffic is doing very well over there, probably because it moves on the left. Let us try this in our country too, and by way of an experiment convert just one motor vehicle pool to driving on the left.... We would have had the same experiment with these 10 percent.... Still, despite the resistance we managed to ensure that the president agreed with us (he was precisely the one to introduce the Edict on Elections). We managed to meet with him, explained our position, and gave all the arguments "in favor" and "against"--and he agreed with us.... I think that our former parliament would not have resolved to pass such an election law. [Sukhomlinova] Still, what is its principal flaw? [Sheynis] Our main mistake was that we introduced a system of one-round voting in single-seat districts. A situation developed which was similar to the 1989-1990 elections. Just as at that time, a multitude of candidates, frequently without a clear association with parties, competed within the same district, and this "split" the vote of the electorate. However, those elections were held in two rounds, after all. This time there were random results in many districts.... I tried to change the situation by setting an example and withdrew as a candidate in a single-seat district, suggesting that the voters support another candidate from the democratic bloc, Pavel Medvedev, who was elected as a result. I counted on something greater: on others following my example. Alas.... The two-round system would have allowed us to correct the situation to a degree and to concentrate the votes of the electorate with similar political orientations around the most promising candidates. Having perceived the mistake, our working group passed on to the president the draft amendments to the Election Statute as early as 3 November. At the time amendments were still being made. However, either the president turned down our proposals or the draft simply did not reach him--it is not easy to find a way to the president.... Well, the issue was closed. [Sukhomlinova] However, can we say that this is an issue for the future? [Sheynis] Certainly. We will analyze our original draft law most thoroughly against the background of the actual electoral process and will, of course, try to introduce amendments to the law which the parliament has yet to adopt. After all, the statute in effect is devised solely for the 1993 elections. It has other drawbacks, too. The extremely short period allowed for the election campaign is the common source of the drawbacks. When preparing the draft law we proceeded from the necessity of 135 days for the entire campaign. This is not a random number but one calculated with the experience of other campaigns and the conditions specific to our country taken into account. However, the elections were announced, and the real election campaign was conducted within a considerably shorter period of time, which undoubtedly influenced its results.
