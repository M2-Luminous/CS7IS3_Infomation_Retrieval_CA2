In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for minor original license for the Apthorp Project, located on the Ammonoosuc River, in Grafton county, New Hampshire and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (draft EA) for the project. In the draft EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the environmental impacts of the existing project and the proposed expansion, and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate mitigation or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the draft EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104 of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.
