They contend that between the "conservatism and close-mindedness of the right camp" and the "capitulation of the left camp," there is another possibility: the Alon plan. Yig'al Alon conceived his plan in the late 1960's. It was based on a chain of Jewish settlements in vital areas of the occupied territories and on military control of the mountain ridges. This plan, which early on won broad support in the Labor Party, has now been pulled out of mothballs even though the conditions that gave birth to it have changed. If a genuine, bold and clearheaded leadership had arisen in the early 1970's and opened a real dialogue with Jordan and the PLO, it might have been possible to realize some elements of the plan. Today, after the peace agreement with Egypt, which included total withdrawal from Sinai, and given our readiness to achieve a comprehensive peace with Syria--at the price that entails--the Alon plan is no longer viable. It is now a political corpse irrelevant to our times. The simple, salient question before us is, are we ready to make peace with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians or not. That is it in a nutshell. I am aware of the public's gut feeling--peace yes, but not at any price. But the price is clear: total withdrawal from the Golan, withdrawal from most of Judea and Samaria except for Jerusalem, and the possibility that a Palestinian state will arise as part of a permanent arrangement. The compensation for that is a comprehensive peace agreement with the confrontation states around us, with defense arrangements acceptable to the military and security branches and a different, optimistic outlook for Israel's future development. These are the only two paths before us: Greater Israel with perpetual war and rule over another people, or peace with major and painful territorial concessions. The whites in South Africa could have worked out a shared government and rotation in office with the black majority 20 years ago. The apartheid leaders closed their hearts and minds and ended up with full control by the black majority, something that could have been prevented by a wise and balanced approach. In the basic elements of the dispute and in its solutions, the case of South Africa necessarily is not identical to the Middle East. But the comparison is applicable to determinism of historic processes. Rule over a foreign people, even if it is justified, has a price. Yesterday's price is not today's and certainly will not be tomorrow's. Whoever tries to use yesterday's plans today will pay the price tomorrow.
