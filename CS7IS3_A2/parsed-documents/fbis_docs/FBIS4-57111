ERP Deputy Juan Ramon Medrano dismissed the decision by the FMLN leaders, saying it has no legal validity. [Begin recording] [Medrano] We deplore the decision. Talk of suspensions amounts to talking of expulsion. [Reporter Mario Jovel] According to Juan Ramon Medrano, the decision by the Communist Party of El Salvador [PCES], PRCT [Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers], and the FPL [Farabundo Marti Popular Liberation Forces] lacks validity because it was made without the total consensus of the FMLN. The ERP members said they did not attend Monday's extraordinary assembly because the sole purpose was to put them on trial. [Medrano] We call on the other side to not throw a tantrum, literally, and to not put us on trial and tell us that they are going to punish us for having political differences. Instead, they should realize the political reality is different. The war ended a few years ago. Society now needs people with a capacity for understanding. [Jovel] Medrano indicated there is no unity pact in the FMLN because it ended with the war, and, therefore, now there is a need for a new understanding. [Medrano] An alliance pact has become necessary since the agreements were signed because, since then, we have permanently and consistently had these two-against-three divisions. [Jovel] In the opinion of this organization, it is up to the other forces within the FMLN to decide whether they will retain a party in which the Marxist-Leninist vertical command structure prevails, which for the EPR is no longer valid, or whether they will make an alliance in which there is respect for the democratic principles of all the factions. [end recording] The National Resistance [RN], another of the groups affected by the FMLN decision, said the suspension of eight leaders from the FMLN Political Commission will heighten the internal crisis of that leftist party. According to Eduardo Sancho, RN secretary general and former guerrilla, the measure eschews internal debate in the FMLN and limits democratic maneuvering room to redefine the party's role. [Begin recording] [Reporter Julian Melendez] The FMLN internal debate went beyond the limits of tolerance. On Monday, 9 May, Eduardo Sancho, one of the FMLN deputies accused of treason for taking the post of secretary of the Legislative Assembly's Board of Directors, opposed the decision by the FPL, PCES, and PRCT to suspend him and six [as heard] other deputies from the party leadership. [Sancho] The suspension lacks any legal or political validity. We will continue serving as deputies and members of the Board of Directors. I believe the FMLN has fallen under the control of a very conservative view. [Melendez] Hours earlier, Sancho, accompanied by RN leaders, said the FMLN problems are based on its lack of identity, but never on disciplinary aspects. In the former guerrilla's opinion, what is at stake is the democratization of the FMLN. [Sancho] I believe this is not the way to democratize a country. A country is not democratized with those kinds disciplinary measures. That is no the way to teach a people who must get ready for big debates on the nation's problems. [Melendez] The splintering within the FMLN grows every day, but nobody wants to emerge from the crisis as a loser. The five leftist parties are betting that they will maintain the representation of the party. [end recording]
