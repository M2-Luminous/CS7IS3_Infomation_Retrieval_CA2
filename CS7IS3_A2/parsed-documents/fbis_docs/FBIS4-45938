In an address at the opening session of the Army Commanders' Conference here, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao said that non-proliferation measures must be universal and non-discriminate and should include a specific time-frame. This statement to senior Defence personnel assumes significance in the context of the U.S. pressure on India to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Mr Rao said that India had always advocated peaceful use of nuclear energy and continued to believe that non-proliferation measures should not be selective in their application. Speaking on allegations of human rights violations, the Prime Minister said that India's concern for the maintenance of human rights was second to none. He claimed that those who tried to extract capital out of this issue should cease what he called their futile attempts to malign Indian security forces. "It would amount to an insult to the concept of human rights to distort and misuse it for political exploitation and slanderous propaganda," he said. He added that of late, there had been a better understanding of India's performance and that some success had been attained in dispelling the motivated campaign against the forces. The Pakistan-sponsored low intensity conflict in Kashmir was a major challenge to the nation, Mr Rao said.
