Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet is expected to discuss his country's stand during his meeting with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai when the Thai leader visits Hanoi from March 16 to 19, said Hoang Trong Quang, permanent secretary of the Vietnam National Mekong Committee in an interview with THE NATION. Hoang Trong Quang, who stressed he was speaking in a private capacity, said if Thailand does not agree to Hanoi's requirements there will be no agreement at all. "In that case, Vietnam is prepared to leave the committee," he said. "We need the committee but it must fulfill its function. If it has no right to make any decision (it is a) committee for what," he said. Quang said he wanted the Mekong Committee, which comprises Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, to have a ruling say in any project that may have negative repercussions on other riverine states. The current round of talks on a framework for the committee, which have dragged on for two years, appeared close to a conclusion in December after a year marked by squabbling between Thailand and Vietnam. But negotiations broke down again in January because of differences between the two countries. Vietnam reportedly refused to endorse previously agreed points in the 42-Article framework accord on the sustainable use of water resources at a meeting of the technical drafting working group in Vientiane. Quang said the earlier negotiations had yet to settle the contentious question of diversion of water from, the mainstream and tributaries during the dry season, and two points in the four-point Article Five dealing with the reasonable and equitable utilization of water. The National Mekong Committee's chief said Vietnam has accepted these clauses but wanted the issue of dry season diversions to be agreed upon by all the riparian states. The Vietnamese chief delegate said the Thai delegation did not agree to this at the Vientiane round of talks. "Vietnam has no intention to place any preconditions but we do not want any use of the waters causing harm to the other riparian states," he said. The secretary said Vietnam had not raised objections to water projects in Thailand, in particular the Kok-Ing-Nan project which will draw water from the Kok River, a tributary of the Mekong, and channel it via an underground canal to the Chao Phraya River. Quang said Vietnam only brought up the project during the Vientiane meeting for comment. "So far we have no official information about that project," he said. He said his country has legitimate concerns over the impact of such projects on the lower reaches of the four-million-hectare Mekong Delta, which is in danger of drying up unless controls are implemented over the quantity of water in the mainstream river. In contrast to the earlier rounds of negotiation, Quang said Vietnam has adopted a more flexible stand in regard to the diversion clause. "It means that the upstream cannot change the flow regime along the river," he said. In a separate interview at the Bangkok-based Mekong Secretariat, officials said the current mandate of the drafting working group has expired and Vietnam must call for a renewed mandate from the United Nations Development Programme which is the main financier of the Mekong Committee's projects. Under an agreement reached by the committee in Hanoi last February, the drafting working group was given until last October to conclude the drafting process. "Thailand has given considerable concessions with regards to national sovereignty. They agreed to notify the committee before using water from the tributaries during the wet season and to prior consultations during the dry season, according to one official who asked not to be named.
