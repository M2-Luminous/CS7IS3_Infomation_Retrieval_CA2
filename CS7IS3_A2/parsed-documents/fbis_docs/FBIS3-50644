The communique is signed by Monsignor Ramon Godinez Flores, auxiliary bishop of Guadalajara and secretary general of Mexico's Bishop conference and, therefore, official spokesman of the Mexican Catholic Church. In the communique, Flores stated that the Bishops Conference called for respectful and truthful dialogue between both parties; in addition, he stated that dialogue is necessary, adding that those who assumed arms must be heard, because they have been unheard for a long time. The most important part of this one-and-a-half page communique reads: What must we do? First of all, we must hear the clamor of these brothers and many more Mexicans, some of whom have assumed arms, others who are taking refuge in not participating in the elections, as well as others who are desperate over not finding solutions to the crises we are facing. This is like a voice of God; we must all hear and know how to interpret it. Flores also added in his communique: Those who have authority must be attentive to discover the sense of these voices and not try to repress them violently. These are voices of anguish and desperation. The very peasants who assumed arms have said this is not a war to destroy, rather, to build a better fatherland. Commenting on this situation, Flores, as official spokesman of the Mexican Bishops Conference, said: [Begin recording] [Flores] These are incidents that must be dealt with carefully. They cannot simply be interpreted as a confrontation between one army against another or for a political change. They are requesting that their just demands be met, and they themselves must be a part of this to overcome these difficulties. They cannot just wait until their difficulties are solved; they must act to overcome their crises. [end recording] The church representative explained later that Christians must pray so that God will give us a peaceful heart and we may act with prudence and wisdom in these difficult times. He said: This will permit us to build peace based on justice, making the plan of God--who gave us the resources of nature to benefit all and not a few--a reality. This is the most important part of the official communique by the Mexican Bishops Conference on the events in Chiapas, issued on 4 January 1994.
