In a society with rapid economic growth and tight economic relationships, we must enhance the strength of reform. We must not cease development to work on reform. Without effective macroeconomic regulation and control, there will not be a mature market economy. Since the latter half of last year, the Chinese economy has exhibited the "three high" phenomena -- a high economic growth rate, high investment growth rate, and high commodity price increase rate. In light of the conflicts and problems occuring in China's economic life, the central government assessed the situation and made some timely policy decisions on macroeconomic regulation and control. How are the prospects and effectiveness of the strengthened macroeconomic regulations and controls? How should the current and future conflicts and problems in China's economic life be resolved? With these questions in mind, this reporter visited famous economist and National People's Congress Member Professor Liu Guoguang in October. The Prospects for Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Look Good; Inflation Warrants Alarm Liu Guoguang believes that the series of macroeconomic regulations and controls adopted by the central government to resolve previously existing and newly occuring problems in China's economic life will soon show results. The excessively high production rate fell for three straight months in July, August, and September. In September, it fell to 19.1 percent. The market peaks are tending towards stabilization, the finance situation has improved, and the rate of funding available for major construction has increased from 19 percent at the end of June to 70 percent. There have been no "IOUs" issued for the purchase of farm products, personal savings have increased again, the revenue growth rate has risen, and exports have grown. These achievements have gradually alleviated some people's anxieties. A growing number of people have come to understand that macroeconomic regulation and control is not overall retrenchment but the reality of structural readjustment. This set of macroeconomic regulations and controls has been called a "soft attack." It mainly uses economic methods to scale back in a planned way the excessive investment which overloaded the national ability, as well as to rectify the chaotic finance order, suppress serious inflation, and resolve the conflicts and problems of the process of rapid economic growth. It does this while avoiding the great economic losses of applying "emergency brakes." Liu Guoguang feels that the establishment of a socialist market economy requires effective macroeconomic regulation and control. Becoming a market economy does not mean a completely free, laissez-faire approach. Without effective macroeconomic regulation and control, there cannot be a mature market economy. He said that even in a normal market economy, the government has to intervene in markets which have deficiencies. This is even more true for China during a period of structural transition, when some unpredictable problems will undoubtedly occur. It appears that there are many vacuums during this process of transition, and these would not exist during the original accumulation phase in the early development of market economies. At that time, the problems of a planned economy making a transition to a market economy did not exist. If a laissez-faire approach were used now, allowing the market to function spontaneously, the problems would be even more severe. Liu Guoguang said the main purpose of macroeconomic regulation and control is to use economic methods to solve the conflicts and problems in the process of rapid economic growth and thus create an atmosphere conducive to reform. Many people still have doubts about whether macroeconomic regulation and control will work and whether the "soft attack" will succeed. Liu Guoguang's view on the prospects for macroeconomic regulation and control is that the first possibility is that the various measures of macroeconomic regulation and control will work quickly and be manipulated with an appropriate degree of tightness and suitable timing. Thus, the economy would be able to maintain a certain vitality and appropriate growth rate but also avoid the serious consequences of exacerbated inflation. In this way, the annual GNP growth rate for this year would reach 13 to 13.5 percent and next year's GNP growth rate would fall to about 10 percent. Inflation would be kept below two figures. The second possibility is that fear of excessively rapid commodity price increases will cause continued retrenchment, resulting in economic shrinkage and the prevention of economic restructuring. This would make it impossible to implement several major reform measures due to a restrictive environment. The third possibility is that excessive relaxation in confused reaction to the finance shortfall will result in the premature abandonment of macroeconomic regulations and controls which were just begining to be effective and thus cause even more severe economic overheating and inflation. Liu Guoguang emphasized that the latter two scenarios must be avoided. He said this set of macroeconomic regulation and control measures can achieve the first scenario predicted because the problems were recognized early and the measures adopted were effective and timely. In looking at the current situation, however, the progress on inflation may regress due to the need to maintain a certain economic growth rate in support of production. Liu Guoguang predicts that if there are no sudden developments, there will not be a repeat of 1988's panic buying sprees, but the danger of inflation cannot be ignored. He said that the retail price index last year rose 5.4 percent but in 35 large and middle-sized cities it rose 10.9 percent. The increase in currency circulation this year pushed prices higher. The June retail price index in 35 large and middle-sized cities rose more than 20 percent. The accumulated inflationary pressure over the past few years has begun to take effect. Experience proves that when measures are not taken to curtail inflation over two digits, the inflation will be exacerbated. When it is over 10 percent, all groups in society will take steps to protect themselves. Macroeconomic regulation and control is an art. If it is done well, there is a certain pace and relatively stable inflation. He said that as long as the real income growth rate of fixed income earners is greater than the rate of inflation, and actual savings interests rates are appropriate, it will guarantee that labor accumulation will not be reduced to naught after inflation. Under these conditions, he would not oppose the use of mild inflation to stimulate economic growth. Negative interest rates, however, must not be used to support the development of inefficient industries. Liu Guoguang emphasized that during the structural transition period, effective macroeconomic regulation and control can create an environment conducive to reform. But care must be taken that the macroeconomic regulation and control uses reform methods and economic techniques as much as possible. Administrative techniques should not be used to intervene in problems which can be solved with market mechanisms or indirect control techniques. Practice has proven that the old structure cannot carry out sustained rapid economic development and cannot resolve the conflicts and problems which arise amidst rapid movement. We must learn how to strengthen the potency of reform in an environment with rapid economic development and tightly stretched economic relationships. We cannot halt development in order to carry out reform. Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Continues to Move Forward; Strengthened Reform Is the Basic Approach Liu Guoguang feels that the current progress made by macroeconomic regulation and control still falls short of the expectations of society and of the central government, particularly in areas such as guaranteeing agricultural production, raising peasant income, guaranteeing working capital for efficient large and middle-sized enterprises, and centralized funding guarantees for major basic construction projects. These areas still need much work. In essence, one can say that these conflicts and problems have arisen because the defects of the old system have not yet been completely overcome and the new system is still not completely formed. Therefore, the way to resolve these conflicts and problems is to strengthen reform and establish a socialist market economy structure. He said that the market has moved towards reform during the last ten years or so and, as we enter the 90's, the reforms have changed in nature so that the task of reform is now to carry out a comprehensive and basic transformation of the entire economic structure to establish a socialist market economy structure. Reform must be extensive in all areas of economic life at both the macroeconomic and microeconomic levels. Therefore, to resolve the deep underlying conflicts and problems in China's current economic life and to perfect macroeconomic regulation and control, we must not delay in pursuing a finance structure, a tax revenue structure, a foreign trade and foreign currency structure, an investment structure, a social guarantee system, a public functionary system and other important reforms. He said the main thrust of the finance structure reform is to strengthen the regulation and control function of the central bank and to make the People's Bank of China into a true central bank. A polcy-making bank must be established to carry out the separation of policy finance and commercial finance, and specialized banks should become true commercial banks. The direction of the tax revenue structure reform is to promote a divided tax system to rationalize the relative distribution between the central government and local governments and reform the distribution of profits between the state and state-owned enterprises. The reform of the investment structure is to divide construction projects into competitive commercial projects, basic production projects and public service projects and also to redetermine funding sources and change funding methods. It should also promote a responsibility system for project managers and reform the initiation and assessment procedures for projects. The thrust of reform in foreign trade is to adopt various measures to conform to GATT standards. Liu Guoguang emphasized that reform is a complicated piece of systems engineering, and the reforms listed above cannot be accomplished overnight. The attainment of many of the reform goals is not a simple process. The specific implementation of many reforms still requires much detailed research and the identification of specific measures. The most difficult and the most important aspects of establishing a new structure and carrying out various reforms are the reform of state-owned enterprises and the transformation of operation mechanisms. It will be a long process. Enterprise reform still needs to go through pilot project testing and gradual implementation. We cannot promote a corporate system and implement a modern enterprise system all at once. There are also many problems in the process of corporatizing which will require research to solve. Finally, Liu called for the immediate implementation of the "Corporation Law" which stipulates the standards for corporate norms and corporate behavior, to allow the reform of state-owned enterprises to continue to progress. This will provide an underlying foundation for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure.
