FBIS4-31018 "dreeu106__a94030" FBIS-EEU-94-106-A Daily Report 31 May 1994 ANNEX Romania MPR Leader Denies Romanian Holocaust Occurred MPR Leader Denies Romanian Holocaust Occurred AU0106122594 Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1631 GMT 31 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0106122594 Bucharest ROMPRES English BFN [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Marian Munteanu, head of the Movement for Romania [MPR], presented to a news conference on 31 May a document, dated 20 December 1993, issued by the Association for the Redemption of the Rights and Properties of the Jews of Romanian Extraction. According to Marian Munteanu, the document had been advanced to the government and Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu. He claimed that meetings had taken place on the issue of Holocaust in Romania. In the presented document, the Association demands from the Romanian state the restitution of the material assets possessed by the former Romanian citizens of Jewish origin and assumption by the Romanian state of responsibility for the killing of 400,000 Jews during the Second World War, by the "Romanian fascist" regime. Marian Munteanu thinks the claims are not justified, since "there was no fascist state and no Holocaust in Romania" and the figure of 400,000 is "a simple mistake caused by insufficient knowledge of historic reality." The Movement for Romania, a non-parliamentary party, considers that the victims of repression and violence in Romania were Romanians and by no means the national minorities. A commitment by the state's current rulers to what the Jewish organizations claim might lead to Romania's economic enslaving, forcing the Romanian people to pay tens of billions of dollars in damages and retrocession of real estate and enterprises, Marian Munteanu said. He hoped Romania's president would deny the claims of the Association for Redemption of the Rights and Properties of the Jews of Romanian Extraction.
