The law should also make regulatory measures more effective in relation to citizens from countries with which the Czech Republic has an agreement waiving the visa requirement, he said. The inter-departmental commission is to be composed of representatives from the ministries of the interior, foreign affairs, and the economy. Ruml said some 100,000 foreigners have long term residence in the Czech Republic. Stricter requirements are under preparation which will lead to only those who have a genuine interest in working or studying in the Czech Republic being granted residence permission, he said. Legislation is also being prepared whereby a Czech citizen who invites a foreigner who later undertakes criminal activity will have to pay the cost of his expulsion. Ruml said he expected the bill to find support among members of parliament. The commission will also consider raising the charges related to the invitation of a foreigner. In Slovakia, Ruml pointed out, the charges have already risen to 1,000 crowns (about $30).
