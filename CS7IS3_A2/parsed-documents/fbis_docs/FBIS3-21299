Rounds of talks between the sides have been accompanied by angry demonstrations by workers and, at times, by outbreaks of violence in which employees vented their rage on factory machinery and management offices. The moment of truth, however, has arrived--and IAI's recovery plan, which was submitted yesterday for the government's approval, is going into effect. In practical terms, the plan means dismissal of 2,900 workers at a cost to the government of more than $400 million. The workers' committees, as well as the Histadrut, have now given their consent to the plan, a "verdict" that some of those subject to dismissal do not accept. Not in vain did candidates for layoffs recently hold a number of demonstrations against members of the committees, but it seems that everyone has become reconciled to the need for dismissals to give IAI's recovery plan a chance. The recovery plan was hammered out jointly by the government, IAI's management, the Histadrut, and the workers themselves. It went into effect with the Histadrut's signing of the agreement last weekend. The key clauses of the plan provide for worker layoffs with limited compensation to be paid by Mavtakhim, the Histadrut's insurance company. As if the sweeping dismissals were not enough, the workers have stated their willingness to take pay cuts of 15 percent by giving up the salary raises and cost of living increases that every Israeli employee is to receive this year. Another clause, which is considered essential to the recovery plan, grants IAI's management greater authority to transfer workers according to production needs among the various factories as they arise. This employee transfer clause was one of the main sticking points during the contacts and negotiations between the sides. People are now wondering whether the plan will save Israel's aircraft industry or give it some breathing room in the continuing world crisis that is putting red ink on the account books of most of the world's aircraft corporations. The threat presented by the crisis still hangs over IAI's skies. The industry's good times lie in the past; those days, when more than 24,000 workers were employed, will not return. The workers, too, know that; that is why they are willing to give up some of their take-home pay. More than a few of the workers who were destined to receive pink slips have already left the country, many of settling in South Africa or America's Silicon Valley. Others, who still have years to go before they can leave on pension, have taken early retirement on the promise of modest compensation. Yet there exists among the workers laid-off a segment that does not want to accept the judgment; it is a good bet that the "workshop quiet" will be shattered. As a general matter, however, the recovery plan for this major industry is becoming a concrete fact on the hope that IAI will learn to get back on its feet, and even open its doors to new markets, or adopt modern work techniques with new market shares both here and abroad. The success of IAI's recovery plan is of major importance for other Israeli businesses, including the military industry, that have sunk into crisis. As the upheaval in them persists, more than a few of those leading the fight for employees seek to rely on facets of IAI's recovery plan. Even so, the government has poured in more than 800 million shekels in recent months, to make possible the dismissals of close to 2,500 workers even within such a framework. Now it is arranging for the release of still another 300 workers and even the shutdown of an additional two or three "unprofitable" installations. There is concern at military plants, too, over an unclear future. In the past, Israel could take real pride in its military factories, which employed more than 18,000 workers; today, that number is estimated at just 5,000. The military recovery plan also included testing production lines for the civilian market as well as shifting plants in the center of the country to regions of the Negev. That idea made sense, because the explosions occurring in those installations endangered residential areas; the compensation that had to be paid for damages to homes and businesses could have sped up the transition to the Negev. Finance Minister Avraham "Beiga" Shohat now insists that these plants must not be moved because the costs involved amount to more than 300 million shekels. Overall, production cutbacks in military plants are placing their economic future in doubt. A business such as Rafa'el, which is in a crisis, also raises grave concerns regarding Israel's future security because of further reductions in arms production. It looks like the government will not be able to evade this problem; it will soon have to give its attention to the future of these installations, perhaps on the basis of IAI's recovery plan.
