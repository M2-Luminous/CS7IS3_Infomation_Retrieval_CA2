In the Pavlovskis words, the program should provide clearer conditions and terms for the entrance of the states, signatories to the program, into the NATO. Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup, who visited Riga earlier this week, already pledged Pavlovskis to do everything he could to amend the program, Pavlovskis said. "My personal opinion is that Lithuania's application for the NATO membership was premature," Pavlovskis said. It prompted Russia to air its (negative) stance on the acceptance of the Central European countries to this organization with a pretext that the move could undermine the European security, the minister said. Pavlovskis prognosticated that Western politicians would heed to Russia's anxiety in fear of the destabilization of the situation in Russia itself. Subsequently, the Western leaders may refuse to amend the Partnership for Peace, said Pavlovskis. He also said he hoped his prognosis would not come true. The East European security problems could be tackled much easier if "Europe guaranteed our security." Then, Eastern Europe could focus its efforts on the development of economy and democracy. Besides, the entrance to the NATO is very costly because the member states need good armament and equipment. It would also be more advantageous for the NATO to grant the East European countries some security guarantees than to enroll new members. The motion would even benefit Russia by stabilizing the situation in its neighboring states.
