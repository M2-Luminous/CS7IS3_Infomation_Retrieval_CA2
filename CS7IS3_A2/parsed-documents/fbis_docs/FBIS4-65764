It is a national problem about which the Turkish nation is very sensitive. To portray Rauf Denktas as intransigent or as the party that is preventing an agreement would be tantamount to working for the Greek Cypriots. It is the Greek Cypriots who do not want a solution. It is the Greek Cypriots who had Butrus-Ghali puncture the package, eliminate the rights granted the Turkish Cypriots, and accord more gains to the Greek Cypriots. The aim is to portray Denktas and the Turkish Cypriot side as the guilty party, and thus pave the way for the Greek Cypriot Administration to join the European Union [EU]. The aim is not to solve the problem through a balanced and mutual give-and-take, but to ensure that the negotiations fail and blame the Turkish Cypriot side for it. In fact, the confidence-building measures are a trap that is leading Cyprus toward enosis step-by-step and toward the implementation of the salami tactic in favor of the Greek Cypriots. It is time for Turkey to set its Cyprus policy. The best policy is to maintain the legal and practical existence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] and to assist in securing its recognition by other countries. The Cyprus problem was resolved with the 1974 peace operation. The West's calculations regarding a return to the pre-1974 era do not concern us. Let them try it if they can. The fact that the $60 million in economic aid Turkey extends to the TRNC every year was not delivered this year is being interpreted as a move to pressure the TRNC. It is a significant shortcoming that Turkey has not met the power and water needs of the TRNC since 1974. Electrical power still comes from the Greek Cypriot side. Addressing a panel meeting on the economic relations between Turkey and the TRNC, organized by the Turkish Businessmen and Administrators Fund, Rauf Denktas said that his feelings were hurt by Turkey, that the past 20 years were wasted, and that a deep-rooted dialogue was not formed between Turkey and the TRNC during all those years. He said: "The TRNC is a separate country, but we have a common religion, language, and ancestry. The interests of the two countries are the same as the interests of the 60 million Turks. The Greek Cypriots always see the Turkish Cypriots as a disintegrating community. Despite all the negative stands, however, including the attitude of Turkey, we have fought the difficulties and we have not collapsed. We could have been in a much better position today. We could have undertaken joint tourism investments with Turkey during the past 20 years. The existing facilities in the TRNC could have been exploited better through joint tourism projects. Small- and medium-size industries could have been set up. The TRNC's economy could have supported Turkey abd not been a burden to it. It is not too late now...." Unfortunately, with pressure from the EU, Turkey is implementing a sort of economic embargo on the TRNC. For some reason, the TRNC- Turkey customs union agreement could not be concluded during the past two years. TRNC citizens are not allowed to set up companies or trade in Turkey. Turkey does not conduct with the Turkish Cypriots the commercial cooperation it has with the Greek Cypriots. Turkey even refuses to recognize the TRNC's sovereignty rights in the sea. The status of the TRNC is always unclear during the UN debates on Cyprus. The Turkish Republic does not recognize the TRNC as a fully independent state. Turkey is not helping the TRNC economy, which is tied to its own economy, stand on its own two feet. Turkey's cool attitude toward the TRNC upsets the balance in favor of the Greek Cypriots.
