At a precisely designated hour on 4 March deputies of the state duma -- communist Krasnitskiy and liberal democrat Yegorov, who had completed the ceremonious act of submitting sensational documents to legal protection organs, appeared before television cameras at the entrance to the city office of the public prosecutor. The essence of the compromising materials was as follows: the chairman of the Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK [State Television and Radio Company], Bella Kurkova, gave a large discount to the closed joint-stock company, "Kommercheskiy Tsentr TV i Radio Sankt-Peterburga" [Commercial Center for St Petersburg TV and Radio] in exchange for financial aid rendered by the aforementioned firm to Kurkova's husband, Vadim Tareyev, publisher of the newspaper NEVSKIY GLASHATAY. He was allegedly given 12 million rubles in cash. The general director of the firm, V. Mikhaylov, informed the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] deputy to the state duma, V. Marychev, of this two days prior to the aforementioned ceremony. Events occurred in the following manner. Some time ago, Mikhail Syroyezhin, deputy chairman for commercial questions of Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK, did make a proposal regarding sponsorship to the newspaper NEVSKIY GLASHATAY. The corresponding contract was signed on 16 February by Mikhaylov and Tareyev. Incidentally, the document cites 15 February 1994 as its expiration date. The document was obviously prepared in such haste that not a single signatory found time to read the typed text with the typographical error. The one-year agreement concerning joint advertising operations with Mikhaylov's firm was signed on 23 February by Siroyezhin. While having the right to decide such questions unilaterally, he nevertheless brought the document to Kurkova, who also signed it the following day. The contract concerned 120 minutes per month of advertising on St Petersburg television and a 35-percent discount on the total cost of materials placed. On 22 February Mikhaylov gave Tareyev 12 million rubles -- the first sponsor contribution. He explained that he borrowed this money from his friend Nikita Arkhipov, who not long before the events being described was invited by Syroyezhin to be director of the joint commercial center of St Petersburg TV. Thus, he said, accept the cash. This is how Mikhaylov portrays events in his report of Mr. Marychev. Actually things went a little differently. Syroyezhin gave the money to Tareyev, and not on 22 February but on 25 February, Friday. Few people paid attention to this discrepancy in dates, and as we will see further, that was a mistake. One must be a very naive person and not understand anything about commerce to take 12 million rubles in a plastic bag without witnesses, without even looking at the bills (what if they were counterfeit), carry them through town to the editorial offices and lock them in a safe because the work day was over and all banks were already closed. The editor of NEVSKIY GLASHATAY is precisely this kind of person. This was confirmed unanimously by people who have known him for a while. Bella Kurkova insists that she learned about the sponsorship contract with NEVSKIY GLASHATAY only when the scandal broke. But these are words which, as we know, do not correspond to the facts. The financial and commercial affairs of Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK are being examined by a management control commission of the president's administration, sent from Moscow today. Incidentally, this type of examination had been planned, but the fuss surrounding St Petersburg's TV accelerated the disembarkation on the banks of the Neva of a landing party of inspectors from the capital. They should have at the same time questioned some participants in this story in order to receive first-hand information. But here some curious circumstances arise. Mikhaylov has disappeared. Moreover, his firm is nowhere to be found. The Petrograd District administration cannot confirm that his commercial structure was registered -- there is no data about it in the computer. It is unknown where, by whom and when Mr. Mikhaylov's enterprise was registered. There is more. Three days before the transfer of the 12 million to the NEVSKIY GLASHATAY, Arkhipov, the director of the OKTs [Joint Commercial Center] of St Petersburg TV was fired unexpectedly. Telephone calls to his home reveal that he is somewhere abroad and it is not clear when he will return. Finally, Kurkova's deputy, Syroyezhin, who handed her husband the money on Friday, 25 February, went to Moscow on business on 28 February and has also disappeared. Several days prior to his departure he attempted to obtain a visa to the U.S. through the international division of the Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK for his wife, who worked for him at the television station. He was unsuccessful in obtaining the visa, but Siroyezhin's wife disappeared from the city, and from that time no one in St Petersburg has seen him either. It is true that two people at least heard from him. Bella Kurkova, who categorically refuses to comment to SMI [mass media], nevertheless submitted a number of documents to ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. A business note by V. Nechayev, director of the joint information service of Peterburg-5y Kanal, states: "On 2 March at about 8 p.m. I received a call from M. Syroyezhin, who told me that he was calling from Moscow, that he had been involved in an incident, that he had been attacked, that it had been said he was in `shock' and was in the hospital to recover. `If anyone organized this, it was someone from Most Bank,' said M. Syroyezhin. It's too bad B. Kurkova is quarreling with Most Bank (let me remind you that in one of the broadcasts, entitled `On the Political Olympus,' which aired on RTV [Russian TV] following the well-known October events, eyewitnesses told Kurkova that the thugs bypassed the floors occupied by this commercial structure). Nevzorov was also discussed, and M. Syroyezhin said that Nevzorov also has his sights on St Petersburg television." From the work notes of S. Karatayev, director of the international service of Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK: "On the evening of 10 March M. I. Syroyezhin called me and said that he was in Austria and in the hospital because of liver damage. In Moscow a gang of people unknown to him had attacked and beaten him, taking the documents that he carried. After this, being in shock from his injuries, he travelled to Austria, where he learned that an abnormal situation had developed surrounding his name. He told me that he would like to return to work at the TV station but that first he would have to know exactly what he was being blamed for. He asked me to talk to B. Kurkova so that she would explain everything about the guilt of M. Syroyezhin. He reported that very high authorities about whom we do not know are interested in firing Kurkova, and that he is a `small' person who wants a normal and quiet life." Mr. Syroyezhin has not yet appeared on the banks of the Neva. The company's management has turned to the Federal Counterintelligence Service and the St Petersburg and oblast GUVD [Main Administration for Internal Affairs] with a request to take measures to find him. All of this is like a bad dream. We have the feeling we have already seen it before. Yes, of course, the "white house," the vice president with compromising briefcases, the secret disappearance of Yakubovskiy...It looks like an old scenario was suitable for this time too. It is true that it is a play on a different scale and on a different stage. This point of view is shared by Aleksandr Semikolennyy, the director of the group of inspectors from the president's administration. In a conversation with me, without anticipating the results of the investigation, which in all likelihood will not conclude earlier than next week, he called the Channel 5 scandal a preplanned political provocation. In his opinion, no criminality regarding advertising discounts will be upheld, because this is practiced on domestic TV right and left. The television company should just have been more selective in choosing partners for cooperation in the commercial arena. B. Kurkova says that Mikhail Syroyezhin's appearance on television did not arouse the slightest bit of suspicion in the company's administration, since he had a fair reputation in business circles. In additio,n he is the son of the deceased Ivan Syroyezhin, well-known in our country and abroad as a scientist-economist who participated actively in Leningrad TV programs. These are the main participants and perpetrators of the scandal, which naturally has an underlying political basis. There was no point to Mr. Marychev's assurances at a recent Moscow press conference on the Channel 5 situation that the actions of the duma deputies have the completely beneficial purpose of fighting corruption. To a person who knows the habits of the representative of St Petersburg's liberal democrats in the state duma it is very difficult to believe in the sincerity of such pronouncements. Recently, for example, he wished to appear on television in order to campaign for the LDPR before elections to the city assembly. Having received a negative reply for the reason that not a single one of the 16 election blocks will have this opportunity during the pre-election campaign, Marychev declared that Kurkova should not forget about the empty rooms in Lefortovo prison. Simultaneously with the heated scandal, Nevzorov restated his demand to put "600 Seconds" back on the air. On the initiative of the city office of the public prosecutor, his work was subject to expert analysis in the Russian Academy of Sciences, where Nevzorov himself is an honorary member. The academicians found no evidence in his program of calls toward violent action, of fascist propaganda or of other illegalities. On this basis Nevzorov demanded to be put on the air and people carrying red flags and portraits of Stalin moved toward the television station. However, all of this is just surface scandal. There are other facts that are hardly known to most people. On 25 February (the day of the transfer of money to Kurkova's husband and the eve of the mysterious disappearance of Syroyezhin) a fax arrived at Chapygina 6 from the director of the Arkhangelsk Joint Radio and Television Transmission Center with a request to give communications workers the right to broadcast in exchange for canceling all debts of Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK. After this, similar dispatches arrived from Kaluga, Ulyanovsk, Yekaterinburg, Yaroslavl, Zlatoust, Belgorod, Rybinsk and Tula. All of them stated the same thing, as if they were xeroxed copies of each other. B. Kurkova feels that the scandalously blank television screens in Russia this winter were not the result of a strike by communications workers, but a demonstration of the power of big money, of the intentions of powerful commercial structures to buy government television. If Ostankino and RTV are not accessible to some today, they can try to get the third largest state television company, that of St Petersburg, the programs of which are transmitted by 300 transmitters to 80 million people. Considering the fact that presidential elections are not far off, someone is already examining the situation and pulling the strings. Who? I do not have the answer to this question. B. Kurkova says that she knows the names of people who will attest that Mikhail Syroyezhin has certain ties with many representatives of the party's "armed detachment," which is very displeased with the changes in the country. Mikhail Molostvov, deputy of the state duma from Saint Petersburg, and writers Daniil Granin, Aleksandr Volodin, Yakov Gordin, Nina Katerli and Boris Strugatrskiy have sent an open letter to the RF president, in which they ask him to turn his attention to the Channel 5 situation and to have the Russian General Office of the Public Prosecutor take this matter under strictest control. I feel there is an urgent need to do this.
