Andres Pastrana has issued a message to farmers during Agriculture Day along with the four-point program he plans to implement. The program includes the identification of priorities in the agriculture sector, emergency policies to deal with the top problems, and "the giving of resources and delegation of concrete responsibilities so that the rural area can once again have owners." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 6 Jun 94 p 6a) During his first tour after the 28 May elections, Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper has visited the coastal area and proposed new measures to mitigate the economic situation in the border and rural areas. He has said his proposal for the border area included "the extension of the value-added tax, tax exemptions for new industries, and the renegotiation of commercial debts." Pastrana has also reported several liberal leaders in Santa Fe de Bogota, Cauca, Tolima, and Narino have offered him their support.

In his speech, he called on the government to make another readjustment in the price of the 125-kg sack of coffee and set it at 150,000 pesos. He said he was not satisfied with the recent readjustment, "because the international price is currently between $1.50 to $1.60 per pound, and the coffee producer is getting approximately 82 cents; that is, half the price of a pound of coffee." In Caldas, Samper talked about the peace talks, saying "I will clearly establish the negotiations agenda. I promise I will respect human rights during my administration, will not allow paramilitary activities, and will also ask the guerrillas to comply with the commitments to respect human rights." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 6 Jun 94 p 6a) Led by Antonio Navarro Wolff, the 19 April Movement Democratic Alliance assembly has decided not to back the conservative or liberal parties in the upcoming runoff elections. Ernesto Samper is seeking votes everywhere and has even accepted the support of extreme rightist General Oscar Maza Marquez. Andres Pastrana is also preparing for the runoff and plans to continue his strategy to strengthen his base of support. Both candidates are trying to obtain the votes of the large number of people who did not vote in the recent election. The national registrar has reported 7 million of 24 million eligible voters are not on the electoral listings and, thus, will be ineligible to vote. He added a new census of the population is necessary to enable all eligible citizens to vote. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 0130 GMT 5 Jun 94)
