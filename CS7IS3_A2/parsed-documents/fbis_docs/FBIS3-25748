According to a report released by Unomoz [UN Operations in Mozambique] today, half the government and Renamo regulars, are already in confinement centers. The United Nations representation is now waiting for demobilization to start on Tuesday [1 March], as scheduled. But Renamo has not yet handed in the list of its soldiers to be demobilized and to avoid delays, UN representative Aldo Ajello is proposing that the government should take the first step. The proposal has been totally rejected. In statements this evening to RDP, the Armed Forces chief of staff recalled that such a measure would infringe the Rome peace agreement: [Begin recording] [General Antonio Hama Thai] That is incorrect, that is not what is contained in the agreement, that is not what we agreed with Renamo. I would like to say this is my personal view -- we did not agree that, we did not sign that, we do not have any problems with Renamo. The agreement does not say that. [Unidentified correspondent] As far as you are concerned, the government should not demobilize before Renamo does so? [Thai] Of course, it has to be simultaneous, that is what is contained in the agreement. Because the agreement, the agreement means that there are signatories. As for this new story telling people to demobilize, it is a bad one. [end recording] That was General Antonio Hama Thai, the Mozambican Army chief of staff. The Mozambican Government rejects a two-speed demobilization.
