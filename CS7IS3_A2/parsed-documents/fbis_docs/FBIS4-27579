Presidents Kim and Yeltsin reaffirmed that North Korea must abide by the inter-Korean agreement on denuclearization and that its nuclear program must be deterred. During the first summit session Wednesday evening, Kim received a Russian promise of participation if the U.N. Security Council decided to impose sanctions on North Korea as a last recourse. Such pledges are reassuring, especially because Russia is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council and can still exert influence on North Korea. The degree of sanctions Russia would support remained unclear, but Moscow's stance will certainly pressure China, which is the last remaining uncertain variable. In a show of growing partnership, Kim and Yeltsin agreed to open a hot line between their offices for around-the-clock consultations on urgent situations including the North Korean nuclear matter. The hot line, reserved previously for close security allies such as Japan and the United States, is symbolic of the transformation in bilateral relations that were once confrontational during the cold war days but are now based on mutual cooperation. President Kim raised the issue of the North Korea-Russia Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, especially the clause in which Russia is obligated to automatically intervene on North Korea's side in case of war. He made clear that any supply of military equipment and technology to North Korea, which has not yet given up hope of national unification by force, is inappropriate. Yeltsin suggested that a line has been drawn in Pyongyang-Moscow relations, explaining diplomatically that the treaty with North Korea is virtually dead in practice. The summit cast light on future bilateral relations, the spirit of which was embodied in the 13-clause joint declaration released after Thursday's summit. The two presidents championed democracy and a market economy as shared values and vowed to build a relationship on these principles. They accented cooperation in trade, science and technology, hoping to wed South Korea's industrial technology and experience in free competition with Russia's advanced science and natural resources. Seoul-Moscow economic relations remain marred by the unrepaid South Korean loan to Russia. But Seoul officials decided to separate this issue from other economic projects and expect it will not get in the way of bilateral trade promotion. Further helping to thrust forward Seoul-Moscow ties, Yeltsin handed over, as promised, Russian documents on the 1950-53 Korean war in a gesture aimed at sweeping away the cold war past when Moscow had aided Pyongyang during the fratricidal clash. Kim has now wound up his summit diplomacy with all four surrounding powers, with each providing confirmation of strong bilateral ties. The summit with Yeltsin was no exception.
