The protests on Monday were concentrated in the western part of Caracas, where groups of students seized at least two mass transit buses and clashed with riot police. It was unofficially reported that the young students, most of them high school students, set one of the vehicles on fire. The disturbance, which spread to five areas west of the Venezuelan capital, is the most serious distubance reported so far in the government of Christian Democratic President Rafael Caldera, who took office last February. The students, between the ages of 16 and 19, were also demanding punishment for those responsible for the murder of a fellow classmate. The student was shot three times by a policeman during the protests that took place in downtown Caracas. On Monday, transportation sector workers went on strike to demand a 50-percent increase in bus fares and to protest the government's delay in the payment of student bus fare subsidies. Similar protests resulted in the deaths of dozens of students during the administrations of social democrat Jaime Lusinchi (1984-89), Carlos Andres Perez (1989-93), and Ramon Velasquez (1993-94).
