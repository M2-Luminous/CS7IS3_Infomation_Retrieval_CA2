The news conference was devoted to international economic cooperation and investments into Russian economy. According to the vice-premier, the International Monetary Fund is practically prepared to grant Russia the second part of a three- billion "system credit." At a session of the board of IMF managers opening in Washington this week preparations will be launched for granting a standard credit worth 4 billion dollars, Shokhin said. In his opinion, an annual session of EBRD managers held in St. Petersburg last week showed a high level of Russia's interaction with Western partners. He pointed out that Russia would like to attract more private investments for the development of the oil and gas sector. The government is prepared to accept such investments on privileged terms, he said. For instance, the value added tax, which caused great concern of foreign and domestic investors, has been practically lifted from foreign investments into Russia, Shokhin said. Until recently, Russian enterprises had to pay a lot of money to the state for equipment it imported from abroad. Now, as soon as the equipment is installed, the whole amount of tax levied on the equipment will be returned. As for the imports of material and monetary means for the formation of the fixed stock, they are exempt from taxes altogether, Shokhin said. The government does not forget potential domestic investors, the vice-premier said. At present, the government is working out a plan of making a bigger number of attractive enterprises available for privatisation after a voucher stage is over than their original number offered for privatisation. On the other hand, stable inflation rates reached by the government will inevitably bring about the reduction of bank interest rates, which is a major condition for encouraging investments into industry, Shokhin said.
