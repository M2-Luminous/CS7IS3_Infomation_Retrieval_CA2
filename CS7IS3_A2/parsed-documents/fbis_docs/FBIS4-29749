They said SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and senior SDP officials also decided to draw up a blueprint of a new government, of which the nation's second-largest political party would be part. Earlier in the day, Murayama said his party will seek a temporary alliance with the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to call for a snap poll if planned realliance talks with the ruling coalition fail. Murayama told a meeting of the party's former Diet members that the SDP should join hands with the LDP to create a temporary cabinet if talks with the minority coalition of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata break down and, consequently, Hata is forced to resign after a no- confidence vote. The LDP, ousted last year after 38 years in power, has pledged to submit a no-confidence motion against the shaky Hata cabinet after the budget bills pass the Diet, expected within a week. If the SDP supports the LDP move, that will clinch the no- confidence vote, leaving Hata with a choice of resigning with his ministers or dissolving the House of Representatives for snap elections. Hata has made clear that he will step down if a no-confidence vote passes the lower house.
