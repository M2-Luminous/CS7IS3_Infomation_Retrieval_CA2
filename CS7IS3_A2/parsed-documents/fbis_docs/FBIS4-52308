In talks at Sakigake headquarters, SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura also explored prospects for a future alliance, the sources said. They said the two party leaders agreed on holding regular consultations between their officials in charge of Diet strategy and policy, as well as the holding of study meetings by parliamentarians. The SDP wants to eventually form a joint parliamentary group with Sakigake to confront the minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the sources said. Sakigake, for its part, is said to be seeking a reconfiguration of the political community by enticing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) rebels to join the prospective alliance. But some Sakigake members remain opposed to an alliance with the SDP because of outstanding differences in policy on such issues as defense and nuclear energy. Sakigake's 15 House of Representatives legislators are defectors from the conservative LDP, which has strongly upheld the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. On Monday, Sakigake and the three-member legislative group Seiun, a breakaway from the Japan New Party, launched a unified 18-member parliamentary group in the lower house. Also on Monday, SDP leader Murayama pledged to cooperate with the LDP, the largest opposition party, against what he called the Hata coalition government's high-handed management of state affairs. The SDP quit the ruling coalition after the coalition's majority forces led by Shinseito moved to create a 130-member parliamentary bloc excluding the SDP. The SDP's walkout left Hata's coalition with a minority in the lower house. Speaking at the opening of a two-day council meeting of the Socialist International in Tokyo, Murayama blasted "a revival of power politics and fascist political forces." He saw a rise in popular expectations of social democratic and liberal forces, saying the day the SDP regains power is fast approaching.
