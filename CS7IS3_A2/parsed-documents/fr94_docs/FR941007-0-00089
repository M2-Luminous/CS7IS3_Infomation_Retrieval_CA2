FR941007-0-00089 FR941007-0-00024 Six comments addressed the notification form in Table 151.26(b)(3)(ii)(A), that contains information to be provided in the initial and follow-up reports. Two of the comments suggested evaluating the sample report format with respect to the information required by the National Response Center (NRC). This would facilitate the timely transfer of information to the NRC when the report is made. The Coast Guard agrees that the information on the form should coordinate with that required by the NRC. The Coast Guard has worked with the NRC to provide consistent reporting requirements. Another comment noted that the information on the form differs slightly from the information required to be reported under 33 CFR 151.15(e). The Coast Guard has determined that this issue warrants further consideration. The reporting requirements in 33 CFR part 151 will be updated to reflect amendments to Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78 in a future rulemaking project. The other two comments pointed out that the sample report format should require an estimate of the volume of oil spilled during the incident. The Coast Guard agrees that there should be a place on the form to give brief details of the pollution incident; this would include an estimate of the quantity of cargo lost. Block ``RR'' of Table 151.26(b)(3)(ii)(A) already provides a place for this information to be recorded. Another comment notes that a space for the vessel's ``noun name'' be included in the report. The Coast Guard agrees and has already provided block ``AA'' as the location for listing the ship's name, call sign, or flag. Additionally, one comment stated that the incident reports be kept on file with the plan and summarized with each annual letter. The Coast Guard has determined that there is no basis for establishing this requirement. Three comments stated that qualifications on reportable conditions should be replaced with requirements consistent with section 155.1035 of the interim final rule (IFR) for vessel response plans (58 FR 7424; February 5, 1993). They noted that there is no need to add additional qualifiers when either a spill has occurred or there is a threat of a spill. The Coast Guard disagrees and points out that reporting requirements for this rulemaking reflect the MARPOL standard. They are not intended to mirror notification requirements described in ยง155.1035 which were issued under separate legislation. As a result, the notification requirements will remain consistent with Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 as intended. One comment received suggested that a note be added to indicate that (for vessels in U.S. waters) a report made in conformance with 46 CFR 4.04 satisfies the reporting requirements for probable discharges. The Coast Guard disagrees and contends that regulations issued for marine casualties in 46 CFR part 4 were issued under separate legislation and do not require notification to the NRC. This comment also suggests that we modify the information provided by MEPC/CIRC.267 to include the phone number for the NRC. The Coast Guard supports this suggestion and has included the phone number in ยง151.26(b)(3)(iii)(B). One comment contended that rather than merely referring to Protocol I of MARPOL 73/78, that the specific required procedures should be listed. The Coast Guard disagrees, preferring to reference Protocol I of MARPOL which may be amended periodically by the MARPOL Parties. Another comment contended that this rulemaking is redundant with the current requirements of 33 CFR 151.15. This comment wanted it made clear what relationship and impact the proposed regulations have on current regulations in 33 CFR 151. This rule implements the requirements of Regulation 26 of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 and will be added to the existing MARPOL requirements published in 33 CFR 151. The purpose of Regulation 26 is to improve response capabilities by establishing requirements to carry on board an oil pollution emergency plan.
