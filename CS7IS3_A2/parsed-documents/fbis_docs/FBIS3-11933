The estimated production was calculated by the National Supply Company (Conab). The minister said the record harvest will provoke a drop in grains prices, particularly beans, in the next 45 days. Beans were marked as the villain in the FHC2 [Fernando Henrique Cardoso 2] Plan because prices tripled following the creation of the Real Value Unit (URV). Bean prices will "probably drop" again, the minister said. Guazzelli said the high price of beans followed a lack of rain in bean-producing regions like Irece, Bahia. It is now raining in the northeast and the Ministry of Agriculture is anticipating that farmers will harvest 1.3 million tonnes during this period of "partial harvest." This represents a 66-percent increase compared to the same period in 1993. Corn and soybean will help to make the 1993/1994 harvest the best in Brazilian history. The minister said corn production is up by 2.5 million tonnes and soybean by 1.5 million tonnes. Conab figures show rice production is also up by 7.7 percent compared with last year, to 10.6 million tonnes. The current record was set in 1990 when total grains production reached 71.5 million tonnes. The following two harvests fell below 60 million tonnes. Last year production reached 68 million tonnes. The numbers announced yesterday are only estimates, but the minister trusts the figures. "The harvest could even be larger because Conab calculations are very conservative," the minister quipped. He added that the country has the potential for even larger harvests. While farmers produce their rice, beans, corn, and soybean, the government is responsible for ensuring proper storage conditions. Last year Conab withdrew the authorization of several grain stores due to administration irregularities and technical problems. The minister said he does not anticipate any problems because some grain stores that lost their credentials have corrected the problems and again offer their services to Conab. Guazzelli figures he will need $2 billion to guarantee the commercialization of the record harvest.
