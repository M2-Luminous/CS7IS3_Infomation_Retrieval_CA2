This comes after the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) had `unfoundedly and unsubstantiatedly blamed the Serb side, without coming up with any material evidence,' for Friday's mortar attack which killed nine people in a food queue in Sarajevo's Dobrinja suburb, Gen. Milovanovic said. In order to prevent similar moves, the Serb side on Saturday proposed that a joint committee, made up of military experts of the UNPROFOR, the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims, visits the scene of the attack together with the military commanders of the Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and the UNPROFOR. The Muslims immediately refused to allow its experts to go to the scene of the explosion as did UNPROFOR chief-of-staff for Bosnia, General Angus Ramsey, although he had first accepted this proposal, Gen. Milovanovic said. According to him, all this gives much reason to the Serb side to doubt the objectivity and truthfullness of the report on the blast at the Sarajevo market which killed 66 people and wounded close to 200. Gen. Milovanovic recalled that at the eve of all previous major peace talks, the Muslims had orchestrated even the killings of civilians in order to blame the Serbs for everything and cause the internationalization of the war.
