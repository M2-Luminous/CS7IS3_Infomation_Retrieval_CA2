FR940617-0-00003 FR940617-0-00002 5 CFR Part 1209 Practices and Procedures for Appeals and Stay Requests of Personnel Actions Allegedly Based on Whistleblowing AGENCY: Merit Systems Protection Board. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Board is amending its Practices and Procedures for Appeals and Stay Requests of Personnel Actions Allegedly Based on Whistleblowing. This amendment extends the time limit for filing an appeal of an agency action where the appellant first files a request for a stay of that action. This change will bring the filing time in initial whistleblower cases into line with filing times in the Board's appellate jurisdiction cases and will also have the effect of making the Board's appellate processes more accessible to Federal employees. DATES: Effective June 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert E. Taylor, Clerk of the Board, (202) 653&hyph;7200. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This change came about as a result of Executive Order 12866, September 30, 1993, requiring agencies to insure that regulations are effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable. The Board's review found that changing the time limit for filing initial appeals to its regional offices would be consistent with the legal and regulatory time limits for filing with the Federal courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission both of which can potentially review final decisions of the Board. The consistency created by this proposed change will help to eliminate possible confusion by Federal employees who file appeals with the Board. The Board proposed the amendments to its practices and procedures at 59 FR 18502, April 19, 1994, and requested comments. The Board received 29 comments from agency and union representatives. Twenty-two were in favor of or not opposed to the amendments. While some commenters suggested alternatives to the proposed regulations, the Board has considered these suggestions and determined not to adopt them. The Board has determined that this proposed regulatory action is not ``significant'' as defined by Executive Order 12866, and therefore, is not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The Board has also determined that this proposed regulatory action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612). List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 1209 Administrative practice and procedure, Civil rights, Government employees.
