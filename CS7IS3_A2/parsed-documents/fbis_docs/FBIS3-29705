Previous government attempts to have the military trade agricultural products for defense equipment have proved futile. This time the armed forces are saying once again that bartering is neither feasible nor appropriate for arms procurement, particularly when it concerns the need to modernize weapons systems. Barter would require the use of international commodity trading firms to handle sales of agricultural products with the proceeds going to pay the weapons suppliers. This is a cumbersome, complicated arrangement, personally unrewarding -- and not preferred by those who want something under the table. Multi-billion baht arms procurements in the past usually meant a lot more than professional pride to military leaders, who staunchly protected their vested interests under the pretext of "national security" and argued that acquisitions should not be subject to any scrutiny by the government. The present generation of military leaders -- though with a relatively good image -- still owe some explanation to the government as to why they think barter trade is not acceptable when arms procurement is needed. They know they still bear the brunt of public criticism arising out of questionable deals concluded by their predecessors, with doubts over possible kickbacks heightened due to the huge wealth of many in the top brass. The public has a clear memory that whenever a barter deal has been suggested in the past, senior military officers have defended their preference for commercial deals or direct cash purchases by arguing that the best and most suitable weaponry could not be purchased by barter. But subsequent embarrassing incidents revealed there had been more than just simple shady dealing involved. The weapons acquired were sometimes found to be far below acceptable standards, their shortcomings raising serious doubts about their effectiveness in a war. Controversies involving Stingray light tanks, the Spada air defense system, and Bell Helicopter purchases, for example, have caused the generals to scramble for lame excuses to dilute the negative effects of the public outcry over suspicious deals -- about attractive commissions and kickbacks for all, from those responsible for preliminary arrangements up to the top decision makers. There have been only a few successful bidders for arms deals, as the record of the armed forces shows. Fewer than five firms have shared in cozy arrangements with the military, with Commercial Associates Co Ltd at the forefront with huge deals every fiscal year. The company represented the makers of Stingray light tanks, the Spada anti-aircraft missile system, Bell Helicopters and AMX jet fighters, among others. The Stingray and Spada purchases proved embarrassing for the Army last year when defects were detected. In the end, the manufacturers agreed to carry out repairs free of charge. When the deals for the Stingray tanks and Spada rockets were proposed in the late 1980s, top Army figures were strong in their support, saying they were appropriate for Thailand's defense capability. Key military figures of the time, such as Supreme Commander Gen Sunthon Khongsomphong and deputy Army chief Gen Wanchai Ruangtrakun, have all since retired and, as expected, none of them came forward to defend the equipment last year. If the military genuinely wants to modernize its defense capability, it should have avoid weapons not in use in the armies of other countries [sentence as published]. For example, the military keeps on buying Bell combat helicopters which are no longer used by the US armed forces. At one time, they wanted to buy used helicopters decommissioned from the US forces, arguing that they were still in good condition having been repaired and refitted. [passage omitted] A notable point is that the Thai armed forces have frequently been the "launch customers" of an item of defense equipment, such as the Stingrays. This raises the question whether there was something more involved than just a direct commercial arrangement. It could be that many types af weapons purchased by Thailand were procured on the assumption that they would never be used in battle and whatever defects there might be would never be known to the public. Risks of exposure were considered minimal, except in the cases of bad luck or a power play among military figures. The controversies surrounding the Stingray light tanks and the Spada missile system have proved otherwise -- that they were not the most modern or most suitable weapons, as claimed.
