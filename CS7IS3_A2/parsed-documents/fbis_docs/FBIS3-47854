However, with the beginning of the new year, a sign for the solution of the problem has appeared. North Korea reportedly said that it will accept inspection of seven facilities and the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks is expected to take place soon. However, the issue of special inspection has not been raised. How do you assess the present status of the North Korean nuclear issue? [Han Sung-chu] Ten months have passed since North Korea declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] on 12 March last year. But the nuclear issue has not been resolved up to now. I feel regret and sadness over this. However, this does not mean that we wasted this ten months. We can prevent this problem from going to an extreme situation. Moreover, there was no sign that North Korea manufactured nuclear materials during this period, or used this period for developing and manufacturing nuclear weapons. As you pointed out, although we cannot fully assure this, a sign for the solution has also appeared. The agreement and comprehension between the United States and North Korea and discussion on ordinary and ad hoc [imsi] inspections between the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea are not the negotiation or agreement for the final solution of the North Korean nuclear issue. They are of significance in further seeking an essential solution through insurance of continuity of nuclear safeguards by IAEA and through the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks. Therefore, the special inspection, which you mentioned earlier; insurance of nuclear safeguards; North Korea's complete nuclear transparency pertaining to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula; comprehensive checking of North Korea's nuclear development; and the like, can be regarded as preparatory measures for the next stage, rather than as present-day problems. [Yi Chong-su] What were presented as preconditions for the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks was insurance of North Korean nuclear transparency and another was tangible progress in North-South dialogue. We understood that only after this, the third round of talks can be held and the issue of improvement in relations and cooperation can be discussed. However, recently, the issue on tangible progress in North-South dialogue has not been briskly mentioned even though considerable progress appeared in North Korea's nuclear inspection issue. Will you tell us about what degree of progress in North-South dialogue will enable the United States and North Korea to discuss the third round of high-level talks and the issue of normalizing relations? [Han] We may say that there is progress in ensuring continuity of IAEA's nuclear safeguards measure. There is no change in the policy to regard such progress as an indispensable step for future dialogue. Likewise, there is no change in the policy of calling for tangible progress in North-South dialogue. Therefore, although this issue has not been emphasized openly and discussed loudly, the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks will not be held without tangible progress in North-South dialogue. [Kim] With a sign for the solution of the North Korean nuclear issue, do you think that tangible progress in North-South relations can be expected in the new year? Some people view that North Korea would reluctantly come to dialogue with the ROK merely for the sake of negotiations with the United States. What do you, the minister, think of this? [Yi] In the event that the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved to a certain degree and progress is seen in North-South dialogue, do you think there is a possibility of North-South summit talks? [Han] It is too early for us to say that a summit is possible or impossible at the moment. However, there is no need to exclude the possibility of a summit after the stumbling block, also known as the nuclear issue, is removed. [passage omitted] [Yi] I would like to ask a question about how the ROK should maintain relations with the four neighboring big countries of the Korean peninsula. At the end of the Cold War era, can ROK-U.S. relations be a little distant or should they become even closer? To what degree should relations with Japan be close? Is it alright even if relations with Russia are somewhat distant, and how close a relationship should we maintain with China? [Han] In maintaining relations with the four big countries surrounding the Korean peninsula including the United States, it is not desirable to consciously designate precedence and order of the countries to keep close or distant relations. However, relations with the United States still remain most important in terms of security, economy, and diplomacy. ROK-Japan relations are also very good at present in various aspects. In fact, the relations are better than ever before. Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa visited the ROK last November and held a summit with the ROK. The two sides agreed to develop relations in a forward-looking manner by overcoming the past to the greatest possible extent. I think this is possible. As for relations with China, since relations were normalized in August 1992, remarkable progress was effected in the trade field, and cooperation in other fields has also been satisfactory. In particular, China cooperated with the international community for the solution of the nuclear issue and made a great contribution to solving this problem through dialogue. I believe that China will also contribute to this in the future, as well. As for relations with Russia, since diplomatic relations were established, good relations have been maintained. Although the issue of payment in economic cooperation still remain as a pending issue, ROK-Russia relations have not been affected seriously by this. We hope to maintain good relations with Russia. We also hope that Russia will satisfactorily achieve political and economic stability at home. Thus, we will maintain good relations with the four countries, and amid balanced cooperation among these big countries, we will secure our own position. [Yi] Will you explain how you are going to implement the policy for reunification? [Han] The policy for reunification is closely related to pursuing our 5-point basic goals. We may divide it into three stages. One is how peacefully and productively we should manage the present status of division. For example, the solution of the nuclear issue stresses the necessity of diplomacy to manage the division. Next, the diplomacy for achieving national reunification and for winning the support for this is necessary. In other words, we should carry out diplomacy to convince the neighboring countries that our reunification is not contradictory but corresponds to their interests and to ask for their cooperation. This is applicable not only to the aforementioned four countries but also to many other countries. We should also seek cooperation from international organizations, including the United Nations. Last, we should prepare ourselves for the postreunification era. We should review how to maintain relations with world nations and international organizations after the reunification. This is the issue related not only to the Foreign Ministry but also to the National Unification Board, other government offices, and the people. [Yi] Thank you, Minister Han, for being with us today.
