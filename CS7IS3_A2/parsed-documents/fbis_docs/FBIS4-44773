When the turbine blades of modern jet engines are surrounded by a not quite 0.3-millimeter thick thermal insulation layer of zirconium oxide, the gas temperatures from the combustion chambers can be further increased. This is almost the melting temperatures of the turbine blades, which are firmly attached to the turbine axis, however, and thus can also transmit heat. The goal is now 1,500� for the gas temperature; each 150� increase raises the efficiency of the turbine by about six percent and correspondingly reduces the fuel consumption and generation of pollutants. The DLR researchers do not take into account the cooling of the blades, for example by circulating cool air, since the power gain is then largely eliminated. When you surround the blades which are under extreme thermal stress with thermal insulation in order to prevent the flow of heat to the metal, the difference between gas and metal temperatures can be further increased. Then, however, the adhesion of the protective layer determines the life of the turbine; if the layer peels off, there is total damage. Using so-called electron-spring jet-vaporization facilities the DLR is trying to overcome the poor evaporation ability of certain elements such as silicon and to enrich materials which increase layer adhesion in the insulation layers. The constant race between thermal material resistance and higher gas temperature is not unique for jet engines. It began with the first steam engines which drained the mines and in so doing burned at low steam temperatures a large part of the coal that was mined. It was evident even at that time that the efficiency of a thermal power machine is greater the higher the temperature difference between the working gas and the outside temperature.
