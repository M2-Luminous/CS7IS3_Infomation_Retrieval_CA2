As UNIAN already reported, the Russian delegation is led by Yuriy Dubinin, the Russian president's ambassador-at-large and includes Feliks Gromov, the Russian Navy commander. "We have long been offering to return to the Black Sea Fleet negotiations," Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told UNIAN, "and today these negotiations have been resumed. It is in our interests and those of the Russian side to find a solution to this issue in order to prevent the Fleet problem from setting off unexpected developments. Right now, everything happening around the Fleet is out of control, and the Odessa incident is an example of that. If we manage to find a solution soon to the Black Sea Fleet problem on the basis of mutual interest, we would decrease the probability of unforeseeable consequences in future. We need to find such solutions that will not harm the Black Sea Fleet and at the same time satisfy the interested parties. These solutions must be based on the Massandra, Yalta, and Zavidovo accords.
