Dragan Kalinic Wednesday warned that representatives of the "Medecins sans Frontieres" organization were misusing their humanitarian mission by giving political connotations to their reports. In a letter addressed to Eric Stobbaerts, "Medecins sans Frontieres" mission chief in Belgrade, Kalinic said he was astonished at the statements by the organization's representatives in Gorazde, Moslem enclave in south-eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina and by its central office in Paris, which contained negative political connotations for the leadership of the Serb state in that former Yugoslav republic. Kalinic asked "Medecins sans Frontieres" to keep to the activities within the framework of its mandate, realling that the Serb authorities had highly appreciated the cooperation with this organization in the past, the R.S. news agency SRNA reports. The statements by the M.S.F. members have for some time been rife with anti-Serb stances, particularly those made by its representatives now in the Gorazde enclave, where the fighting escalated at the end of March after Moslems -- as confirmed by U.N. representatives -- started attacking the neighboring Serb territories. Nevertheless, the M.S.F. representatives in Gorazde keep pointing out in their reports that Serbs are attacking that safe area, even though it was being used for military actions against the Serbs. The U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali recently warned that Moslem safe areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina were being used for preparations for military actions, and that lawlessness prevailed and prostitution was common in those areas.
