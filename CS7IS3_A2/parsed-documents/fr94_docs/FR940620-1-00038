FR940620-1-00038 FR940620-1-00008 Comments In opposing the Proposed Rule, MABA argues that the Shipping Act, 1916, 46 U.S.C. app. 821, and the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1710(b) (``Shipping Acts''), prohibit the Commission from shifting the burden of ``personally serving private complaints from the Commission to private parties.'' Comments at 1&hyph;2. MABA's position is that only the Commission can serve the complaint, and that a ``rule is which service of the complaint is performed by someone other than the Commission does not comply with the clear statutory command that the Commission `shall furnish' a copy of the complaint.'' Id. at 2. Regarding the Commission's interest in bringing Rule 113 in conformity with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, MABA contends that the Federal Rules ``are not underlain by a similar statutory obligation that the district court `furnish a copy of the complaint' to a defendant.'' Id. at 3. Finally, MABA cites differences between district court and FMC proceedings, and ``*␣*␣* practical reasons why the Commission should not abandon its statutory responsibility to serve a complaint.'' Id. at 3. MABA argues that the Shipping Acts' statutory provisions governing complaints mean what they say and that the Commission is compelled to serve a respondent on behalf of a private complainant. It contends that because the Commission has national jurisdiction, field offices, and an extensive regulated persons index, it is also in a better position to personally serve the respondent. MABA believes that the Proposed Rule would place the burden of personal service on small companies, thereby acting as a possible barrier to the prosecution of claims before the agency, and exacerbating whatever service problems now exist. Conclusion Upon a reevaluation of the concerns that prompted this proposal, the Commission has decided not to proceed to a final rule. Any actual service of process difficulties in a specific case will be addressed on an ad hoc basis. Therefore, it is ordered, That the Proposed Rule is withdrawn and this proceeding is discontinued. By the Commission. Joseph C. Polking, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14914 Filed 6&hyph;17&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6730&hyph;01&hyph;M
