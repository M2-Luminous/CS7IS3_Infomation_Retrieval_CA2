The study is based on a collection of 630 mollusk samples most of which were taken in 1990-1991 from rivers in the Dnepr basin. Mostly fresh water mollusk of the Viviparus, Contectiana, Lymnaea s.str., Planorbarius, Unio, Anodonta, Colletopterum, and Dreissena genera were selected for the radiometry study, and Succinea, Bradybaena, Cepaea, and Helix land snails were used for comparison. A correction for natural activity of [.sup]40[/]K was made. The background _b_-radioactivity of mollusk shells from the collection gathered before the start of nuclear tests in the atmosphere and water was close to 50 Bq/kg due to 40K while more than 90% of _b_-activity in the shells collected in the Chernobyl fallout pattern can be attributed to [.sup]90[/]Sr. This is evident from the energy characteristics of the _b_-particle flux, a good correlation between the specific activity of shells from [.sup]90[/] Sr contaminated terrain or water, and differences in the _b_- and _g_-activity ratios in fallout patterns with different radionuclide compositions. On the other hand, the mollusks' individual variability and taxonomy differences make only a slight contribution to the spread of experimental data. The conclusion is drawn that snail and mollusk shells are a convenient biological indicator of man-caused contamination and water quality and should be used extensively in areas with operating nuclear power plants and other installations. It is noted, however, that the Kursk, Smolensk, Khmelnitskiy, Rovno, and Zaporozhye nuclear power plants are not causing detectable river contamination at this time.
