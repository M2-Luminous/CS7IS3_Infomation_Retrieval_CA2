These consultations are also aimed at exploring the possibilities for activating the stalled negotiations in light of the full and fair partner role that the United States has pledged to play. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher proposed these preliminary consultations as part of other measures designed to end the stalemate in the peace process. It is noteworthy that even before the ink on the Oslo agreement dried, Israel announced that it was not presently interested in promoting the peace efforts on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. Israel also said that peace was achieved in the region in the wake of the Oslo agreement, and that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks can wait. The Israeli deception did not last long because this agreement remained mere ink on paper. Moreover, the contradictions of this agreement soon surfaced, and Syria once again occupies a prominent position. Syria's role will continue to be a central one because it is essential to both the peace process and the Middle East region. The United States acknowledged Syria's basic role when it sent its secretary of state to the region in order to discuss rescuing the peace process, and also when it arranged for the upcoming summit in Geneva between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. It is natural for the Israelis to cast doubt on the Syrian-U.S. summit, just as they usually do. The Israelis are looking forward to encircling and belittling the Syrian role and undermining the possibility of a deep Syrian-U.S. understanding on the aspired Middle East peace and on the need to establish it on firm bases, so it would stand fast in the face of various events and developments. The Israelis widely publicized the Gaza-Jericho agreement. However, the events that followed this agreement have shown that this agreement is a group of ambiguous principles and that reaching further agreements on these principles would need months of painstaking negotiations. Events have also shown that the peace process has retreated several steps backward instead of moving one step forward, and that there is no alternative to the return to the bases of the Madrid conference, the Washington talks, and the formula of a just and comprehensive peace on all tracks of the conflict, based on both the Security Council resolutions and the principle of exchanging land for peace. As the Gaza-Jericho agreement faces a real impasse, the Israelis have appealed to the United States to intercede with Syria in order to render this agreement a success. It is to be recalled that this agreement has carried the seeds of failure since the very beginning because it is a separate deal, which conflicts with the objective of a just and comprehensive peace, and it does not achieve the Palestinian people's rights. Moreover, Israel has shown great intransigence and arrogance, thus increasing the conviction that it does not want to withdraw from the occupied territories and that it is using the agreement to strike at the intifadah -- with Palestinian hands if possible. Thus, the demonstrated Israeli desire for Syrian flexibility are no more than deception. Israel was the party that lured the Palestinian side into concluding a separate deal. Israel is also the party that imposes its condition on the Palestinian side and refuses to show any flexibility. As was the case two years ago, Israel stands as an obstacle to the opportunities of a just and comprehensive peace in the region. Syria, along with other Arabs, has called on Israel to achieve a just, comprehensive, and honorable solution based on a principle on which the world was unanimous; namely, the exchange of land for peace. In return for Israeli withdrawal from all occupied territories, Israel would reap the fruit of peace on all tracks without exception. Contrary to its allegations, Israel's withdrawal does not entitle it to concessions because the occupied territories are Arab lands, and because the Security Council resolutions provide for withdrawal and frankly reject occupation, annexation, and the building of settlements. Since the Washington talks began, however, Israel has undermined all the opportunities for a real peace, rejected various offers and proposals, and insisted on the policy of separate deals. This policy can make neither peace nor even a truce. Hence, both the resumption of the Washington talks and the activation of the march toward a comprehensive Middle East peace depend on Israel. Neither Syria nor Lebanon will listen to Israel to conclude separate deals. Israel, however, will receive a favorable response if it really seeks an honorable, comprehensive, and just peace. We do not believe that any world state, including the United States, differs with Syrian opinion on the need to establish a just and comprehensive peace. All parties now agree that there will be no peace if it is not a just and comprehensive one. This is the significance of both the preliminary talks in Washington and the upcoming Syrian-U.S. summit. As has been the case since the convening of the Madrid conference, the ball remains solely in the Israeli court.
