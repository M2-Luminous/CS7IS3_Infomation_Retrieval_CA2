This was stated by Prime Minister Lubbers in Jakarta last Tuesday, after a meeting with President Suharto. "A development relation can be useful at a specific point in time," Lubbers said, "but at a certain moment, it is better to renounce this relation." During his talks with Suharto, it became clear to Lubbers that relations between both countries had become more mature and better since Indonesia announced in 1992 that it no longer wanted development aid from the Netherlands. Relations between both countries are now based rather on various forms of cooperation which are profitable to both countries. According to the prime minister, providing development aid is a temporary phase in a relationship, which must be abandoned at a certain moment. He found it an interesting idea that the Indonesian Government is presently considering to establish development relations with some African countries. These countries might, for instance, learn from the way in which Indonesia handled birth control. Lubbers also announced that he welcomed the Indonesian Government's wish that Queen Beatrix would pay a state visit to the country. The prime minister refused to elaborate on the question whether such a visit should take place in 1995. During that year, Indonesia will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the proclamation of the independent republic. Netherlands India veterans claim, however, that the fiftieth anniversary should not be celebrated before 1999, because the formal transfer of sovereignty did not occur until 1949.
