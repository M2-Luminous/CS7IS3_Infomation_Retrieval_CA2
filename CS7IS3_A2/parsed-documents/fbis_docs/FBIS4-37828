FBIS4-37828 "drnes122dd_94008" FBIS-NES-94-122 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Sha'th Discusses `Domestic,' Economic Issues Sha'th Discusses `Domestic,' Economic Issues JN2306202794 JN2306202794 BFN [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic, in a special "With the Events" program, carries from 1438-1614 GMT a live or recorded phone-in program with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, "official in charge of the planning and international cooperation file in the Palestinian authority," who received phone calls in a "temporary studio" set up at the Palestine Hotel in Gaza. The phone-in program is interrupted by a news summary at 1530 GMT. Sha'th answers questions by the program moderators and callers on various domestic and personal issues, especially concerning prisoners and deportees. The program is moderated by Roset Hakim in Jerusalem and Hasan Abu- Zayid Sa'id and Mu'addi in the studio in Gaza. Answering a question by a caller from Hebron on rumors about Hebron being handed to the Palestinian authority early July, Nabil Sha'th says that according to the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles [DOP] signed in Washington, 13 July was the date set for the start of self-rule in the entire West Bank. He says that there has been some delay, but he expects that "if intentions are sincere and if the required effort is made, all cities of the West Bank will be included within the framework of the Palestinian authority and self-rule" three months from now. Asked by Hasan Abu-Zayid on the date of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule area, Nabil Sha'th says: "Abu-Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] always keeps his travel secret and surprising. Undoubtedly, he will declare the date of his arrival a few days earlier so that all preparations are made. However, we should not forget that President 'Arafat is the president of all Palestinians. Consequently, he has responsibilities outside Palestine toward the Palestinians living abroad. He will be also responsible for the situation of PLO institutions after his return to the homeland. He has to settle many matters before he returns to Gaza and Jericho. Also, some preparations must be made in Gaza and Jericho, such as, among other things, completing the implementation of the agreement and putting the security measures into practice. I have always said that I expect 'Arafat to arrive before the end of this month. This could be the case, but if any delay takes place, it will not be for much longer." Asked by a caller from Gaza on employees' salaries and the economic situation, Sha'th says that "the Palestinian authority wants to continue to offer the required services to citizens, including education, health, sewerage system, illuminating streets, protecting beaches, and other similar matters. All this, including security, needs taxes to make them possible. Now we are fully responsible for security. This requires salaries for the police and others. We will receive international aid in the first year. This aid will enable us to offer services before we manage to collect the taxes needed for that. We will seriously discuss the possibility of increasing salaries. I asked brother Abu-Shar'iah, who is responsible for personnel affairs at the civil administration, to draw a plan for increasing the salaries of government employees so as to bring them close to the salaries paid to United National Relief and Works Agency and private sector employees." Asked by Roset Hakim whether the Palestinian police will exert efforts to capture the killers of a Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activist, who was killed in Bayt Lahiya on 22 June, Sha'th says: "Definitely. We will not allow any killer, assailant, or thief to escape punishment. This is not because we want to take revenge on anybody, but to give all citizens a feeling of justice and security irrespective of their political affiliation and geographic locations." Asked by Hakim whether he is holding contacts with representatives of the Palestinian opposition to learn about their stand on the peace process and the possibility of their participation in future self-rule elections, Sha'th says: "I will be holding such contacts very soon. I started by resolving the problems facing the police and the civil authority through cooperation with my colleagues and brothers. I am visiting professional Palestinian communities--workers, merchants, and others. I know that some of my colleagues are in constant contact with the opposition. I will gladly hold contacts with them to achieve a genuine peace, national unity, democracy, and participation by all. In light of peace and the agreements that we have signed, we want to give everybody a chance to take part in building their homeland and future." A telephone call was also received from Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, a Hamas leader in Gaza. In a brief dialogue, Sha'th and al-Zahhar exchange greetings and hope to meet soon. Al-Zahhar says: "First, we beseech God Almighty to grant you and your brothers here success. You are all welcome to your homeland. We beseech God that your presence here will be beneficial for the homeland and will spare us harm and evil, signs of which are evident through the agents' escalation of their activity against honorable persons of various affiliations. This has resulted in the martyrdom of youth Nasir Salluha. This is extremely regrettable. We hope that the police will not take its role fully to establish justice and to put an end to those agents." Sha'th responds: "I wholeheartedly support you, brother Mahmud. We will not relinquish our responsibility. Defending you and all those affiliated to your organization and all the children of those people who struggled and paid sacrifices to achieve genuine security, effective participation, and justice is a responsibility which we are assuming without hesitation." Asked to comment on some Palestinian prisoners' intention to receive 'Arafat upon his arrival in the self-rule area with black flags, Sha'th says that Palestinian prisoners have suffered a great deal from prisons and that peace has not secured their release although they had a role in the start of the peace process. He says that Palestinian officials are sparing no effort to secure their release. He says that the Cairo agreement has created the mechanism for the release of all prisoners, noting that special arrangements and negotiations are still needed. Asked by Hasan Abu-Zayid on Jerusalem and recent statements by Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, on a Palestinian-Israeli "secret file concerning Jerusalem," and whether a "new media clamor" about Jerusalem is imminent, Nabil Sha'th says: "I do not believe that what is required is a media clamor. What is required are clear bases for action regarding the issue of Jerusalem. I believe that brother Abu-al-Lutf [Faruq Qaddumi] also refers to Holst's message, which constitutes a part of the overall Oslo accords. I remind the brother listeners that among the Oslo accords were the DOP which was signed in Washington, the letters exchanged between President 'Aaraft and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel, and this message by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres to Holst, the late Norwegian foreign minister. What is required is for everyone of us to realize what these bases are. First, the final status of Jerusalem will be decided by the agreement that will result from the negotiations on the final status. These negotiations will begin within a period not exceeding two years after the signing of the DOP. The agreement will be implemented within a period not exceeding five years, which is the transitional period -- three years after the first two years. However, the implementation of the DOP on the final status of Jerusalem is based on the implementation of Resolutions 242 and 338. In other words, Jerusalem is considered an occupied city. It is not an annexed city, but a city like other cities in the West bank and Gaza occupied in 1967. Until we arrive at the final status, every side has its declared objectives. Our declared objective is that in the final status, we want East Jerusalem to be the capital of an independent Palestinian state. As for the relationship between east and west Jerusalem, this is a topic of negotiation. We do not want a new Berlin wall between east and west Jerusalem. This is something that will be decided in the negotiations. Until we arrive at this situation, our rights in east Jerusalem must be maintained. We must not be prevented from entering Jerusalem and the Palestinian civilian and religious institutions in the city must be defended. The Israeli Government must not take any measures preventing citizens' freedom and rights in Jerusalem. This is our position, and this is what has been achieved by Holst's message. What is required is abidance by this agreement rather to be engaged in media rows about it." Asked by Abu-Zayid on the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations that will start on 27 June, Sha'th says that the first topic on the agenda will be drawing timetables for the release of remainder of Palestinian prisoners. He says that the negotiations will deal with issues not included in the Gaza-Jericho agreement and deployment of Palestinian authority and police throughout the West Bank in preparation for Israeli withdrawal from cities and villages and in preparation for the elections which will be held when withdrawal is completed. He says that those negotiations will "most probably" be held in Gaza and Israel.
