As a result, Hungary has disputes with its neighbors, but these are not as serious as those in the Balkans or the Caucasus," Prime Minister Peter Boross said this evening in his reception toast for participants in the conference of DEMYC, the union of European center-right parties' youth organizations. DEMYC is holding its executive committee session in Budapest from Friday [25 February] to Sunday [27 February]. Boross said debates with neighbors involve human rights issues, such as use of the Hungarian language in official contacts, the right to native-language education or the right and possibility of using originally Hungarian geographical names. He added Hungary is nonetheless developing economic and cultural ties with its neighbors, and that the disputes do not threaten Europe in any way. DEMYC President Klaus Welle, head of the German CDU's [Christian Democratic Union] European Policy Department, said some in the West think that Eastern and Western European countries should be separated. The young conservatives and Christian democrats reject this view, and support their joint participation in NATO, the European Union, the Western European Union, and other institutions. Hungary has won the right to do so also by its minority policy, Welle said.
