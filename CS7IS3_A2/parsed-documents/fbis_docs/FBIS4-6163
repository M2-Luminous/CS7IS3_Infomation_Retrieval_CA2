Wave shapes of signals transmitted via optical fiber cables tend to disintegrate and the timing of signals becomes delicately upset, but these new IC's have the capability to correct such problems. They also have been improved so that the corrective function is more precise than with circuits developed in the past and will serve to enhance the reliability of and to miniaturize optical transmission systems. The newly developed IC is a circuit used for required processing following conversion of the optical signals, received via optical fiber cables, to electrical signals. It compensates data signals weakened or contaminated by static while passing through optical fiber cables. Additionally, when computer processing is involved, the new IC augments signals with clock signals and automatically synchronizes them with timing reflected in data signals. The new IC, as a single unit, will handle processing previously involving several ICs and delicate manual adjustments. First, clock signals are allowed to emanate automatically at an appropriate frequency and as the compensated data signals change from a "0 to 1" or "1 to 0" range, the starting point of the clock signals and compensated data signals are synchronized. Next, the point in time for the change in the data signal is captured, deviations in the two signals are checked and the frequency of the clock signal is subjected to minute adjustment. Repetition of this process leads to the final synchronization of the two signals. Under previous methods, with data signals unchanged, as long as a "0" or "1" signal was repeated more than seven times, the data was sent to the central processing unit (CPU) without detection of deviations. Thus, reliability could be assured only by controlling deviations via a dedicated circuit. The newly developed IC has the capability to memorize data up to the point where a change in data signal occurs and to make 23 consecutive timing corrections. In reality, the probability of the same data repeating itself more than 23 times is very small and such a capacity provides for sufficient commercialization of the IC. The new IC will provide for miniaturization of high-capacity receiving systems capable of handling multiple signals and a reduction in electrical consumption.
