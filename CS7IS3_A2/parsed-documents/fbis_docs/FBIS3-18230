These four countries' membership negotiations yesterday entered their decisive stage, whose deadline is midnight on 28 February; a time limit which enables the membership treaties to be debated and approved in the European Parliament before the June elections and the new partners to join 1 January 1995, if the referendums in each of the countries produce favorable results. Reservations Westendorp's statements in favor of enlargement and the scheduled timetable come at the very moment when Spain is attracting the four applicants' greatest attention because of its supposed obstructionist attitude to the membership process. It is no secret that Spain is the country which has reservations about the greatest number of areas in the negotiations. The Spanish Government has unsatisfied demands in the areas of fisheries -- in which Norway does not wish to yield "even one sardine" -- regional aid, the Community budget, the distribution of votes in the Council of Ministers, and the quantification of the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union. In fact, Westendorp rejected the new proposal on regional aid presented by the Commission yesterday. This proposal is to create a new classification for areas with a density of population below 7 percent, so that the arctic and subarctic regions can receive structural funds. These regions would be classified as Objective 1A, instead of the previous proposal to classify them as Objective 1, which includes the regions which have incomes totaling 75 percent of the Union average. Senior Spanish officials who took part in the membership negotiations also complain with some bitterness about the difference in treatment which the four new applicants and their skeptical publics are receiving, as compared with that which Spain received. According to these views, Spain found itself forced to adjust many sectors to Community conditions and to accept transitional periods for its fisheries and agriculture, while the four applicants are negotiating advantageous positions in almost all sectors, to the extent of endangering the very idea of the Community's heritage. "It seems that it is we who are going to join them -- not vice versa," a Spanish negotiator asserted.
