"...it is not only they who carry swords, who shed blood, and who emit radiant rays of military glory who are chosen to choose the personnel of a government for a people who want to democratize themselves; it is also the right of citizens who have fought in the media, who are identified with the principles of the revolution, who have fought the despotism that is undermining our laws because it is not only by firing bullets in the battlefields that tyrannies are defeated; it is also by launching ideas of redemption, expressions of freedom, and terrible curses against the executioners of the people that dictatorships and empires are overthrown (...) and if the historic facts show us that the demolition of all tyrannies, that the overthrow of all bad governments is the joint work of the idea with the sword, it is an absurd thing, it is an aberration, it is an outrageous despotism to want to segregate the healthy elements who have the right to elect the government because the sovereignty of a people is made up of all healthy elements who have a full awareness of their rights, whether they are civilians or accidentally armed people, but who love freedom and justice and work for the good of the fatherland." -- Emiliano Zapata in the voice of Paulino Martinez, Zapatist delegate to the Sovereign Revolutionary Convention, Aguascalientes, Mexico, 27 October 1914. To the people of Mexico: To the peoples and governments of the world: Brothers: The EZLN, on a war footing against the bad government since 1 January 1994, addresses you to explain our thoughts: I. Mexican brothers: In December 1993, we said ENOUGH! On 1 January 1994, we called on the legislative and judicial branches to assume their constitutional responsibility to prevent the genocidal policy that the federal executive branch is imposing on our people, and we based our constitutional right by applying Article 39 of the political Constitution of the United States of Mexico: "The national sovereignty essentially orignates with and resides in the people. All public power comes from the people and is instituted for the benefit of the people. The people have, at all times, the inalienable right to alter or modify its government." This call was answered with an extermination policy and lies. The branches of government disregarded our just demands and allowed the massacre to be carried out. But the nightmare only lasted 12 days, because another force, superior to any political or military power, prevailed over the parties involved in the conflict. Civilian society assumed the duty of preserving our fatherland; it expressed its disagreement with the massacre and forced a dialogue. We all understood that the days of the eternally ruling party, which uses for its own benefit the product of the work of all Mexicans, cannot continue any longer, that the presidentialism that supports it inhibits freedom and cannot be allowed, that the fraudulent culture is the method by which democracy is limited and suppressed, that justice only exists for corrupt and powerful people, that we must make those in power learn how to obey, and that there is no other way. This is something all honest Mexicans and all good-willed civilian society has understood. The only ones who are opposed are those who have based their success on stealing public assets; those who protect drug traffickers and murderers, thereby corrupting the justice system; and those who resort to political assassinations and electoral fraud to impose their wills. Only these political fossils are planning to return to Mexico's past and to erase from the national conscience the shout that the entire country has cried out since 1 January 1994: ENOUGH! We should not let this happen. Today, we are not calling upon the government's ineffective branches that failed to fulfill their constitutional duties by allowing the executive branch to control them. Although the current legislators and magistrates have been undignified, others will come who will understand that they must serve their people and not themselves. Our call goes beyond a six-year administration or an approaching presidential election. Our sovereignty rests upon CIVILIAN SOCIETY; people are the ones who at any time can alter or modify our form of government, and have already decided to do so. It is the people to whom we issue a call in this. SECOND LACANDONA JUNGLE DECLARATION We say to them: First: We have faithfully complied with conducting military actions within the framework of international agreements on war. This has given us the tacit recognition of nationals and foreigners as a belligerent force. We will continue honoring those agreements. Second: We have ordered our regular and irregular forces throughout the national territory and abroad to observe a UNILATERAL EXTENSION OF THE CEASE-FIRE. We will continue to respect the cease-fire TO PERMIT CIVILIAN SOCIETY TO ORGANIZE IN WHATEVER WAYS IT DEEMS BEST TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY. Third: We condemn the threat to civilian society posed by the country's militarization with personnel and modern repressive equipment prior to the upcoming federal elections. There is no doubt that the government of Salinas de Gortari will try to succeed through the culture of fraud. WE WILL NOT LET THIS HAPPEN. Fourth: We propose to all independent political parties that they now recognize the intimidation and denial of political rights our people have suffered for the past 65 years and that they demand a government of political transition toward democracy. Fifth: We reject manipulation and the attempt to separate our just demands from those of the Mexican people. We are Mexicans and will not give up our demands or our weapons until we have achieved democracy, liberty, and justice for all. Sixth: We reiterate our desire for a political solution in Mexico's transit toward democracy. We urge civilian society to resume the heroic role it had in stopping the military phase of the war and to organize to conduct peaceful efforts toward democracy, liberty, and justice. A democratic change is the only alternative to war. Seventh: We invite honest members of our civilian society to participate in a national dialogue for democracy, liberty, and justice for all Mexicans. This is why we say: II. Brothers: After the war started in January 1994, the united voice of the Mexican people stopped the confrontation and called for a dialogue among the conflicting parties. The federal government responded to the just demands of the EZLN with offers that failed to touch the basic point of the problem: a lack of justice, liberty, and democracy on Mexican soil. The degree of compliance with the proposals made by the federal government to the EZLN's demands has been determined by the political system of the ruling party. This system has allowed another power, which is above constitutional power, to exist in Mexican territory. Its roots keep the party in power. This system of complicity has promoted the existence and belligerence of bossism, the omnipotent power of cattlemen and merchants, and the infiltration of drug trafficking... The simple offering of the so-called Compromise for a Dignified Peace in Chiapas provoked a great uproar and open defiance on the part of these people. The single-party political system is trying to maneuver in this reduced horizon imposed by its existence. It cannot refrain from attacking these groups without hurting itself and it cannot leave things as they are without seeing an increase in the belligerence of peasants and Indians. In sum, compliance with the commitments implies, necessarily, the death of the system of the party of the state. By suicide or execution, the death of the current Mexican political system is a necessary condition, although not sufficient by itself, in our country's journey to democracy. There will be no real solutions to Chiapas' problems unless Mexico's problems are settled. The EZLN realizes that the problem of Mexican poverty is not caused by a lack of resources alone. Its main contribution is to understand and point out that any effort, in one aspect or another, will only postpone a solution unless these efforts are made within a new framework of national, regional, and local political relations: a framework of democracy, liberty, and justice. The problem of power will not depend on who is the leader, but on who will exercise it. If power is exercised by a majority, the political parties will be forced to confront that majority and not one another. Viewing the problem of power within the framework of democracy, liberty, and justice will force the creation of a new political culture within the parties. A new class of politicians should be born, and undoubtedly, a new types of political parties will be born. We are not proposing a new world but the start of a new Mexico. This revolution would not end with the creation of a new class, part of a class or group in power, but in free and democratic "space" for political struggle. This free and democratic "space" will be born from the stinking corpse of the system of the party of the state and the presidential system. A new political relationship will be born. A new policy whose base is not a confrontation between political organizations but a confrontation between their political proposals and the various social classes, because the head of political power, and not its exercise, will depend on the GENUINE support offered by these groups. In this new political relationship, the new proposals of system and course (Socialism, Capitalism, Social Democracy, Liberalism, Christian Democracy, and so on) must convince a majority of the nation that their proposal is the best for the country, not that they will be "watched" by the country they lead to ensure they offer regular reports and are subjected to the nation's opinion on whether they should remain in power or be removed. A plebiscite is a regulated means to confront power, both the power of party and nation, and it deserves an important place in the ultimate law of the country. The current Mexican legislation is too narrow for this new policy between rulers and those being ruled. There is a need for a NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION to produce a PROVISIONAL OR TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT through the resignation of the federal chief executive or through elections. The NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION AND TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT should produce a new Constitution and new elections should be called within its framework. This process will always cause less pain to the country than that produced by a civil war. The prophecy of the south is valid for the entire country, and we can learn from past developments and make the delivery of the new Mexico less painful. The EZLN has an idea of what system the country should have and what course it should follow. The political maturity of the EZLN, its coming of age as a representative of the feelings of part of the nation is based on the premise that it does not wish to impose this idea on the nation. The EZLN demands for itself what is evident: The coming of age of Mexico and the right to decide, freely and democratically, the course it should follow. This historic start will not only produce a fairer and improved Mexico, but also a new Mexico. We will risk our lives in this -- in giving to future Mexicans a country in which it is not shameful to live... The EZLN, in an unprecedented democratic exercise within the armed organization, consulted its components on whether it should sign the peace agreement proposal presented by the federal government. In light of the fact that the main issues of democracy, liberty, and justice for all have not been resolved, the EZLN rank and file, which mostly comprises Indians, has decided to reject the signing of the government proposal. Being under siege and pressured from various flanks which have threatened us with extermination if we failed to sign for peace, we, the Zapatists, reaffirm our determination to attain peace with justice and dignity, and in this endeavor we will offer our lives. We are again continuing the dignified struggle of our forefathers. The dignified call of insurgent Vicente Guerrero -- "Live for the Homeland or Die for Liberty" -- is coming out again from our throats. We cannot accept peace without dignity. Our decision to fight resulted from the impossibility to fight peacefully for fundamental human rights, of which the most valuable is the right to choose, with freedom and democracy, a system of government. Currently, the possibility of a peaceful transition to democracy and freedom is facing a new struggle, namely, the electoral process of August 1994. There are those who are preparing for the postelectoral period by preaching apathy and disappointment from their stagnant positions. They seek to benefit from the blood shed by those who have fallen on all combat fronts, violent as well as peaceful, in the city and in the countryside. They are basing their political project on the postelectoral conflict, and hope, without doing anything, that political demobilization will again open the heavy gates of war. They will save, so they claim, the country. Others, from now on, are anticipating that the armed conflict will begin before the elections and that the ensuing ungovernability will help them retain power. As they did yesterday, when they usurped the popular will through electoral fraud -- and, as they do today and will do tomorrow -- while in the confusion of preelectoral conflict, they are seeking to prolong the agony of a dictatorship which, disguised under the official party, has already lasted decades. Other sterile harbingers of apocalypse believe that a war is unavoidable, and they sit in wait for the corpse of their enemy... or of their friend, to be walked on. The sectarian mistakenly believes that the firing of rifles in and of itself will bring the dawn our people have awaited since that day when the night fell upon them following the deaths of Villa and Zapata on Mexican ground. All of these thieves of hope believe that behind our weapons, there is ambition and a thirst for prestige, and that this will lead our path in the future. They are mistaken. There are other weapons behind our weapons -- the weapons of reason. Hope drives both types of weapons, and we will not let anyone take them away. Hope by way of the trigger had its moment at the beginning of the year. It must now wait. It is necessary that the hope that exists in broad-based movements returns to playing the pivotal role it deserves out of right and reason. The flag is now in the hands of those who have names and faces; good, honest people who walk paths that are not ours, but whose goal is the same as we are fighting for. We respect these men and women and we respect and hope they will take that flag to its rightful place. We will be waiting, standing up with dignity. If that flag falls, we will pick it up again... Let hope be organized and walk now in the valleys and cities, as it did yesterday in the mountains. Fight with the weapons available to you. Do not worry about us. We will know how to resist until the end. We will know how to wait... and we will know if the doors are closed again, so that dignity can prevail. That is why we are addressing our brothers of nongovernment organizations, of peasant and Indian organizations; workers of the countryside and the city; teachers and students; housewives and settlers; artists and intellectuals; and members of independent parties of Mexico: We appeal for a national dialogue on the topic of democracy, liberty, and justice. In turn, we are now calling for a National Democratic Convention (CDN). We, the Zapatist National Liberation Army, are striving to achieve the democracy, liberty, and justice that our fatherland deserves, whereas: First, the supreme government has also usurped the legality bequeathed to us by the heroes of the Mexican revolution. Second, the existing Constitution no longer reflects the will of the Mexican people. Third, the ouster of the usurping federal government does not suffice, and it is necessary to have a new law for our new fatherland, which will be born of the struggles of all honest Mexicans. Fourth, all forms of struggle are necessary to achieve a transition to democracy in Mexico. We appeal for the holding of a CDN [expansion unknown], sovereign and revolutionary, which will propose a transitional government and a new national law, a new constitution that will guarantee the legal fulfillment of the people's will. The fundamental objective of the CDN is to organize the civil expression and defense of the people's will. The sovereign revolutionary convention will be national inasmuch as its composition must include all states of the federation. It will be pluralist because all patriotic forces will be represented. It will be democratic in the making of decisions because we will utilize national consultations. The convention will be chaired freely and voluntarily by civilians and public personalities of renowned prestige, regardless of their political affiliation, race, religious creed, sex, or age. The convention will comprise civilians through local, regional, and state committees in villages, neighborhoods, schools, and factories. These convention committees will be charged with gathering the people's proposals for the new constitution and their demands to be met by the new government, which will stem from the new constitution. The convention must demand the holding of free and democratic elections and struggle tirelessly for respect of the people's will. The EZLN will recognize the CDN as the authentic representative of the interests of the Mexican people in their transition to democracy. The EZLN exists throughout the territory of the nation and is now in a position to offer itself to the Mexican people, as guarantor of the fulfillment of the people's will. For the first meeting of the CDN, the EZLN offers a Zapatist town as a venue and all the resources available to it. The date and place of the first session of the CDN will be announced in a timely manner. III. Mexican brothers: Our struggle continues. The Zapatist flags continue waving in the mountains of the Mexican southeast. Today we declare: We will not surrender! In the mountains, we spoke with our dead so that they could point us to the road on which our gagged people must march. Drums resonated and the earth spoke of our pains and our history. Our dead say: "Everything to everybody." As long as this does not happen, there will be nothing for us. Speak on behalf of other Mexicans, look into your hearts and speak to those for whom we struggle. Invite them to walk the honorable road of the faceless. Urge everybody to resist; let no one receive anything from those who give orders for the sake of giving orders. Turn the not-for-sale principle into the common banner of the majority. Ask those who speak encouraging phrases to give us more than words for our pain. Ask them to share our pain, to resist at your side, and to reject alms from the powerful. Let the good people from this land put together today the dignity that gives them the strength to resist and that prevents selling out. Let them put together this dignity to demand tomorrow that those who govern remain truthful to and hail the essence in the heart of the majority. Let the good road win in order that those who give the orders do so while obeying. Do not surrender! Resist! Do not dishonor the truth! Resist with dignity in the land of true men and women. Let the mountains nestle the pain of the men of corn. Do not surrender! Resist! Do not sell out! Resist! This is how the essence in the heart of all of those who have died. We have sensed that what our dead are saying is true and that their advice is truthful and honorable. This is why we are appealing to all of our Mexican Indian brothers to resist with us. We appeal to all peasants, workers, employees, settlers, housewives, students, and teachers, those whose life means thinking and speaking, and those who have dignity and honor. We appeal to all of them to resist with us because the corrupt government does not want democracy in our land. We will not accept anything from the rotten heart of the bad government -- not a single coin, or medicine, or rock, or one single grain, or the crumb of alms they are offering in exchange for our honorable march. We will accept nothing from the supreme government; even if our pain and suffering increase; even if death continues sitting at our table, in our land, and in our beds; even if we see that others sell out to the oppressor; even if we ache everywhere; and even if the rocks cry out in pain. We will accept nothing. We will resist. We will accept nothing from the government. We will resist until those who give the orders do so by obeying. Brothers, do not sell yourselves out. Resist with us. Do not surrender. Resist with us. Repeat with us these words, brothers: "We will not surrender! We are resisting!" Let this be heard not only in the mountains of the Mexican southeast but also in the north and in the peninsulas, on both coasts, and in the middle of the country. Let this be shouted in the valleys and the mountains. Let this resound in the cities and in the countryside. Unite, brothers; thunder with us; let our demands be your demands! "We will not surrender! We are resisting!" Let dignity break the siege with which the dirty hands of the corrupt government is suffocating us. We are all besieged. They do not let democracy, liberty, or justice enter Mexican territory. Brothers, we are all besieged. Let us not surrender! Let us resist! Let us be honorable! Let us not sell out! What good will wealth do for the powerful, if they cannot buy what is most valuable in this land, if the dignity of the Mexicans cannot be bought? What good will power do for the powerful? Dignity does not surrender! Dignity resists! Democracy! Liberty! Justice!
