"I do not think at all that our interest in joining NATO is less intensive than the interest of the other Visegrad Group countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland). Many times, on every occasion we clearly showed our interest," Moravcik said. He was reacting to the fact that British Prime Minister John Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had omitted Slovakia when listing the countries which have come closest to NATO membership. "I would not overestimate the reach of such statements. At personal talks with the politicians who had omitted naming Slovakia, we were always assured that Slovakia was counted on as the other Visegrad countries.... We really do not have the least reason to consider Slovakia a less prepared partner," Moravcik emphasized. He said that the Slovak Government was ready to sign the Partnership for Peace initiative, and a special group of officials from the Foreign and Defense Ministries would be soon created to prepare the special agreement and its realization. Asked whether or not he would discuss the question of Slovakia's Hungarian minority with his Hungarian counterpart at their meeting in Prague, Moravcik said that the problem could be mentioned only in connection with Slovakia's efforts to work out a pan-European document, because the question of the minority status was Slovakia's internal affair. The Slovak delegation to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton on the occasion of his Prague meeting with representatives of the Visegrad Four will include President Michal Kovac, Premier Vladimir Meciar, Moravcik, Deputy Premiers Jozef Prokes, Sergej Kozlik, and Julius Toth, Economics Minister Jan Ducky, Health Minister Irena Belohorska, Foreign Ministry State Secretary Jan Lisuch, Slovak Ambassador to the Czech Republic Ivan Mjartan, and the Slovak ambassador designate to the United States, Branislav Lichardus. At a government session today, Moravcik said that Slovakia wanted to use the Prague meeting with Clinton to express again its interest in NATO membership, and to present a proposal to intensify Slovak-U.S. economic relations.
