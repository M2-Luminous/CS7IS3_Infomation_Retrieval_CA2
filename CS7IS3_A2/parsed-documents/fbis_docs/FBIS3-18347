For cynical political reasons, they will not say so publicly, but the unmistakeable message from Tallaght -- underscored by another incendiary blitz on jobs and businesses in the North -- was that the constitutional parties should waste no more time trying to spot significant policy shifts in Provo speak. There haven't been any, and there won't be. Even the Hume-Adams initiative which set off the present peace momentum -- and which the SDLP [Social Democratic and Labor Party] leader naively forecast at one stage could achieve peace in a week -- has turned out to be a mirage. Neither Gerry Adams, nor the Provisional movement, for all the reassuring rhetoric that we have heard in recent months, is prepared to accept that the principle of Unionist consent to any new political arrangement also entails the right to say No. The two sovereign Governments have accepted that fact. It has been endorsed by some 90 per cent of the population of this island, according to the latest poll. And even two-thirds of the Provos' own supporters, according to the findings, want them to call off the murder campaign and join the political process. But while Sinn Fein continues to call on everyone else for a change of attitude, its leadership seems incapable of doing just that. It is convenient to hide behind the socalled Unionist veto. That allows the Provos to shirk the much more formidable task of convincing the North's Unionist majority that their best interests lie in a political arrangement with the rest of this island. You don't do that by shooting them and blowing up their businesses. And even if the British left in the morning, that task of persuasion would still have to be undertaken -- and it still could not be done with guns and bombs. The Sinn Fein leadership, whether through lack of courage or fear of their paramilitary masters, wasted the unique opportunity provided by the Ardfheis to give substance to the current peace process. Now the two Governments and the other constitutional parties have to move on the the next stage without them. The most intolerable veto of all would be to allow a party which commands just two per cent electoral support in this country -- and whose real political influence comes out of the barrel of a gun -- to frustrate the widespread desire for peace in both parts of this island.
