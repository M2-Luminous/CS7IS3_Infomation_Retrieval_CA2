Here is our correspondent Valeriy Kuts. [Kuts, in progress as heard] ...by Moscow time, the Mi-8TM helicopter with the terrorists and hostages on board took off, circled the airport and town several times, and headed off for the town of Makhachkala, but because of heavy icing, the helicopter had to return to the airport at the town of Mineralnyye Vody, where it landed at 0240 Moscow time [2340 GMT]. Evidently officials of law and order bodies will once more attempt to make contact with the criminals at dawn in order to establish their further plans. Valeriy Kuts, information service.
