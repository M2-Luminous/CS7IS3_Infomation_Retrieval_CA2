FR941202-0-00063 FR941202-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner 24 CFR Parts 200, 203, 204, 206, and 267 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1626; FR&hyph;3027&hyph;C&hyph;04] RIN 2502&hyph;AF25 Appraisals and Property Valuation, Final Rule; Correction AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: On October 3, 1994 (59 FR 50456), the Department published in the Federal Register , a final rule that established minimum standards for real estate appraisals made by staff, fee panel and contract appraisers in determining the maximum insurable mortgage amount in most HUD/FHA single family (one-to-four family) and multifamily transactions; and established criteria for the selection of appraisers by mortgagees. The rule also distinguished those appraisals that may be performed by state licensed appraisers from those that must be performed by state certified appraisers. The purpose of this document is to correct several minor technical errors contained in the preamble and text of the October 3, 1994, final rule. It also corrects ยง267.1(a) to clarify the limited applicability of part 267 to the risk-sharing program. DATES: Effective date: December 2, 1994. Applicability date: Section 267.10 is applicable to HUD employees who qualify as certified general appraisers not later than December 31, 1994, unless the Assistant Secretary-Commissioner specifies otherwise in a specific case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For single family programs: Morris Carter, Director, Single Family Development Division, Room 9270, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;8000, telephone, voice: (202) 708&hyph;2720; (TDD) (202) 708&hyph;4594. (These are not toll-free numbers.) For multifamily programs: Linda Cheatham, Director, Office of Insured Multifamily Development, Room 6134, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 6134, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;8000, telephone, voice: (202) 708&hyph;3000; (TDD) 708&hyph;4594. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This document corrects several minor technical errors contained in the preamble and text of a final rule on Appraisals and Property Valuation, that was published in the Federal Register on October 3, 1994 (59 FR 50456). Section 267.1(a) is also being corrected to clarify the limited applicability of part 267 to the risk-sharing program. Although the final rule, in ยง267.1(a), limited part 267 to National Housing Act mortgage insurance programs, it was the Department's intention that the multifamily risk-sharing program under part 266 (which is not a National Housing Program) would also be covered by provisions in ยง267.3(c) regarding a reporting requirement for the gender and minority classification for appraisers. This is made clear in references to the risk-sharing program that appear in ยง267.3(c). Section 267.1(a) is being corrected to clarify this limited applicability of part 267 to the risk-sharing program. Accordingly, FR Doc. 94&hyph;24327, a final rule on Appraisals and Property Valuation, published in the Federal Register on October 3, 1994 (59 FR 50456), that amended 24 CFR parts 200, 203, 204, and 206, and added a new part 267, is corrected as follows: 1. On page 50457, in the preamble, in column one, in paragraph two following the subpart A heading, that refers to the definition for ``FIRREA'', remove ``(d)'' after the word ``definition''. 2. On page 50457, in the preamble, in column one, in paragraph three, following the subpart A heading, that refers to the definition for ``Single family program'', remove ``(j)'' after the word ``definition''. 3. On page 50457, in paragraph four, in column one, following the subpart A heading, that refers to the definition ``USPAP'', remove ``(l)'' after the word ``definition''. 4. On page 50457, in the preamble, in column three, in paragraph one following the subpart B heading, in line three, remove ``(a)'' after the word ``paragraph''.
