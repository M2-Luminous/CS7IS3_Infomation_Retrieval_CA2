Although he stopped short of unilaterally naming a prime minister, he nevertheless announced measures which depart from the constitutional framework as agreed by the Sovereign National Conference (CNS) which, we should remember, brought together all elements of Zairian political life and civil society. Contrary to the Zairian leader's claims, not all parties have signed the protocol of agreement between the opposition and presidential party. At the very most, the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition indicated last Wednesday that it would agree to sign it and some representatives have put their signatures to the text. Moreover, Mobutu would have no right to dissolve the High Council of the Republic (HCR), which resulted from the national conference, and to merge it with "his" national assembly. The opposition sees this as a further "constitutional coup d'etat" by the president. Clever as always, Mobutu would thus be undoing the work of the CNS while forgetting that the validity of his own position stems from it. His mandate in fact expired in December 1991 and was extended by the conference members at the insistence of the Western partners (the Americans in particular) in order to avoid a transition marked by conflict. As is customary, Mobutu is dipping into the texts to retrieve that which suits his own ends. Lukoji Against Tshisekedi? In his Friday evening address, Mobutu announced that the remodelled interim HCR-Parliament was to meet yesterday and should, over the next two weeks, deal with matters of its internal organization (validation of mandates, rules of procedure, election of officers, setting up of committees), drawing up and adopting the interim constitutional act, and the choice of a prime minister drawn from the opposition, whose appointment should be sanctioned by a presidential decree. He also indicated that the allies of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and the presidential party had suggested Mulumba Lukoji as prime minister, while the Sacred Union continued to support Etienne Tshisekedi. For their part, the opposition representatives do not want to hear any talk of the immediate dissolution of the HCR. They believe it should first examine the texts of the protocol of agreement. If it concludes that they do not violate the statute of the CNS, it must have them signed by all the parties (including Mobutu) at a formal ceremony in the presence of foreign witnesses. Finally, the meeting scheduled for this Monday has been postponed until Wednesday. It seems that this is designed to provide time for tempers to cool off. On Sunday the present HCR was unable to sit. The military prevented it from doing so under the pretext that the president had terminated its legal existence. For his part, Etienne Tshisekedi has rejected the presidential decisions and pointed out that he is the only "legal" prime minister because he was elected by the CNS. He also called upon the population to respect a total shutdown of activities on Wednesday. Monsengwo to the Rescue Whereas Mobutu has succeeded in reviving tensions, the HCR president has been seeking to ease them. In any event, Monseigneur Monsengwo seems ready to confront the radical opposition. In his opinion, all political factions have "either signed or reached a decision to sign the protocol of agreement." The prelate considers them to be historic agreements. He has thus called upon the parties not to compromise "the result of so much hard work." Monseigneur Monsengwo wants the HCR to meet "right away" in order "to be able to take up the option which allows it to form a single body with the former national assembly." He has thus admitted in substance that this institution should give way to the interim HCR- Parliament, now remodelled following political agreements. This declaration will certainly not please the most radical opposition members who believe the new HCR will be dominated by the presidential party and members of the moderate opposition with little inclination to support Tshisekedi. Paris as the Third Way All this should make it possible to arrive at the "third way" as suggested by the French cooperation minister. According to Michel Roussin, a "third way must be found between Etienne Tshisekedi and the government appointed by Mobutu." For the opposition, this amounts to nothing less than abandoning Tshisekedi and breaking the consensus binding Belgium, the United States and France. It should be noted that neither Belgium nor the United States have reacted to Mobutu's statements. Both countries seem to be waiting to see how things develop and if the latest negotiations manage to ease the tension. But the fact remains that the Belgian Government does not seem very worried by the prospect of the HCR disappearing so easily, despite the fact that it has always seen it as the sole representative body of the Zairian transition. The alarming descriptions of what is happening in the field also seem to be meeting with little reaction. Several witnesses report troop movements, sporadic looting and violence, none of which augurs well. Many people are now hoping above all that Mobutu becomes genuinely involved in the interim process in order to avoid any further breaking of the consensus and further delays for the transition.
