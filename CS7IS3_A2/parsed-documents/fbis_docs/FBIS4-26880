This was revealed today by Wang Shuwen, deputy director of the Law Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), at the eighth session of the NPC Standing Committee, which opened today. He was speaking on the revised version of the Draft Regulation on Penalties for Copyright Infringement, based on the previous review by the NPC Standing Committee and opinions from relevant government departments, localities, legal and financial experts. The original draft provided that people who obtain "extremely big sums" of illicit money from the crime, or whose crimes are "especially serious," will be sentenced to two to five years in prison or dealt with administratively, and/or will be fined. The new draft changes the prison term to three to seven years. The former draft said that the lesser criminals of this kind will be sentenced to less than two years in prison, and/or fined. This ceiling is raised to three years in the latest draft. Wang asked the NPC Standing Committee to further review the draft for an early promulgation. "The draft is now basically feasible," Wang said. The revised draft also lists what constitutes criminal copyright violation, including pirating books, movies, videotapes, computer software and producing and selling forged paintings. Wang said that the revised draft would better protect the legal rights of the copyright owners and promote the management of the cultural market.
