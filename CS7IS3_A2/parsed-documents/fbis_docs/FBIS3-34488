"Baraqi completed a three-part series of tests at the end of last year, and all three tests were successful." This was revealed yesterday by a senior Israeli Navy figure. He added that the Navy plans to install this missile system on the Saar 5 missile boats which are being built in the United States, and on some of the Saar 4.5 vessels. The Barak missile is the result of a joint REFA'EL [Armament Development Authority] and IAI [Israel Aircraft Industries] development. The missile's range is about 10 km, and it can hit a pinpointed target. The missile will be mounted on Saar 5 and Saar 4.5 as the central defense weapon system. The senior figure said that Barak is the best missile of its kind in the world, and its uniqueness lies in its ability to intercept low-flying missiles cruising a few meters above water. The missile can be also used against attacking aircraft. In the last three tests, the missile was fired from a naval platform, and it intercepted a Gabriel ship-to-ship missile. In one of the tests, Barak hit Gabriel as it had been programmed, while in the other two tests, it passed a short distance from it -- also in accordance with the programming which sought to collect data about the missile's performance.
