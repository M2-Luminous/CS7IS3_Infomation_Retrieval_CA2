FBIS4-916 "drafr076_a_94015" FBIS-AFR-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Belgian Troops Hand Over UNAMIR Role to Ghanaians Belgian Troops Hand Over UNAMIR Role to Ghanaians EA1904193894 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in Kinyarwanda to Rwanda 1015 GMT 19 Apr 94 EA1904193894 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura Kinyarwanda BFN [Excerpt] At Kanombe Airport in Kigali yesterday, where Belgian troops have been getting ready to return home, handover ceremonies were held between Belgian troops and the Ghanaian troops who had previously been in the neutral zone between the two sides. They came to replace the departing Belgian troops at the airport. One of the departing Belgian soldiers, after recalling the 10 colleagues who had been killed by government troops, said they could not remain in Rwanda as part of UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] because they were mistreated, and in some cases killed. They could not defend themselves because of the instructions given to UNAMIR. The soldier went so far as to say that Belgium will no longer send its troops to the United Nations. Although the job of the Belgians was rendered impossible and they were obliged to leave Rwanda, they continued to show that they were willing to help Rwanda. During the ceremonies yesterday, Belgian troops left the Ghanaians all their equipment so that they could continue to carry out the job previously done by Belgians without too many problems. The United Nations is still faced with the important problem of replacing the Belgian troops within UNAMIR, as the country was UNAMIR's most important component due to the skill of its troops. It is said that even though they left their equipment, their skills to use it are also needed. Apart from the skills, they had the third biggest force, after Bangladesh which has 940 men and Ghana which has 840 men. Therefore it is clear that the withdrawal of the Belgian troops complicates the work of UNAMIR in Rwanda. [passage omitted]
