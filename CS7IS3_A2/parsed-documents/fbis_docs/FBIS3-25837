Last year, the port reported a handling capacity of 175.96 million tons, a net increase of more than 13 million tons over that of 1992, according to the Ministry of Communications. The figure puts Shanghai some 100 million tons ahead of Qinhuangdao port, the second in terms of handling capacity, located in north China's Hebei Province. The increase amount almost equals the annual handling capacity of Rizhao in East China's Shandong Province. The handling capacity of the port rose by 5.2 percent in 1991 and 11 percent in 1992. Its growth rate last year was 7.4 percent. In addition, major seaports of China reported a handling capacity of 635.56 million tons in 1993, up 12.6 percent compared with the previous year. Of the ports which have a handling capacity of more than 50 million tons each, Shanghai's growth rate is lower than those of Ningbo in Zhejiang and Guangzhou in Guangdong and much higher than those of Dalian and Qinhuangdao.
