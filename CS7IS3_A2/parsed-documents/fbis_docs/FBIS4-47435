Manuylov, cand. biol. sci., Moscow] [Abstract] Intravenous administration of a solution prepared by perfusing pig liver with physiologic saline significantly was shown to reduce mortality of mice and dogs with experimental sepsis due Staphylococcus aureus injections. Based on these results, analogous trials were conducted on 45 male and female patients, 16-73 years old, with life-threatening pyoseptic conditions. The infusions were prepared by using dextran, 10% glucose or autogenous blood to perfuse the porcine spleen. The therapeutic regimen consisted of 400-500 ml (2-4 ml/min drop-wise) of the solution given 1-6 times at 1-5 day intervals, 2-8 days after a surgical intervention. The beneficial effects of xenogeneic splenic therapy were most pronounced in 28 patients with destructive appendicites, cholecystitis and purulent peritonitis. Only 3 (10.8%) patients in that category died vs. a 26.7% mortality rate in 15 control patients. In general, this therapeutic approach was least beneficial in patients with necrosis of the pancreas. However, the overall impression of this form of therapy remains a positive one and the benefits seem to result from detoxication and enhancement of immune reserves by bioactive splenic substances. The therapy is most beneficial when instituted early (12-48 h) in the disease process. Complications in the form of fever and chills were noted in 10% of the cases and readily controlled by antihistaminics and analgesics. Figures 1; tables 1; references 16: 13 Russian, 3 Western.
