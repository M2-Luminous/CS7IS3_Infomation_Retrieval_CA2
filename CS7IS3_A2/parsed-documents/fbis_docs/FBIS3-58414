Regarding Bosnia, Clinton had corroborated his country's readiness in principle to take part in NATO air raids in the event of a continuing siege of Sarajevo, for instance. According to reports today, however, the President expressed doubts about the wisdom of foreign military missions in crisis centers in the world. He is quoted as saying that it is one of the saddest facts of the world that people slaughter one another within their own borders. These two statements appear to clearly contradict each other, and we will try to solve this contradiction in an interview with security expert Egon Bahr of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. Good day, Mr. Bahr. [Bahr] Hello, Mr. Buss. [Buss] How do you interpret this? [Bahr] I interpret this as the establishment of a fact, namely, it is objectively impossible to intervene with the aim of creating or enforcing peace, if people really intend to kill one another within the borders of their state or their former state. This holds true for Bosnia, Nagorno-Karabakh, southern Sudan, and Somalia. If they absolutely intend to do so, we cannot prevent them, unless we intervene in a way that allows us to stifle such conflicts. However, under the aspect of fairness and equitableness, we would then have to intervene everywhere, not just in regions where the media or oil interests suggest such an approach. In the case of Yugoslavia, such an intervention would require 500,000-800,000 men, which we do not have. To that extent, your question is justified. The option -- which no one is really taking seriously -- that NATO will suddenly carry out air strikes by mandate of the United Nations is in contradiction to this. But I am glad he has realized this, because nothing can be achieved with isolated air raids at Bosnia -- neither militarily nor in the sense of creating peace. [Buss] But, Mr. Bahr, there is still the question of what applies in the case of Clinton -- his tough words in Brussels or his more recent cautious statement? Would you have to guess, or do you have any new information? [Bahr] No, I do not have any new information. You would have to ask the President. I think we should hope that the statements he made in Brussels will not survive today or tomorrow. [Buss] Somalia and Bosnia, in particular, have reflected the international community's impotence. Would or could it be a solution for us to just forget our international responsibility and to wait and see how these civil wars will develop? [Bahr] If we are unable or unwilling to create peace by force and to stifle a conflict, there is, first, the option to allow it to dry out by the embargo being made watertight, so that not a drop of oil, gasoline, or diesel, and nothing except for medicines gets into the country, or, if we are not even able to do this, there is, second, the option to allow the conflict to burn out -- as terrible as this sounds. [Buss] A few words on Bonn's policy, Mr. Bahr. Reviewing the recent past, we see that the trend in Bonn rather is in favor of an increasing international commitment. In view of Clinton's recent statements, do you think that our government should perhaps reconsider its position? [Bahr] No, I think in this respect, Bonn's position is correct, meaning that if the United Nations can implement what it planned to do in 1945 when it was founded, namely, to create global collective security, Germany must be ready to decide on a case-by-case basis and take part.
