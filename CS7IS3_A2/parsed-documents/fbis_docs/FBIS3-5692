His speech was a bureaucratic composition which served only to convince us that there is some basis to the U.S. criticism that the Hosokawa administration is controlled by bureaucrats. There is speculation that the prime minister did not have enough time to prepare for his speech because of the confusion over the cabinet reshuffle. It appears the prime minister has given up his previous practice of using only his own words. Originally, the prime minister was a politician who placed importance on speeches. In preparing for his visit to the United States in February, he worried more about a speech to Georgetown University than the important Japan-U.S. summit talks. The general policy speech he delivered to the Diet in August last year immediately after his inauguration assured us this was the "start of a new era." His general policy speech in September, which quoted from a German writer, bore his certain style. The recent speech was his first administrative effort, but it was not a good one and was excused by an aide with the excuse, "the prime minister had no choice but to mention all sorts of matters because the speech was based on the draft budget." The general public wanted to hear something other than an enumeration of policies prepared by bureaucrats. The first thing they wanted to hear was the prime minister's recognition of the economic recession and mention of what counter measures were planned. The second thing they wanted was an explanation of how he will rebuild relations between Japan and the United States. They would also have wanted to hear about his responsibility for the confusion within the ruling coalition over the proposed national welfare tax and cabinet reshuffle. The prime minister's speech failed to provide enough answers to satisfy these legitimate public concerns. As far as economic pump-priming measures are concerned, the prime minister merely pointed out the need for "seamless fiscal expenditure." He made no mention of the responsibility the government had for allowing the economic recession to become prolonged. He said the Japan-U.S. relationship "is moving to a new level." What concerns us is the prime minister's optimistic view of the situation, as if he had happily accepted the breakdown of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks. In providing an abstract explanation of the political confusion among the ruling coalition parties, he said only that "these trials are only to be expected given that we have dared to choose a new and untrodden path." The prime minister probably wanted to say that a little confusion should be expected. What, instead, we see in his speech is that the prime minister has no sense of responsibility for the current situation in which there seems to be no policy. It seems Hosokawa has tended to speak first and think later since the confusion over his proposal to introduce a national welfare tax. He told reporters recently that his administrative policy speech would be delivered on 7 March. The next day he had to go back on that. We do not intend to support the Nagata-cho rule [which works only in Nagata-cho where the Diet and the LDP headquarters are located] that "the prime minister must not speak about Diet schedules." The prime minister sometimes has to make decisions that will affect lives of many people. If he is careless in what he says, it could affect Japan's credit with foreign nations. Aides to the prime minister said: "This was the result of having many people work out the speech, rather than leaving it to one person." This amounts to a confession that bureaucrats played a leading role in writing the policy speech. When bureaucrats write a speech appealing for the need to tackle economic and administrative reform through deregulation, as the next big task following political reform, the words only ring hollow.
