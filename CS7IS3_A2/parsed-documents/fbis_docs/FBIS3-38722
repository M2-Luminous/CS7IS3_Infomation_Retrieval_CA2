There is close cooperation between the security organizations of the two countries. This cooperation is gradually increasing. We have agreed that the differences of views or conflicting information that might arise from time to time will be taken up at that level and resolved. We have reassessed these issues at this meeting with Syrian Foreign Affairs Minister Faruq al-Shar'.
