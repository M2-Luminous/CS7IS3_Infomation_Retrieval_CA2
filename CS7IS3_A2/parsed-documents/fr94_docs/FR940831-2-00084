FR940831-2-00084 FR940831-2-00063 [Investigation No. 337&hyph;TA&hyph;358] Certain Recombinantly Produced Human Growth Hormones; Decision Not To Review an Initial Determination on Violation Until November 29, 1994, at the Latest AGENCY: U.S. International Trade Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review an initial determination (ID) (Order No. 132) issued on July 28, 1994, by the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) in the above-captioned investigation extending the date for issuance of the ALJ's initial determination on violation until November 29, 1994, at the latest. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jean H. Jackson, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;3104. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission instituted this investigation concerning allegations of section 337 violations in the importation of recombinantly produced human growth hormone on September 29, 1993. Complainant Genentech Inc. (``Genentech'') alleges infringement of claims of four U.S. patents owned by Genentech. On July 21, 1994, respondents Bio-Technology General Corp. and Biotechnology General (Israel) (collectively, ``BTG'') and respondents Novo-Nordisk A/S; Novo-Nordisk of North America; Novo-Nordisk Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and ZymoGenetics, Inc. (collectively, ``Novo'') filed a motion to delay issuance of the initial determination on violation. The motion for delay was filed in order to give the ALJ more time to consider whether to reopen the evidentiary record in light of documents that had recently become available to respondents. Genentech had previously claimed privilege as to these documents, but that privilege was deemed waived as a result of an inadvertent production to the Eli Lilly Company in concurrent multidistrict litigation, In Re Recombinant DNA Technology Patent and Contract Litigation, 30 USPQ2d 1881 (S.D. Ind. 1994). No petitions for review of the ID were filed. This action is taken under authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. ยง1337) and sections 210.55 and 210.59(a) of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 C.F.R. 210.55, 210.59(a)). Copies of the ID and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street S.W., Washington, D.C. 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;2000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on this matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on 202&hyph;205&hyph;1810. Dated: August 22, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21523 Filed 8&hyph;30&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
