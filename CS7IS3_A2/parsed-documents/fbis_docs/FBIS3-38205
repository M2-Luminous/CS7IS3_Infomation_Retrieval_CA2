The main beneficiaries will be the Russian Central Bank and the new Interstate Bank, which is charged with establishing clearing houses for bank transactions throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The EC official said interbank transfers and payments were painfully slow in CIS countries, hindering trade. Citing one example, he said that a bank transfer from Vladivostok to Saint Petersburg could take weeks. The EC's executive European Commission plans to send a team of high-level finance and banking specialists to Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus to counsel banks there.
