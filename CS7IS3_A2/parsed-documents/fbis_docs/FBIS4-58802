[passage omitted] The English language newspaper `THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER' editorially commented on the military battles raging in Yemen and said the crisis there is a result of foreign and internal factors. The paper said the United States and Saudia [Saudi Arabia] as well as the Kuwaiti regime have worked covertly and in the open to destabilize the security and political situation in Yemen. Although the three parties are united in their opposition to any Arab gathering that could become a nucleus for a pan-Arab unity, each party has its own motives in opposing any Arab unity. The United States along with the world Zionism are against the unity of the Arab nation so that the Arabs remain weak and suffer from their international divisions and differences. The Iraqi paper further said that Israel in occupied Palestine will remain having the upper hand over the Arabs. The U.S. showed indifference to the Yemen unity at the beginning because it felt that the Yemen unity would serve its global policy of winning footholds against the former USSR since south Yemen used to be an ally of the latter. But since the collapse of the former USSR and the discovery of oil in the southern part of Yemen, the U.S. policy towards Yemen has shifted to its previous approach. The paper added that the U.S. touches in the current Yemen crisis are indicated in the suspicious roles played by the U.S. ambassador to Yemen and other U.S. officials who are playing an agitating role in the Yemen crisis. The U.S. influence on Yemen affairs has increased with the increasing number of U.S. oil companies digging for oil. Currently there are about 26 U.S. companies having oil contracts with Yemen. The official invitations being extended to a number of Yemeni officials, journalists, and politicians is another tactic used by the U.S. Administration and its agencies to win political and economic influence in Yemen. It added that the Saudis, for their part, are playing the same suspicious role played by the U.S. Administration in that since the unification of the two parts of Yemen, the Saudis increased their support to feudalism and tribalism in Yemen to destabilize the security and political situation in that Arab country. Since then Saudi Arabia has expelled thousands of Yemeni expatriates and made extra territorial claims against Yemen. This Saudi stance is in line with their government's customary policy of opposing any Arab economic or political unity. The paper pointed out that the Kuwaitis for their part played an agitating role trying to castigate the Yemeni leadership for its support for Iraq during the U.S.-led aggression on the country. So what is going on in Yemen nowadays is a result of a regional and international conspiracy to destroy the fragile Yemen unity and once again bring about its fragmentation. If this is allowed to happen, it would be in the interest of the enemies of the Arab nation and very deterimental to Arab interests.
