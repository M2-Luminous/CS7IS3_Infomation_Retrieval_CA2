Rabin spoke at Labor Party headquarters last night. Dani Gur-Arye reports: [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Prime Minister Rabin says the attacks on Israelis are painful. He says they highlight the need to begin implementation of the agreement with the Palestinians. Speaking to the Labor Party Bureau in Tel Aviv, Rabin said Israel must fight hard against those who seek to derail the peace process. He said Israel is determined to see the agreement through despite the violence. Police Minister Moshe Shahal said following the Bureau meeting that the new security arrangement with the Palestinians will make such attacks more difficult for those who oppose the peace process. [Shahal] We expect that the Palestinians will prevent any kind of terror acts or violence of any kind against Israeli civilians. For that matter, we are going to have all of the responsibility on their shoulders and this is their obligation. We are realistic enough to know that there are those who oppose the peace process and probably they will try to sabotage the peace process by terror acts against civilians: Israelis and maybe even Palestinians. But the Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho will be responsible to prevent those actions. [Gur-Arye] Prime Minister Rabin said at the Bureau meeting that the Islamic Jihad is the leading terror organization in the territories. He said it would take at least a month to reach agreement on outstanding issues with the Palestinians. He ruled out meeting with Yasir 'Arafat before all the issues are resolved. Rabin said Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres had coordinated all his moves with him on the phone from Cairo. He criticized Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin for promising that the government would resign if the public rejects an agreement with Syria in a national referendum. Prime Minister Rabin said Beilin had no authority to make such a promise. [end recording] [Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 11 February in a page 1 report on the Labor Party Bureau meeting by Sarah Honig adds that Prime Minister Rabin adds: "Arab terrorism will not be controlled without help from the Palestinian police." THE JERUSALEM POST writes that "Rabin noted that Israel could not eradicate terror when it controlled the territories. 'Perhaps what we need is a partner to help us towards that end. When the Palestinians have self-rule and deploy their own police force, they will have their own interest in putting an end to terrorist acts perpetrated by their own people. ["`They will have something to lose if they do not exert control. They will have an enormous stake in securing the peace. If they fail and the bloodletting continue, they know they will not arrive at their destination and will not get what they wish to achieve beyond Gaza and Jericho,' Rabin said."]
