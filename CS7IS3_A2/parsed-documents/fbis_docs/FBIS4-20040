[Moellemann] He who wants to make a mark for himself will also make mistakes and have critics! This is also true for me. One has to live with it. Besides, results of 90 percent are abnormal for democracies. More dangerous than the decrease in support in the election of a land chairman is the sustained loss of votes achieved by the FDP in elections. The question is: How can we surmount this low point? [Kleine] How can you? [Moellemann] The FDP must make it clear that we will no longer put up with the enormous increase in our horrendous national debts! Moreover, we must stimulate the economy and create jobs. And the FDP must advocate more strongly the reduction of bureaucracy: Fewer ministries! Fewer deputies! Fewer laender! [Kleine] Is this a coalition offer to the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]? [Moellemann] No! The SPD does not really want to reduce bureaucracy and really cut corporate taxes. Yet, one thing is true: There are no major differences on central issues between the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the SPD.
