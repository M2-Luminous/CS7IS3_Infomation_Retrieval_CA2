There are 16 booths located in this municipality, and a few moments ago there were tables where nobody had gone to vote. It may be due to the fact the media's power of persuasion was not effective. The teachers of Peten held a general meeting on 28 January and decided to urge the rest of the people not to vote. The teachers issued a communique, which states at the end: The teachers urge the citizens in general not to be deceived by the publicity campaign to vote yes or no in the upcoming referendum. Do not go vote in the referendum. This was one of the arguments raised by the teachers to El Peten residents. The few individuals who have gone to vote are Indians. They were trucked into Poptun Municipality. We had the opportunity to listen to Benedicto Lucas, municipal mayor, who spoke in dialect to those who arrived, telling them to vote yes, because that was the thing to do. Everything has taken place normally. Only the UCN [Union of the National Center] installed its delegates but no other delegate at the polling booths. We will report on what is taking place throughout the rest of the department during the remainder of the day.
