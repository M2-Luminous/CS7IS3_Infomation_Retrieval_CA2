The Chechen government on Sunday [2 Janaury] banned delegates of the local clans to hold a congress in Shali designed to announce general elections in the republic. Its organizers told INTERFAX the forum was annulled in order to avoid violence. The council of local clans and ethnic groups says it will announce the timing of a new forum within hours before it opens. Khalidov warned against attempts to try to accuse President Dzhokhar Dudayev of dictatorial habits and seeking to bring an end to democratic reforms. He blamed politicians in the President's entourage for playing on some traits of Dudayev's character and occasionally offering ill advice. Officials in Groznyy say the congress is illegal because the council of local clans was not officially registered. Parliamentary Chairman Akhyad Idigov, in an interview with INTERFAX, described the forum as a step back and an attempt to try to split the Chechens. In the meantime, moderate opposition leaders in the recalcitrant Nadterechny region, which refused to be ruled by Groznyy in June 1992, have described as unproductive attempts to try to call a forum of Chechen clans. It would be much better to rally effort in creating a healthy opposition to the dictatorial regime in Groznyy instead, they told INTERFAX.
