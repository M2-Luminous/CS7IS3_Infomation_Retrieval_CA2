FR940920-2-00084 FR940920-2-00038 Food and Drug Administration [Docket No. 94N&hyph;0318] Medical Devices; Alternatives to Silicone Breast Implants; Notice of Workshop AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice of public workshop. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing a public scientific workshop to discuss draft guidance for manufacturers concerning testing requirements for alternatives to breast prostheses containing silicone. DATES: The public workshop will be held on October 21, 1994, 8:15 a.m. to 6 p.m. Public participation will take the form of written questions that may be submitted at the meeting. Written comments regarding the workshop may be submitted by December 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: The public workshop will be held at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, 2500 Calvert St. NW., Washington, DC 20028. Advance registration, including a $40.00 registration fee, is required. A registration form may be obtained by contacting Sociometrics, Inc., 8300 Colesville Rd., suite 550, Silver Spring, MD 20910, 301&hyph;608&hyph;2151 or 1&hyph;800&hyph;729&hyph;0890 (FAX 301&hyph;608&hyph;3542).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FDA recognizes that many women needing or wanting breast implants would like to have a safe and effective alternative to breast prostheses containing silicone. In addition, potential manufacturers of these medical devices would like to know the agency's views on testing requirements for alternative breast implants intended for reconstruction and/or augmentation. The purpose of the scientific workshop is to provide a forum for FDA to present draft guidance concerning alternative breast prostheses testing requirements. Among the major topics planned for discussion are developments in biomaterials, chemical characterization of materials, mechanical testing, preclinical biological testing, clinical testing, quality of life considerations, requirements for investigational device exemptions and premarket approval applications, and postmarket-epidemiological issues. The workshop will include discussion and an exchange of information by invited scientific authorities. Dated: September 12, 1994. D.B. Burlington, Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23152 Filed 9&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
