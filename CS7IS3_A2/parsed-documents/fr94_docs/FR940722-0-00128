FR940722-0-00128 FR940722-0-00019 166. Partnerships and other non-corporate entities will be subject to similar requirements. Indicia of ownership that we will consider in non-corporate cases include (but are not limited to) (a) the right to share in the profits and losses, and receive assets or liabilities upon liquidation, of the enterprise pro rata in relationship to the designated entity's ownership percentage and (b) the absence of opportunities to dilute the interest of the designated entity (through capital calls or otherwise) in the venture. As with corporations, our concern is ensuring that the economic opportunities and benefits provided through these rules flow to designated entities, as Congress directed. 167. Application of the Five-Year Holding Rule. Finally, we explain how these attribution rules apply with regard to the five-year holding and limited transfer period for C and F block licensees. During this five-year period, a C or F block licensee must not sell more than 25 percent of its passive equity to a single investor if the resulting attribution of that investor's gross revenues or total assets would bring the company over the $125 million gross revenues/$500 million total assets thresholds, or if that investor's personal net worth exceeds the $100 million personal net worth cap. Similarly, while individual members of the control group may change (if it would not result in a transfer of control of the company), the control group must maintain control and at least 25 percent of the equity and 50.1 percent of the voting stock. 144 A company will be permitted to grow beyond these gross revenues/total assets caps, however, through equity investment by non-attributable (i.e. passive) investors, debt financing, revenue from operations, business development or expanded service. 145 144 A minority or woman-owned company must continue to adhere to the attribution rules applicable to it, set out above. 145 These rules will continue to apply in this manner throughout the license term with regard to a firm's continuing eligibility for installment payments, ``enhanced'' installment payments and bidding credits. 168. Abuses. As stated above, we intend by these attribution rules to ensure that bidders and recipients of these licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks are bona fide in their eligibility, and we intend to conduct random audits both before the auctions and during the 10-year initial license period to ensure that our rules are complied with in letter and spirit. If we find that large firms or individuals exceeding our personal net worth caps are able to assume control of licensees in the entrepreneurs' blocks or otherwise circumvent our rules, we will not hesitate to force divestiture of such improper interests or, in appropriate cases, issue forfeitures or revoke licenses. In this regard, we reiterate that it is our intent, and the intent of Congress, that women, minorities and small businesses be given an opportunity to participate in broadband PCS services, not merely as fronts for other entities, but as active entrepreneurs. b. Limit on Licenses Awarded in Entrepreneurs' Blocks 169. The special provisions which we adopt for designated entities are based, in part, on our mandate to fulfill the congressional goal that we disseminate licenses among a wide variety of applicants. 47 U.S.C. §309(j)(3)(B). Therefore, in adopting the financial assistance measures set forth in this Report and Order, we are concerned about the possibility, even if remote, that a few bidders will win a very large number of the licenses in the entrepreneurs' blocks. As a consequence, the benefits that Congress intended for designated entities would be enjoyed, in disproportionate measure, by only a few individuals or entities. Congress, in our view, did not intend that result. We shall therefore take steps to ensure that the financial assistance provided through our rules is dispersed to a reasonable number of applicants who win licenses in these blocks. 170. To achieve a fair distribution of the benefits intended by Congress, we shall impose a reasonable limit on the total number of licenses within the entrepreneurs' blocks that a single entity may win at auction. In setting this limit, we shall take care not to impose a restriction that would prevent applicants from obtaining a sufficient number of licenses to create large and efficient regional services. Specifically, we shall impose a limitation that no single entity may win more than 10 percent of the licenses available in the entrepreneurs' blocks, or 98 licenses. These licenses may all be in frequency block C or all in frequency block F, or in some combination of the two blocks. Such a limit will ensure that at least ten winning bidders enjoy the benefits of the entrepreneurs' blocks. At the same time, it will allow bidders to effectuate aggregation strategies that include large numbers of licenses and extensive geographic coverage. 171. Further, this limitation will apply only to the total number of licenses that may be won at auctions in these blocks; it is not an ownership cap that applies to licenses that might be obtained after the auctions. For purposes of implementing this restriction, we shall consider licenses to be won by the same entity if an applicant (or other entity) that controls, or has the power to control licenses won at the auction, controls or has the power to control another license won at the auction. 2. Definition of Small Business 172. In the Second Report and Order we adopted a definition for small businesses based on the standard definition used by the Small Business Administration (SBA). This definition permits an applicant to qualify for installment payments based on a net worth not in excess of $6 million with average net income after Federal income taxes for the two preceding years not in excess of $2 million. 13 CFR §121.601. 146 In the Second Report and Order, we noted, however, that, in certain telecommunications industry sectors, this limit may not be high enough to encompass those entities that, while needing the assistance provided by installment payments, have the financial wherewithal to construct and operate the systems. Therefore we indicated that, on a service specific basis, we might adjust this definition upward to accommodate capital intensive telecommunications businesses. See Second Report and Order at ¶267. 146 The SBA has recently changed its net worth/net income standard as it applies to its Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program. See 59 Fed. Reg. 16953, 16956 (April 8, 1994). The new standard for determining eligibility for small business concerns applying for financial and/or management assistance under the SBIC program was increased to $18 million net worth and $6 million after-tax net income. 15 CFR §121.802(a)(3)(i). The change in this size standard was attributable to an adjustment for inflation and changes in the SBIC program ``designed to strengthen and expand the capabilities of SBICs to finance small businesses so that they can increase their contribution to economic growth and job creation.'' 59 Fed. Reg. at 16955. However, Section 121.601, which was the SBA size standard cited in the Notice and the Second Report and Order, has not been modified by the SBA. For purposes of our generic competitive bidding rules, in consultation with the SBA, we will reexamine our $6 million net worth/$2 million annual profits definition in light of the SBA's recent action.
