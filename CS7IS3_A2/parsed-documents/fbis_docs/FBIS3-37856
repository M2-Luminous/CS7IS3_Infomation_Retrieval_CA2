Russia was ready to send more troops to Bosnia, if it was necessary, Kozyrev said in an interview to the Polish television in Krakow, where he took part in the [word indistinct] Russian confermce on the new partnership. It was a big delusion to think that NATO was able to solve every problem unilaterally. He criticized NATO members for deciding about the Sarajevo action without prior consultation with the east. NATO was last week ready to launch air strikes in the Sarajevo area acting on the ultimatum to the warring sides to demilitarize that city. In reality, the threats were addressed to the Bosnian Serbs alone. The Bosnian Serbs started withdrawing heavy weapons around Sarajevo on Friday, only after the Moscow initiative and guarantees, and Russian peacekeepers were deployed on the line dividing the Serb and Moslem side.
