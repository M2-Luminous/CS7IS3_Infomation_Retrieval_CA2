The ITAR-TASS correspondent was informed by sources within the Russian Governmental delegation that V. Chernomyrdin had stated the intention of Russia to firmly adhere to the course of developing friendly ties and cooperation, which accords with the interests of the two countries' peoples. The head of the Russian Cabinet informed the Hungarian president of the main directions of the Russian Government's policies, especially in the economic sphere. It was noted that a deepening of practical cooperation and the finding of mutually acceptable solutions to questions that arise should provide a firm and stable basis for the further progress of Russian-Hungarian trade and economic links. V. Chernomyrdin said also that Russia highly appreciates the level that has been achieved in bilateral relations, which are no longer burdened by any fundamental problems and are characterized by a fruitful political dialogue and constructive interaction between the Russian Federation and Hungary in a spirit of genuine equality and partnership. Today Russia occupies second place among Hungary's major economic partners. In its turn, Budapest is in sixth or seventh place among Moscow's main foreign trade partners, Arpad Goncz said. In the view of the Hungarian head of state, there is every chance that the economic interaction between the two countries can be made even more intensive. The legal and juridical base for this has already been created. In spite of the fact that "Western orientation" is considered a priority in the development of the Hungarian national economy, Budapest cannot allow itself not to expand its Eastern European links, above all with Russia. It is necessary to work out a joint document on the mutual protection of investments and to push forward cooperation in the financial sphere and in interaction between banks, Arpad Goncz stressed. After meeting the Hungarian president, Viktor Chernomyrdin laid wreaths at the monument to Soviet soldiers in Budapest's Freedom Square and at the monument in Heroes Square.
