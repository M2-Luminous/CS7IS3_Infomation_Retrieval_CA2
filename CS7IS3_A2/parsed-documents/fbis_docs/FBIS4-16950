They are needed to unify criminal liability for encroachment on all kinds of property, to enhance criminal liability for terrorism and contraband, to guarantee citizens' rights to necessary defence and more effective struggle against organised crime. Such is the essence of the federal law on amendments and supplements to the Russian criminal code and the Russian code of criminal procedure passed by the State Duma in the second reading on Wednesday. A number of amendments have been made to the criminal code in connection with a radical change of the socio-political situation in Russia over the recent years. Thus, wordings such as "socialist property" are dropped from the criminal code. References to crimes against "state and public property" are eliminated. All forms of property become equal. For instance, an encroachment on an enterprise of any kind, regardless of the form of property, is qualified as banditry. A new definition is given to such crimes as theft, robbery, plunder, fraud. The criminal code is supplemented with an article envisaging criminal liability for a failure to restore to Russia objects of artistic, historic or architectural value for Russian people if such a restoration is obligatory. Articles are introduced that envisage criminal responsibility for evading the payment of customs duties and for violating customs legislation. Separate articles envisages criminal liability for terrorism and for obstructing the discharge of duties by a procurator, an investigator or persons conducting an investigation. During the debating of the draft law on Wednesday the deputies extended from 10 to 12 years the maximum term of imprisonment for a theft in a particularly large amount committed by organised groups or by particularly dangerous habitual criminals. On an initiative of the faction of the Democratic Party of Russia, the criminal code was supplemented with two articles envisaging criminal liability for illegal transactions with foreign currency and for concealment or failure to remit sums in foreign currency.
