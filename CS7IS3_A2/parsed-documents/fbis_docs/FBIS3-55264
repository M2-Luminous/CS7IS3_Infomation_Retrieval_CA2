During an 11-minute report, correspondent Tatiana Ulyanova gives brief details about the Republic of Kabardino-Balkar and introduces its president, Valeriy Mukhamedovich Kokov, who is interviewed by the program's presenter. Asked whether he has established a hard-line dictatorship in the republic, Kokov replies: "I would not like to say that a hard-line dictatorship has been established on the territory of Kabardino-Balkar, but I can assert something else. We are in favor of discipline and order. It is for that reason that we take every measure to be in line with the both the political and economic changes that are occurring in the world, in good time and without excesses." The relative calm in the republic is explained by the ways and wisdom of the republic's peoples. "They demonstrated this," says Kokov, "in the elections that took place recently. They assessed the situation in a fairly wise manner and, in spite of all the efforts of the political leaders to divide society into a minimum of two camps, the people of Kabardino-Balkar gave two-thirds of the votes in favor of stopping the further disintegration of our fatherland, for law and order, that is, in support of the constitution. What is more, the people of Kabardino-Balkar elected a new parliament in accordance with the new constitution of the Russian Federation." Kokov then explains that he is giving this interview in the interval in the session. Kokov stresses that Kabardino-Balkar has exerted every effort to achieve a settlement in the Ossetian-Ingush conflict, and is opposed to revenge actions in such conflicts.
