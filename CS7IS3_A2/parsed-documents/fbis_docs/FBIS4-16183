The most important thing for the Russian diplomacy is that the problem be resolved," said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. "Our position presupposes that this problem can be resolved both at bilateral talks and in the framework of the U.N. Security Council, but even if this yields no results, possibilities of an international conference should be used," Panov said. According to Panov, a Russia-suggested idea of holding an international conference on problems of ensuring security and a nuclear-free status of the Korean Peninsula is being rejected neither by China, nor by Japan or South Korea. As for North Korea, at the present stage, Pyongyang is coming out for the settlement of the nuclear problem only at bilateral talks with the United States, Panov said. The Russian diplomat pointed out that Russia cannot agree with statements that an international conference will procrastinate the negotiating process. It is bilateral talks that impede the solution of the problem, he said. "One cannot say that this is a bilateral problem only. It concerns the whole world community once at issue is North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Moreover, this problem mostly concerns countries located in close proximity to the Korean Peninsula," the Russian diplomat said. He spoke on problems of the Korean Peninsula in connection with talks between heads of the Russian and South Korean foreign ministries scheduled on Thursday, which would be attended by South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu who arrived in Moscow today.
