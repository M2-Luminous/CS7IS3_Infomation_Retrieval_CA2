Downplaying the previous military criticism that the requirement would hinder the armed forces' arms acquisition process, Adm Prachet said the requirement represented a new policy and it should be welcomed as it would be beneficial to the country. Adm Prachet said that soldiers in democratic societies had no choice but to respect and obey and the Government's policy. [sentence as published] "In the democratic system, government officials have to follow the Government's policy and soldiers have to know their exact role in the system," said Adm Prachet, who will retire in 1996. The Navy commander said it was understandable that the Government's barter trade policy has caused confusion during its initial period. "Now the misunderstanding has been resolved. Initially, there are different views on the issue but now we have a clear understanding," explained the Navy commander. He said he was optimistic that problems would not occur during the implementation of the policy in acquiring arms. "There should be no problem," said the Navy commander. He said under the government barter trade policy the armed forces had to separately submit their arms acquisition plans to the Cabinet for approval should it exceeded 1 billion baht. Adm Prachet said he was optimistic that the Cabinet would give its final approval during its next meeting to the Navy's proposal to buy a new fleet of attacker A-7 Corsairs from the United States. He said the attacker was part of the Navy's development plan which would cost about 2,000 million baht.
