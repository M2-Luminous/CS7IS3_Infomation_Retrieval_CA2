The world economy is not always favorable. [passage indistinct] at times is hard to obtain. Therefore, the spirit of depending on ourselves, our own efforts, our own materials, our own resources -- human, material, and financial -- is the real background and foundation to any successful development activity. So this is the spirit from which we have to borrow here. We would also like to strengthen and encourage existing relations and areas of cooperation. We came here to borrow quite a lot of ideas. You have been successful in many fields, notwithstanding, of course, the fact that you are going through a very special period. This, however, further strengthens the spirit of the Revolution. Thus, forward we shall go. [end recording]
