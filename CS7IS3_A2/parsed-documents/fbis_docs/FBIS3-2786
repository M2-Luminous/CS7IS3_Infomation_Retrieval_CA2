He stressed that the human rights issue would be linked with the issue of China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status. Before his visit, he sent Assistant Secretary of State Shattuck ahead of him to make arrangements and to contact a very small number of people who have attempted to undermine China's stability and to collect pretexts for not extending MFN. Christopher thought that as long as he wielded the human rights club, he would certainly be able to gain something from his visit to China, not only interfering in China's internal affairs but also opening up the Chinese market and creating a new model of diplomacy between the two countries by forcing China to swallow his bitter medicine. However, China firmly adhered to its position and firmly rejected the U.S. concept of human rights. It reiterated that no one could interfere in China's internal affairs. Qian Qichen, Li Peng, and Jiang Zemin successively met with Christopher. They mentioned that China and the United States face a historical opportunity for economic and trade cooperation, and also talked about China's own concept of human rights. On the issue of human rights, the two sides frankly expressed their own opinions and arguments. The three Chinese leaders expressed the same point of view, and firmly safeguarded China's sovereignty. Premier Li Peng pointed out: "China and the United States hold different concepts of human rights. It is unfair to impose the human rights concept of the developed countries on developing countries. China and the United States can discuss their differences on the issue of human rights on an equal footing, and no pressure should be exerted by one side on the other. If MFN is rescinded, China will not be the only one to suffer losses, and losses suffered by the United States will not be smaller than those of China. China mainly relies on its domestic market and has a strong self-sufficient ability. If Sino-U.S. relations are good, economic and trade cooperation between the two counties will be free from artificial hindrances, and U.S. business circles will have a historical opportunity for development." Li Peng said China's imports would increase to $1,000 billion over the next seven years, and many imported items will be in areas which are strong points of the United States. On the other hand, Christopher conceded that his visit to China was aimed at seeking a long-term and stable cooperative relationship with China. Li Peng's arguments were mainly focused on the practical advantages of Sino-U.S. cooperation, and were quite convincing for the U.S. side. President Jiang Zemin responded to Christopher's viewpoint about linking the human rights issue with trade from an overall, long-term, and strategic point of view. Christopher's current visit to the East is aimed at implementing President Clinton's diplomatic policy toward the East. The United States is trying to make use of the opportunity of Asia's vigorous economic development to build closer relations with various Asian countries. If Christopher forgot this strategic task, he would just have returned home with both hands empty. Therefore, President Jiang Zemin proceeded from a strategically advantageous position in his talks with Christopher by reviewing his meeting with President Clinton. He said: "Sino-U.S. relations are more than bilateral relations. We should approach our bilateral relations from a worldwide view and give consideration to future development, especially in the 21st century. China and the United States share common interests on many major issues. So both sides should increase mutual trust, reduce trouble, develop cooperation, and prevent confrontation. President Clinton expressed agreement with my opinion." How come the U.S. position endorsed by Clinton changed when Christopher came to China? Christopher did not respond to this point. Jiang Zemin mentioned Christopher's personal experience of the process of normalizing Sino-U.S. relations during the Carter administration, and affirmed that he had good knowledge of the history of Sino-U.S. relations. In the past 45 years, Sino-U.S. relations have undergone innumerous twists and turns, and there have been both positive and negative experiences. "If both sides transcend ideology to develop cooperation, Sino-U.S. relations will advance. This is not only beneficial to both peoples but is also conducive to world peace and stability. If things go in the opposite direction, Sino-U.S. relations will encounter difficulties and setbacks." As far as human rights is concerned, Jiang Zemin pointed out sharply: Some people in the West are not really concerned about the rights, interests, and prosperity of the vast number of Chinese people; instead, they are only concerned about a small number of people who try to subvert the Chinese Government and undermine China's stability. "This is in essence a political issue and a legal issue rather than a human rights issue." China's viewpoint is identical with that held by other Asian countries. Even Lee Kuan Yew agrees with this. If these trouble-makers take power, China will be thrown into major chaos, and this would be unfavorable to the Chinese people. On completing his visit to Beijing, Christopher did not smile, because even the American Chamber of Commerce was opposed to his diplomatic approach. He had thrown away a golden opportunity to promote Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations and had returned with both hands empty. An American businessman pointed out: Human rights should not be linked with MFN, which should be given to China unconditionally. If favorable tariff arrangements between the two countries are removed, U.S.-Chinese relations will regress. In that case, China's losses would just be temporary, but losses suffered by the United States would be long-term losses. If the United States really wants to share in Asia's economic prosperity, President Clinton should actually honor his policy of supporting "a strong, stable, and prosperous China, which is in the national interests of the United States." If their deeds do not match their words and they still attempt to create trouble in China's political situation, then what they do will not be in the long-term interests of the United States; neither will this be favorable to peace, stability, and prosperity in Asia. After his debates with Chinese leaders, Christopher hesitated about what move to make. He did not express a clear position on MFN and behaved rather prudently. He needs to discuss with President Clinton to see whether the United States can actually use this card. It is certain that U.S. business circles will not support a diplomatic policy that will just harm the U.S. economy, because imposing sanctions against China is in fact an act of imposing sanctions against the United States itself.
