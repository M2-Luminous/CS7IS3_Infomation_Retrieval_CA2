ACTION: Public Land Order. SUMMARY: This order partially revokes the Secretarial orders dated October 22, 1919, and March 14, 1929, and Executive Order No. 8685, insofar as they affect 3.75 acres of public land withdrawn for the Colorado River and Yuma Storage Projects and the Imperial National Wildlife Refuge. The land is no longer serving the purposes for which it was withdrawn, and the revocation is needed to permit disposal of the land to the State of Arizona as partial compensation in a condemnation action under Title V of the Arizona-Idaho Conservation Act of 1988, 16 U.S.C. 460xx (1988), commonly referred to as the Santa Rita Legislation. This action will open the land to mineral leasing and surface entry and mining, unless closed by other withdrawals or segregations of record. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Mezes, BLM Arizona State Office, P.O. Box 16563, Phoenix, Arizona 85011, 602&hyph;650&hyph;0509. By virtue of the authority vested in the Secretary of the Interior by Section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1714 (1988), and the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of October 15, 1966, 16 U.S.C. 668dd (1988), as amended, it is ordered as follows: 1. The Secretarial Orders dated October 22, 1919, and March 14, 1929, which withdrew land for the Bureau of Reclamation's Colorado River and Yuma Storage Projects and Executive Order No. 8685, which withdrew land for the Fish and Wildlife Service's Imperial National Wildlife Refuge, are hereby revoked insofar as they affect the following described land: Gila and Salt River Meridian T. 5 S., R. 22 W., Sec. 13, W1/2W1/2NE1/4SW1/4SW1/4SE1/4, E1/2E1/2NW1/4SW1/4SW1/4SE1/4, W1/2W1/2E1/2NW1/4SW1/4SE1/4, and E1/2E1/2W1/2NW1/4SW1/4SE1/4. The area described contains 3.75 acres in Yuma County. 2. At 10 a.m. on June 13, 1994, the land will be opened to the operation of the public land laws generally, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record, and the requirements of applicable law. All valid applications received at or prior to 10 a.m. on June 13, 1994 shall be considered as simultaneously filed at that time. Those received thereafter shall be considered in the order of filing. 3. At 10 a.m. on June 13, 1994 the lands will be opened to location and entry under the United States mining laws and to the operation of the mineral leasing laws, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record, and the requirements of applicable law. Appropriation of any of the lands described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts. Dated: April 22, 1994. Bob Armstrong, Assistant Secretary of the Interior. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11668 Filed 5&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;32&hyph;P
