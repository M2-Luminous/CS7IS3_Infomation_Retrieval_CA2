According to the bureau, the State is now issuing a special ID-like certificate to the growing number of foreign experts that will enable them to make more convenient purchases and money exchanges. The regulation's main content is the ID certificate which is designed to make life more convenient for foreign experts. With it, experts can bring into China such working tools as personal computers without paying custom duties. They can also exchange foreign currencies at the Bank of China. Foreign experts are hired by the state for such things as teaching at universities or editing for newspapers or publishing houses. In most cases their contracts stipulate that they are paid a percentage of their salary in renminbi. According to Ma Junru, director-general of SBFE, more than 50,000 foreigners worked for China last year, including 11,000 experts in universities, newspapers, and publishing houses. There were also 4,500 special economic and technical experts, more than 20,000 foreign engineers for big construction contracts, and 10,000 overseas staff in foreign-funded enterprises, Ma said. They will all receive the new identification certificate. Foreign professionals have been invited to China since the founding of the People's Republic. But they shied away from China until the 1980's. The experts in university and journalistic units earn 2,000 yuan ($230) to 4,800 yuan ($552) a month plus free housing, a vacation bonus, and round-trip plane tickets. But the 4,500 economic and technical experts actually receive no salary apart from stipends. Usually retirees, they voluntarily help with their knowledge and experience. Foreign engineers earn $300 to $1,200 a day working on construction sites of power plants, expressways, and chemical complexes in line with their contracts. According to Ma, foreigners now work in every province, municipality, and autonomous region including landlocked regions like Tibet and Xinjiang. "Foreign intellectual resources have instilled great momentum into China's modernization drive," he said. Foreign experts have helped in "establishing a market system in China, solving technical difficulties in important construction projects, industrial and agricultural production, and spreading advanced technology," he added. Meanwhile, Ma told China Daily that SBFE will help import more fruit and vegetables from Europe and South America to enrich the national dinner table variety.
