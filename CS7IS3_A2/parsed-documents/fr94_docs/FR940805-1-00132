Subpart A_General §91.1 Purpose. (a) Overall goals. (1) The overall goals of the community development and planning programs covered by this part are to strengthen partnerships with jurisdictions to extend and strengthen partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector, including for-profit and nonprofit organizations, to enable them to provide decent housing, establish and maintain a suitable living environment, and expand economic opportunities for every American, particularly for very low-income and low-income persons. (i) Decent housing includes assisting homeless persons to obtain appropriate housing and assisting persons at risk of becoming homeless; retention of the affordable housing stock; and increasing the availability of permanent housing in standard condition and affordable cost to low-income and very low-income families, particularly to members of disadvantaged minorities, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability. Decent housing also includes increasing the supply of supportive housing, which combines structural features and services needed to enable persons with special needs to live with dignity and independence. (ii) A suitable living environment includes improving the safety and livability of neighborhoods; increasing access to quality public and private facilities and services; reducing the isolation of income groups within a community or geographical area through the spatial deconcentration of housing opportunities for persons of lower income and the revitalization of deteriorating or deteriorated neighborhoods; restoring and preserving properties of special historic, architectural, or aesthetic value; and conservation of energy resources. (iii) Expanded economic opportunities includes the provision of jobs accessible to housing affordable to low income persons, including provision of jobs involved in carrying out activities under programs covered by this plan to low-income persons living in areas affected by those programs and activities; availability of mortgage financing for low income persons at reasonable rates using nondiscriminatory lending practices; access to capital and credit for development activities that promote the long-term economic and social viability of the community; and empowerment and self-sufficiency opportunities for low income persons to reduce generational poverty in federally assisted and public housing. (2) The consolidated submission described in this part 91 requires the jurisdiction to state in one document its plan to pursue these goals for all the community planning and development programs, as well as for housing programs. It is these goals against which the plan and the jurisdiction's performance under the plan will be evaluated by HUD. (b) Functions of plan. The consolidated plan serves the following functions: (1) A planning document for the jurisdiction, which builds on a participatory process at the lowest levels; (2) An application for federal funds under HUD's formula grant programs;
