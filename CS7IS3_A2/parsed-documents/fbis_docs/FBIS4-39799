Kiev, according to Russian Ambassador to Ukraine Leonid Smolyakov, agrees to this in principle. But Leonid Kravchuk, forced to make concessions that do not add luster to his image as a "patriot," put forward a new slogan in the course of his Zhitomir tour. In his words, "instead of nuclear missiles Ukraine intends to have high- precision arms." The latest round of Black Sea Fleet talks discussed the division of not only the bases but also the shore-based infrastructure. By the start of the discussions that moved from Sevastopol to Kiev, the experts did a certain amount of work: according to Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the Russian Navy, the parameters in accordance with which the division of ships will take place "have been basically determined" already by both the experts and the economists. Members of the delegations were briefed on the results of this work. Some, of course, had more ideas "up their sleeve," hearing which Adm. Gromov thinks "different points of view on separate questions cannot be ruled out." Agreement on Sevastopol, though, was on the whole sewn up. In the program of further talks is the division of the remaining naval bases along the Crimean coast. Considering perhaps that the talks on the Black Sea Fleet would hardly be over by 26 June (election date), Kravchuk avoided serious statements about dividing the fleet. But on the other hand, he told the officers and cadets of the Zhitomir Air Defense Radio Electronics Higher Military School about new prospects of boosting the republic's military might. He pointed out that in Ukraine (as also "both in Russia, and in the United States") "scientific exploration" is under way to develop some sort of "high-precision weapon with assigned parameters." Leonid Makarovich [Kravchuk] did not go into details, hinting vaguely that this weapon "is capable of engaging installations that carry danger, and of protecting from weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons included." It is this secret weapon that Ukraine intends to add to its arsenal "instead of the nuclear missiles that are being destroyed." Interestingly, Kravchuk divulged this "military secret" attesting to the president's tireless care about the army and the military-industrial complex precisely in the home stretch of the election race and precisely before the grateful audience of a military school. In the course of the Zhitomir tour, however, he also found what to say to the workers of a woodworking combine (prospects of the sector's growth), and to those who work in agriculture (also prospects, but those concerning agriculture). Should Kravchuk continue to concentrate on similar problems (avoiding the less than advantageous subject of the Black Sea Fleet) there may appear a chance for Russia and Ukraine finally to agree about the fleet.
