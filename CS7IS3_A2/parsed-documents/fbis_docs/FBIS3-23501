Volodko, honored figure of science and engineering of the Russian Federation and State Prize laureate, under the rubric "Flight Safety: Investigating Flight Accidents": "Modeling Gives the Answers"] [Text] Methods of mathematical modeling associated with the use of high-speed computers are becoming more and more widespread in the investigation of flight accidents [LPs], dangerous failures of aircraft hardware and errors by the flight personnel. The urgency of their use could seem, at first glance, not very great for modern aircraft equipped with Tester or MSRP-64 type flight data recording gear (BUR). The informativeness of specific types of BUR naturally differs, but it provides a sufficiently complete representation of the nature of the development and, in the aggregate with a host of one-time commands, on the possible cause for the appearance of an emergency situation in flight. The parameters recorded, at the same time, frequently prove to be insufficient to establish the true cause of an LP. In order to make a judgment regarding the pattern of the airflow around an airframe, for example, it is essential to know the angles of attack and slip, which are not on the recording list. Most importantly, not one kind of BUR can determine the trajectory of aircraft movement, and it is the last leg of a flight (before an aircraft hits the ground), after all, that is of the greatest practical interest in the investigation of a flight accident. The MSRP-12-93 magnetic flight recording system, installed on the An-12, An-26, Tu-95 and Tu-22 aircraft and Mi-6 helicopter in particular, records only 12 analog parameters of a flight, including the barometric pressure and indicated airspeed, vertical G-forces, angles of deflection of the controls, angles or angular velocities of pitch and roll and two or three diagnostic parameters of the operation of the power plant. The SARPP-12 optical recording system employed on the MiG-23 aircraft and Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters puts only six analog parameters onto photographic film. They are insufficient, in both cases, for an analysis of the development of an emergency situation and the establishment of the causes for an LP. It also happens that the information medium is destroyed, lost or stolen. A representation of the trajectory and nature of the movement of an aircraft on the last leg of its flight is formulated in such cases according to indirect indications (sketch maps, ground objects destroyed, the results of study of the aircraft hardware, the indications of witnesses and the like). Mathematical modeling of the dynamics of a flight thus proves to be useful and necessary, both with the availability of information from flight data recording systems and, the more so, in the absence of it for any reason. When investigating a flight accident it allows, by way of example, computation of the parameters of aircraft movement according to a known initial flight mode and assumed destabilizing factors. The legitimacy of versions that are put forth with reference to the circumstances of the flight accident is analyzed, in that case, according to the results of mathematical modeling of the dynamic reaction of the aircraft to the effects of disturbances caused by the failures of the aircraft hardware or erroneous controlling actions of the pilot that are being considered. Tasks of the second type (the reciprocal task of flight dynamics) are also posed and resolved in those cases when, according to the objective data (information from the on-board recording devices, radar plotting of the flight route), the trajectory of movement and the angular position of the aircraft are known, with unknown destabilizing factors present. The forces and moments required for the parameters of such movement, as well as the necessary settings of the controls to create them, are determined according to the results of the mathematical modeling. This provides an opportunity, based on cause-and-effect links, to single out from among the aggregate of proposed versions only those that satisfy, or at least do not contradict, the actual parameters of the aircraft flight in the emergency situation. An evaluation of the good working order of the aircraft hardware is accomplished only for an aircraft equipped with the Tester or MSRP-64 systems. The flight mass (m), center of gravity of the aircraft, trim positions of the controls, stability reserves, moments of extension or retraction of the flaps or air brakes, changes in the sweep angle of the wings and some other important data can be singled out therein when investigating an LP. The dynamic equations of Euler are the methodological foundation for modeling the dynamics of aircraft movement, with the aircraft in most cases considered to be an absolute solid body of constant mass (1): m(V[.sup]x[/] + _o_[.sub]y[/]V[.sub]z[/] -_o_[.sup]z[/]V[.sub]y[/]) = R[.sub]x[/], m(V[.sup]y[/] + _o_[.sub]z[/]V[.sub]x[/] -_o_[.sup]x[/]V[.sub]z[/]) = R[.sub]y[/], m(V[.sup]z[/] + _o_[.sub]x[/]V[.sub]y[/] -_o_[.sup]y[/]V[.sub]x[/]) = R[.sub]z[/], I[.sup]x[/]_o_[.sub]x[/] + (I[.sub]z[/] -I[.sup]y[/])_o_[.sub]y[/]_o_[.sub]z[/] -I[.sup]xy[/]_o_[.sub]y[/] = M[.sub]x[/], I[.sup]y[/]_o_[.sub]y[/] + (I[.sub]x[/] -I[.sup]z[/])_o_[.sub]x[/]_o_[.sub]z[/] -I[.sup]xy[/]_o_[.sub]x[/] = M[.sub]y[/], I[.sup]z[/]_o_[.sub]z[/] + (I[.sub]y[/] -I[.sup]x[/])_o_[.sub]x[/]_o_[.sub]y[/] + I[.sup]xy[/](_o_[.sub]y[/][.sup]2[/] -_o_[.sup]x[/][.sup]2[/]) = M[.sub]z[/], where V[.sup]x[/], V[.sub]y[/], V[.sub]z[/], _o_[.sup]x[/], _o_[.sub]y[/] and _o_[.sub]z[/] are projections of the linear and angular velocity of the aircraft on the right body axis of the system of coordinates; R[.sup]x[/], R[.sub]y[/], R[.sub]z[/], M[.sub]x[/], M[.sup]y[/] and M[.sub]z[/] are projections on the same coordinates of the resultant forces and moments acting on the aircraft; and, I[.sup]x[/], I[.sub]y[/], I[.sub]z[/] and I[.sup]xy[/] are the moments of inertia of the aircraft with regard to the corresponding axes of the coordinates. For a helicopter, the system of equations (1) is usually supplemented with an equation of the dynamic of rotation of the main rotor: I[.sup]r[/]_o_ = M[.sub]eng[/] - M[.sub]t[/], where _o_ is the angular velocity of the rotation of the main rotor; M[.sup]eng[/] is the available rotating moment of the engines; M[.sup]t[/] is the required torque of the main and tail rotors; and, I[.sup]r[/] is the polar moment of inertia of the main rotor and the assemblies kinematically linked with it. The angular velocities of pitch _o_[.sup]z[/], roll _o_[.sup]x[/] and yaw _o_[.sub]y[/] are determined as a result of integrating the equations for the dynamic of aircraft rotations with regard to the center of mass, and are used to compute the corresponding angles _n_, _g_, and _ps_. The trajectory of movement in the system of ground coordinates is determined according to the components of the forward speed of flight V[.sup]x[/], V[.sub]y[/], and V[.sup]z[/] and the angles _n_, _g_, and _ps_. The forces R[.sup]x[/], R[.sub]y[/] and R[.sub]z[/] and the moments M[.sup]x[/], M[.sub]y[/] and M[.sup]z[/] acting on the aircraft and determining the right portions of the system of equations (1) are quite complex, non-linear functions of the design parameters of the aircraft and the kinematic parameters of its flight (the speed and barometric altitude, angles of attack and slip, angular velocities of pitch, roll and yaw, positions of the controls). These forces and moments are determined by the aerodynamic design of the aircraft, and are entered into the computer using interpolation tables, polynomials or rough approximation formulas. The law of automatic control of aircraft flight is usually realized in the form T[.sup]�_D_�+_D_�[/] = K[.sub]1[/]_D_q + K[.sup]2[/]_D_q[.sub]i[/], where D[.sup]�[/]is the settings of the controls (elevator, stabilizer, ailerons, cyclic pitch control and the like); _D_q[.sup]i[/] is the change in the kinematic parameters being controlled or stabilized (angle of pitch or roll, heading, speed and altitude of the flight) from the set trim position; and T[.sup]�[/]K[.sub]i[/] is a constant for time and the gear ratio of the SAU [automatic control system] (autopilot). The modeling of the operation of the power plant plays an important role in investigating an LP, the more so as it is namely its failure in flight that is the cause of most emergency situations and accidents. The mathematical model of the power plant, in its most general and simplified form, includes the known operational characteristics of the engines (throttle, altitude and speed, climatic), an equation for the dynamics of the turbocompressor rotor T[.sup]n[/]_D_n[.sub]tc[/] + _D_n[.sub]tc[/] = K[.sup]G[/]_D_G[.sub]T[/], and the law of engine control T[.sup]G[/]_D_G[.sub]T[/] + _D_G[.sub]T[/] = K[.sup]_a_[/]_D__a_[.sub]ec[/], as well as the laws for the automatic regulation and limitation of the defining parameters of the engines. Here _D_n[.sup]TK[/] and _D_G[.sub]T[/] are the changes in the rotational frequency of the turbocompressor rotor and the hourly consumption of fuel compared to their established values in the initial flight mode of the aircraft; _D__a_[.sup]ec[/] is the setting of the engine control level from the set trim position; and, T[.sup]G[/] and K[.sub]G[/] are a time constant and a transfer factor defining the characteristics of the engine (time of pickup and throttling). The mathematical model for the dynamic of the flight defines the unstable three-dimensional controlled movement of the aircraft in special situations, caused by the failure of the aircraft hardware, erroneous control actions by the pilot or intensive external influences. The modeling of disturbing factors is usually accomplished in the form of various time functions with varying parameters, approximately describing objective data on the circumstances of the flight accident and (or) put forward in the course of investigating a version as the possible cause of an accident. One may cite as examples of the modeling of typical disturbing factors: --the complete, unexpected failure of one of the two engines, accompanied by a reduction in its thrust or power according to a law close to exponential; --the mechanical jamming of a control channel; --the break-off of a piece of the main rotor, accompanied by the effect of cyclical unbalanced centrifugal force _D_Nsin_o_t; --the effects on the aircraft of a vertical ascending gust of wind with a velocity W and gradient section of velocity build-up _t_. The disturbing factors are naturally individual in each specific case in the investigation of a flight accident, but their modeling requires a certain experience and skill of the researcher. Mathematical modeling is successfully employed, aside from the global task of flight dynamics considered, to resolve a broad circle of partial but in practice exceedingly important tasks, among which could be included: --the ballistic computation of the trajectory of destroyed elements of an aircraft that have separated in flight (stabilizer surfaces, parts of a propeller blade, cockpit canopy and the like); --modeling of the non-standard interaction of the SAU with elements of the piloting and navigational system; --computation of the intensive flywheel movement of an elastic main rotor blade accompanying a blow by the end of the blade against the tail boom of the helicopter in a single-rotor configuration; --modeling of the overturning of a helicopter in a non-design-rated turn in taxiing etc. Improvements in the mathematical models, for the realization of which personal computers are beginning to be utilized successfully, including those using leads coming from on-board flight data recording gear, are constantly underway.
