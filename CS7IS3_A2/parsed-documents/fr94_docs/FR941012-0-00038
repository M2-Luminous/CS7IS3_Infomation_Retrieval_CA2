FR941012-0-00038 FR941012-0-00011 1. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes annual reports that list the estimates of injuries in the private sector during the year under consideration, Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 2&hyph;2, 2&hyph;3, 2&hyph;4, 2&hyph;5, 2&hyph;6, 2&hyph;7, 2&hyph;8, 2&hyph;9, 2&hyph;10, 2&hyph;30, 38B and 38C). The data and information are broken down industry by industry according to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. The BLS injury reports and data are generated from inquiries to selected employers about the OSHA Form 200 (Log and Summary of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses). Table 1 shows BLS occupational injury incidence data for the logging industry for 1972 through 1991. The data in Table 1 were derived from the BLS data using SIC code 241 (Logging Camps and Logging Contractors). While this classification covers the majority of the employees engaging in logging operations, it does not cover loggers employed by mills (SIC 242&hyph;Sawmills and Planing Mills) and other loggers working for other miscellaneous employers (SIC 24&hyph;Lumber and Wood Products, Except Furniture). Although the incidence rates for SIC 242 and 24 are very close to the rates for SIC 241, OSHA did not include incidence rates for those SIC codes in its determination of incidence rates for logging because BLS does not provide incidence rates for occupational categories within a SIC code. As such, OSHA was not able to identify and segregate out the percentage of accidents which occurred while employees were performing logging as opposed to other operations in those related industries. OSHA is aware that there has been a move on the part of some mill owners to increasingly use private contractors rather than mill employees to harvest the trees that the mills process. OSHA believes, however, that SIC 241 does capture the vast majority of employees performing logging operations. To the extent that some logging operations may still be performed by employees in other than SIC 241, OSHA does not believe that their accident data significantly alter the level of risk present in logging operations.
