What is the difference between him and Bill Clinton in your view? [Vranitzky] The atmosphere was correct and even friendly. Yet it would have been difficult for me to discuss social and employment issues with him. This is completely different with Bill Clinton. I met him in 1991 during a meeting of the so-called Bilderberger in Baden-Baden, during which these issues were also discussed. Basically, however, it is not up to me to define the differences in the styles of two U.S. Presidents. As a small country that was liberated in 1945 and became fully independent in 1955 with the help of the large United States, Austria's main interest must be to raise its profile in the United States. [Pelinka] You seem to be visiting the United States quite often. [Vranitzky] During numerous visits -- formerly as a financial manager and now as chancellor -- I have noticed that Austria is not really represented on a large scale. The second reason for my frequent visits is a political one -- specifically the joint interest of our two countries in the stabilization of Central and East Europe, and the joint interest in a stronger United Nations that has one of its headquarters in Vienna. [Pelinka] In this respect, you proposed the convening of a conference in Vienna for the settlement of the economic problems in the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Don't you think that there have been enough conferences on this topic? Are the real problems not somewhere else -- particularly in view of the tragedy of Gorazde? Is the planned reconstruction of in this largely destroyed region topical at a time when a bloody war is still raging there? [Vranitzky] Like everybody who is dealing intensively with this problem, I am a little helpless. After the adoption of the cease-fire in and around Sarajevo, the Serbs have again started massive armed aggressions. First, the armed hostilities must now be stopped with all means that seem useful. However, generally, I am afraid that it will be even more difficult to find a political solution for the postwar period. The world community is currently very reserved in this conflict. For this reason, I will submit my proposal. We Austrians are not entitled to call for a stronger military commitment because we cannot participate. [Pelinka] Don't you think that the proposal that you are presenting here in the United States might be interpreted as another sign that the Europeans again want a stronger U.S. commitment because they themselves cannot solve the problem? [Vranitzky] In this specific case, this is not true because the proposal was coordinated with Bonn, Rome, and Helsinki. [Pelinka] Many Europeans, particularly conservative ones, are currently displaying anti-Americanism. Has it been triggered by the disappointment about the failure of Reaganomics, and by the insight that the United States has remained a superpower -- in fact, the only one -- but that it no longer is the leading conservative power in a Cold War that no longer exists? [Vranitzky] Reaganomics has proved inefficient and is outdated. However, I have never believed that European and U.S. interests can be separated, and that efforts to assign the United States a leading role in the Far East are not useful. The United States has always intervened at the right time -- in the Panama conflict against Noriega, in the Gulf war against Saddam, now in Sarajevo, and in the Middle East Peace process. Despite all reservations against the U.S. system -- in the social and health spheres, for example -- it has always proven to be able to renew itself. [Pelinka] Are you saying that Europe should not increase its distance from the United States if the European Union [EU] turns out to be successful, or if the Western European Union becomes stronger and even turns into an alternative to NATO? [Vranitzky] Particularly from the Austrian viewpoint, a greater distance would be nonsense. We must not advocate Eurocentrism, and we must not pretend that Europe can become a fortress. As far as the military aspect is concerned, membership in NATO is not topical. We are primarily interested in the creation of a European security system. [Pelinka] Austria has a large trade deficit vis-a-vis the United States. Our exports involve 15 billion schillings and our imports 25 billion. Will we be able to develop more strength in the U.S. market once we are a member of the EU? [Vranitzky] We must not rely on others in this respect. Everything depends exclusively on our own strength. Let me give you a few positive examples: The BMW works in Steyr, the development of a Diesel engine for passenger vehicles, the establishment of a BMW factory in the United States, and the development of an Austrian-produced Diesel motor for this factory. This became possible because our tax reform has made investment in Austria more attractive for BMW.
