Early on Wednesday [9 February] morning at a meeting with Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, allegedly "a call was born, which will probably grow into a 16-member platform," the paper says. "Two sources have told us independently that it was a declaration about two and a half pages long, in which the members of the alternative announce their desire for a broad coalition without the participation of the top members of political parties and movements. They consider this solution a temporary one, because they are counting on an agreement on early elections being called next year," NARODNA OBRODA writes. The call was preceded by Friday's [4 February] summoning of deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac by Slovak Prime Minister and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar, who accused him of proceeding incorrectly during the parliamentary crisis in organizing the active participation of several deputies' groups in parliament. Reservations concerning Kovac and Moravcik were heard at the HZDS on Monday [7 February], the paper notes. An alternative program within the governing movement did not have to radically influence the change in the balance of power in parliament. "Nor can it be ruled out that the new platform will continue to vote in unison with the coalition and the balance between the HZDS and the opposition, a pair of horses, will be preserved," the paper writes. At the same time, though, the declaration in favor of a wider coalition without top party members and in favor of early election is an "indirect declaration by part of the movement of lack of confidence in the methods and style of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's work," the paper believes. "The clash of these two conceptions could end with the faction's defeat at a party assembly, but the snowball effect in the HZDS could also bury its leader under an avalanche," says NARODNA OBRODA.
