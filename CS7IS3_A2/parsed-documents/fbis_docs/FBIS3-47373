By recently bringing to the front experts in Korean issues and the press, they are repeatedly waging smear and defamation against our socialist system, and are speaking ill of us by talking about our so-called economic difficulties and so forth. Moreover, they are rashly acting to slander even our system. They also openly revealed the ambition for military reinvasion of our country. The new state advocates [sin kukka chuuija], like Ozawa, representative of the Japan Renewal Party; and Nakanishi, former director general of the Japan Defense Agency, branded us as No.1 imaginary enemy by maximizing our nuclear issue and missile threat. They said that in the event a state of emergency is created on the Korean peninsula, they will cope with it jointly with Japan, the United States, and South Korea as one. They even made absurd and bellicose remarks that a preemptive attack should be the basis of Japan's national strategy. Some media also joined this. As soon as it greeted the new year, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported that because our country is a most dangerous and entirely unpredictable nation, Japan, as its neighbor, should not forget its existence, and that Japan would participate in war on the Korean peninsula. As has been proven, the Japanese right-wing reactionaries and some media have lost their discretion and are maliciously slandering us. Regarding such an act by the Japanese reactionaries as a challenge to us, we consider it a grave act. The anti-Republic smear campaign of the Japanese reactionaries is a product of the consciousness of crisis of those who are struck with terror at the might and invincibility of the anthropocentric socialist system of our country. In recent years, socialism was frustrated in some countries and capitalism was restored. Cheering this, the imperialists are scheming to eliminate socialism from the earth forever and their spearhead has been directed at our Republic. Our people, however, are vigorously accelerating socialist construction by upholding the banner of chuche socialism and by overcoming repeated difficulties even amid political and military pressure, threat, and economic blockade of the enemies. The superiority of ever-victorious socialism in our country and the might of chuche Korea have been fully demonstrated. This worked as encouraging might to the world's people who are fighting for the socialist cause--the cause of independence. A number of reactionaries, who ran amok to smash our socialism, crumbled to the ground by themselves. Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are trying maliciously to detract from the attraction of our socialism and isolate and stifle us. This is one of the reasons they are stubbornly resorting to the hostile, false propaganda aimed at besmirching the dignity and authority of our Republic, while distorting facts and reversing black and white. This proves that the Japanese reactionaries are the most atrocious enemy of socialism. It is no doubt that if they continuously resort to anti-Republic and antisocialist maneuvers, they will be subject to stern denunciation as the enemy of all of the world's progressive people who are advancing toward socialism. If those who are regarded as quick-witted [yaksa pparuda] people act foolishly ignoring the solemn reality existing in front of them, they will only be reflected as pitiful existence to the people. It is a nasty habit of the Japanese reactionaries to try to attain their sinister aims by vilifying others. Today prospects opened for the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. As has been reported, holding the third round of talks, our country and the United States agreed to settle in a package [ilgwal tagyol] the issues for the essential solution of the nuclear problem. Many countries in the world and progressive people welcome such developments in the situation. Even political quarters, social circles, and academic sectors in Japan raised voices demanding the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and improvement of DPRK-U.S. relations. Nevertheless, only the Japanese right-wing reactionaries and their followers are opposed to this. The Japanese right-wing reactionaries are all militarists and revanchists obsessed with an irresistible zeal for reinvasion. They are stepping up their moves to turn Japan into a military power and arm it with nuclear weapons and have justified this by raising the fiction about our nuclear threat and missile threat. If the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula is solved and DPRK-U.S. relations are improved, the Japanese reactionaries will be unable to use this fiction any more as an excuse. This is the reason why the Japanese reactionaries are trying hard to hamper the solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula and the improvement of relations between the DPRK and the United States. Japan's attempt to be a military power and to arm itself with nuclear weapons does not originate from someone's threat but entirely originates from the Japanese militarists' demand for realizing the ambition for overseas aggression. The Japanese reactionaries regard the Korean peninsula as their first target. This is actually proven by fact -- the Japanese right-wing reactionaries have not hesitated to say that if an emergency situation takes place on the Korean peninsula, a preemptive attack should be basic in the state's strategy and Japan will participate in the war on the Korean peninsula. In the past, the Japanese imperialists occupied Korea for approximately 40 years and imposed innumerable miseries and sufferings on the Korean people. Our people have not forgotten the Japanese imperialists' atrocities of sanguinary slaughters and their cruel activities of exploitation and plunder. Our people cannot refrain from expressing wrath at the Japanese imperialists. If the Japanese reactionaries have a bit of conscience, they should truly apologize to our people for the great miseries and sufferings and should compensate for them. Instead of liquidating the past full of crimes, however, the Japanese reactionaries are running wild through thick and thin in a bid to achieve the ambition for the great East Asia coprosperity sphere by reviving the past. The Japanese reactionaries' way of thinking and position are not different from those of the Japanese imperialists at all. We cannot but point out that the Japanese right-wing reactionaries' false propaganda against the DPRK is aimed at making Japan's politics reactionary and fascist and at obstructing the improvement of DPRK- Japanese relations. On the pretext of the threat from North Korea, they are trying to pressure those who call for improvement of DPRK- Japanese relations. Today's reality shows that if the Japanese Government authorities continue to leave alone the right-wing reactionaries to run wild recklessly, Japan would be made all the more reactionary and thereby the Japanese people themselves would suffer therefrom, and then, the neighboring countries would not be safe either. The more the Japanese reactionaries adhere to the stratagem against the DPRK, the more this proves the validity of our socialist cause. No false propaganda and reckless military strength obliterate [malsal] the socialism of our own style centered on the popular masses, which brilliantly gives off its ray. The Japanese reactionaries are conducting the activity to eliminate someone, without considering the single-hearted unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses and the might of our socialist self-reliant national economy and the self- defense in the national defense. This reminds us of the saying, Fools rush in where angels fear to thread. The Japanese right-wing reactionaries should give up the foolish thought -- like breaking a rock with head. Only fools can conduct excessive proud activity. Our people and People's Army are closely watching with a high degree of vigilance the Japanese reactionaries' anti-DPRK and antisocialist maneuvers. Our people will never pardon those who are trying to impair the national dignity. We solemnly warn the Japanese reactionaries: If the Japanese reactionaries constantly persist in the reckless anti-DPRK and antisocialist maneuvers, they will not get good results. They must stop acting rashly.
