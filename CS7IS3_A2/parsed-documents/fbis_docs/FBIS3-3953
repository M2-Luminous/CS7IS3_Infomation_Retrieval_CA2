"The reason we stand for seeking a solution through dialogue is that we believe this issue can be solved through it," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Spokesman Wu Jianmin told journalists at his weekly briefing, "We oppose exerting pressure as this will only serve to sharpen the conflict," he said when asked if China would veto UN Security Council sanctions. "Exerting pressure is not helpful for carrying out dialogue, and we do not wish to see the issue referred to the UN Security Council," he said. Wu did not respond to questions on whether Beijing and Pyongyang are presently holding consultations. He said despite present difficulties, previous talks had progressed and he called on all sides to show patience.
