The measure does not affect Moscow though the number of broadcasts in St. Petersburg have been reduced, he said. Cutbacks in the number of TV programs on two state-run channels follows a decision by communications workers in response to a Rbl 80 Bn debt run by the Ostankino and All Russia TV companies. Russian PM Viktor Chernomyrdin after Wednesday's meeting with Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak and Ostankino TV Company Chairman Alexander Yakovlev instructed the Finance Ministry to raise funds to help phase out the debt. Glubokov said regional broadcasting would resume as repayment was made.
