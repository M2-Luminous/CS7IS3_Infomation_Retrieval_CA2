"I want to reaffirm the support of the United States for a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East," Clinton told reporters at the White House before meeting with Husayn. Clinton expressed his welcome to King Husayn back to the White House [as received] and said that "I support his courage and vision in renewing his efforts to make peace with Israel." "This remains a very important priority for me and for our administration, and I am very encouraged by where we are now in the whole process, and especially by efforts that King Husayn has made," the President said. It was reported that King Husayn was ready to take major steps toward normal relations with Israel and would not wait for similar progress in Israel's dealings with other Arab countries. Asked if he is seeking a separate peace with Israel, Husayn said that "I'm seeing the beginning of serious negotiation on the agenda that was ratified here in Washington as rapidly as possible" [as received]. "This is what we expected to be engaged in in the coming period," Husayn said, "but beyond that, we certainly would share with the President our hope that we will have a comprehensive peace in the entire region."
