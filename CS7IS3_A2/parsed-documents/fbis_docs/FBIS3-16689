According to Aleksey Krysanov, department chief at the General Machine-Building Design Bureau, which is charged with designing the new space port, the feasibility study of the new space centre will be completed before the end of 1994. The preliminary plans provide for these of first two and then five silos for launching light booster rockets of the Rokot (Rumbler) type and two new launch pads for the lift-off of the heavy Angara-24 boosters. No huge outlays are required for the first launches of the Rokot missiles -- specialists will do with two of the several tens of silos left behind by the military missile division which was disbanded under the START II agreement last autumn after serving the country's defenses since 1968. The silos, measuring more than 20 meters in depth and 4.2 meters across, some equipment and the control room as well as the life-support system were also left intact after the military took away their "toys." Some new equipment has to be installed and launches for peaceful purposes can begin. Rokot missiles can be launched from the silos. Two launches have already been effected from Baykonur. After some modifications the missiles, earlier used for defence purposes, will lift off light military and civilian satellites. Aleksey Krysanov stressed that the missile division used to occupy an area of several tens of square kilometers. The new spaceport will need less land. The remainder will be re-cultivated before being returned to civilian authorities.
