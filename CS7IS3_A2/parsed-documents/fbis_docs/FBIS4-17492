He underlined that during the visit of the Russian parliamentary delegation to Strasbourg he said at the sitting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council that one should take into consideration Russia's opportunity to influence the situation in Yugoslavia to a greater extent. "One should not resort to arms until all other opportunities are used. Now the Russian Foreign Ministry is sticking to this position and we entirely share it," said Podoprigora. He pointed out that in contrast to the State Duma there are no contradictions on this issue within the Federation Council and said that the lower chamber had sent its own delegation to Yugoslavia in order to clarify its position. However, as Podoprigora said, "deputies should interfere in practical policy only in extreme cases, their aim is to determine foreign political strategy and decide on how to coordinate foreign policy with the Constitution and current legislation." Podoprigora said that according to the Constitution the president determines foreign policy and the parliament prepares decrees. That's why the Federation council does not intend to consider issues on Russian policy in Yugoslavia at its sittings, said Podoprigora.
