FR940314-2-00091 FR940314-2-00053 Considering the limited nature of the proposed directed service operation, e.g., only two active shippers on the 3.6 mile CCRY line, CRR has asked that in order for CRR to waive all compensation from the Federal government otherwise applicable under 49 U.S.C. 11125(b)(5), that it be allowed to condition it's offer to provide uncompensated directed service by limiting its initial 60-day operation to only those portions of the CCRY lines that CRR determines can be safely operated; that CRR not be required to improve any CCRY lines that it believes are unsafe to operate; that it be allowed to perform needed switching service to shippers using crews from its through trains, and that it be allowed to utilize CCRY maintenance of way employees in conjunction with its own employees only to the extent practicable for its limited operations. Considering CCRY's cessation of service without alternative and its apparent inability to continue due to its cash position, we find that CCRY's current situation meets the standards of 49 U.S.C. 11125(a)(1) and (3). In view of the need for continued rail service over CCRY's lines and CRR's willingness to provide directed service without compensation from the Federal government, this decision grants the requests of interested parties for interim service authority to CRR. The emergency nature of the situation compels us to conclude that advance public notice and hearings would be impractical and contrary to the immediate public interest in assuring the immediate resumption of essential rail transportation services. Accordingly, we exercise our authority under 49 U.S.C. 11125(a) to waive advance public notice in the present circumstances. Section 11125 permits us to direct service for an initial period of not more than 60 days, with an option to extend the directed service period for an additional 180 days, if cause exists. We believe directed service authority to be necessary here at least for an initial 60 day period. Any interested person may file comments on this action during this period. We Find 1. CCRY had discontinued service over all of its lines. CRR has requested the Commission to permit it to provide continued rail service over those lines which it considers to be operable. 2. To prevent transportation and economic disruptions due to CCRY's ceased operations, and to assure the immediate continued movement of commodities, some of which may be perishable, it is necessary for the Commission to authorize CRR to operate CCRY's lines at Charles City, Iowa under 49 U.S.C. 11125, conditioned upon a waiver of any compensation or subsidy from the Federal government. 3. Our action in this decision will not substantially impair the ability of CRR to serve its own patrons adequately, or meet its outstanding common carrier obligations, see 49 U.S.C. 11125(b)(2)(B), and will assure continued rail service to affected shippers. This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or energy conservation. It Is Ordered 1. Based upon its undertaking to do so without any form of compensation from the Federal government, CRR is authorized to enter upon and operate CCRY's lines at Charles City, Iowa pursuant to this voluntary directed service order under 49 U.S.C. 11125. (a) Entry by CRR on the lines of CCRY may occur on the date and time authorized in this decision. Operations by CRR may continue no later than the sixtieth day from the effective date of this decision. (b) CRR shall immediately notify the Commission, CCRY, and SOO, in writing, of the date on which it commences operations under this order. 2. Operations performed under authority of this order shall conform to the directions and conditions prescribed above. 3. All submissions filed in this proceeding should refer to DSO No. 1515 and be sent to the Commission's headquarters at 12th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20423. An original and 10 copies should be submitted. 4. The provisions of this decision shall apply to intrastate, interstate, and foreign commerce. 5. The Commission retains jurisdiction to modify, supplement, or reconsider this decision at any time. 6. Notice to the general public of this decision shall be given by publication in the Federal Register . The decision will be served on the Federal Railroad Administration, the Association of American Railroads, American Short Line Railroad Association, CRR, CCRY, SOO, and the IDOT. 7. This decision and order shall become effective at 12:01 a.m., on March 7, 1994. 8. Unless otherwise modified by the Commission, this order will expire at 11:59 p.m., on May 5, 1994. Decided: March 4, 1994. By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, Commissioner Simmons and Philbin. Sidney L. Strickland, Secretary.
