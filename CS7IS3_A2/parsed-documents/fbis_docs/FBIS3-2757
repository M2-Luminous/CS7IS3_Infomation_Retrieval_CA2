The new situation, the new tasks, and the new practice require the whole party to attach greater importance than anytime in the past to ideological education and theoretical studies; they require the leadership at all levels to study and master Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to constantly improve their understanding and leadership skills. Attending the opening ceremony were students of the 16th class for leading cadres at provincial and ministerial level, the 22d class for cadres at the prefectural and department levels, classes for ethnic cadres from Xinjiang, classes for young and middle-aged cadres, classes for backbone theoretical and propaganda cadres, and personnel from branch schools at organs directly under the central committee and at state organs as well as from military units, 2,600 in all. After analyzing the current situation at home and abroad, Hu Jintao pointed out: The majority of comrades taking course here are leading cadres in their respective fronts. Regardless of his position or the sector in which he is exercising leadership, every one of them needs to approach problems from a strategic high plane and from an overall point of view. The fact that Comrade Deng Xiaoping is good at using the Marxist stand, point of view, and method to approach to deal with problems from an overall strategic perspective is dominantly demonstrated in his works. Leading cadres at all levels must study and master them. Realistic analysis and understanding of the situation is a precondition and a basis for correct decision-making, for putting the interests of the party's work first, and for executing well the various tasks. Only by keeping closely in mind the current situation at home and abroad; by learning how to approach problems from an overall strategic perspective will we be able to be farsighted, to get a clear understanding of the situation, to have a good grasp of the overall situation, and to implement well the party's basic policy for this year in an all-round manner. In his speech, Hu Jintao elaborated on the importance and urgency for leading cadres to take the lead in studying theory. He pointed out: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the Marxism of contemporary China, and it serves as the spiritual pillar and scientific guide for our triumphant march forward. The party is leading people of all nationalities in the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In our march forward, there will inevitably be some complicated problems and difficulties which we have never encountered before. Especially in the process of accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, complex, deep-rooted problems will become even more pronounced with each passing day. Only by studying the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics will we be able to unify our understanding; have a good grasp of the relationship between reform, development, and stability; properly handle all sorts of contradictions in society; approach problems from an overall point of view; make a correct assessment of the situation; constantly improve our work in terms of adherence to principles, systematic approach, farsightedness, and creativity to ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. Hu Jintao stressed: While studying the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must study theory and basic knowledge of the socialist market economy. We should, first of all, study -- in a comprehensive and systematic manner -- pertinent expositions contained in Deng Xiaoping's works and grasp its essence. Anyone interested in the theory of socialist market economy must read the report to the 14th CPC National Congress and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. We must study the principles, policies, and measures of reform formulated by the Central Committee for the establishment of a socialist market economy. We must also study basic knowledge of the socialist market economy so as to raise our capabilities in work on the socialist market economic sector. Wang Jialiu, Central Party School vice executive president, also spoke. Vice President Xing Bensi presided over the opening ceremony. Also present at the opening ceremony were Hou Zongbin, Wang Weicheng, Liu Yunshan, Wang Xudong, Chen Fujin, and Liu Shengyu.
