But he can hardly have been impressed with what he saw on a trip to Nizhniy Novgorod, the place where President Boris Yeltsin's reforms are moving fastest. The point of the visit was to see a trucking factory -- but it turned out to be little more than a collection of ramshackle buildings. A large, burly man, speaking in Russian, described the machinery to Mr Major, who tried to look interested. For most of his visit he has been wearing a typically Russian black fur hat, which seemed just a fraction too large, falling down his forehead to just above his eyes. He wore it this morning as he boarded the aircraft in Moscow but was bare-headed during his walkabout in Nizhniy Novgorod when he was mobbed by some 400 people. When someone asked him why he was not wearing it on such a cold day, Mr Major retorted with a smile: "Not a bit of it. It is a nice, pleasant spring day." In fact, the town was bleak and the temperature several degrees below freezing. During his walkabout, Mr Major entered a habadasher's shop and later went into a restaurant for a buffet lunch. The news that he planned to meet the people was broadcast frequently on local radio and hundreds of people turned out to greet him. In crowded Poprovka Street, he plunged into the crowds and one woman told him with a smile: "It's good to see you here but you can't see Nizhniy Novgorod in a single day." A smiling Mr Major replied: "One day here is better than a day sitting in my office back in London." The Prime Minister is the first Western leader in office to visit Nizhny Novgorod since it was founded in 1221. When one local dignitary urged him to promise that he would return, Mr Major told him: "It is 770 years since a Western leader came here -- I promise you that I will be back before another 770 years have elapsed." Overall, however, his visit to Russia has been dominated by the civil war in Bosnia. The Russians have had centuries of affinity with the Serbs and would be reluctant to see air strikes on them if they failed to comply with the Nato demand to surrender control of their artillery on the outskirts of Sarajevo or remove it altogether. The Prime Minister assured Mr Yeltsin this would be a limited operation if an air strike had to happen at all. Mr Yeltsin, although warning that Russia would not allow force to be used without her sanction, seemed to be moving towards the idea that air strikes might be necessary as one means of ending the war. For his part, Mr Major said he believed they could now see peace starting up in Sarajevo and hoped this could lead to a settlement elsewhere in Bosnia. But he stressed -- and the view was shared by Mr Yeltsin -- that there could never be a military solution. If the UN commanders on the ground appeal for more troops, Britain's policy would be that those countries which have not contributed troops so far should now be asked to do so. But no details were available from the Prime Minister's office on whether such a request had been made by Britain to the UN headquarters in New York. The visit included the signing of several economic and cultural agreements between the two countries. One was a pledge by both sides that nuclear missiles should be "de-targeted" from pointing at each of the two countries. They also signed an agreement that British and Russian troops, mostly Army personnel, would take part for the first time for 50 years in joint exercises, in Russia, and in the United Kingdom. It is expected that the UK exercises would be held on Salisbury Plain, although no firm decision has been taken. Elsewhere, the Prime Minister met British and Russian businessmen, Russian parliamentarians and other influential figures. He was accompanied in Moscow by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who this morning split off from the main party and flew into Riga for talks with the leaders of the three Baltic states. Mrs Norma Major, who accompanied her husband, visited a children's hospital in Moscow and the Bolshoi Ballet School. Mr Major virtually refused to answer questions during his visit about Back to Basics and his domestic problems, including the resignation as a parliamentary private secretary of Tory MP Hartley Booth over his "kiss and cuddle" relationship with Emily Barr, his 22-year-old former assistant. He makes it a policy, other than in exceptional circumstances, to answer questions when he is abroad only about immediate business in hand.
