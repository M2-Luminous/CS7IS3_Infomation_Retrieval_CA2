Many people think that the aggravation is attributable to U.S. Trade Representative Kantor's excessively uncompromising attitude. To tell the truth, Kantor does not have any experience at all in dealing with commercial problems. Since one year ago when he assumed the present post, his capability has been considered questionable in the United States as well as in Japan. And people think that, to cover his inferior experience, he has absurdly maintained the uncompromising attitude toward Japan. In fact, Kantor's attitude was excessively uncompromising in the process of the recent Japan-U.S. economic talks being broken off. A sign of compromise was seen between the secretariats of Japan and the United States with the Japan-U.S. summit close at hand. A consensus was being formed to the effect that, taking Japan's standpoint into consideration, the United States would make a concession concerning the numerical targets and others based on the agreement reached at the Japan-U.S. summit held in July last year. It was literally a final stage as "the wording of the agreement to be announced was being reviewed" (informed sources). It was Kantor who spoiled the agreement with his "voice of authority." Then, he tried to settle the issue by presenting the numerical targets at a direct talk with Foreign Minister Hata. "At this point, the repulsion of the Japanese Government officials reached its peak" (informed sources in Washington). Presently, his understanding of the commercial problems lying between Japan and the United States is beginning to be questioned even in Washington. For example, in February this year, at a dinner table with reporters, Kantor referred to the fact that U.S.-made cars were not selling in Japan, and strongly accused the exclusive nature of the Japanese market. However, it is a well-known fact, even to American people who have some knowledge of the situation, that the big three makers had been neglecting their efforts to promote sales. Reportedly, Kantor caused laughter among the reporters because of his total ignorance of this fact. While being such a person, he still maintains strong enough power to speak within the government, and is even supposed to be "the closest person to the president." At the back of this firm Clinton-Kantor line, there lies the fact that President Clinton himself maintains a revisionist idea toward Japan. In other words, he thinks it natural to exert strong pressure on Japan, and all the persons around him are making good impressions on him by maintaining an uncompromising attitude against Japan. A journalist in the United States points out: "It is true that, in the past, there have been people among the high-ranking government officials who appeared to have been influenced by revisionists. However, right now, both Kantor and Secretary of State Christopher are giving the impression that they themselves are literally revisionists". Kantor covers his ignorance about the commercial problems by bashing Japan, and has now raised himself to the No. 2 post of the U.S. Government as his attitude is completely in line with the revisionist concept of President Clinton. No doubt, he is going to be a person who would make future Japan-U.S. relations more and more gloomy.
