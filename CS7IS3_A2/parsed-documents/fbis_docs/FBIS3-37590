Asked by the conflicting sides to mediate at the talks, the Russian Defense Ministry has proposed a plan for stopping the military actions stage by stage. Opening the meeting, Pavel Grachev noted that Russia's impartial mediation in this conflict is in line with the national interests of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Russia itself and is being conducted within the framework of the UN Security Council's resolutions on the Karabakh problem and the CSCE group on Nagorno-Karabakh. "There are no strong-arm methods of solving the conflict," Grachev said, adding that, since the parties themselves are not yet capable of solving the conflict because of its prolonged nature and complexity, mediation is extremely important and should lead to positive results. Moreover, the previous mediation efforts made by various countries and international organizations have not brought any long-lasting results so far. The question of the legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh will not be tackled at today's meeting. Purely military decisions concerning the stage-by-stage cessation of military actions and the establishment of conditions for a political solution will be discussed and, probably, adopted. According to the Russian defense minister, a cease-fire and the disengagement of the sides should be the first stage of the process, followed by the withdrawal of all "foreign troops" from the occupied territories and the deportation of all foreign mercenaries back to their homelands. The next stage will be the exchange of hostages and POW's. Pavel Grachev said he was pleased to be offered the role of mediator and reported that the meeting is being organized on the eve of the summit between the presidents of Russia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh expressed the hope that the meeting will be fruitful and agreements proposed by the Russian Ministry of Defense will be reached.
