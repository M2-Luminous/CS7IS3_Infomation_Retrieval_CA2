The nation's power generation capability is 3,132 megawatts, but the fact that the generator units of certain plants have not received maintenance or have broken down has resulted in a significant drop in the output of energy. Although 1,325 megawatts were provided this week, there is a marked difference between the nation's supply of electricity and its demand. This has resulted in extensive outages between 0500 and 0000. Next week's deficit is estimated at 680 megawatts; therefore, the extensive outages will continue.
