Rumors of clashes between the Mexican Army and rebels have turned out to be just that: only rumors. Here in Chiapas, most people have returned to their daily activities. Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, held a news conference upon his return to Mexico City. He warned that even with the presidential bill granting general amnesty to everyone who participated in the violence in Chiapas, there is still a risk of falling into provocations that could hinder the peace process. [Begin Camacho Solis recording] In facing this situation, the country is strong, civilian society is mobilized, the national and international media are vigilant, and the Army is loyal to the executive branch and the nation, which prefers a political solution to an escalation of the conflict. [end recording] Regarding rumors of clashes, Camacho Solis said firmly that unlike some other countries, the civilian government controls the Armed Forces in Mexico. He added that he hopes the Indians have received President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's message, which he read in the Tzotzil, Tzetal, and (Chol) languages. San Cristobal de las Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia during his Sunday homily expressed his satisfaction about the conciliatory messages exchanged by both sides. Bishop Ruiz Garcia invited Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis to come to the altar, to which Camacho replied: I am just a faithful Christian. Bishop Ruiz Garcia responded: I am bishop of this Diocese, but I am also a citizen. Before approximately 3,000 parishioners, Ruiz Garcia said he has received threatening telephone calls. [Begin Ruiz Garcia recording] Without trying to be conspicuous, without any deception in my words, but with a sincere heart, I tell all those who have recently said they will make me disappear -- even making such threats in public places -- and all those who have left threatening messages -- even though I have also received encouraging phone calls -- that although I know their names, I harbor no hard feelings against them in my heart. [end recording] In closing the homily, Ruiz Garcia said the eyes of the world are on Mexico and urged the parties involved in the conflict to meet and show their willingness to find a solution through genuine national fraternity.
