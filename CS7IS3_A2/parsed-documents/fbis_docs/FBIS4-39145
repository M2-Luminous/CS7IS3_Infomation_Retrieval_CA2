Rather conducive to this also is the premier's vacations that he took to save face, and the temporary premiership of Oleg Soskovets, who has never been seen as being fond of Mr. Chubays, while being closely tied to Mr. Luzhkov. The latter's victory must among other things mean the end of privatization a la Chubays. One should not, however, forget that this privatization was publicly approved by Boris Yeltsin at one time. Thus, Luzhkov's victory over Chubays is first and foremost a blow at the president and a demonstration of the Moscow mayor's absolute power. A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent heard all of the above from a reliable source in the president's staff whose members have been of late shedding their loyalty to their present boss and pondering on who is going to be their next master. In their opinion, the greatest chances belong to the one who is now governing Russia's capital in a tough way.
