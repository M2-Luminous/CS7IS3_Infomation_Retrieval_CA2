L. 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on the proposed criteria for meeting the general statutory funding preference. Approximately $100,000 will be available in FY 1994 for this program. It is anticipated that $100,000 will be available to support 10 competing awards averaging $10,000. Previous Funding Experience Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions regarding submission of an application for this program. In FY 1993, HRSA reviewed 22 applications for Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships. Of those applications, 100 percent were approved. Fifteen projects, or 68% of applications received, were funded. In FY 1992, HRSA reviewed 9 applications for Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships. Of those applications, 100 percent were approved and funded. Purpose Section 831(b) of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to make grants to provide financial assistance to certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA) who are faculty members in accredited programs to enable such nurse anesthetists to obtain advanced education relevant to their teaching functions. Applicants must compete for Federal support annually. Eligibility Public and private nonprofit institutions which employ CRNA faculty to teach registered nurses in a full-time accredited nurse anesthetist training program may apply for a Grant for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships. National Health Objectives for the Year 2000 The Public Health Service urges applicants to submit work plans that address specific objectives of Healthy People 2000. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report; Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00474&hyph;0) or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report; Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00473&hyph;1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9325 (Telephone 202&hyph;783&hyph;3238).

Smoke-Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.
