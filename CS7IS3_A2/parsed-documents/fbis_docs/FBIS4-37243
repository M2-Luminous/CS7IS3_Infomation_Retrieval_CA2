Has this led to any change in Sanaa's conditions for the dialogue and what are the practical results of this tour so far? [Al-Iryani] The conditions set by Sanaa to conduct a political dialogue to end the crisis have not changed. Sanaa insists that such a dialogue must be held under the canopy of constitutional legitimacy and the Republic of Yemen's Constitution, and based on recognizing the outcome of the 27 April [1993] elections, the unity of the Armed Forces, and dismissing from the dialogue those against whom the public prosecutor has issued arrest warrants. [Birru] The Arab League secretary general has announced that the Arab League's failure will lead to requesting the UN Security Council to take deterrent measures against the party that does not abide by the cease-fire. [Al-Iryani] That statement, which was made by an Arab League assistant secretary general and not the secretary general, came as a shock to us in Sanaa. The Arab League is playing a role that it is not accustomed to and is using language that we have never heard before. But the statements were made by an assistant secretary general. His words may have failed to express what the Arab League means exactly. But the principle in itself was strange. The Arab League has never addressed any Arab issue through threats to seek help from the world community. [Birru] What is the outcome of Sanaa's moves on the international level to explain the Yemeni Government's views and the tour by 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-Ghani in the capitals of the super powers. Has that tour resulted in bringing about any change in the positions of these states? [Al-Iryani] Undoubtedly, the tour by Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential Council member, resulted first in the drafting of the UN Security Council resolution. The initial draft that was proposed by Prince Bandar [Bin-Sultan, Saudi ambassador in Washington] referred to Yemen as the Arab Republic of Yemen, and not the Republic of Yemen. It also included several sentences which implied hidden intentions. The activity of Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani in this regard was positive. He also met with officials in the United States, France, and China. The main objective of that tour was to stress Yemen's commitment to UN Security Council Resolution 924 and its categorical rejection of any new intervention in Yemeni domestic affairs. [Birru] The telephone call between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, the United Arab Emirates President: Was that the result of efforts by Lakhdar Ibrahimi, and what was discussed in that phone call? [Al-Iryani] The efforts of Lakhdar Ibrahimi are clear and specified by the UN Security Council resolution. But contacts between the brother president and His Highness Shaykh Zayid have, in fact, never ceased. These contacts have continued over these past weeks after the military situation was ignited by the secessionists. This was not the first contact between the president and Shaykh Zayid. [Birru] What was the subject of the phone call? [Al-Iryani] The subject was the topic of the hour; that is, establishing the cease-fire, annulling the secession, ending the conflict with the secessionists through peaceful means, and expressing the desire that the United Arab Emirates play a role in this regard. [Birru] The multi-faceted dialogue: What happened to it, and what are the topics under discussion now? [Al-Iryani] In fact the dialogue is, practically, governed by a UN resolution now. Lakhdar Ibrahimi stresses that his report will mention the fact that Paragraph 4 of Resolution 924 can be implemented. Let us say that the warring parties now accept the dialogue and we have stressed to Brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi that we feel this dialogue should be held within the framework of the three parties of the government coalition. The Socialist Party is the direct party in this crisis, the party that declare secession, and the party that led the rebellion. We are prepared to hold dialogue with the Socialist Party leadership according to the conditions I mentioned before. [Birru] What about the joint committee, the presence of observers, and Sanaa's approval of the presence of non-Yemeni observers? [Al-Iryani] The joint military committee was established during the military tensions and before the military situation exploded. It had representatives from Oman and Jordan, as well as the U.S. and French military attaches. What Sanaa proposed is to revive this committee to supervise the cease-fire and seek help from the military commanders from both sides. We understood from brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi that there is a desire to include other states in this committee. We proposed that Syria and Morocco should be included. This proposal was conveyed by Brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi to the secessionists in Jeddah and we are still expecting an answer. [Birru] What is the status of the talks with the unionists in the Socialist Party; with whom and where are these talks being conducted? [Al-Iryani] Such efforts were exerted before UN Security Council Resolution 924 was issued. Now that the resolution has been issued, I do not think there are any attempts to open new channels for dialogue. It is not useful to open several channels. Since there is a channel recommended by the UN Security Council, this should be the only channel. [Birru] Will you agree to let the Socialist Party resume the same role it played and hold the same share of power it held before secession? [Al-Iryani] We have stressed to Brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi and others, as well as to several states, that we adhere to the outcome of the 27 April elections. This means that the privileges, given to the Socialist Party in order to avoid the situation we are in now, cannot be given to it again. As for the size of its share in power in light of the outcome of these elections, we will stick to that. [Birru] What are the most significant reforms that will be introduced after the end of the war, whether on the level of the Army and the government institutions or the administrative powers, such as centralism and other issues? [Al-Iryani] The issue of the decentralized self rule, or the so-called local government, was a principal point during the dialogue. We thought that an agreement over this point would also help us avoid the situation we are in today. However, this issue will be more pressing than before the military battles. This means that the financial and administrative decentralization and the local government will become, in my opinion, more important and urgent than they were before these military battles. [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, how do you see the future: the future of the war, the future of unity, the future of relations between Yemen and the Gulf states, and the future of Yemen in general? [Al-Iryani] First, we beseech God that the war will have no future, and that those who seek war will fail. As regards the relations between Yemen and its neighbors, I can stress that the efforts exerted before this war broke out to improve the relations between Yemeni and its neighbors were unprecedented in more than 60 years. But regrettably, these efforts clashed with the military explosion. I can stress that these efforts that were exerted still survive and the hands will continue to be extended. If we exerted unprecedented efforts in the history of relations with the neighbors, then these efforts should continue after this situation is over. As for the future of Yemen, I think that you, as a journalist who can tour all parts of the country, will not find any exaggerations in my statement when I say that the future of the united Yemen is a historic inevitability and that those who are seeking to challenge history have to reconsider their position [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, thank you. [Al-Iryani] Thank you.
