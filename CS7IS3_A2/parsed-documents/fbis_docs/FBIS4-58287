At a news conference in Cairo today, he said he discussed the situation in Rwanda with President Husni Mubarak during their meeting today. He said he appealed to the president to use his influence and relations to end the war. He also urged the international community to intervene to stop the fighting and persuade all sides to abandon arms so that the people of Rwanda can be convinced to halt the war. [passage omitted] Mugenzi said his country has been in a state of war for four years, during which the number of refugees and displaced inside the country rose from 400,000 people to 1 million. With a population of 7 million people, there is one refugee for every seven people in Rwanda, he said. [passage omitted] On the security situation in Rwanda, Mugenzi explained that the government is doing all it can to restore stability and calm to a country where people are dominated by a spirit of revenge. The government expresses regret for the victims of violence and is doing everything in its power to stop this bloody human tragedy, he said. He said the conflict has gone beyond all rational boundaries, and the war has turned into a tribal and ethnic one. It is difficult to control a people willing to apply their own law of revenge and ones who are confident that their primary enemy is the Patriotic Front and its Tutsi tribes, he said. This is the reason for the violence in the country, he added. He regretted and condemned the killings in his country and called on the people to demonstrate patience and leave the government to do its job. On reports that the Belgian forces operating within the UN peace- keeping force are involved in Rwanda's incidents, Minister Mugenzi expressed his country's "anxiety" [ta'azzum] over the conduct of the Belgian forces. He said: Our relations with Belgium have until recently been extremely good. We do not blame the Belgian Government for the acts of some personnel, and we believe those are individual acts. He said Rwanda is concerned about the conduct of the Belgian forces. Since they set foot in the capital Kigali, he said, they have been engaged in suspect acts with support from the Patriotic Front. We warned those forces against this conduct, and officials apologized for some incidents, he said. He added: We clearly say that many members of these Belgian forces cooperate with the Patriotic Front. They were placed in strategic positions and several armed battles have taken place between them and the government forces in Rwanda, resulting in many victims. He said his country demanded withdrawal of those forces, and the necessary measures for this withdrawal have already been taken. The forces reached the border and this is satisfactory, he said.
