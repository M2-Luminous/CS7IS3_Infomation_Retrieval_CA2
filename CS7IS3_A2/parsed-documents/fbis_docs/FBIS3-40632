And 113 countries have consented to endorse it. The agreement, which is likely to be signed in April 1994 in Marakash, Morocco, has been reached in face of stiff opposition from some quarters in the developed and the developing world. Textile lobbies of the US and Portugal, farming lobbies of France and Japan and different quarters of the developing world have severely opposed the new arrangement. The mercantilist practice of maximising exports and minimising imports is no longer accepted. Trade benefits both exporters and importers. Specialisation in production according to the resource endowments leads to cost minimisation round the world. But in the short run, when the imported cheaper products displace domestic goods from the market, some problems crop up before the factors of production shift to better alternatives. Thus, lifting of tariff or non-tariff barriers leads to problems for the inefficient producers and benefits the consumers. The cost-benefit analysis of liberalisation of foreign trade underlines that benefits overweigh costs. For the developed world, trade liberalisation has become a necessity as their domestic markets are becoming saturated. On the other hand, for the developing world this analysis needs to be done more carefully. Their gains from trade are less, because of low value-added primary exports and higher percentage of export earnings in GDP. This latter fact means that the developing world's vulnerability to external factors is high. And there is an immediate loss of revenue, because of decrease in customs duty. But in the long run the gains from trade are likely to overweigh costs. The opening of primary products market, which has so far been guarded by high tariff and subsidy walls, is expected to help the developing countries. The specialisation in the production of goods in their respective areas of advantage will help them capture the markets of the developed world. The other point to reckon with is that the developing world's bargaining power becomes very low in bilateral negotiations. A number of issues, which were controversial, have been left out. Issues like entertainment, financial services, shipping and communication fall in that category. The US reluctantly agreed to phase out import quotas on Third World textiles and clothing in over 10 years rather than 15 years. India is going to gain by this agreement in all spheres except the patents. In textiles, although 49 per cent of the quota is to be lifted only after the year 2005 AD, the Indian industry, which ranks amongst the best in the world, is going to get a big boost during the phased withdrawal of 51 per cent of the quota by the end of the period. Indian exports of steel ropes, wires and rods have been the target of US anti-dumping authorities in the past. The new rule under the agreement is that the volume of dumped imports is to be treated as negligible, if from a particular country it works out to be less than one per cent of the market for similar products in the importing country. This stipulation is going to help Indian exports in a number of spheres, besides the specified ones, because of very low labour cost and subsequent lower costs of production by international standards. Though Indian economy has not been able to generate enough surplus of foodgrains, farm and related products, poultry and dairy-based ones, will find a good market in the developed world. This section of exports (poultry and dairy) has a very high value-added content and a very good market in the developed countries. Although India produces very little of the Japonica variety of rice, the demand for which will rise with the opening of the Japanese and Korean rice markets, pressure on the Japonica variety will make the Indian variety more attractive. India is a part of the developing world. It falls in the low-income bracket, but the size of its economy sets it apart from the other developing countries. Indian export earning in terms of the GDP is as low as 8.12 per cent. Manufactured goods constitute about two-thirds of the exports. The factors which affect the developing world are not of concern to India and if its economy moulds itself according to the requirements of the developed world markets then the new agreement will help it tremendously.
