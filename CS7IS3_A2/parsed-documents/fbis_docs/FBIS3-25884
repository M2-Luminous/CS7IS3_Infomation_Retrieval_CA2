The Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday held the first meeting of the special task force on examining applications for investment in the mainland. The meeting approved for the first time indirect investment in the mainland by building, engineering consulting, and leasing traders. In addition, the meeting also, in principle, gave a green signal to indirect investment in the mainland by passenger transportation traders. Due to incomplete application data submitted by the traders for examination at the meeting, the ministry will hold its official approval to the passenger transportation trade until the next meeting of the special task force. In accordance with the principles for examining investment and technology cooperation projects in the mainland, promulgated on 31 December last year, the ministry convened the first meeting of the supra-ministerial special task force yesterday. At the meeting, representatives from various ministries examined 18 projects on investment in the mainland. As the Construction and Planning Administration under the Interior Ministry insisted that examination for applications from building and construction traders must be separated, Li Shu-chiu, executive vice minister of economic affairs who chaired the meeting, said: Building traders may invest in the mainland conditionally; however, the prohibition shall continue to be enforced on construction traders planning to invest mainly in development and marketing projects in the mainland.
