The proposal to include the issue into the Friday agenda was made by LDPR member Aleksey Mitrofanov, but was rejected. During a recent tour of former Yugoslavia, Zhirinovskiy warned the West that he would view any air strikes on Bosnian Serbs as an attack on Russia and pledged full support to the Serbian population. Also on Friday another Duma faction, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, released a statement calling for a Russian veto on air strikes if the issue is discussed in the UN Security Council.
