Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on October 12, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rules 17.3, ``Expedited Proceeding,'' and 17.8 ``Offers of Settlement,'' to (1) specify that the subject of an Exchange investigation must notify the CBOE staff in writing within 15 days of the date of notification under paragraph (d), ``Notice, Statement and Access,'' of CBOE Rule 17.2, ``Complaint and Investigation'' that he elects to proceed in an expedited manner pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.3; (2) reduce the time period during which settlement offers may be submitted by a subject in an Exchange disciplinary matter who seeks to resolve the matter through expedited proceedings pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.3; and (3) allow either the subject or the Exchange staff to end the negotiations for a letter of consent at any point during the negotiations. 1 If either the CBOE staff or the subject ends the negotiations, the subject will have 15 days to submit a written statement to the BCC pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.2(d) indicating why no disciplinary action should be taken; the CBOE staff may then bring the matter to the BCC for appropriate action. If the subject and the CBOE staff are able to agree upon a letter of consent, the CBOE staff will submit the letter to the BCC. 1 CBOE Rule 17.2(c), ``Report,'' requires the CBOE staff to submit a written report of its investigation to the Exchange's Business Conduct Committee (``BCC'') in every case where an investigation results in a finding that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of the Act or the CBOE's rules has been committed. CBOE Rule 17.2(d), `'Notice, Statement and Access,'' requires the CBOE staff to notify the subject of the report of the general nature of the allegations and of the specific provisions of the Act or of the CBOE's rules that appear to have been violated. Under CBOE Rule 17.3, the subject of a report written pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.2 may to seek to dispose of the matter through a letter of consent. In addition, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.8, Interpretation and Policy .01, to provide that if the respondent and the CBOE staff are unable to reach agreement on a letter of consent under CBOE Rule 17.3 then the number of days over 30 between the time when the CBOE staff receives notice of the respondent's election to proceed in an expedited manner under CBOE Rule 17.3 and the date when either party ends the consent negotiations shall be deducted from the 120-day period specific in CBOE Rule 17.8 (a), ``Submission of Offer,'' which provides a 120-day period within which a respondent may submit a settlement offer to the BCC. Regardless of the amount of time spent in unsuccessful consent negotiations, the respondent will have no less than 14 days to submit a settlement offer to the BCC pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.8(a). The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statement may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Background Pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.2(d), prior to the time that the CBOE staff submits an investigative report to the Exchange's BCC concerning possible disciplinary violations, the staff if required to provide a notice to the subject of the report which sets forth the general nature of the allegations made in the report and the specific rules that appear to have been violated (a ``Notification Letter''). CBOE Rule 17.2(d) provides further than, except when the BCC determines that expeditious action is required, the subject of an investigative report shall have 15 days from the date of the Notification Letter in which to submit a written statement to the BCC concerning why no disciplinary action should be taken against a subject (a ``Notification Response''). In accordance with CBOE Rule 17.4, ``Charges,'' the CBOE staff then submits the investigative report and the Notification Response to the BCC, and if the BCC determines that probable cause exists for finding a disciplinary violations, a statement of charges is issued against the subject. Upon the issuance of a statement of charges against a subject, the subject is referred to as a respondent under the Exchange's rules. 2 Pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.8(a), a respondent has 120 calendar days from the date of service of a statement of charges in which to submit settlement offers to the BCC. However, the 120-day settlement period does not include the number of days in excess of seven calendar days that it takes the Exchange's staff to comply with a respondent's request for access to documents which is made properly pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.4(c), ``Access to Documents.'' 3 In addition, with one exception, a respondent is only entitled to submit a maximum of two settlement offers to the BCC during the 120-day settlement period. 4 Upon the expiration of the 120-day settlement period, or earlier if the BCC rejects a respondent's second settlement offer prior to the expiration of such period, a hearing is scheduled with respect to the charges. 5 2 See CBOE Rule 17.4(b), ``Initiation of Charges.'' 3 See CBOE Rule 17.8, Interpretation and Policy .01(c). CBOE Rule 17.4(c) provides that within 60 calendar days after a statement of charges has been served upon a respondent, the respondent may make a written request for access to all documents concerning the case that are in the Exchange's investigative file except for CBOE staff investigation and examination reports and materials prepared by the CBOE staff in connection with such reports or in anticipation of a disciplinary hearing. However, in providing such documents the CBOE staff may protect the identity of a complainant. 4 See CBOE Rule 17.8, Interpretation and Policy .01(a) and (b). The BCC, at its discretion, may permit a respondent to submit a third settlement offer during the 120-day settlement period if the pertinent details of the offer are consistent with parameters and criteria deemed acceptable by the BCC. 5 See CBOE Rule 17.8, Interpretation and Policy .02. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CBOE Rule 17.3 sets forth an expedited proceeding process pursuant to which a subject may seek to resolve a disciplinary matter through a letter of consent with the Exchange prior to the issuance of a statement of charges against the subject. CBOE Rule 17.3 requires that a letter of consent contain a description of the facts, violation, and sanction and must be agreed upon by the Exchange staff and by the respondent. In addition, CBOE Rule 17.3 requires that all such letters of consent be accepted by the BCC. If the Exchange staff and the subject are unable to agree upon a letter of consent or if they agree upon a letter of consent and the letter is rejected by the BCC, CBOE Rule 17.3 provides that the matter shall proceed as if no letter of consent had been submitted to the BCC ( i.e, the BCC may decide to authorize the issuance of a statement of charges against the subject; the subject is then entitled to submit settlement offers to the BCC pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.8 during the 120-day settlement period).
