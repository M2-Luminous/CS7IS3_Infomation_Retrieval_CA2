This is evident from a report, entitled "Comprehensive Analysis of the Situation in Russia and Developments Forecast," drawn up by the Center for Social and Strategic Studies and presented at a news-conference in Moscow on Tuesday. The report says that scientific research and high technology development has shrunk by 73 percent over the last two years while industry has been increasingly oriented on raw material output. The percentage of fuel, energy, metal, and chemicals in industrial production costs soared to 50 percent in 1993 from 30 percent in 1989-1991 whereas the share of machinery and consumer goods dwindled from 44 percent to 28 percent. "Industrial decline is underway with an explicitly one-sided trend toward raw material production," the report underlines. The government's economic policy last year is described as "the continuation of reforms without macroeconomic stabilization." The cabinet's strategy to bridge the budget deficit through reduced state expenditures proved ineffective. Although efforts to keep the budget deficit within 10 percent succeeded this year, in fact this gap has proved larger than the officially announced deficiency since some profits and liabilities, like foreign loans and payment of interest on state debt, have been inaccurately declared. Experts believe that there can be no talk of any national development unless the ruling political elite consolidates itself. At the same time, they point to the problem of political terror in Russia. In their opinion, last year's series of murders of bankers was politically motivated.
