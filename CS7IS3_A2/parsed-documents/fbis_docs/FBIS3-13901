The Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad was called to the Foreign Office today and informed of Pakistan's decision. A spokesman of the Foreign Office said that this decision was taken because the Consulate General found it impossible to function effectively due to noncooperative and negative attitude of Indian authorities. The spokesman recalled that Indian Government had gone back on its commitment to leave the Jinnah House for use of the Consulate General in Bombay. The Indian authorities had even refused to (?permit) the acquisition of the principal premises for the Consulate General. The Maharashtra Government had in fact acted in a manner that made it extremely difficult for the Consulate General to carry out its assigned functions.
