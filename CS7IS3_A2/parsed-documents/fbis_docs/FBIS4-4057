An official from the Bureau of Legislative Affairs under the State Council said here today that the legislation on negotiable instruments in China has become increasingly imperative as the market economy is developing rapidly. Speaking at a seminar on negotiable instruments held by the Chinese Chamber of International Commerce (CCIC) and the Chamber of International Commerce, the official said that the National People's Congress and the State Council have attached great importance to the work on such a law. The legislative branch has already put the draft and viewing of the law on its top agenda. China began its work on drafting the law in 1990 and the initial draft has taken shape. The official said that the drafting group did research not only on the use and circulation of domestic negotiable instruments but made studies on the relevant laws abroad. Xu Dayou, vice president of CCIC, said that the seminar was aimed at better understanding foreign laws on negotiable instruments and international experiences in the area by Chinese lawyers, financiers and industrialists, in order to standardize Chinese actions of negotiable instruments in international trade and investment fields and ensure the normal use and circulation of negotiable instruments. During the two-day meeting, experts on checks and bills from the Chamber of International Commerce and Britain will exchange views with Chinese legislators and financiers on international norms on rules, structures, sorts and actions of negotiable instruments as well as the current situation of the use of negotiable instruments in China.
