This morning, Cetin met with Aremnian Deputy Foreign Minister Gerard Libaridyan [as received]. After the meeting, Cetin told the press: "I had the impression that the Armenians have realized the importance of peace." During the meeting, Libaridyan briefed Cetin on the latest developments and said that with Azerbaijan they "have arrived to a point that is very close to peace." Cetin said to him: "You are waging a meaningless war. At this day and age nobody will allow the occupation of a country's land. You must reach a solution peacefully. The war hurts both sides extensively. We will extend every kind of support for peace. Do not seek solutions outside the CSCE framework. Cetin and Libaridyan agreed that seeking solutions to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict in too many ways and through various channels makes the solution even more difficult to reach. They also agreed that "Russia's support is essential for a solution." Cetin gave Libaridyan the message that "the relations between Turkey and Armenia cannot be normalized as long as Azeri territory is under occupation." Discussing his bilateral meeting with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, Cetin said: "I thanked France for showing understanding and supporting our struggle against terrorism." Juppe discussed the consternation being caused by the failure to reach a solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina and stated that closer cooperation is necessary with Turkey in this respect. Cetin pointed out that France can pressure Armenia so that peace can be established in the Caucasus, adding: "The solution must be within the CSCE framework. This war can end with the concrete support of the Western countries." Discussing Turkey's problems in connection with the Iraqi pipeline, Cetin asked for Paris' support to rescue the pipeline in which Turkey invested considerably. Cetin pointed out that Turkey does not intend to violate UN resolutions, but that there is no need for a new UN Security Council resolution in connection with this matter which is technical in nature. Cetin pointed out that France will be the term president of the European Union when Turkey joins the customs union, adding: "we will expect your concrete support." Cetin also briefed Juppe on the latest developments regarding Cyprus. At his meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff [title as received], Cetin criticized the decision to link aid to Turkey to certain conditions and to reduce it. He termed this as "a negative development." Cetin stressed that "Turkey is being subjected to unjust criticism as a result of wrong and insufficient information." He added that everyone must refrain from harming Turkish-U.S. relations. Cetin pointed out that the United States can be more effective in the Caucasus. He also raised the issue of the Iraqi pipeline and discussed Turkey's problems and demands in connection with that issue. Tarnoff stressed that the U.S. President attaches great importance to relations with Turkey, and that efforts will be made to prevent the relations from being harmed and to explain the facts. Cetin criticized Belgium for allowing DEP [Democracy Party] to open a "solidarity bureau" there. He said: "Nobody should support terrorism. This is what international agreements and responsibilities say. Terrorism should not be tolerated. This is a very sensitive issue. Turkey's issues and problems are resolved in Turkey. Seeking solutions outside will not help. Such steps cannot be of any use." Cetin returns to Turkey today.
