The Wallis sub-committee, set up in 1992 to investigate the causes of violence in Natal, charges General van der Merwe with having twice blocked bold initiatives by his senior officers to root out alleged SAP [South African Police] misconduct in Natal in the past. The general yesterday dismissed the charge as "naive and stupid". During sittings in Natal, the sub-committee under Mr M.J.D. Wallis, SC, was inundated with allegations that police had delayed investigations and that members of the force had perpetrated acts of violence. Faced with a mountain of unsolved cases, many of which had never been processed properly, the sub-committee, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and ANC [African National Congress] agreed to identify a workable number of solvable cases in the Port Shapestone area. All parties would cooperate in bringing these cases to trial as a "very small first step in restoring community trust in the police force", they agreed in February last year. Local police accepted the plan, but approval from headquarters has still not been obtained more than a year later. General van der Merwe had ignored approaches by the Goldstone Commission, the report said. Yesterday the general said he was not aware of the request. In May last year, General van der Merwe assured the committee of his "sincere desire" to improve relations between the police and the community. Three months later, he blocked a bold plan to root out police misconduct in the Natal Midlands hours before it was to be placed before the committee. The entire Natal SAP hierarchy had approved the establishment of a police investigation unit to investigate allegations of police misconduct in the Natal Midlands. At the time, General van der Merwe said he did not object to the proposal in principle, but would not sanction the unit because a Security Forces Board of Inquiry Act existed to deal with such matters. The Wallis report rejected this response as inadequate, saying the board -- yet to be constituted -- would not have the powers to investigate many complaints. Yesterday General van der Merwe said he had discussed the matter with Judge Richard Goldstone at the time "and he supported me". He rejected allegations that he had blocked the Natal initiatives.
