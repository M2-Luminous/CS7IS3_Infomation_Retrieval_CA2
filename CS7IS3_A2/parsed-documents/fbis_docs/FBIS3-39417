The decision for a military intervention by NATO was not as simple as many citizens imagined, Kinkel said today at the Ash Wednesday meeting of the FDP in Bayerbach [Bavaria]. In the event of a military strike, however, there would be "no lack" of support from the German government within the limits of its legal possibilities.
