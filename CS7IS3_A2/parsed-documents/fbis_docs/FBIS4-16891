According to Interfax sources, about 300 citizens of South Ossetia (Georgia) have arrived in Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia (Russia) to organize a meeting in front of the parliament building. The republic leaders persuaded the demonstrators to move to the Art Center and meet with North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov. The president said that the most important thing now was "to work in order to turn Ossetia into an economically mighty country." He also said that the North Ossetian leaders would make efforts to ensure that the Russian-Georgian border between South and North Ossetia be transparent and never divide the peoples.
