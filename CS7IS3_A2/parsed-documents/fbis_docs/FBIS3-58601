The verdict of six "jurors" in the duel between Di Pietro and the senatur. Mannheimer: "It was a serious blow for the Lega." Pontiggia: "It damaged their image." Milan--Who was the victor in the televised Cusani trial? the solid Antonio Di Pietro from Montenero di Bisaccia or the lively Umberto Bossi from Cassano Magnago? Or wouldn't it be fairer to declare it a tie? No, says our ideal jury. Once the televisions were turned off and the newspapers set aside, this was no tie: Bossi was defeated, even on technicalities. He limited the damage, but he still lost. Let us hear from our first juror, sociologist and Lega expert Renato Mannheimer: "During the trial, each played their own role, but Bossi is in serious trouble politically because he will now be lumped together with all the others. This event will cause him great harm in his field." Who could profit from the Lega leader problems? Mannheimer immediately names two of his most direct competitors among the moderates: "Berlusconi and Segni, but...." But what? "But we will have to see if they are able to capitalize on the situation." And how did the fighter Bossi do in the courtroom? According to Mannheimer: "He tried to act like someone who does not know the law in order to escape from it." Did he succeed? " It would be interesting to determine what impact his deposition had on the Leghists, but unfortunately I have no data." And what does the sociologist Mannheimer think of this televised trial, which was able to draw as many viewers as the music festival of Sanremo? "The trial reflects the transition from the First to the Second Republic. It is history as it happens, and that is the way it should be, without the intervention of either the professors or the journalists." Even the architect Gae Aulenti thinks Wednesday "was not a very good day for leader Umberto Bossi. It came out that the Lega definitely did take money. However, someone who is unable to form a subtle opinion of Bossi may very well continue to follow him through thick and thin." Ornella Vanoni, who is busy on tour these days, was unable to watch the Cusani trial on television. However, she also sees clouds forming on the horizon for the Lega and the senatur:: "They admitted talking the money, right? I think their reputation will be damaged because people used to think they were angels. Not me, because I have never believed in angels." The writer Giuseppe Pontiggia says he was made uneasy by what he saw on television: "I felt embarrassed. The Lega's good name was muddied because they were unable to avoid committing wrongful deeds, although they are hardly to be compared to those committed by the others. The problem is that if someone wants to offer an alternative model, then they have to know how to behave coherently." However, the novelist feels that Umberto Bossi may have to pay a dearer price to the voters for his political vacillations and awful language than for the 200 million lire received from Montedison. But is it a good thing or a bad thing to gather round to watch a trial as if it were a theatrical production, or even a boxing match? Pontiggia says: "Drama is part of the particular period we are in, and I believe it is almost inevitable that this is the way it should be, even though from a strictly judicial point of view, we may have gone too far." The painter Enrico Baj, cultural councilor on the Lega town council of Varese for a few days, until he resigned amidst controversy, is adamantly against televised justice: "In Italy, there used to be the commedia dell'arte, or comedy of art, but today we have the comedy of justice, with everyone up there trying to look good." Did Bossi achieve his goal? "He played the populist, as always, which will eventually weaken Bossi the politician. At first he gathered the protest vote, but now the people want more. The Lega has either not known how, nor been able, to create a valid base for itself that was independent of the impromptu brainstorms of its leader. Also, when these same Leghists went to Rome, they started acting like the Romans." But Bossi did earn some points in court, didn't he? "Bossi should have limited himself to admitting his guilt and then kept silent. Instead, he behaved like a driver who, when he is caught redhanded by a policeman in a strictly no parking zone, still finds something to argue about. I do not understand why he agreed to play this part." Mario Rodriguez, campaign expert and authority on political communications, offers another interpretation of the confrontation between Di Pietro and Bossi: "The public prosecutor looked straight at the camera, totally aware of the dramatic role he was playing. Instead, I thought Bossi was more spontaneous, but also more uncouth. In the end, I think I understood that certain things--certain behaviors--which today we all think are illegal, were standard procedure in 1992, which no one could escape, not even--although to a very small degree--the Lega. And I also realized that, deep down, the new Bossi has an old face. In any event, I believe that this demonstration will not affect his showing in the elections by more than 5 percent. On the other hand, we still have to see what influence the presence of Mario Segni and Silvio Berlusconi will have on him.
