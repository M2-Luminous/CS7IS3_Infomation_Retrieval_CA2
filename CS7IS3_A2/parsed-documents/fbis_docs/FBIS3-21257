Minute characters or designs are drawn by the atoms. Various techniques have been researched, but the one being used by this project is the STM (scanning tunneling microscope) method. When a 5-volt 30-millisecond pulse voltage is applied to the STM probe, atoms adhere to the tip of the probe. The pulse voltage is also applied when the atom adhering to the tip is released. However, even under the same conditions, atoms cannot always be successfully manipulated by applying a voltage pulse. Therefore, up until now, after pulse voltage was applied, it was necessary to confirm whether the atom was adhering to the probe tip or had been released by using the original function of the STM as a microscopic device. This project research group developed a method to detect a feeble signal change which occurs when the atom adheres to the probe or when the atom is released from the probe. This made it possible to analyze the circumstances of the atomic manipulation in real time and detect, with certainty, whether the atom was adhering to the probe or had been released. They succeeded in moving atoms on the silicon surface at will by using this real time atomic analysis technology. In addition, they were able to construct atomcraft made with hydrogen atoms on the silicon surface. In future research, they plan to take up the challenge of real time analysis of atoms other than silicon or hydrogen.
