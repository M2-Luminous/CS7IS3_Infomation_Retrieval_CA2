(Fumio Sato, president) announced on 19 November that it has developed a small superconductor magnet without using liquid helium, by commercializing a refrigerating machine that can cool to the temperature of liquid helium (absolute temperature of 4.2�K=-269�C). Since conventional refrigeration machines have not been able to go below 10�K, niobium titanium superconductor magnets could not be used, but since with this new refrigeration machine cooling to 4.2�K is possible and the container is approximately one-third the size of conventional ones, it is possible to generate a strong magnetic field of six tesla in a large diameter room temperature space, which has an internal diameter of 18 cm. Toshiba believes that there will be a great expansion in the fields using superconductor magnets. The superconductor magnet system that was developed incorporates a small refrigeration machine that is an improvement on the Gifford-McMahon (GM) type refrigeration machines that are most commonly in use at present. Since conventional refrigeration machines could not cool below 10�K, niobium 3-tin, etc. had to be used, but by finding regenerative materials with large specific heats below 10�K, Toshiba was able to attain cooling in the 4�K range. In addition, an oxide superconductor which has low thermal conductivity and in which current flows well in a strong magnetic field is used for the power lead that brings current to the superconductor coil, and this is connected to the reduction in cooling temperature. With this it is possible to use the main current niobium titanium superconductor magnet, for which liquid helium cooling had been necessary, with a direct cooling refrigeration machine, and a strong magnetic field can be generated with a small unit. The container that accommodates the magnetic field is 65 cm wide, 50 cm deep and 49 cm high, a small size about that of a 25 inch television set, and all that must be done when it is used is to turn on a switch. Toshiba says that almost all superconductor magnets, such as those for industry and research, can use this refrigeration machine, and it will release users from the complexity of using liquid helium cooling.
