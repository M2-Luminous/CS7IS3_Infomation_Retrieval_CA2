But the group of blue-suited, middle-aged men who walked into the second-floor office of the PLO's grubby apartment block in Cairo's Mudiriyat al-Tahrir Street on Thursday night was unique. For the first time a joint US Defence and State Department delegation was paying an official visit to the PLO to assess the amount of military assistance Washington could provide for 'Arafat's fledgling "Palestine" police force. The talks were as friendly as they were unprecedented. Over bananas and sweet tea, the Americans agreed to provide the PLO's police commander, General 'Abd-al Razzaq al-Yahya, with almost 200 military vehicles, from pick-up trucks to 2.5 ton "Blazer" jeeps, which the PLO will use on joint patrols with Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip. Already, the PLO has arranged to purchase several dozen Russian armoured vehicles with which to control the slivers of "Palestine" ceded to it under the agreement sealed by that nervous handshake of Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin on the White House lawn on 13 September last year. Yet the Americans found the Palestinian negotiators in a curious frame of mind -- frustrated and angry rather than ecstatic at the prospect of entering their "homeland" for the first time in a quarter of a century. Aware that Palestinians in the occupied territories are coming to regard them as traitors rather than liberators, the PLO officials seemed to be tearful of the future, convinced the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Rabin, by postponements and delay, was trying to "crack" 'Arafat, to break him to acceptance of every Israeli demand in the occupied territories. On the face of it, secret agreements between the PLO and the Israelis, details of which were given to the Independent on Sunday last week, are impressive. 1. A Palestinian police force of at least 6,500 men, equipped with up to 9,000 Kalashnikov rifles and around 100 machine-guns. They may bring with them into Gaza and Jericho between 30,000 and 35,000 family members -- the first substantial "return" of Palestinians since the catastrophe that overwhelmed them in 1948. 2. A system of new "lateral" east-west roads in Gaza, jointly patrolled by Israelis and Palestinians, along which settlers may travel to and from Israel; the elimination of all Israeli fixed military positions outside Jewish settlements in Gaza; and PLO control of almost 90 per cent of the Gaza Strip. 3. Four "safe-passage" roads between Jericho and Gaza, for all Palestinians wishing to travel between the two cities. This includes freedom of movement for Palestinians on roads through the State of Israel as well as the occupied West Bank. 4. Provision for up to 80,000 Palestinians exiled after the 1967 Arab-lsraeli war to return to Jericho and Gaza, each applicant to be vetted by a joint Egyptian-Jordanian lsraeli-Palestinian committee. 5. Rules of engagement and conduct for PLO and Israeli security forces in Gaza and Jericho, governed by written instructions on the use of firearms, and agreements to prevent PLO and Israeli forces firing at each other. 6. An interim one-week "joint deployment" operation, during which PLO forces will take over from the Israelis, the two sides spending seven days alongside each other to avoid a military vacuum. The PLO police advance guard would arrive seven days before "Z-Day", as the PLO calls it -- the final 'Arafat-Rabin signature on the "interim phase" of the peace process. The full deployment of PLO police would be completed within 14 days after Z-Day. 7. A PLO-lsraeli "Joint Security Committee" with three coordination offices in Gaza City, the Khan Younis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, and in Jericho, which will arrange joint security force mobile patrols -- usually one PLO and one Israeli vehicle on "lateral" roads in Gaza and other places of joint use. Given the complexity of the arrangements, Sha'th's anger at Israeli delays last week may have been understandable. But there are deeper reasons for the PLO's depression. In the corner of Sha'th's Cairo office, for example, there is a three-foot stack of documents and maps which show just how far the talks still have to go before the PLO can take over Jericho and that part of Gaza which the Israelis will allow it to administer. By this weekend, for example -- just four days before the deadline which both sides regarded as sacred last September -- the PLO and Israelis had still not agreed on the exact size of the Jericho enclave to be controlled by the PLO, nor the number of Palestinian paramilitary police the Israelis will eventually permit into Jericho and Gaza. The "safe passage" arrangements which Palestinians need to travel along the four agreed roads between Jericho and Gaza remain unclear. So does the legal jurisdiction of either side over settlers and Palestinians in each other's territories. And there is still no agreement on the system of courts which each side must administer, along with arrangements for the apprehenslon of Palestinians or Israelis suspected of criminal activity inside or outside the autonomous areas. For the Palestinians as well as for the Israelis, however, the greatest bone of contention is the continued existence of the Israeli settlements in Jericho and Gaza. "Since we started these talks, we must have spent 80 percent of our entire time talking about nothing but the Jewish settlements," one PLO negotiator said last week. "They have been the single most important peace-breaker." In retrospect, the talks were never going to be easy. The imbalance of the two parties -- an economically bankrupt and militarily impotent PLO versus an all-powerful Israel backed by the most pro-lsraeli US administration in a generation -- have been reflected in miniature among the negotiators. Sha'th is a businessman and small-time publisher whose bald pate and spectacles make him look more like an impatient schoolmaster than a crafty statesman. His Israeli counterpart, Maj Gen Amnon Shahaq, is deputy chief of staff of the Israeli army. Old General al-Yahya -- the PLO's top military official at the talks -- has not seen his home town of Haifa since he fled as a 19-year old in 1948. His opposite number is the dapper Maj Gen Uzi Dayan, nephew of Israel's most famous soldier. From the start of the talks at Taba on 13 October last year, the Israelis bore down on the PLO negotiators, astonishing Sha'th with territorial demands that would have left 47 per cent of the newly "autonomous" Gaza Strip still under direct Israeli military control. The PLO found that the Israelis wanted separate written agreements on every settlement in the Gaza Strip, some of them so small that only two dozen families lived there. "We spent days just negotiating the security of the settlement of Nezerim," one of the participants recalled last week. "There are only about 30 families in Nezerim but the Israelis demanded the right to establish new military positions on the Gaza beachfront to protect it, an entirely new road system connecting Nezerim to the Israeli border to the east, a special Israeli-PLO joint patrol system to protect Nezerim residents who wanted to play tennis in the settlement of Gush Katif or attend horse-riding classes there or who wanted to visit their friends." The Israelis created, in the words of another PLO official "a monstrosity of systems to protect the settlers". Settlements, it was decided, would be regrouped in two main areas in Gaza: Gush Katif and another area in the north of the Gaza Strip, identified on the negotiators' maps as Erez. The Israelis then decided that the settlers should travel to Israel by three "lateral" roads (constructed west to east across the Strip) in order to avoid the highway that runs the length of Gaza. At one point in these early talks, one of Sha'th's colleagues exploded in anger at the Israelis, calling their demands "utterly ridiculous" and asking why, in an area only 20 miles in length, settlers could not travel an extra 10 miles to Israel on the north-south highway rather than constructing three new roads. To the astonishment of the PLO the Israelis then proposed an Israeli- controlled zone lkm wide along the border of the Gaza Strip and a zone 1.2km wide along each of the new roads, together with five more military bases on these routes and along the Gaza beachfront, giving Israel 14 military camps in areas "controlled" by Palestinians outside the settlement zones. When the Palestinian negotiators realised that under this plan, Israel would remain in control of 47 per cent of Gaza, they suspended the Taba talks. 'Amr Musa, the Egyptian Foreign Minister, flew to see Rabin in Jerusalem to complain. "Why are the Palestinians so angry?" Rabin is retorted to have replied. "This is only our first negotiating move!" Upon which the Israelis reduced their occupation of Gaza to 10 per cent of the territory, although the depth of an Israeli cordon sanitaire along the Gaza- Egyptian border is still being negotiated. PLO officials are also aware of the tenuous nature of their authority, something they have been unwilling to emphasise lest the true nature of Israel's power over the future Palestinian entity becomes apparent. They have conceded, for example, that only Palestinians holding Jordanian or Egyptian identity papers may enter Gaza and Jericho as PLO policemen. Palestinians resident in Lebanon or Syria -- the principal focus of opposition to 'Arafat's agreement with Israel -- will be forbidden entry to the police. Israel originally insisted that 'Arafat's "capital" of Jericho. should be only nine square kilometres in size. So Sha'th and his fellow negotiators slowly added new strips of land. They first demanded that two neighbouring refugee camps should come under the PLO's control, then the water resources in the hills to the west and the agricultural area around them. Then Sha'th said he wanted the Palestinian hamlet of 'Auja and its agricultural land, along with a right of passage for Palestinians to the Dead Sea and to the religious shrine of Nabi Musa. The final size of Jericho, between 57 and 58 square kilometres, is to be decided at the pre-signing meeting of 'Arafat and Rabin. But to their shock the Palestinians discovered last week that the Israelis have already started construction on a large new military base on the main road south of Jericho, scarcely a mile from the position that they will evacuate when the PLO takes over. Aware that the Israelis are creating new "facts on the ground", Sha'th fell back on the argument that the actual size of Jericho did not matter because, once the PLO's control is extended into the rest of the West Bank, Jericho will "melt" into this area. It is not difficult to see how 'Arafat's ever-growing army of opponents in the occupied territories will find fault with these arrangements. Far more delicate are the arrangements by which the PLO's police force will "co-ordinate" with the Israeli army. HAMAS [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the other radical Islamic groups opposed to the PLO accord claim that the PLO will become a branch of Israeli intelligence once the interim agreement comes into force. And it has indeed been agreed between the Israelis and the PLO that an intelligence officer from each side will take part in the weekly meetings of the Joint Security Committee. Sha'th insists that their role will be purely "functional" - intended to keep the security role of the Israelis and PLO separate rather than united, with the Israeli Shin Beth officer and the PLO mukhabarat (intelligence) agent sitting down together, but operating independently of each other. "This will be `non-friction' co-ordination," one of the PLO negotiators said. "It is to make sure that the two armies don't shoot at each other." But it will be difficult to convince Palestinians that this rule will be adhered to, especially if the Israelis are searching for wanted Palestinians. Even the court systems -- the jurisdiction which each side will have over its own citizens and the arrangements for dealing with serious acts of violence by either side -- have not yet been agreed upon. The PLO's rules of engagement, set out in documents which have been shown to the Independent on Sunday, appear woefully inadequate. Armed Palestinian security forces may act, they say, in response to "an act or incident constituting a danger to body or property", provided the shooting "is aimed at preventing/terminating such an act or incident or at apprehending its perpetrators". Firearms may not be used except "within the law (sic)" and "as a last resort" after "warning the perpetrators or shots in the air" have failed to halt wrongdoers. So what if the Palestinians are confronted by thousands of Hamas demonstrators? Or by angry Israeli troops shooting at Palestinians on the edge of the "autonomous" area? Or if the Israelis are ambushed near the settlements and want to stage a military sweep through part of the autonomous area? Or if a settler is shooting at Palestinians, as Baruch Goldstein did in Hebron? What if the Israelis' nightmare -- a Katyusha rocket attack from "PLO" Gaza into Tel Ashqelon -- becomes a reality? One of the most senior of Sha'th's negotiators claims there is no point in debating this. "None of what we are doing will work if it's not an irreversible march towards peace," he says. "There is only one guarantee against a Katyusha attack -- that's the commitment of the Palestinians themselves that this peace process is worthwhile. The only way to stop Katyushas is for every Palestinian to regard anyone who fires a Katyusha as an enemy of Palestinian independence. What we are doing is creating conditions that the Israelis would be stupid to reverse." Creating those conditions however, is taking far longer than it should. Given the degree of hostility now facing 'Arafat in the occupied territories, many of the secret agreements may already be hostages to fortune. Over the past seven months, 'Arafat has announced his imminent arrival in Jericho on four separate occasions; but on current progress (or lack thereof) the PLO chairman is unlikely to keep even his latest promise to turn up next month. As for Gaza, there are those among his negotiators who suspect he will need all the military vehicles he can lay his hands on -- American or Egyptian -- to protect himself from his own people there.
