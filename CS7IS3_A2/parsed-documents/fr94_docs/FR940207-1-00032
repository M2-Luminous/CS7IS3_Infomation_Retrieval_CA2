FR940207-1-00032 FR940207-1-00004 The minimum Private Capital levels of $2.5 million for section 301(c) companies and $1.5 million for section 301(d) companies are floors established by the Act. If a Licensee has no Leverage, SBA is not at financial risk if Private Capital is reduced. Accordingly, ยง107.802 is proposed to be amended so that non-Leveraged Licensees may have voluntary decreases in Private Capital as long as they do not drop below the applicable statutory minimum. Licensees which are liquidating in accordance with a plan previously approved in writing by SBA may decrease private capital without restriction. All decreases in private capital for non-leveraged licensees shall still be reported to SBA pursuant to ยง107.1004(a). Under ยง107.904(a) SBA's prior written approval is presently required whenever a Licensee disposes of assets, including assets acquired in liquidation, by transfer to an Associate (except as a dividend); and SBA's approval is conditional upon a showing that the proposed terms of disposal are no less favorable to the Licensee than are elsewhere obtainable. The need for such a restriction is obvious when SBA is at risk as a guarantor, creditor, or investor. When no such risk to SBA exists, the need for the restriction disappears. Compliance With Executive Orders 12866, 12612, and 12778, and With the Regulatory Flexibility and Paperwork Reduction Acts Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule will not be a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 because, if promulgated as final, it is not likely to have an annual impact on the national economy of $100 million or more, and, for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , it will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. This rule is proposed pursuant to a statutory mandate (Section 408(d) of Pub. L. 102&hyph;366) direction SBA to review its regulations and to exempt non-Leveraged Licensees from compliance with those regulations primarily intended to insure the safety and soundness of Leveraged Licensees. The potential benefits of this proposed regulation have been set forth in the discussion above, under Supplementary Information. The potential cost of this proposed regulation cannot be quantified or estimated. SBA is not aware of reasonably feasible alternatives to this proposed rule. Executive Order 12612 SBA certifies that this proposed regulation has no federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612. Executive Order 12278 For the purposes of Executive Order 12278, SBA certifies that this proposed rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 2 of that Order.
