It accused Israel of being behind such deceptive lies. In the first comment on reports about a message received by Syrian Jews from sources claiming to belong to the Syrian Islamic Party for Justice and saying that it is permissible to spill Jewish blood, a Syrian official said that no such name exists at all. He added that the claims by American Jewish organizations that Jews in Syria were threatened and are facing the danger of revenge for the Hebron massacre, and the crocodile tears shed for the Jews of Syria by Israel and its Jewish organizations, from whom the American Jewish organizations get their orders, are all part of the continuous attempts to confuse and cast doubt on the situation in Syria and on the Syrian position advocating a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace. The Syrian official said that Israel knows very well that it would only reap failure and that it would never be able to absolve itself of the crimes it commits in broad daylight against Arab citizens and holy places. He accused Israel of always trying to force Arab Jews to immigrate to it, and then committing massacres against them to force them to commit massacres. [passage omitted]
