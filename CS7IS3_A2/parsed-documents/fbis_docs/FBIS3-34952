It wished them all "every success in serving the national cause in the context of their new options." Meanwhile, Colonel Salih al-Habbuni, deputy commander in chief of the "Libyan National Army" [LNA] (the NFSL's military arm), and Lieutenant Colonel 'Abdallah Ahmad al-Shaykhi, that army's chief of operations, have issued a statement criticizing LNA Commander Colonel Khalifah Haftar, saying that he "has no right to speak on behalf of the LNA" and that his statement was full of "fabrications, prevarications, and false claims." They stressed that the LNA "is a part of the NFSL's institutions." The day before yesterday 15 NFSL members announced that they were seceding from it. They included some leading members such as Burayk Suwaysi, Col. Haftar, 'Abd-al-Majid al-Saghir, 'Umar al-Fathali, and Yunis al-Fannush, and fund raisers such as al-Hajj al-Sabir Majid and Husayn Sufraki. In a separate detailed statement "in the name of the LNA's officers, warrant officers, and soldiers," Haftar announced his withdrawal from the NFSL and attacked its leadership "which has failed to rise to the level of the challenge." Al-Habbuni and al-Shaykhi issued a statement yesterday in which they said: "The press carried (the day before yesterday) a statement in the name of Col. Haftar on behalf of the LNA's officers and soldiers making numerous claims and accusations against the NFSL's leadership and in conclusion announcing his withdrawal from the NFSL.... In view of the fabrications, prevarications, and false allegations contained in that statement, we have decided that it is our struggle duty as well as our military and moral duty to disclose a number of things to the public." The statement added: "Col. Haftar has no right to speak on behalf of the LNA which is one of the NFSL's institutions founded by the joint will of all the officers, warrant officers, soldiers, and fedayeen and by a decision of the NFSL's Permanent Bureau on 21 June 1988." It continued: "The characterizations and charges made by Haftar against the NFSL and its leadership are unjust, offensive, and unfounded.... By announcing his withdrawal from the NFSL, Col. Haftar has lost his leadership status in the LNA which represents the NFSL's armed forces and is one of its institutions." In conclusion, the statement emphasized "pride in the NFSL, its role in the struggle, and its great and continuous efforts in manifestation of the national will seeking to overthrow the Libya regime and to replace it with a national, constitutional, and democratic alternative..., and pride in being a part of it and linked to its objectives, march, leadership, and legitimate institutions." It should be recalled that that those who split from the NFSL had issued two internal memoranda last August and November, the first focusing on the need for internal reforms, criticizing the internal and external methods of work, and calling for a revision of the organizational frameworks. The second strongly criticized NFSL Secretary General Dr. Muhammad al-Muqaryif for claiming responsibility for the military mutiny which occurred in Bani-Walid in Libya last October as a result of which, it said, NFSL members at home were hunted down and arrested. In December the NFSL's Permanent Bureau held a meeting attended by some of those who announced their secession the day before yesterday. It was agreed at that meeting that all the observerations, criticisms, and differences would be referred to the NFSL's National Council (the highest authority), which was due to convene in a matter of months, but the continuation of differences made it impossible to wait for that National Council's meeting and has led to the present state of affairs.
