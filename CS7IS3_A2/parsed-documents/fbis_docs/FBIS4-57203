"Peace might be around the corner, but we are living one of the most decisive and pivotal moments in Guatemalan history; consequently, political and military efforts are necessary in order to consolidate a long-desired peace in this nation," Enriquez Morales stated during the commencement of the 42d class of Kaibiles [Guatemalan counterinsurgency troops] in Poptun, Peten. Over 40 Guatemalan, Mexican, and Salvadoran soldiers received the Kaibil rank under the motto: "If I go forward, follow me. If I stop, hurry me up. If I go back, kill me." Enriquez Morales believes the end of the internal armed confrontation will cause serious problems. These problems, he asserted, will go beyond mere political bounds because a high level of misinformation exists and will prevail. He stressed that, as a result, the URNG will want to come out the front door [salir en caballo blanco], which will hinder national unity. Regarding the coming meeting between the government and the URNG in Oslo, Norway, scheduled for late May, Enriquez Morales said: "Let us hope there is political will on the part of the URNG to be able to sign, once and for all, a peace agreement by the end of 1994." Enriquez Morales, accompanied by the other members of the Army's high command, decorated over 40 Guatemalan, Mexican, and Salvadoran soldiers during the ceremony. These soldiers spent two months in Peten's jungle and earned the Kaibil rank. The commencement was held at the Kaibil Special Operations Center, located in the Zaculeu Plaza, known as Poptun's Hell [Infierno de Poptun]. Enriquez Morales added that the Army will reject a reduction of its troops so long as they are prepared to join the UN-led international peace security forces or blue helmets.
