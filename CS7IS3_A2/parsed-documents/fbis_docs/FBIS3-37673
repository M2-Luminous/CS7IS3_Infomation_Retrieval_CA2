Our program Details is now being broadcast live on Russia's TV. It will focus on the Bosnian crisis, in which a peaceful settlement has become possible after the initiative put forward by Russia yesterday. Today's guests are two politicians: Vladimir Petrovich Lukin, the chairman of the Duma Committee for International Affairs and, until recently, Russia's ambassador to the United States; and Mr. Thomas Pickering, the present U.S. ambassador to Russia. My first question is to you, Ambassador: Do you think that under the present circumstances the possibility of air strikes being delivered on the Serb positions near Sarajevo is still real? [Pickering] I think that under the current set of circumstances, when the diplomacy of President Yeltsin has made a serious difference in the attitude of the Bosnian Serbs, and we are working together to carry out the evacuation and control of heavy weapons around Sarajevo -- if all this continues to successful, then the main problems to be resolved in connection with the possible air strikes, will be the questions of violating the cease-fire. As you know, such attempts were made and the UN secretary general has asked for NATO's help in this respect. We hope no one will break the cease-fire. We hope for further success of Russian diplomacy. We hope that the process will reach a new stage and that we will perform that complicated work together and in partnership, which could bring a more permanent peace to Bosnia. [Svanidze] I have the same hopes as the ambassador. Now a question for you, Vladimir Petrovich. This current achievement of the Russian diplomacy -- if everything is resolved peacefully, as we all hope it will do -- that will really be a great achievement. What effect is this going to have on the relations between the legislative and executive branches of power? What is the Duma's attitude to this at the moment? I mean the Duma as a whole -- Mr. Zhirinovskiy, I know, will think it was all his work -- but the Duma as a whole? [Lukin] The Duma, as a whole, is a very complex notion. I must say that your suspicions are confirmed. The Liberal Democrats leader said today that all good things that are now happening or will happen in Bosnia, in Yugoslavia, have come about as a result of his visit there. [Svanidze] Sure. [Lukin] We all understand that he is exactly right. I will even say that there could not have been any other explanation, but the real problem is that I could not see any substantial differences in Duma's and our executive power's initial approaches to this problem. As you know, during the first days of this crisis, when the ultimatum was made, the Duma took a decision that said very clearly and unambiguously that it was against any sort of ultimatums, and expanding the scope of air raids. In the Duma's opinion one cannot reduce air raids and shooting by expanding the scope of air raids. At the same time, the Duma stressed the need for a very intensive search for political solutions. I think that the president and the executive power acted in line with this decision, and developments that have taken place or are happening now in line with this decision can only upset those who are not interested in coordinating the efforts of all the elements of the Russian state structure. [Svanidze] So do you think that the Duma shares this, let us hope, possible success for Russian diplomacy? [Lukin] The Duma shares all Russia's successes, including those made by Russian diplomacy, as long as they are successes. [Svanidze] Yes, of course. Ambassador, in your opinion, whose success is it -- if it turns out to be a success? Was it achieved by Russian diplomacy, working together with the Duma, of course, the United Nations, or NATO? What do you think? [Pickering] I have been in diplomacy long enough not to get involved in discussions of internal affairs in countries where I am accredited. But I think that there is enough credit to go around here. I think the most immediate step, and obviously (?a very important one), was produced by President Yeltsin's (?leadership) and various people working on the ground, and somehow (?we ended up with) a situation in which obviously the Bosnian Serbs had to consider very carefully what steps they took (?and they had to take account of) the work of the secretary general and the development of the UN position under the resolution. It all helped in the process of moving ahead. Realistically, I think we are not engaged in any fight or discussion about who takes credit [passage indistinct]. [Svanidze] Thank you. Vladimir Petrovich, what do you think about frequent talk of the contradiction in Western and Russian interests in the Balkans? This is stated frequently. What do you think about it? [Lukin] I think that we have a lot in common. I think that in the long term our victories and defeats will be the same, although, I agree with my friend Tom here. Listening to him, I remembered a French proverb saying that victory has a lot of father and that defeat is an orphan, but as far as long term prospects are concerned, what sort of interests can people, not wishing to see a conflict, have? They want to stop the conflict, to reach an agreement, finally to put an end to people being killed and see the observance of slight balances of national interests both within various communities -- who brought about the explosion of the whole process -- and on a more general scale in Europe. I am convinced that we can achieve this but one has to be careful. Every country has to look, not just in the mirror, but also in the window so that it can see its opponent, appreciate his arguments, and listen to them carefully from the very beginning. Only then will we achieve the settlement, we most definitely will because, of course, Russia wants fraternal and friendly nations -- and that is what they are -- to stop shooting each other. Finally, there is a chance, but I would like to emphasize that we are only talking about the possibility for settling this particular critical situation, however morbid it might be. After that there will be a very complex stage of settling the whole Bosnian problem. All sober thinking people, professionals and non-professional, will have to make a huge effort to resolve it. [Svanidze] Incidentally, I did not know you were personal friends, Vladimir Petrovich, I was not warned about this. You may have agreed on this before the program began, or is that ruled out? [Lukin] We have known each other long enough, and when Tom was leaving the United States we got together and had a lively and detailed discussion of our professional matters. We have met regularly since, and I have a great respect for this outstanding diplomat. [Pickering] Thank you. [Svanidze] Gentlemen, I have a question to you both. In the past few days, there has been a lot of talk about the health condition of President Yeltsin and his ability to work. More specifically, President Clinton failed to reach him on the telephone, and there have been many other rumors. Now it is known for sure that the message to the president of Serbia was signed by the Russian president who played an important role in -- well, at this stage let us call it an attempt to resolve the crisis. Let me ask you first, Vladimir Petrovich: Do you think that this stance of President Yeltsin will boost his rating and raise his prestige both in Russia and abroad? [Lukin] Well, first and foremost, I would like to say that I saw the president with my own eyes when John Major was here on a visit. I participated ex officio in some of the protocol events, and he was then in a normal working condition. The other side of the question -- excuse me, what did you ask? [Svanidze] The question was if Yeltsin's prestige would grow now because there has been a lot of talk about this recently -- about his ability to work. [Lukin] I think the prestige of everyone involved in this work will grow. I agree that in Russia the president was the person most involved in it, together with the people who worked on the spot. So, all the people who did this work deserve that their prestige should increase and it will increase. [Svanidze] And what is your opinion, Ambassador? [Pickering] I heard with interest what Vladimir was saying. I had great pleasure in being able to take part in the summit in January, and I thought that President Yeltsin's state was as Vladimir has said. I think that the leadership of President Yeltsin has played a significant role, as well as that of our country's president, since both them became involved in joint work. Unfortunately, due to a number of technical reasons, they failed to contact each other on the telephone, but they have been in touch several times since, including just this morning, and I have had several very good messages from President Clinton to your president, on developments in Bosnia, among other things. [Svanidze] Our time is up, thank you very much. I remind you that the guests of the Details tonight were Vladimir Lukin, the chairman of the Russian Duma Committee for International Affairs, and Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Russia. Goodbye.
