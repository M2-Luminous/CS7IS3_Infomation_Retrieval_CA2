Stewart discussed the development of bilateral ties with the local government. At a time the island is trying to resolve its problems amid serious difficulties, "it needs friends and support so the changes can be implemented in a positive and peaceful manner," the official said in a news conference before returning to her country. Stewart explained that Canada has that bilateral responsibility, adding it will internationally begin a process of discussions with other countries in the hemisphere to break every trace of isolation. She recognized, however, "it will be a slow process that will not change rapidly." Stewart said that despite the different views on the issue, her country must maintain an open dialogue in this regard with the United States, which has maintained a tight blockade against Cuba since 1962. "The reality is that Canada is not the only country that has relations with Cuba," the official indicated, upon recalling that states from Europe and other parts of the world maintain ties with the island, which "offers opportunities for the countries of the world." Regarding the position of Western hemisphere governments that Cuba must return to the OAS, Stewart said Canada will not impose conditions on that possibility "because we try to be respectful." Under this purview, Stewart commented on the decision of Caribbean governments to include Cuba in the Caribbean States Association, which will be formed soon. Canada will support and promote this idea, the official stressed. This reflects the fact that there is a growing understanding that Cuba's situation in the hemisphere must be revised, she commented. Stewart even said that Washington is gaining awareness of this and is reconsidering some points of its blockade policy, such as trips. In this regard, the official considered, "we must promote opening toward Cuba in the United States." Stewart referred to the position of a growing number of Cubans in the United States that this country must soften its rather ideological stand towards Cuba. According to Stewart, other nations in the hemisphere have adopted this position, and this could have an impact on U.S. policy. In light of criticism from the U.S. over Ottawa's decision to strengthen its ties with Havana, Stewart underscored that "despite the differences with the United States, with whom we held discussions at the OAS annual assembly, the reality is that I am here in Cuba and we will continue to increase our ties with the island." Stewart's visit is the most important by a Canadian official to Cuba since 1976, when then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau traveled to Havana. During a busy work schedule, Stewart met with President Fidel Castro, Vice President Carlos Lage, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, and the ministers of finance and prices and foreign investments and cooperation, Jose Luis Rodriguez and Ernesto Melendez, respectively. On Monday evening, Stewart inaugurated, together with Lage, an international conference on business opportunities on the island, sponsored by the British magazine, THE ECONOMIST. This conference is being attended by over 120 business executives from Canada, the United States, Great Britain, Europe, and Latin America. At the conference on Monday evening, Stewart praised the efforts of the Cuban State to try to preserve social programs such as education and health, amid an acute economic crisis. She expressed Canada's willingness to assist the island in whatever way it could. Stewart took the opportunity to announce the resumption of official economic aid from Ottawa to Havana, suspended in 1978, and she stressed her government's willingness to promote Canadian investment in Cuba.
