Professor Berov took part in the work of the cabinet on 7, 8, and 10 April, but on 11 April developed clinical symptoms that aroused suspicions that he had hepatitis. Laboratory tests are now being conducted to confirm this, and the results will be announced tomorrow or on the following day, the Government Press Center announced. According to acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, Professor Berov will be in quarantine for seven or eight days. He said that Professor Berov's state of health did not prevent him from having two lengthy conversations with the prime minister today. [Begin recording] [Correspondent] If I may comment on the delicate fact of the deterioriation in the prime minister's health, in this aspect, was the decision for him to come back to work not made somewhat prematurely, so as to serve a particular political situation? [Matinchev] I always maintained that what Professor Berov wanted to prove was beyond his powers. He is a man who during the period of his recuperation -- even if the process is 90 percent complete -- a man must always take account of the fact that in such a case, anyone's health is extremely fragile. [Correspondent] Nevertheless, the public has been left with the conviction that it was not a question of his own decision but a decision imposed from outside. [Matinchev] Precisely in connection with everything that people have started saying about this, I can tell you that it was the prime minister's own personal decision. If you were to ask me what my own personal attitude is, I advised him that he simply must limit his contacts to a minimum and leave to me and my colleague the matters concerning the administration of the Council of Ministers. [Correspondent] It would follow that his return to work simply saved the cabinet. [Matinchev] No, I would not say this is so. [end recording]
