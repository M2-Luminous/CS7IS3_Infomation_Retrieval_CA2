According to the PDS there is a solution to Italy's data processing problems: it is through the creation of a megastructure formed by none other than STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company] and Olivetti. An indissoluble union of public and private. The PDS plan is contained in a document that is still "top secret," to which the party's industrial experts are still adding the finishing touches. In the meantime, IRI's [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] financial institution has announced respectable results for 1993: net profits were over 1.4 trillion lire, with almost 30 trillion lire in combined revenues. All the while Finsiel, STET's leading company, is reorganizing: from now on it will consist of a department for directing operations and five "business units." "Innovation no longer exists in Italian data processing, where the time for young entrepreneurs, capable of launching daring challenges to pre-existing operators, has passed," the PDS document says. The document is a total of 24 pages plus 11 pages of tables. This is why it is necessary to create a conglomerate that will directly involve Tecnitel's STET, Finsiel, and Olivetti. It is in fact impossible to overcome the crisis "without the direct involvement of STET, with its manufacturing department of telecommunications equipment and network services, and with its data processing services department (Finsiel), and Olivetti and its manufacturing and services department." According to [Achille] Occhetto's [PDS secrtary] party, this conglomerate will be in a position to gather together all the small and medium-sized enterprises of the sector, and thanks to oportune alliances with European partners, will be able to face the big competitors. The PDS's plan is a radical one, behind which lies an unclear diagnosis of the Italian and international data processing sectors. The Italian data processing sector is made up of companies with a "scarce capacity to understand the situation," says the PDS, and where a "strong trend towards daily production, without long-term goals, exists." They are companies that "did not know how to take advantage of opportunities presented by financed research projects." In the research field, the efforts of Italian companies "are not only less than those of companies in other countries, but above all, they are not focused on national advantages and involve research of little use and scarce productivity." What's more, "investments abroad tend to be ignored." But the document does not limit itself to drawing a global picture of the sector, it closely examines the situation of individual companies, all of which are not very comforting. Olivetti? "It cannot make it alone." IBM? "It's beginning to gasp." As for Bull, "it is too dependent on the lobby system and public administration." According to the PDS, if Olivetti is incapable of overcoming the present "difficult phase," a problem will be created not just for the Ivrea conglomerate, "but the entire Italian data processing field will ready to collapse." The Finsiel group position appears to be better off. "It is moving in an opposite direction from the rest of the sector which is encountering great difficulty in even maintaining its position." Nevertheless, the "progressive" experts do not hide the difficulties inherent in the project. The document states that this conglomerate "is not easy to manage." That is why its strategic management "must be given to a group of managers that have not been compromised by the errors of the industrial and old power systems." It requires a management with strong technical expertise, capable of exercising a cultural leadership with high professional integrity. Is the PDS "planning" the future of Italian data processing? In the meantime, STET is grinding out profits. Yesterday in Athens, where he was present at the inauguration of the Athens-Salonica highway mobile radio network, Michele Tedeschi, the number-two man at STET, reported its net profits for 1993 were over 1.4 trillion lire, more or less in line with those of 1992. Consolidated revenues were almost 3O trillion lire; an increase of more than 1O percent.
