The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the prosecutor of the Jordanian State Security Court, which handles cases affecting state security, expected the number of the detainees to increase, and that a number of Kalashnikov machineguns, explosives, and pistols were found in the possession of the accused and in some hideouts in Amman. Disclosing some details about the detainees, the source said that they had all gone to Afghanistan via a third state, that some of them received training there for three months on various types of weapons, and that the detainees did not know one another but they did know their leader and commander who is also now under detention with them. The source added that they operated in small cells with one secret official in charge and that they did not give their organization any name because they did not want such a name to circulate and eventually lead to their exposure. He said that they had confessed that they all belonged to one group which had one leader who is now detained with them, and that they used to arrange their travel to Afghanistan through individuals returning from Afghanistan who would supply them with air tickets and addresses to go to in other states, and that they would stay at some relief home [Bayt i'ashah] until someone came to provide them with the necessary information and requirements after which they would go to Afghanistan. They emphasized in their confessions that they had worked for the elimination of vice which, to them, meant movie theaters, video cassettes, bars, and shops which sell alcoholic drinks. They also confessed that they had planned to assassinate Jordanian and Palestinian prominent civilian and military figures, and that their actions were also aimed against the current peace process and geared toward preventing the conclusion of peace agreements with Israel. The Jordanian source expected the investigation to be completed and the entire case to be referred to the Jordanian State Security Court around the middle of this current month. The recent explosion in the Salwa movie theater in the town of al-Zarqa', in which Egyptian citizen 'Id al-Jahhalin (the man who planted the bomb) was injured and had his two legs and one finger in his left hand amputated, enabled the Jordanian authorities to lay their hands on the first strings of the case. Al-Jahhalin confessed that his task was only to plant the detonator in the timer of the explosive device which included four coconut-shaped bombs. Al-Jahhalin, who is now at al-Zarqa' government hospital, said that he regretted what he did.
