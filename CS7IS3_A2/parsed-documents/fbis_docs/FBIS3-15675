On the same day, the opposition distributed a statement among the deputies calling for recognizing the results of the March 1 vote on Georgia's joining the CIS null and void. On March 1, the parliament ratified the treaty on the republic's joining the CIS by a majority of 121 votes, with 47 votes against and 4 abstentions. According to the opposition, a two-thirds majority, or 145 votes, rather than a simple majority was required to pass the decision. On the whole, the Georgian parliament includes 220 deputies. At the same time, opponents to the republic's membership in the CIS agreed to the proposal by Parliamentary Speaker Vakhtang Goguadze to allow international experts to decide on the legality of the ratification. Simultaneously, the Social Democratic Party of Georgia which supports joining the CIS called on the opposition to regard this issue of paramount importance for the republic with due understanding. During the session, deputy Tengiz Sigua pointed to the need to provide an answer to a recent statement by Armenian Foreign Minister Vagan Papazian. In an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, the Armenian minister did not rule out the possibility of his republic's applying pressure upon Georgia, if goods are not promptly delivered to Armenia from the seaports of Batumi and Poti. He also demanded an end to acts of sabotage on the railroads and pipelines going through the Georgian territory. Sigua described the statement as "diplomatic blackmail and policy of intimidation" pointing out that "such a statement by an Armenian official must not be left without an adequate reaction."
