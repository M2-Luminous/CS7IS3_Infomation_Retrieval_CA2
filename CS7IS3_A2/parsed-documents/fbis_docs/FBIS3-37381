Here is what Mikhail Kolesnikov himself said about the report of his resignation: "This is another fabrication. The purpose of such articles, in my view, is to sow mutual enmity, force a split within the leadership of the Defense Ministry, and thus weaken one of the most stable of state institutions -- the Russian Armed Forces. These articles personally do no more than disgust me. This is all the more unpleasant since we have established good businesslike relations with many mass media. "I would like to appeal to mass media leaders and journalists. We are open, we are always ready for frank, constructive discussion. We do not make a secret of our plans or the state of the Armed Forces, we do not make a secret of our work. Journalists are frequent visitors to us. Not a single function of public importance takes place at the Defense Ministry or the General Staff without representatives of the mass media being involved. So those people who are really interested in obtaining reliable information about the Armed Forces have every opportunity to do so."
