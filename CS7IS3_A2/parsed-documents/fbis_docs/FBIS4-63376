The matter concerns the handing over on 16 May in the residence of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of two former Soviet POW's seized by a group supporting Golboddin Hekmatyar during the war in Afghanistan. After many years of imprisonment and deprivation in camps run by the Afghan opposition, the two Russian men, Yuriy Stepanov from Bashkiria and Aleksey Olenin from Kuybyshev Oblast, have been allowed to return home. I welcome the release from captivity of Aleksey Olenin and Yuriy Stepanov, the Russian foreign minister said today. Their return home was made possible by the constant attention of the Russian leadership to the problems of finding and freeing former Soviet POWs captured in Afghanistan, and to the joint efforts in this area of the Foreign Ministry, other Russian departments, and the Committee for Affairs of Soldiers Serving Abroad, the Russian foreign minister said. Kozyrev expressed hope that constructive interaction between the leaderships of Russia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan will continue, in order to solve the humanitarian problem of POW's as soon as possible. According to Russian Defense Ministry figures there are 290 of our soldiers missing in Afghanistan. It is known that 60 or 70 of them are alive. Leonid Biryukov, head of the section for the finding and freeing of missing soldiers of the Committee for Affairs of Soldiers Serving Abroad under the council of CIS heads of government, who cited these figures to the ITAR-TASS correspondent, expressed confidence that all the Afghan war veterans who had been separated from their homeland would certainly be reunited with it. The complex work to rescue our soldiers captured in Afghanistan will continue.
