FR940404-1-00045 FR940404-1-00020 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AB56 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Withdrawal of Proposed Rule To Designate Critical Habitat for the Little Mariana Fruit Bat, Mariana Fruit Bat, Guam Broadbill, Mariana Crow, Guam Micronesian Kingfisher, and Guam Bridled White-Eye AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final decision; withdrawal of proposed rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) withdraws the proposal to designate critical habitat for six endangered forest species on Guam: The little Mariana fruit bat ( Pteropus tokudae ), Mariana fruit bat ( Pteropus mariannus mariannus ), Guam broadbill ( Myiagra freycineti ), Mariana crow ( Corvus kubaryi ), Guam Micronesian kingfisher ( Halcyon cinnamomina cinnamomina ), and Guam bridled white-eye ( Zosterops conspicillatus conspicillatus ). Most of the lands proposed for critical habitat have now been protected by the inclusion of these lands in the Guam National Wildlife Refuge. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent under the Endangered species Act (Act). ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, room 6307, P.O. Box 50167, Honolulu, Hawaii 96850. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert P. Smith, at the above address (808/541&hyph;2749). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In the final rule listing a number of Guam species, published August 27, 1984, in the Federal Register (49 FR 33881), the Service determined endangered status for seven birds and two mammals: Guam broadbill (Myiagra freycineti), Mariana crow (Corvus kubaryi), Mariana gallinule (moorhen) (Gallinula chloropus guami), Micronesian kingfisher (Halcyon cinnamomina cinnamomina), Guam rail (Rallus owstoni), Vanikoro swiftlet (Aerodramus vanikorensis bartschi), Guam bridled white-eye (Zosterops conspicillatus conspicillatus), little Mariana fruit bat (Pteropus tokudae), and the Guam population of Mariana fruit bat (Pteropus mariannus mariannus). These species are found in the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific in the Territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, both under the jurisdiction of the United States. The six species, along with three other species, were listed as endangered on August 27, 1984. In a proposed rule published in the Federal Register on June 14, 1991 (56 FR 115), critical habitat was proposed for six of these endangered forest species on Guam: the little Mariana fruit bat, Mariana fruit bat, Guam broadbill, Mariana crow, Guam Micronesian kingfisher, and Guam bridled white-eye. Comments related to the proposed critical habitat designation were solicited during four public comment periods held: June 14, 1991, through August 13, 1991; October 15, 1991, through October 31, 1991; June 12, 1992, through July 15, 1992; and March 1, 1993, through March 31, 1993. A public hearing on the critical habitat proposal was held in Guam on July 31, 1991. The six species were once distributed in the forests throughout Guam, but by the time they were listed in 1984, their ranges had been severely reduced. The species continue to decline in the wild. The main cause of the decline at the time of listing was not known with certainty, but probable causes included predation by introduced animals (most notably the brown tree snake), habitat loss, and, for the two species of fruit bats, hunting. It has become increasingly clear that predation by the introduced brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) is the primary cause of decline for the endangered birds (Savidge 1987). For fruit bats, poaching is a serious threat along with predation by the brown tree snake (DAWR 1993). The Mariana crow is currently extant in the wild on Guam and the neighboring island of Rota, 44 miles to the north of Guam. The population on Rota has been relatively stable and, based on a 1982 survey, was believed to number about 1,300 individuals (Engbring et al. 1986). Additional surveys will be conducted on Rota, starting in 1994, to acquire more current information. On Guam, the population has declined and is now believed to number approximately 50 individuals (DAWR 1993), with little or no successful reproduction since 1986. Compared to other forest birds native to Guam, the Mariana crow requires relatively large tracts of forest that do not have high levels of human activity.
