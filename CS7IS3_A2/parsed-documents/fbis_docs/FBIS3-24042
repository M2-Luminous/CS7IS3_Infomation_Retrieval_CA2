[Birkavs] Yes, this victory places upon us the responsibility of seriously preparing for the next meeting, for the Lithuanian government anticipates holding this next sports meeting in Kaunas, in the famous arena where the "Zalgiris" team normally plays before five thousand spectators. In addition, the head of the Lithuanian government said that they will now begin serious training. If we are talking about the significance of the recent game, then, it seems to me, it very much strengthened our informal contacts with the Lithuanian government. [Bekeris] How did you do personally in this game? [Birkavs] I didn't even notice how quickly I received the five personal fouls. But I had the honor of tossing in the second and third baskets in the beginning. Then the [Economics Minister Ojars] Kehris and [Internal Affairs Minister Girts] Kristovskis offensive started. [Bekeris] In your New Years speech, heard by all the people, you picturesquely spoke of, cited, "the golden sands of the economy, which will not pour into our own hands because they are found in the bottom half of our hour glass. The structure of the national economy must be turned to its proper position so that the sands can pour into Latvia's granaries." The new year, as they say, is moving along, but the old one leaves its own legacy. What is that? [Birkavs] Perhaps, examining it superficially, it appears that nothing in particular is happening with the economy. But in reality we already in the previous year have put in place and also this year are putting into place, the foundation that will will permit the economy to recover. Statistics indisputably show that this process has begun. Of course, it has not been as rapid as we would like, not as grand, and yet the volume of production grows larger and the consumer price index confirms that this recovery process also influences prices. In principle, the process to a greater or lesser degree happens in accordance with our projections. What sorts of tasks must the government complete this year? We must reduce interest rates on loans, although in regard to this a completely clear future is not apparent. The privatization process must be sped up. I hope that the package of bills will be adopted immediately. It will speed up this process even more and provide the opportunity to restructure production. That is why there is a basis for the economic projection of five percent growth in total production. That is a significant indicator, but it is "large" only because we have "fallen greatly". This year Latvia will receive the most investment in Eastern Europe: a total of $600 million. Other investments will accompany this. The conditions which were placed on all investments are skillful and economical utilization of our local human resources and factories. Therefore the determining factors for economic recovery are investment, privatization, and a decline in borrower interest rates. In the future they will be the steps that will turn the structure of the economy in the right direction. [Bekeris] The Saeima has passed on its first reading the government's budget proposal. But if this proposal is thrown out or derailed.... [Birkavs] Even the strongest structure can be derailed, but this budget is still not the "strongest structure." It is only balancing the fragile. In the course of discussions a whole range of emphases appeared, quite essential supplements and also new priorities, including defense policy, which require greater financing than we had anticipated. Therefore everything depends on how precisely we will be able to work these new demands into the budget by the second reading. I do not think that it is possible to improve the budget significantly. We have maximal%w increased revenues, maximally sought to balance the budget's social part with expenditures.... The vote on child subsidies placed an immense supplemental load on the CM [Cabinet of Ministers]. In fact it will not resolve the problems of the "poorest," but more likely of the "most prosperous." Still, we have found an option, putting forth an amendment to resolve this problem. Indexing pensions also requires supplemental expenditures. That is why we must carry out some very difficult jobs by the second reading, and I hope that we will succeed in establishing an economic structure which the Saeima will not be able to destroy. [Bekeris] Would the complete rejection of the budget proposal threaten the resignation of the government? [Birkavs] I passed Mr. Kirsteins on my way back to my seat, after I gave my "budget speech," which I closed by saying that by not accepting it the Saeima invokes Article 7 of the Cabinet of Ministers system: an expression of no confidence in the government. Mr. Kirsteins said to me, "But that could not happen on the first reading. We must wait for the second." In essence we announced the budget policy with the first reading. With the second reading of the budget, if it is amended to the point that it no longer corresponds to government policy, if it is "harmonized" so that it no longer corresponds to our priorities, then I will simply resign. But it would be much easier for me to resign, and I have emphasized it many times, if our opposition had drafted an alternative budget. Then I would have a clear conscience, for I would know who was coming after me and with what sort of political outlook. Right now I will do everything so that the budget is adopted and the government's priorities are accepted, and therefore I will not resign. But, if this budget is voted down, then, as I already said, Article 7 will go into effect and my "easy life" will begin. [Bekeris] The previous government was not threatened with this "easy life." [Birkavs] No. In no way. We worked out that article ourselves. The Cabinet of Ministers discussed this rule, for the budget is the government's and the nation's policy in figures. [Bekeris] What have been the consequences of the "significant" new year's date, the events of 10 January? Did Vidzeme borough council chairman Andrejs Rucs really cause a crisis situation? And another related question about this situation, which was predicted to have far-reaching consequences: Why was Supreme Court chairman Gvido Zemribo the first to react with his statement, rather than the government? [Birkavs] I think the the government reaction was sufficiently active, clear and unambiguous. I must say candidly that the world has evaluated it positively. That is also discernable from the side of Russia, for our bilateral negotiations have not been interrupted. But still, we encountered two impediments right after these events. That is the Northwestern Army Group's declaration about shooting if their installations are threatened, and Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev's declaration that the Baltic states belong within "their" sphere of interest. Even if we ignore the later retraction of this declaration, we must be extraordinarily careful and capable in our actions. Our capacity for action became clear even before Kozyrev's declaration: We announced that national security is our priority number one. The actions of Rucs were the catalyst and to a large extent laid bare the situation. It threw us back considerably in our negotiations with Russia, significantly limiting our ability to maneuver in these negotiations. I must say that although Rucs demonstrated completely apolitical action, it still expressed that popular desire, to wit, that it is high time for the Russian army to leave. There can be no more procrastinating, for the coatrack is full and patience is almost at an end. [Bekeris] The Vidzeme borough municipal deputies corps has demanded that Rucs be allowed to return to his former position. [Birkavs] I would not want to read tea leaves. Rubiks was elected to the Saeima, Siegerist was elected. The viewpoint of the public is a sacred thing. If there is no legal hurdle, of course, Mr. Rucs will be able to return to his former post. But I think that this event illuminates for us also the necessity for regulating relations between municipalities and the government more precisely, for until now the status of municipal deputies has been higher than the status of Saeima deputies. If a Saeima deputy has committed an offense, he can immediately be detained, but municipal deputies may not be. I do not assume that deputies are criminally inclined, but offenses as such create an exclusive situation in which it is necessary to act. This kind of situation must be precisely reflected in law. [Bekeris] The Russian Foreign Minister's declaration has been heard throughout the world. After it was made the thoughts were expressed that it was incorrectly understood and translated. Did you perceive it in the same way? [Birkavs] Nothing was misunderstood. That is Kozyrev's style: First to express himself very strongly, then to turn around completely, see what the reaction will be, and after that to say, 'I was not even thinking that.' Let's remember his Stockholm speech. In essence it was a professional overture, how far can Russia permit herself to go in her statements and actions, especially after the meeting between Clinton and Yeltsin. There were no misunderstandings or inadvertant word games, but rather a deliberate action by Kozyrev to explain what the reaction will be. [Bekeris] What, in your opinion, is the status of the Latvian army? Can this force be viewed as a guarantor of national security? [Birkavs] The guarantor of Latvia's independence and security are the Latvian people themselves. The Army only carries out certain functions in order to enforce this guarantee with weapons in hand. Today (21 January) I had my regular meeting with Defense Force leaders. We must seriously turn to defense questions so that with minimal resources we can acquire a maximally organized and battle ready defense system. People must have faith in the army and must feel secure. I must admit that until now we really have not addressed the army's problems--I will not mince my words--we have neglected them. If security becomes priority number one, then we must guarantee normal supplies of weapons and ammunition for the army. But we cannot become involved in some sort of arms race which would leave us naked and impoverished. We must evaluate our options, but we cannot pursue them at the cost of the educational, cultural or social spheres. [Bekeris] How has the situation with the intelligence services developed? The veil of ignorance and secrecy surrounding them gives rise to malicious rumors and gossip. [Birkavs] The situation with the intelligence services is unsatisfactory. I think that that will not continue for long. The Cabinet of Ministers has prepared a restructuring program for the intelligence services. The new order will bring all of these systems into mutual harmony. Each worker will receive precise, certain duties. Everything will be done so that the country is better supplied with information, timely analysis and everything else that is necessary for her security. The Cabinet of Ministers adopted article 81 of the counter-intelligence rules, which the Saeima did not accept. Therefore the government will put forth an initiative asking that the Saeima accept them on an urgent basis, for the rules heretofore do not satisfy me personally. [Bekeris] Will we soon be able to produce goods, both manufactured and agricultural goods, marked "Made in Latvia" for the world market and really ensure coverage of the lats? Right now there is talk of a stable lats being an illusion, emphasizing that the lats is competing with the dollar in an uneven battle, unsuccessfully seeking to conquer stable foreign currency. [Birkavs] Latvian goods will never make it to the world market if they are oriented only toward the Eastern market. On the other hand, if these goods are oriented toward that sphere which in which it is very difficult to compete right now, toward the Western market, then they will always be able to compete in Russia's market also. That is why, it seems to me, we must think about what direction we want our economy moving in. We can go to the Eastern market, renewing our old economic connections and not especially renovating our technology. But let's take into account that there is no foreign capital in Russia either, and that that country too, with the free market regime Western goods are flooding in. This market is large, and within it also there stands a high capacity for competition. That is why it is better to orient ourselves to the West, but always, knowing that we can go to the East, it is not necessary to orient ourselves completely to this market. As pertains to the illusory stability of the lats.... Its actual stability will alway depend upon the [central] bank's economic monetary policy connection with all national economic policy. If monetary policy is just as isolated from national economic policy as it has been until now, then the stability of the lats may be threatened. But they may not interfere in administrative undertakings; in this well considered cooperation is essential. [Bekeris] Did the rapid decline in production of manufactured goods and the accompanying unemployment, cause you to worry? [Birkavs] Obviously the chief problem this year will be the increase in unemployment and the accompanying expenditures for retraining the unemployed. But it is better to invest money in unemployment benefits and training than to maintain enterprises which produce goods for warehouses and produce them for a higher price than anywhere else in the world. As enterprises go bankrupt and close the next action must immediately follow: New jobs must be created. Toward this end either private companies must take over the factories, or foreign investment must flood in, or the appropriate state policy must be implemented with investment. That is one of the heaviest issues which, I think, we will be able to resolve positively this year; utilizing domestic accumulation for investment. Currently we are chiefly financing future technological projects on the basis of foreign credits. Domestic investment reserves are small. [Bekeris] The rate of inflation keeps going up. How long will that continue? [Birkavs] Inflation has its own laws. After the introduction of the turnover tax the anticipated increase in the rate of inflation reached its maximum in December and November of last year. Now the prognosis is stronger: the rate has a tendency to slide downward. In relation to the increase in the turnover tax, I made this prognosis precisely at that time; the talk was of three or four months in which an increase in inflation was inescapable, which would worsen the economic situation. Just as inescapable is a further decrease in inflation and the stabilization of the situation. The appropriate economic policy is being maintained, as confirmed by international experience. [Bekeris] The current bureaucracy is being critized. Under the influence of the law on civil service a new, and, we must hope, progressive and intelligent "bureaucratic apparatus" will be established. What are your thoughts about that? [Birkavs] An interesting phenomenon can be observed: They strongly criticize the bureaucracy, but do not want to establish a new bureaucracy. I undoubtedly evaluate positively the new reform of the bureaucracy. That is one of our programmatic assignements: to bring order to the bureaucracy and train them. The new bureaucracy reform is receiving no small amount of criticism, but I am satisfied to a certain extent because currently the existing bureaucrats very fearful of these changes. I think that no honorable or forward-looking bureaucrat is afraid of the reform. I could argue over whether this bureaucratuc reform must occur at such a fast tempo. But bureaucracy is a basic element of every country's mechanism. It is important that bureaucrats serve the public. Right now we are all dissatisfied with the bureaucracy. That is why we should not be stingy with work and resources in this area. I do not see a different road. Right now many of the more capable and smarter people are leaving the bureaucracy, going to work for private companies. We cannot pay bureaucrats high salaries, but we can compensate for this work with the greatest demands of the bureaucracy, which are related to sufficient social guarantees. Thousands of people want to work securely, not to feel threatened, to serve the country, to serve the people. The law on the bureaucracy is vitally essential. [Bekeris] The current bureaucracy is connected with bribe taking and bribe giving. I would like to mention another one of your public pronouncements, when your were speaking of a specific example of bribe giving. The state reform minister Maris Gailis became a sacrifice to that. But by starting with holding the bribe givers responsible, is not the corruption problem being resolved from the wrong end? They say that if there were no bribe takers, then bribe givers would not arise. Of course the reaction of Maris Gailis was sharp and dignified, as becomes a high-ranking official. [Birkavs] Information about a person who takes bribes is broadcast rather quickly. They give to those who take, but they do not even make offers to those who do not take and they try to find alternative ways around them. The needed information about those "takers" disappear into the sand, for there is no one who will point a finger, 'See, this official takes bribes.' And only recently special operations have been carried out on the borders, where customs agents were arrested for taking a $2,500 bribe, a concrete fact was demonstrated. Or in the Riga Central Market, when several security police workers were arrested for demanding bribes from illegal liquor sellers. Only when special operations are conducted or preparing a special professional provokation to catch a guilty one, then bribe givers or bribe takers can possibly be caught. In corruption both parties, the taker and the giver, are interested in hiding the crime. In these crimes the so-called likelihood is the highest. There are crimes in which both parties are interested in finding the criminals, let's say murder. Representatives of state justice protection services and the victim's loved ones are direclty interested in rapid, operational investigation of the crime. You will be more interested in the apprehension of a pickpocket if you are one of the victims, for the state's interest in these crimes is determined, if only because the police cannot cope with all the pickpockets. But crimes in which both parties are interested in hiding the transgression, such as bribe taking and taking, are the most difficult to investigate. The battle against corruption must be waged with special actions; those who carry it out must be given special rights and assignments. [Bekeris] Are you still leading the Jurists Association of Latvia? [Birkavs] Still. Although I have passed down my authority and given it over to the association's four vice presidents. But I have remained in this post formally and just recently I attended the association's five year anniversary party. I also participate in the association's council meetings. The Association of Lawyers is helping me greatly in terms of implementing the judicial reform by providing me with specific proposals. [Bekeris] Doesn't the decreased financing of the justice system threaten their independence, and perhaps for that very reason it is difficult for it to lose its political coloring, to better carry out juridical, that is law enforcement duties? [Birkavs] I do not want to agree that the justice system is melting away on account of financing. This year to this end we developed a financial foundation. Last year I personally obtained a salary increase for judges, which, because of inflation, unfortunately, was ineffective. Salaries in the procuracy were also increased, but we must acknowledge that it has all been insufficient. Now we are ensuring a judicial reform with a financial basis. Have the courts been politicized? In my opinion, this time has already receded into the past. Judges and, I hope, also all the other justice system institutions are depoliticized in point of fact. [Bekeris] What sort of evaluation could you make as a lawyer of the actions of Justice Minister [Egils] Levits, when in his institution, in reducing its status, he nevertheless was forced, by a legal order, to rehire the laid-off workers into their previous posts? [Birkavs] The answer to your previous question is hiding here. Notwithstanding that this was the Justice Minister, the court rehired the laid-off workers. This affair could also have been "approached politically." The court fulfilled its duty to the blind goddess of justice. [Bekeris] How do you assess the activities of emigre Latvians who have returned to their homeland to work in responsible posts in the Latvian state? [Birkavs] There can be no general analysis. All of the emigre Latvians cannot be measured on one criterion. Mr. Siegerist is also Latvian by ancestory. Everbody is different, more or less professional in their actions, every one of them has made their own path in life. And I think that they enrich our lives to a large extent with their worldly experience. I would not want to say that they are not needed here. These are people who are developing into a part of our people, who are Latvians just like us, only with a different education and life's experience. I would not permit myself to judge any of them as higher or lower. Under no circumstances would I distinguish the emigres over our own folks, who lived for so long "in the Soviet regime," or vice versa: distinguishing "our own" above "them." Everyone has their own individual shortcomings, pluses and minuses. In my opinion if someone is irresponsible in his position, then he must be relieved. A local can be just as irresponsible in his assigned post as can be an emigre Latvian. [Bekeris] Still, the emigres do not have our real life insights. [Birkavs] Of course. But now that they have arrived in the homeland they are beginning to have better insights, they are running into the same negations with which we "locals" grapple. But the fact that they perceive it differently enriches our mutual insights. [Bekeris] What is your view of adoption of the citizenship law? Isn't it a sort of a frontier barrier, a trench which we move away and move away, fearing to take the fateful leap, for we might blunder, break a leg or, in the worst case, even the backbone? [Birkavs] Your comparison is truly unique and graphic. Also not without basis. This jump could have been made long ago, without fear of anything. I had hoped that this law would be adopted last year. I still think that worries and the many arguments have a strong basis, for the talk is not merely of citizenship, but also about the fate of the nation. Two classical approaches are evident. The radical position, which is dominated by the survival and protection of the nation, and the second position, which is dominated by the development of the nation. This approach can be characterized by the prohibition, that nothing should be adopted. Or also that this law should be maximally narrowed. Truth is to be foundin the unification of the principles of national survival and national development. Now the first step has already been taken, to be followed by the second, third and fourth. Obviously there will be a referendum. [Bekeris] Do contacts between the Prime Minister and the President continue to be good? Mr. Ulmanis emphasized the significance of understanding in his New Year's interview with RIGAS BALSS. [Birkavs] I think that we have an understanding. In my view the chief assignment from my side is to ensure stability. Understanding from one side, stability from the other; that would the most important thing. [Bekeris] Does your mutual relationship also include arguments? [Birkavs] I haven't noticed any real arguments. But, taking into account that the institution of the Presidency is renewed and new, on many ocassions there arises the necessity to meet, not to resolve misunderstandings, but to make more precise our actions in conformance with the Constitution. We each see common goals from our own positions. Here arises that prerogative, if the President emphasizes a question of understanding, then I, as the Prime Minister, with the executive agencies must ensure this understanding. [Bekeris] How do you evaluate the press? What is your attitude toward "angry" journalists, who often are accused also of destructive activities? [Birkavs] I think that words must be free, but words may not destroy the state. And, if this boundary is transgressed, then I would like to work very actively. [Bekeris] And again, Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to hold you to your words, which you have spoken publicly. Specifically, that journalist who is able to offend you in the press will be granted an award from your personal salary. Does this promise provide proof of the distinguished self-critical abilities, or also do you as a person feel that your unconqerable sense of humor is being trampled down? [Birkavs] My colleagues warned me that journalists may now begin a contest to make me look as black as they can. But I bear no ill will either toward people or journalists. I assess people according to their material qualities and according to what orients them. If people are oriented toward evil, then action must be taken. If people are writing malicious things because of lack of understanding, then we must talk to them and explain things. If they are mistaken, then they must be forgiven. But, if they, in doing their jobs, strive and make my nose appear bigger than it is, then that is really nothing, so why should I be angry with it? [Bekeris] How do you evaluate the judicial process, where we have cases of insulting honor and reputation, and the publication is the defendant? [Birkavs] The most recent information I have received is that the journalist Gailums was fined 1,000 lats. I thought to myself, first of all, where will Gailums get that kind of money? And the second thing that came to mind, doesn't this judgment muzzle journalists? And such a situation could be much more significant than the material difficulties that have been applied to Gailums. We must establish normal relations between the press and the courts. That is a fine matter. The freedom of the press is absolutely necessary in a normal country. There are a few signals that bother me a bit. What is the journalists own responsibilities regarding the information he disseminates? For what and where should be held responsible? Those are the nuances which in conditions of a lasting free press are polished filigree, but we have not done that. As we end our discussion, I will use the opportunity in this first month of the new year to wish the readers of RIGAS BALSS that they not lose their optimism, for optimism is the foundation. [Bekeris] Thank you.
