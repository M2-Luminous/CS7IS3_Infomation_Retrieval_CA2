Hata said he will try to break the deadlock between trade negotiators of the two countries so that Hosokawa and Clinton can look back on the results of the talks with satisfaction when they meet Friday. The foreign minister, who was originally scheduled to depart for Washington along with Hosokawa on Thursday, said he was leaving early on instructions from the premier. He said his schedule in Washington has yet to be fixed. Hata, who doubles as deputy prime minister, said he will impress upon his U.S. interlocutors how determinedly the present administration has been in its attempts to revive the Japanese economy and stimulate increased imports from the U.S. and other countries. He suggested there is a lack of understanding in the U.S. Government in that regard. Hosokawa and Clinton are scheduled to assess progress in the bilateral economic talks being held under a trade framework accord concluded last July. Hata said he wants to tackle the matter before the summit begins, so that the two leaders can have broad discussions on areas other than the economy. Asked about the idea of setting numerical targets to gauge the openness of Japanese markets, Hata did not dismiss it out of hand, saying instead, "we will discuss the matter keeping in mind the potential implications, including what the implications could be internationally." But Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura suggested earlier Wednesday that Tokyo will continue to oppose such a move. "In the negotiations, the Japanese Government has taken the stance that it is very difficult to accept the proposal for numerical targets," he said. Takemura added he believes Hata "will finalize political negotiations before the summit in line with this basic stance."
