FBIS4-11252 "drlat077_m_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-077 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 Brazil Trade Mission Departs for Vietnam Trade Mission Departs for Vietnam PY1904211294 Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 16 Apr 94 p 5 PY1904211294 Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL Portuguese BFN [Text] The first Brazilian trade mission since the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 1989 departed on 15 April for Hanoi. The group, which is headed by Ambassador Celso Marcos, chief of the Itamaraty Trade Promotion Department, is made up of diplomats and representatives of several sectors of the economy. The trip's purpose is to detect business opportunities as a result of the Vietnamese economic opening since the end of last year. The civil construction, energy and electricity, oil and petrochemical, agrobusiness, and car parts industries are represented in the mission, AGENCIA BRASIL has reported. The Vietnamese Government already has informed Itamaraty of its interest in developing economic and trade relations with Brazil, especially in infrastructure projects. There are considerable possibilities in other fields, another Brazilian diplomat said. Thus, these contacts may increase bilateral trade, like in the fields of food and heavy machinery manufacturing. The oil field also is interesting for Brazil, which is why Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], Braspetro [Petrobras International, Inc.], and Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc.] have sent representatives on this mission. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim believes the intensification of relations with Vietnam may open new markets for Brazilian companies as well as for Vietnamese companies. Last year, Brazilian exports to Vietnam were $4.2 million, while imports from there were $13.5 million. Brazil imported nearly $3 million worth of rice alone. The main goods exported by Brazil were chemical products and industrial equipment. The rapprochement with Vietnam is part of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry's strategy to increase trade with the Asian countries that have had the greatest economic growth indexes in the whole world in the past few years. Nearly 16 percent of Brazilian international trade is carried out with this region. Trade with this region, according to Itamaraty, is well below its potential. Beside the mission that went to Hanoi, Itamaraty also will demonstrate interest in intensifying diplomatic relations with Vietnam by choosing a building for a Brazilian embassy. The Brazilian Embassy in Singapore is currently responsible for Brazilian interests in Vietnam.
