At the seminar, Sam Rangsi, Cambodian economy and finance minister, said the Cambodian national budget faces constraints and financial reserves are dwindling. The Cambodian Government has attempted to undertake economic restructuring in order to become self-reliant. Two measures have been planned to achieve this: Economic policy must be continuous, laws must be transparent, and foreign investors must be screened; and also the Cambodian Government will soon devalue the riel to make the currency stronger. According to the Cambodian finance minister, six months have passed since the formation of the new Cambodian Government, but the economy has not yet reached a stage that will attract investors. The government does not have enough money to pay the salaries of officials. This could lead to demonstrations. For this reason, the Cambodian Government has accelerated the targeted collection of taxes to stabilize the country's economic position.
