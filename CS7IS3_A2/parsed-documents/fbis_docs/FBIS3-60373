Regarding the other issues discussed on Friday by the Council, the Presidency noted the following results: 1. Dumping of waste. The Council has reported on the advancement of work relating to this issue which has progressed to such an extent under the Belgian Presidency that it could be closed, under Greek Presidency, during the first half of 1994. It also noted a first overview of results of the cost/profit analysis of this directive as far as certain Member States are concerned. The full Commission report is expected early 1994. 2. Elimination of PCB [polychlorinated biphenyls]/PCT [polychlorinated triphenyls]. "Good progress" was noted in the evolution of technical work on this directive. The Twelve reportedly came close to consensus on the coefficients and technical norms as well as on the calendar for controlled harmonisation. The Commission felt that technical work should focus on elimination on the run up to 2010 and on the limit of concentration. 3. Green Paper on civil liability for environmental damage. At a public session, the Council held a full round table discussion on this document which has already been discussed by public and professional circles. In his introductory speech to the debate, Commissioner Paleokrassas pointed out that only two Member States so far have formally submitted their comments on the Green Paper and that the European Parliament has been associated in a "very fruitful" public hearing. He felt that it was too early, at this stage, to imagine that the state of the environment did not justify measures in this area. Ministers replied by indicating major directions for reflection. They raised questions on several major themes such as: prevention, framework measures that could be justified at Community level, insurance. By way of conclusion, the Commissioner stressed that the subject is a tricky one and requires very serious examination before any decision is taken. He said he felt that the White Paper and/or formal proposals could be presented before next year. Between now and then, a certain number of points should be specified: (a) the scope, that is, the categories of damage to be considered; (b) the sharing of responsibilities between the Union, Member States and other levels of responsibility; in this connection, Mr Paleokrassas felt that "even if we depend upon national legislations, we must ensure that we are within a coherent Community framework that does not cause competition distortion between Member States;" (c) the main aim of the legislation should be prevention. 4. Implementation of Community legislation. In comments on the report recently presented by the Commission, Mr Paleokrassas stressed the "unsatisfactory state" of the situation: many directives have not been transposed into national legislation by Member States or have been transposed incorrectly (directive relating to the assessment of environmental impact). In addition, "the practical application of Community environmental legislation to individual cases often seems inadequate, if one measures the growing number of violations and complaints (about one thousand each year)," he pointed out. The Council has held an in-depth discussion on the means to be implemented to reverse this trend. On this subject, Mr Paleokrassas welcomed the initiative aimed at establishing, within the framework of the Vth Programme, a network of Community authorities to ensure that environmental legislation is applied. In his view, this represents a "major contribution to the development of common approaches from the technical and procedural aspects of implementation and execution." The setting up of the Environment Agency should, for its part, allow the EC to have the means necessary to improve the situation. 5. Follow-up of results of Unced [United Nations Conference on Environment and Development] in Rio. The Commissioner announced the preparation of the Community report to be submitted to the second session of the UN Committee on Sustainable Development in May 1994 and regretted that the Community was not formally participating and that the specific terms of the fund for LDCs [less developed countries] had not yet been implemented. Several Ministers were concerned about the lack of visibility of Community action and the risk that the commitments made in Rio had not been executed. Finally, the Council appealed to national and European decisionmakers so that part of the loan foreseen for the large European networks suggested by Mr Delors be allocated to environmental initiatives such as the clean-up of polluted soil, the restoration of natural parks, prevention of damage caused by bad weather.
