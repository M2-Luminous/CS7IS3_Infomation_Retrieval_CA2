He was received by Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs; 'Ali Abu-Luhum, the Yemeni ambassador in Amman; the UN representative in Jordan; and the Saudi charge d'affaires in Amman. Lakhdar Brahimi spoke to our political affairs correspondent: [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Are you carrying specific ideas from the UN secretary general to the officials of both sides [of Yemen]? [Brahimi] The ideas are very simple. War and internecine fighting will not solve the problem, dialogue is the preferable means, and the international community is ready to help if possible. However, these brothers can solve their problem among themselves. [Correspondent] What do you expect the alternatives will be? [Brahimi] It is premature to discuss options. At present, the urgent objective is to have a serious cease-fire, to respect the cease-fire, and to resume the dialogue. The brothers in Sanaa say that they accept the principle of dialogue, even though they say that this dialogue should be based on principles. They have their own principles. We told them that is alright, and undoubtedly the brothers in the other party have their own ideas and principles. If the principles are accepted, then we will examine the bases, conditions, and circumstances under which this dialogue will take place. [end recording]
