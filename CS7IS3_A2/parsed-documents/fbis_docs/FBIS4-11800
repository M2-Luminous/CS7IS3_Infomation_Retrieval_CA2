The form is been currently distributed in Judaea and Samaria settlements. The Magen Avraham operation, which aims to prevent the evacuation of Hebron Jews, is organized by the right-wing bloc's operational command. The command is headed by several settlement activists, as well as right-wing activists living inside the Green Line. In the past, the command played a central role in organizing mass right-wing rallies against the government. The sign-up form, which was distributed among the attendants of the mass rally in Qiryat Arba' yesterday, asks the potential volunteers to state their IDF [Israel Defense Forces] assignment, navigation skills, whether they are paramedics or doctors, whether they have a driving license, and whether they own a car, a cellular phone, a video camera. The potential volunteer is asked how many kilometers he is willing and able to walk, if required, and how many days he is prepared to devote to the struggle. The spheres in which activists can volunteer are the distribution of leaflets on road junctions and in mailboxes, fund raising, poster pasting, graphics, marketing, writing and editing, photography, lecturing, and other areas.
