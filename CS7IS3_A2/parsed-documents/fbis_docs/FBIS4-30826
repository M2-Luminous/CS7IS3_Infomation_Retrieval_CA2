As announced in Moscow, Churkin is to meet with members of the Croatian leadership in Zagreb on Monday to discuss the implementation of a Russia-brokered agreement on a cessation of hostilities between Croatia and the Republic of Serb Krajina. They are also expected to discuss the situation in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina and other issues regarding the settling of the conflict in former Yugoslavia. On Tuesday, Churkin is expected to leave for Belgrade, where he will meet with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to discuss the finding of a settlement for the Bosnian conflict. Churkin is in Zagreb and Belgrade on the eve of a meeting scheduled for June 2-3 by U.N. special envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi. The Russian envoy wants to check once again Belgrade's and Zagreb's stands on the Bosnian crisis. Over the past few days Churkin has on several occasions criticized the Bosnian Moslems for their attacks on Serb positions in Bosnia. A ranking official at the Russian Foreign Ministry told the Russian Interfax agency on Monday that special importance was being attached to Churkin's current mission because it comes after the failure of the meeting between the international "contact group" for Bosnia-Herzegovina and the representatives of Bosnia's three warring sides. The official said the declaration released at the Geneva meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Union, the United States and Russia on the territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina according to which the Bosnian Serbs should get 49 per cent and the Croat-Moslem federation 51 per cent of the territory of that former Yugoslav republic -- was still effective. Russian sources claim that such a proportion will most probably be accepted both by the Croat and the Moslem side, but the main problem will be the "quality" of the territories. The Serbs, who are now holding 70 per cent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, are willing to give up a certain percentage provided that they do not lose anything of "quality".
