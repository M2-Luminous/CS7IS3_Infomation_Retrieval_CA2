In the 1960's, at the height of the Cold War, the United States and the USSR acknowledged that for the sake of international security and their own security it was essential to limit the number of members in the "nuclear club." Today political rapprochement and the establishment of alliance relations between the United States and Russia offer broader opportunities for joint or parallel actions. However, it is clear that their bilateral efforts are as yet inadequate to the degree of threat to international security posed by nuclear proliferation. The three "underground" nuclear states -- Israel, India and Pakistan -- are outside the bounds of the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty. According to experts' estimates they already possess a certain number of completed nuclear devices. The Republic of South Africa, which joined the treaty in 1990, has stated that it produced six nuclear warheads in the 1970's and 1980's. Of the CIS member states with nuclear weapons deployed in their territory, Belarus and Kazakhstan have signed the treaty. Ukraine remains a non-member. Argentina and Brazil, which have a highly-developed nuclear industry, are also not members. Nor is the picture any more encouraging among the treaty's signatories. In March of last year North Korea officially announced its intention to withdraw from the treaty and thereby free itself from its political obligations not to build nuclear weapons.[.sup]1[/] Even though Pyongyang has not yet made good on its threat, this could set a dangerous precedent. As demonstrated by Iraq's large-scale nuclear weapons efforts as revealed during the Gulf War, it cannot be assumed that some states might not use their participation in the treaty as camouflage for the accumulation of fissionable materials and nuclear technology for military purposes. Experts list Iran, Syria, Algeria, Libya, Taiwan and South Korea among such countries. Programs for the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes can significantly simplify and accelerate the road to acquiring nuclear weapons. Despite the international system to control the trading and exchange of nuclear materials and technologies, "black" and "grey" markets continue to operate, and there technologies and materials with direct or dual applications can still be acquired. The collapse of the USSR created a further risk of trade in contraband and a "brain drain" to states striving to acquire nuclear weapons. According to experts' projections, if the most decisive measures are not taken there could be more than 10 members in the "nuclear club" by the start of the 21st century, and the expansion will take place among the developing states. That prospect, coupled with an alarming situation regarding proliferation of other weapons of mass destruction -- chemical and biological weapons and missiles -- requires the United States and Russia, as the two principal founders of the non-proliferation system, to fundamentally reevaluate their traditional approaches to prevention of nuclear weapons transfers from one country to another, in order to achieve greater effectiveness in ensuring international and their own national security. Beginning in the 1960's the policy of the United States and the USSR in non-proliferation field was based on a discriminatory principle: we (the nuclear powers) may have nuclear weapons, while you (the non-nuclear powers) may not. At the height of the Cold War, when the accumulation and improvement of nuclear arsenals was the main concern of the two opposing superpowers, one could hardly have expected any other approach. The current system for monitoring of non-nuclear states' activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established, a system accepted by them largely as a result of pressure from the United States and the USSR. But even in those years, aware of the vulnerability of their position, Washington and Moscow stressed that the system was only intended to "buy time" -- restraining nuclear proliferation until such time as they could reach agreement among themselves on a way to stop the nuclear arms race. This was also reflected in the text of the treaty, in which non-nuclear states pledged not to build nuclear weapons (Article II) and nuclear states pledged to undertake disarmament (Article VI). However, during the period of nuclear confrontation the latter frequently ignored their pledges. Despite the fact that all the fundamental agreements between the United States and the USSR -- SALT I and SALT II -- acknowledged the need to comply with obligations under Article VI, they nevertheless actually led to further expansion and improvement of nuclear weapons arsenals. The nuclear arms race and the doctrine of nuclear weapons use created a nuclear weapons cult, and the discriminatory double standard applied in regard to non-proliferation spurred on efforts by Israel, India, Pakistan and other countries to acquire them. The legacy of the Cold War is that even today nuclear weapons remain a symbol of military and political greatness and, consequently, a cherished dream of countries counting on playing a leading role in their region or in the international arena. Would the appearance of nuclear arsenals of perhaps only a few dozen warheads in a number of developing states really be such a threat to American and Russian security interests, considering that Washington and Moscow possess thousands of nuclear weapons each? Just one or two nuclear strikes within U.S. or Russian territory would be considered unacceptable damage to their security. Such a threat would increase significantly in the event of the further spread of nuclear missile technology. In that event strategic stability could be superseded by chaos, in which the threat of regional nuclear conflicts, involvement of the current nuclear powers therein, and anonymous nuclear missile attacks would increase many times over. Already in the 1990's the focus of the nuclear threat has shifted from the developed countries to the developing world. In 1990 threats to use nuclear and chemical weapons were issued alternately by both Israel and Iraq, and during the Gulf War by the United States and Iraq. If Baghdad had succeeded in building a nuclear weapon before the start of the war, it apparently would have used it, just as it used its ballistic missiles. That same year the risk of nuclear conflict arose between India and Pakistan as a result of the dispute over Kashmir. In 1993 the threat of a similar conflict between North and South Korea was considered serious. A majority of experts reject the possibility that nuclear weapons will be used by the current nuclear powers against each other.[.sup]2[/] We are witnessing an unprecedented devaluation of the military significance of various types of nuclear weapons, and interest in Russian-American agreements to control them is waning. The era of nuclear competition between the superpowers is over, but it could be followed by an era in which weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, will proliferate. In order to keep that from happening the United States and Russia are demanding preemptive, coordinated joint efforts without parallel in the past. Furthermore, new principles are to form the basis of non-proliferation policy. Firstly, the United States and Russia should acknowledge jointly that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the principal threat to their national security and international security. It is precisely from that standpoint that their political and military relations should be restructured, and the sooner, the better. The spectrum of interaction should include global monitoring of nuclear activities by "underground" nuclear and "threshold" nuclear states -- exchange of intelligence information between the CIA and the Foreign Intelligence Service, development of preventive measures against the possible use of nuclear weapons, and joint research in the field of anti-missile defense. Secondly, it has become clear that it will not be possible for very long to try to combine the uncombinable -- retaining the "nuclear club" while not admitting anyone else to it. In order to prevent expansion of the "nuclear club" it will be necessary, along with its other members, to begin the process of disbanding it, taking far-reaching steps in that direction such as complete bans on nuclear testing, the production of fissionable materials for military purposes and use of nuclear weapons. Only in that event can one hope that a non-proliferation system based on an appropriate treaty be effective and universal. Thirdly, the United States and Russia should rely primarily on political methods of preventing nuclear proliferation, avoiding the use of force and not attempting to use existing problems as an excuse to justify preparations for a new cold war, this time between North and South. The role of nuclear police is not only intolerable from a moral standpoint, it will also inevitably have the directly contrary effect on international and national security. That role could in various non-nuclear states prompt a powerful desire to put an end to the "military and political hegemony" of the current nuclear powers through the accumulation of nuclear weapons by associations of various states, for example the Islamic states. In view of the rapid proliferation of missile equipment and technology in the developing world, the territory of the United States and Russia will sooner or later lie within the range of new nuclear countries' missiles forces. It would be necessary to pay an unacceptable price for taking part in the establishment of nuclear order in the world, i.e. an increased threat to national security. It is not likely that high-tech anti-missile defense systems will provide a 100-percent guarantee of the nuclear states' invulnerability against strikes by potential members of the "nuclear club." The most promising route for the United States and Russia to take is not strategic preparations for expansion of the "nuclear club," but instead prevention of nuclear proliferation. Will the United States and Russia be able to quickly restructure their military and political relations in such a way as to fully subordinate them to the problems of confronting a new challenge? The two countries' success in the non-proliferation field will to a significant degree depend on the answer to that question. As the creators of a non-proliferation system, they will be responsible for breathing new life into the treaty, ensuring that it continues to function into the 21st century and attempting to bring in those states that are not currently signatories to it. The United States and Russia must state unambiguously that they condemn the aspirations of any state to acquire nuclear weapons, regardless of the nature of their relations with them, and they must classify the use of such weapons as a crime against humanity. It appears important that the U.N. Security Council draft a special declaration on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. It should express two key non-discriminatory principles of new policy in this area. On the one hand, a statement by the five permanent members of the Security Council declaring nuclear weapons proliferation intolerable, and on the other a clear expression of their willingness to disband the "nuclear club" and eliminate nuclear weapons completely. The highest-level Security Council session in January 1992 could be considered a first step; following that session it was stated that the proliferation of weapons of mass destructions posed a threat to peace. It is logical to assume that the next step could be the aforementioned declaration. Support for the treaty by all permanent Security Council members who possess veto power would allow one to assume that the council is capable of playing a more decisive role in affirming non-proliferation as a standard, violation of which would invoke the U.N.'s use of adequate measures as provided for by Chapters VI and VII of the U.N. Charter. That possibility stems from the final document of a Security Council session which states that Security Council members will take appropriate measures in the event of any violations reported to them by the IAEA. In 1993 the U.N. Security Council was unable to take such measures (China was opposed) with regard to North Korea, which had announced that it was withdrawing from the treaty, primarily because the five permanent members had no coordinated position on how to resolve nuclear non-proliferation issues. Drafting a special declaration would not only facilitate greater U.N. effectiveness, but would also ensure support by the world community against any violator of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The United States and Russia should play the leading role in achieving consensus among the nuclear states regarding the need to adopt such a declaration. The United States and Russia could add to the world non-proliferation system additional barriers to preparations by "threshold" states. That role could be played primarily by complete bans on nuclear testing and the production of fissionable materials for military purposes. Sooner or later the time will come when there will be a need for the "threshold" states to test their nuclear devices. A complete test ban treaty could essentially be an insurmountable obstacle to a political decision by any "threshold" country to conduct such tests. Thus realization of a program to create reliable nuclear forces could be halted at an early stage. The presidents of the United States and Russia agreed at their meeting in Vancouver that negotiations on a multilateral nuclear test ban should begin in the near future, and that their governments will carry out appropriate consultations among themselves.[.sup]3[/] Any delay in drafting a complete test ban could be fraught with serious consequences: firstly, the risk of a test being carried out by some "underground" or "threshold" state for the purpose of declaring itself a nuclear state and, secondly, complications in the 1995 conference on the further fate of the treaty and its expiration date. The problem of fissionable materials for military purposes is analogous. So long as they continue to be produced by the nuclear states, one can hardly expect the candidates for the "nuclear club" not to do the same. Many years of efforts to convince Israel, India, Pakistan and other countries to place their facilities for the production of enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium under IAEA monitoring have proven fruitless. As demonstrated by the examples of Iraq and North Korea, even countries that are signatories to the treaty are secretly stockpiling fissionable materials. It is clear that only if the nuclear powers agree to the measure will it be possible to expect similar steps by the "threshold" countries. Surpluses of already manufactured materials in the United States and Russia and the closure of a number of the facilities in question have made easier realization of the idea of a global halt to the production of fissionable materials for military purposes and appeals to other nuclear and "threshold" states to join in the initiative. A proposal put forward by President Clinton in September 1993 at a session of the U.N. General Assembly was a timely step in that direction. The United States and Russia could also give joint consideration to ways of expanding the IAEA's authority. IAEA inspectors would take part as observers in monitoring of compliance with treaties on the elimination of nuclear weapons. After reprocessing, a portion of the fissionable materials could be transferred to that international organization for use in the implementation of peaceful nuclear programs. This could graphically demonstrate that both sides are willing to beat their swords into plowshares and convert their nuclear production facilities in the spirit of President Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" program. In that event the United States and Russia would be called upon to facilitate a further increase in the effectiveness of IAEA monitoring and respect for it in the international arena. In 1995 a conference of treaty signatories will be held to decide whether the treaty should remain in force indefinitely or only for a specific period of time. The treaty text leaves no other choice: the conference does not have the right to decide to abrogate the agreement. Nevertheless, it is possible that participants might extend the treaty for a short period of time, upon expiration of which it would be considered invalid. It is also possible that some individual participants might exercise their right to withdraw from the treaty as granted to them by Article X. In 1995 an effort might be made to make extension of the treaty contingent upon the nuclear powers' performance of their disarmament obligations (Article VI), specifically by banning nuclear testing. At all four conferences held to verify the workings of the treaty (1975, 1980, 1985 and 1990) the non-nuclear states have regularly criticized the nuclear powers for failing to perform their obligations, and in particular for continuing to conduct tests. The SALT I and SALT II treaties are definitely capable of reducing tension over this issue in 1995, but they will hardly be enough to achieve the main goal: extending the treaty indefinitely. It is of fundamental importance that the text of a complete nuclear test ban treaty be drafted by the time the conference opens in 1995. The same end could also be served by the aforementioned declaration by the nuclear states that are the five permanent Security Council members, regarding their willingness to see nuclear disarmament through to the end. There is no need to set strict time limits on elimination of nuclear weapons; the most important thing is to express an official interest in the complete and guaranteed liberation of the world from nuclear weapons. Another area in which the treaty can be reinforced is expansion of the number of signatories. The next group of new members should come from the independent states that have emerged in place of the former USSR and Yugoslavia. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus and Uzbekistan have already signed the treaty. The United States and Russia could have some influence on other states as well in order to ensure that they sign the treaty by the start of the 1995 conference. In the course of efforts to provide the new states' governments with an incentive, the United States could let it be known that it is willing to help them resolve their economic difficulties if they will sign the treaty. For its part, Russia could on similar terms promise assistance with the development of peaceful atomic industry, in particular nuclear power plant construction. By the time of the 1995 conference it would also be possible to think about ways of rewarding developing countries that have nuclear power development programs for signing the treaty and abiding by the non-proliferation regime. The idea of providing them at a favorable price the enriched uranium obtained through dismantling of nuclear warheads seems attractive. The most significant difficulties face the United States and Russia in their efforts to turn back the clock on nuclear proliferation in South Asia -- the "race" between India and Pakistan -- and in the Near East, i.e. in Israel, and to prevent the building of nuclear weapons by North Korea and eliminate threat that nuclear weapons will be retained by Ukraine and other CIS members. The example of South Africa, which stated in March 1993 that it had dismantled all its previously manufactured nuclear bombs, gives reason to hope that the same path might also be taken by the "underground" nuclear states -- India, Pakistan and Israel. The most important thing today is to restrain those states from any attempts to officially declare themselves nuclear states prior to the start of the 1995 conference. India's position on non-proliferation issues is ambiguous and not fully defined. On the one hand, it was one of the first countries in the world to support the idea of non-proliferation. New Delhi regularly expresses its support for complete bans on nuclear testing and the use of nuclear weapons and for complete elimination of all nuclear potential and creation of a nuclear weapons-free world. On the other hand, India was the first developing country to label the treaty discriminatory, saying it permanently divided the countries of the world into nuclear and non-nuclear, as well as the first developing country, in 1974, to test a nuclear device, throwing down an open challenge to the non-proliferation system. According to experts' estimates it may have approximately 100 nuclear devices. India takes a negative position on the idea of creating a nuclear-free zone in South Asia and toward bilateral agreements with Pakistan to ban nuclear weapons testing and nuclear weapons proliferation in the region. If nuclear weapons proliferation continues, Indian "hawks" might gain the upper hand and the country would set out irreversibly on the path to producing and deploying nuclear weapons. However, after the end of the Cold War it became obvious that the world was moving in a different direction: the United States and Russia concluded far-reaching agreements on reducing their nuclear arsenals; South Africa signed the treaty, and Argentina and Brazil, though not parties to the treaty, announced their renunciation of military nuclear programs. India's relations with nuclear China improved markedly. Therefore the positions of those in India who support a wait-and-see course have been significantly strengthened. The only thing that could tip the scales in favor of open possession of nuclear weapons would be intensification of nuclear preparations by Pakistan. According to experts' estimates, Pakistan probably has approximately 10-15 nuclear devices. However, they believe that Pakistan's military nuclear program was frozen in 1990, when the United States cut off military aid in response to the acceleration of that program and stated that the entire complex of American-Pakistani economic and political relations would be called into question if the program were carried out. U.S. pressure produced results (albeit temporary ones) -- it became possible to exert diplomatic influence on the positions of New Delhi and Islamabad. The role of the United States and Russia in this region is divided: the United States restrains Pakistan, and Russia restrains India. Thus far India has taken a negative stance on convening a five-state conference (India, Pakistan, the PRC, Russia and the United States) on security and nuclear non-proliferation issues in South Asia. However, its approach will change in any event if the United States and Russia officially announce their willingness to completely eliminate nuclear arsenals, if a corresponding U.N. Security Council declaration is adopted and, finally, if multilateral accords banning the testing or use of nuclear weapons are achieved. Even today the United States and Russia could begin discussing with India the latter's idea of creating a nuclear-free world, as well as the role that it would play in restraining nuclear proliferation among developing and non-aligned states. As in the case of India and Pakistan, there is little likelihood that Israel will join the treaty prior to the 1995 conference. Its signing of the treaty could be the final act in a series of events that will lead to the creation of an effectively monitored nuclear-free zone in the Near East. That has long been proclaimed as a goal by the Arab countries, Iran and Israel, and is supported by the United States and Russia. Creation of a zone free of nuclear weapons is a lengthy process requiring the development of a monitoring system encompassing not only nuclear weapons, but also missile, chemical and biological weapons. Furthermore, a nuclear-free zone can be just one means of resolving the political issues that are the basis of military tension in the Near East. However, neither does that mean that we should wait for a general resolution of the Near East situation and only then begin creating such a zone. Since Iraq's nuclear capability was destroyed Israel has essentially had no competitors capable of challenging its nuclear monopoly in the region. According to experts' estimates, it has 150-200 nuclear devices. Yet it is quite obvious that the Arab countries and Iran are not likely to let Tel Aviv retain that monopoly forever. Israel is also very concerned by the fact that some Arab countries are stockpiling chemical weapons and acquiring missile technology as a counterweight to its nuclear potential. All this could prompt Israel to take a more positive and constructive attitude toward plans to create a zone in the Near East free of weapons of mass destruction, plans under which Tel Aviv would attempt to a certain extent to exchange its nuclear potential for chemical, biological and missile disarmament in the Arab countries. Since the end of the Cold War and the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Russia the nuclear threat to Israel has been virtually non-existent. Alliance relations with the United States and de facto guarantees of the foundations of its security deprive continuation of a military nuclear program of all motivation. It was in this situation that the United States and Russia became able to influence Israel to stop the further implementation of that program and freeze its nuclear preparations. A difficult situation exists on the Korean Peninsula. If the Korean People's Democratic Republic were to acquire nuclear weapons this could, according to expert consensus, have the most dramatic effects on the non-proliferation system. In that case South Korea would be forced to reexamine its approach to nuclear weapons and make the decision to build them. One after the other, many countries in Asia, particularly Japan and Taiwan, could be drawn into a nuclear arms race. Therefore the stakes in whether or not North Korea has nuclear weapons are very high, requiring the United States and Russia, as the founders of the non-proliferation system, to take immediate yet well-reasoned measures. The North Korean threat caught everyone off guard. Despite the fact that American and Russian experts have repeatedly warned that such a step was possible[.sup]4[/], the nuclear powers proved unprepared for this turn of events, once again demonstrating the lack of high-priority attention to nuclear non-proliferation issues. As pointed out previously, efforts to take action through the U.N. Security Council have been fruitless, but that may be for the best. In the opposite case, if economic and political sanctions were taken against North Korea, the treaty itself would be compromised, because it provides for voluntary participation and the right to withdraw from the treaty. A treaty is not a prison whose escapees must be forcibly returned to their place of detention and punished. The United States and Russia were forced to resort to the methods of "quiet diplomacy," but thereupon discovered that they had virtually no political leverage, or else that it was very limited. That is especially true of Russia. After abrogating its treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with North Korea, almost completely shutting off shipments of raw materials and weapons and undertaking a political reorientation toward South Korea, Russia lost its main sources of influence on North Korea. As a result, if there were anyone else that could influence North Korea, then that would mainly be its ally China. The United States and Russia have been forced to work through Beijing, but at this point it is difficult to say how successful that influence will be. The temptation is great to resolve the issue by force. But until the world community and the U.N. Security Council give the go-ahead for any such actions, they would be regarded as aggressive acts, and that could harm the non-proliferation system. At the present stage, U.S. and Russian interaction should have the goal of preventing North Korea from officially declaring itself a nuclear state. The interests of the United States and Russia coincide on their approach to the hotbed of nuclear proliferation that has emerged in place of the former USSR. Both powers understand that if it is not extinguished and if in addition to a nuclear Russia there also emerged other nuclear states -- for example, Ukraine -- that could spur on the spread of nuclear weapons to other regions and undermine the world's policy of restraining the ambitions of "threshold" countries. For Russia that goal is of vital importance, as its security interests require that it be surrounded by nuclear-free states. By 1994 there were political indicators permitting one to hope that by the start of the 21st century only Russia will still be a nuclear power. These were: firstly, the Alma-Ata and Minsk (1991) accords regulating nuclear relations in the CIS; secondly, Russia's assumption of the USSR's seat in the U.N. Security Council; thirdly, pledges by Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan to become nuclear-free states under the Lisbon Protocol (May 1992) to the SALT I Treaty; fourthly, the SALT II Treaty, which provides for elimination of a majority of the missiles deployed in the republics' territory; fifthly, the constitutional obligations of Ukraine and Belarus to become nuclear-free states; and, sixthly, the categorical unacceptability to the industrially developed countries of the world of other republics besides Russia possessing nuclear weapons. The successful completion in mid-1992 of the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons from the other republics to Russia, ratification of the SALT I Treaty by Belarus, Ukraine (though with some caveats) and Kazakhstan, and Belarus' signing of the non-proliferation treaty indicate that the accords can be implemented within the scheduled time frame. However, it would be a serious political mistake to think that the issue is settled. The process of regulating mutual nuclear relations could be interrupted by a possible collapse of the CIS, social upheavals in the republics, assumption of power by extremely nationalistic forces, and increasing economic and political instability in Russia itself. In the event of the worst-case scenario -- social upheavals and civil war -- control over nuclear proliferation and weapons would be lost completely. In this situation, assessment of the approaches taken to this issue by Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan is important. Ukraine's approach to nuclear weapons is taking shape under the influence of two factors: on the one hand, the need to abide by its official obligations to sign the treaty and become a de jure nuclear-free state following the withdrawal of strategic nuclear forces to Russian territory and, on the other, efforts to take advantage of its temporary position as a de facto nuclear state to increase its political prestige in the world arena and strengthen its security relative to a nuclear Russia during a period of heated debate over the Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet. Whereas the former factor makes it possible to put forward various anti-nuclear initiatives regarding, for example, the establishment of joint control with Russia over destruction of nuclear devices withdrawn from Ukrainian territory, transformation of the Black Sea into a nuclear-free zone, Russian suspension of further nuclear testing, etc., the latter factor means a desire to keep nuclear weapons in its territory as long as possible, to achieve greater control over those weapons, to participate directly in subsequent negotiations with the United States regarding their elimination, etc. It should be noted that in the Ukrainian parliament increasing criticism is being levelled at the president (particularly by deputies from Rukh) as political tensions with Russia increase, accusing him of giving up nuclear weapons without receiving any security guarantees in return. Strong pressure on the president is also coming from the rapidly emerging military-industrial complex, which, as in Russia, cannot imagine life without missiles and nuclear weapons. However, one should not completely ignore the extreme scenario, in which rapidly developing nationalist sentiments could prompt a decision to keep nuclear forces. The idea of disarming this nuclear capability and taking a series of measures as a result of which it will become unusable, as put forward by the Clinton administration, seems extremely important. It is equally important for Ukraine to become an official signatory to the non-proliferation treaty as soon as possible, without waiting for the withdrawal of strategic systems from its territory. It does not matter who is capable of more successfully solving this problem, whether the United States or Russia. The most important thing is that it be solved. Belarus was the first country to turn its nuclear weapons over to Russia and sign the treaty. This example is worthy of imitation and should be financially rewarded by Russia and the United States. Kazakhstan is located in a fundamentally different geopolitical environment than Ukraine or Belarus. Its proximity to nuclear China and the "threshold" states India and Pakistan has prompted serious concerns over guarantees of its security in the event that its nuclear weapons are withdrawn. Vacillation on the issue of what sort of state it should be -- nuclear or non-nuclear -- has largely been eliminated by Russia's pledge to maintain its nuclear umbrella over Kazakhstan, as well as by strong pressure from the United States and other Western states. It appears that Kazakhstan has been able to reap the maximum dividends from this situation by ensuring its nuclear defense primarily at Russia's expense. In negotiations over elimination of nuclear arsenals Kazakhstan will most likely resist complete withdrawal of nuclear weapons from its territory and insist that Russia continue to bear the burden of the military obligations involved in ensuring its security. Washington's approach to relations with the other former republics of the USSR is based on the existing nuclear non-proliferation system. The United States, the European states and Japan regularly let it be known that those CIS members cannot expect to develop economic relations with them if they do not sign the treaty and do not abide by disarmament agreements. On the horizon looms the threat of a "brain drain" and uncontrolled trade in nuclear materials and technologies with Third World countries wanting to build a nuclear weapon. By assuming the role of "honest broker" in the dispute between Russia and the former republics, Washington has run into new problems. On the one hand, everything possible must be done to put an end to countries' use of nuclear weapons as a "trump card" in negotiations without inciting their political ambitions as de facto nuclear states. On the other hand, it is also essential that Russia be restrained from using force to resolve nuclear non-proliferation issues. The agreement between Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus concerning joint control of strategic systems deployed in those republics' territory was received without any particular anxiety in view of the fact that it meant a reduced likelihood that any one republic might decide to use those weapons on its own; the republics were granted a veto right, not the right to use the systems. The "two-key" system used with American nuclear weapons deployed with the United States' NATO allies in Western Europe functioned quite satisfactorily during the Cold War and there was never any danger that the allies might use a nuclear weapon without American consent. CIS countries' participation in Russian-American talks on reduction of strategic arms systems could be fraught with additional difficulties, but only if they began resisting the complete withdrawal of those systems from their territory. In view of the fact that Ukraine and Belarus have proclaimed their intention of becoming nuclear-free states, that course of behavior would at first glance seem unlikely. It is more likely that the republics would be something of allies for the United States in its negotiations with Russia, whose representatives are increasingly inclined to be guided in their approach by old ideas (parity or equal security, strategic stability, etc.), failing to realize that the republics never shared such concepts and strove to get out from under nuclear tutelage. However, the United States realizes the danger involved in playing off disputes between the republics, and is extremely interested in ensuring that political differences do not disrupt the delicate process of integrating the newly independent states into the world nuclear non-proliferation system. This is due to the need to set aside nuclear non-proliferation issues as a separate, independent area of relations with the CIS members. As indicated by the SALT II Treaty, the optimum alternative is for strategic weapons to be next after withdrawal of tactical weapons from the republics' territory, coupled with the weapons' subsequent destruction within the framework of agreements with Russia. The Clinton administration has shown particular concern over Ukraine's position, which is to delay the process of joining the non-proliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state. Kiev's demands for security guarantees and financial compensation for getting rid of its nuclear weapons are perceived in Washington as an excuse to retain those weapons. All these things dictate a stricter approach to Ukraine on nuclear issues. The Clinton administration has let it be clearly known that the main condition for economic aid to Kiev is its participation in the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, something else is obvious as well: political pressure by Russia on the issue of nuclear relations with Ukraine could produce diametrically opposed results. In this context Washington's intermediary role is all the more well-defined. The United States, the European countries and Japan will bear most of the responsibility for integrating Ukraine into the worldwide non-proliferation system. For its part, Russia could make the process easier by officially declaring that it does not intend to maintain its nuclear status and that it is willing, together with the other nuclear states, to see disarmament through to the end. Interaction between the United States and Russia as the two leading nuclear powers remains the foundation of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. Its effectiveness will largely depend on how quickly and radically the United States and Russia restructure their military and political relations and assign absolute foreign policy priority to the task of preventing the further proliferation of nuclear weapons. The United States and Russia are the ones to begin the process of creating a system of international security under which possession of nuclear weapons by any state would be considered illegal under international law and would be regarded as a threat to peace. Only such actions as that can provide a fitting response to the challenge presented by nuclear proliferation to the national security interests of the United States and Russia following the end of the Cold War.

China carried out its latest nuclear test in October 1993, thus calling into question the continuation of an almost two-year moratorium by the United States, Russia, England and France. Despite this action and pressure from the American and Russian military-industrial complexes, the United States and Russia are being urged to achieve a complete nuclear test ban treaty. 4.
