As part of the project, the banks will close more than 100 branches and smaller outlets throughout the country during fiscal 1994, the leading business daily said. The job reduction will be implemented mainly through a curb on employment of new graduates and transfer of employees to affiliates, it said. Some of the 11 banks are considering paying extra retirement allowances to induce employees to quit, according to the newspaper. The rationalization of bank operations has been prompted in large part by swollen bad assets due to the collapse of the bubble economy, it said. The 11 major commercial banks are forecast to liquidate more than 2 trillion yen worth of such assets in the current fiscal year, ending next March 31.
