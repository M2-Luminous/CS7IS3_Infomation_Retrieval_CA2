He believes that the Ukrainian parliament's resolution on the ratification of the START-I treaty, passed on February 4, 1994, has many "ambiguous places." It does not say, for instance, what percentage of nuclear weapons is to be eliminated. Dubinin said that on November 18, 1993, the Ukrainian parliament passed the resolution on the ratification of the START-I treaty, according to which only 36% of the Ukrainian missiles and 42% of the warheads were to be eliminated. "This goes against both the START-I treaty and the Lisbon agreements. It's still unclear whether Ukraine intends to eliminate 100% of the nuclear weapons located on its territory in strict accordance with the START-I treaty and the Lisbon protocol," he said. According to Dubinin, neither is it clear whether Ukraine will join the nonproliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state. Speaking about Ukraine's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, he said that Russia is approaching this issue calmly. "Russia has already supported the partnership concept. Why should Ukraine not join it?" he said. ...AND UKRAINE WILL SOON JOIN NONPROLIFERATION TREATY, AMBASSADOR SAYS Ukraine will be a non-nuclear state and will "shortly" join the Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968, the Ukrainian ambassador to Russia said. Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy told a news conference in Moscow on Monday that the Ukrainian parliament had now approved all the points of Article Five of the Lisbon Protocol. "This eliminates the main problem, and now everything is ready for joining the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the immediate future," he said. All nuclear arms will be removed from Ukraine, he said. Kryzhanovskiy said the Ukrainian legislature had charged the government with the exchanging of the START-I ratification instruments and instructed it to take more efforts to enter into relevant international agreements. The ambassador did not rule out that Ukraine's membership in the Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state would be approved by the present parliament, but said this was most likely to be done by the next legislature, to be elected on March 27. Commenting on Ukraine's relations with Russia, Kryzhanovskiy said there was some friction but that it had set off no conflicts between the two nations. As for the idea of the incorporation of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea into Russia through a Crimean referendum, he said it would be the same as the incorporation of Russia's Kuril Islands into Japan on the basis of the results of a referendum by the Kurile population. "That's not serious," he said. He said none of the former Soviet republics, including Russia, "has given a kopeck" to return Crimean Tatars to Crimea.
