FR940523-2-00061 FR940523-2-00040 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Francina C. Spencer (410) 966&hyph;4614. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background A. Program Description Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act) generally prohibits payment for any expenses incurred for items or services ``which, * * * are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.'' We have interpreted this statutory provision to exclude from Medicare coverage medical and health care services and items that are not demonstrated to be safe and effective by acceptable clinical evidence. This prohibition applies to items for which claims are submitted under Medicare's durable medical equipment (DME) benefit. B. Medicare Coverage of Electrostimulation of Salivary Glands for the Treatment of Xerostomia (Dry Mouth) Secondary to Sjogren's Syndrome Patients with chronic xerostomia complain of a continual feeling of oral dryness, have difficulty eating dry foods, and are susceptible to increased tooth decay, oral pain, tongue fissures, and infection. Saliva contains proteins and enzymes that aid digestion, conduct electrolytes necessary to maintain hard tooth enamel, and produce antibacterial agents to control oral bacteria. Salivary gland dysfunction leads to difficulty in speaking, chewing, swallowing, and tasting. A decrease in salivary secretion may result from damage to the salivary glands caused by chronic infection, irradiation, or systemic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, or Sjogren's syndrome. Sjogren's syndrome is a chronic, inflammatory, and autoimmune disease in which the salivary and tear glands undergo progressive destruction by lymphocytes and plasma cells resulting in decreased production of saliva and tears. Treatment for xerostomia varies considerably. If Vitamin C tablets, gum, and hard candy do not stimulate salivation in patients with some salivary gland function, artificial saliva using either an atomizer or an intraoral reservoir are used. While these methods relieve the symptoms of chronic xerostomia, they usually offer only temporary relief. Oral drugs such as pilocarpine and pyridostigmine are effective in increasing salivation if there are some functioning salivary gland tissues. However, because of side effects and contraindications, the usefulness of these drugs is limited. On March 27, 1987, Biosonics, Inc. requested marketing approval by the FDA of the Salitron System. This device is a battery-powered, hand-held electrostimulation device for stimulating salivation from existing glandular tissue by delivering a small electrical stimulus to the mouth using a probe with two metal electrodes. It is used for patients with xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome with residual salivary tissue in the oral and pharyngeal regions. Physicians use the device to screen patients to determine a response to electrostimulation before prescribing the system. After reviewing the recommendation of the Dental Devices Panel, FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the FDA granted premarket approval for the Salitron System on May 18, 1988. The approval was announced in the July 14, 1988, notice entitled ``Biosonics; Premarket Approval of the Salitron System'' (53 FR 26673). At this time, the Salitron System is the only device approved for marketing by the FDA for electrostimulation of salivary glands. Currently, Medicare does not have a national policy for covering electrostimulation of salivary production for treating xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. Without a national policy, Medicare carriers have authority under section 1842(a) of the Act to make coverage decisions within the parameters set by the statute, regulations, and program instructions. Some carriers are paying for electrostimulation of the salivary glands using the Salitron System and others are not because they question the medical efficacy of the treatment. This has resulted in inconsistent coverage policies among carriers. C. Recommendation Not to Cover Electrostimulation of Salivary Production in the Treatment of Xerostomia Secondary to Sjogren's Syndrome On May 26, 1988, Biosonics requested that Medicare issue a national policy decision that would provide for coverage of the Salitron System. Based on our evaluation of their request, we consulted the HCFA Physicians Panel. The Panel recommended that OHTA evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Salitron System as well as the criteria used to identify xerostomia patients who would benefit from the device. On October 4, 1988, we asked OHTA to conduct a full assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the Salitron System and to develop patient selection criteria. To conduct this assessment, OHTA solicited information from clinicians, appropriate private organizations, researchers, other government agencies, other components of PHS, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). OHTA evaluated studies, data provided to the FDA, published articles, and information from respondents to the March 2, 1989, notice entitled ``National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment; Assessment of Medical Technology'' (54 FR 8829). In that notice, OHTA announced that it was assessing the patient criteria for electrostimulation of salivary glands for the treatment of xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome and an electrostimulation device's acceptability, cost, and effectiveness relative to other therapies. On July 30, 1990, we received OHTA's assessment ``Salivary Electrostimulation in Sjogren's Syndrome'' with a bibliography of literature and investigations evaluating electrostimulation of salivary glands. (A copy of this assessment is included as an addendum to this proposed notice.) According to OHTA, from the limited studies as well as data provided to the FDA, it appears that electrostimulation of salivary glands may be useful in managing xerostomia in certain patients. OHTA, however, states that there are insufficient data to determine the clinical utility of electrostimulation, to evaluate its long-term clinical effectiveness, and to identify xerostomia patients who would benefit from this procedure. Also, OHTA has determined that electrostimulation is not widely accepted as an effective method for treating xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome and that other treatments, such as the use of Vitamin C tablets, gum, hard candy, and artificial saliva, are available.
