By the end of last year the economically-developed province had approved the establishment of 230 enterprises funded by Singapore business people. The first such enterprise was set up in 1985. A provincial official in charge of foreign investment said that Singapore-funded projects are on a large scale, with the contracted investment averaging 2.6 million U.S. dollars. Of the projects concluded last year, the official noted, 123 were Sino-Singapore joint ventures and 27 were solely funded by the Singapore side. These projects are distributed in 16 prefectures and cities, with the coastal cities of Qingdao, Yantai and Weihai being the main locations. They are involved in the fields of food processing, textiles, building materials, electronics, real estate, tourism and information consultancy. Last year saw Shandong's foreign trade with Singapore total 220 million U.S. dollars, accounting for three percent of the province's total.
