After over two years of negotiations, the Israeli Government did not budge from its obstinate stands. Rather, it persisted in intransigence. Had the Washington negotiations led to any tangible and practical results, or had they heralded such an outcome in the foreseeable future, then we could have said that the Arab parties' move of cutting short the negotiations was a prize for the Zionist extremists, who did not hesitate to publicly declare their desire to abort this process. But since the negotiations became an end in themselves, then cutting them short now or suspending them in the future will not much change the general standoff characterizing the talks. It seems that the Arab parties were in need of such a dreadful shock so that they might wake up from the dream of running after the mirage of the Washington negotiations and from the effects of Israel's unrestrained policy all this time. The Arab parties need to pause a while to catch their breath and reconsider this futile negotiatory course. They should use this time to reunite their stands, coordinate their negotiating policies more effectively, and work to achieve some of the basic requirements for the return to Washington. This is in order to achieve what is hoped from these negotiations, which have consumed a great deal of time and effort and resulted in more inter-Arab doubts and differences.
