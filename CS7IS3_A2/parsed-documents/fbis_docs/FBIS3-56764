The report expresses ideas that are contrary to Russia's previous official position, and which are to be regarded as threats to Latvia's sovereignty. The Baltic states, including Latvia, are named as a region in which Russia's most important interests are concentrated, and from which the greatest danger to Russia's interests comes. Thus it is important that Russia should not leave, and should not withdraw its troops from these regions. The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Latvia is analyzing the new situation. Latvia will also propose discussing this issue at tomorrow's meeting of the three Baltic prime ministers in Jurmala.
