The statement criticizes the United Nations for holding back from forcing the Serbs to abide by the international regulations and accuses the United Nations of playing a part in the crimes committed by the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The statement says: Iran considers the United Nation's inability to carry out its duties as unjustifiable and once again calls on that organization's secretary general to accept the Islamic countries' proposal to dispatch troops to Bosnia and attempt to lift the arms embargo against that country's defenseless people, thus preventing the continuation of Serbian crimes in Bosnia.
