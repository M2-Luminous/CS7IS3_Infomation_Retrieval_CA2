The Cable News Network, CNN, said that the American ambassador to the United Nations presented this in the form of a proposal. The international affairs editor commented saying: At a time when we have been saying that the time has long become overdue for a review and reorganising of the United Nations on a new basis where all nations would have an equal role in it and would serve to extract it from the quagmire it has fallen into as a result of the hegemony of the Western countries over it. These Western countries transformed the United Nations into an instrument to repress other nations. Thus, by changing the United Nations along these lines, as proposed repeatedly by the leader of the revolution, is a matter which concerns all those countries represented in the United Nations given that the Security Council is the council of all the nations. Consequently, any change made to the council is the prerogative of all the nations it represents. Such changes should be put to these nations for discussion and so they can give their opinion. The editor said that the inclusion of Germany and Japan in the Security Council was not decided by the member countries of the United Nations, they didn't discuss it nor did they make any decision and they shouldn't be forced into accepting any decision they weren't involved in making. The editor said that this trend which involves opening the door to permanent membership in the Security Council and granting the right of veto solely to the powerful industrialised nations indicates a move towards crushing the less powerful nations which sufferred greatly from the monopoly the powerful nations have over the right of veto, a sitution they continue to suffer from. Therefore, there has to be a reassessment of the right of veto itself so that decision making will be in the hands of the General Assembly of the United Nations, that is, in the hands of all the members of this organisation. China had rejected any change to be made to the Security Council without being put to the General Assembly of the United Nations so they can give their approval. The editor said that all the talk underway about allowing Japan and Germany to become permanent members of the Security Council, where the spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated, in January, that China sees that a re-structuring of the Security Council and the inclusion of Japan and Germany as permanent members, could never meet with the approval of the less powerful nations and that such a matter should be put to all the member countries of the General Assembly of the United Nations before any new member is allowed to join the Security Council.
