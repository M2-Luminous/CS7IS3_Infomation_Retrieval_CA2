FBIS4-57361 "drlat095_j_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-095 Daily Report 15 May 1994 Panama Explains Meaning of Campaign Slogan Explains Meaning of Campaign Slogan PA1605150294 Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 15 May 94 p 1A PA1605150294 Panama City LA PRENSA Spanish BFN [Article by Jose Quintero De Leon and Nubia Aparicio S.] [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, the new president of the Republic, yesterday explained that his campaign slogan "the people to power" could have been misinterpreted by his followers and the rest of the country. The issue came up as a result of criticism of Perez Balladares' offer to men like Guillermo Chapman and Ricardo Alberto Arias, considered members of the oligarchy, to hold positions in his government. "It is a problem of conceptual definition," Perez said. He added that "the people to power" does not necessarily mean that all the ministers or directors of the autonomous institutions must be very poor people. This means, the president-elect said, that the government's policy must, above all, protect the interests of the people but this must also be done with everyone's participation. "People does not mean only the poor; people means all of Panama and there are not only whites and blacks in Panama; there is a little of every one and that is the way I plan to compose my government, with everyone," Perez Balladares said. According to the president-elect, he cannot please everyone and he is convinced that his commitment is to the Panamanian people. Perez Balladares admitted that he is a realist and that he only received one-third of the votes. Perez Balladares added that the other two-thirds are not his enemies, but they did not vote for him. Perez Balladares views what happened as a people's mandate to attain national consensus and this is precisely what he is trying to do. According to the president-elect, there are two things he cannot do. He cannot disregard the issue of a national consensus because he believes this is what the country needs; nor can he disregard his party, the one with the most votes in the country. These are the two factors he is attempting to bring together. In this regard, Perez Balladares said that his party will have a majority participation in his government, but there must also be participation of the independent forces. He has also invited Panamanians who are members of other parties to participate in his government. More Appointments to the New Cabinet Announced Meanwhile, the Democratic Revolutionary Party's [PRD] press office has announced new appointments of ministers and directors of autonomous institutions that will make up the new Perez Balladares government. Among those on the list of future ministers are: Housing Minister Dr. Francisco Sanchez Cardenas, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Mitchel Doens, and Public Works Minister Luis Blanco. Two women will head the Commerce and Industry and the Government and Justice ministries; however, their names were not disclosed. Dr. Hugo Torrijos Richa has been appointed to head the National Port Authority. Prior to these appointments it was announced that Gabriel Lewis Galindo would be the new foreign minister; Raul Arango, the new minister of the presidency; and Olmedo Miranda Jr., the new finance minister. A PRD source, who requested to remain anonymous said that many within the party are not pleased because "almost all the ministers appointed are of the oligarchy," thus ignoring the slogan "the people to power" that Perez Balladares used during the campaign. The source also said that there is a "rivalry between the Public Force [FP] officials and the former Defense Forces offices. The FP officials have expressed their strongest opposition to the appointment of a single member of the former Defense Forces to the Public Force. These former Defense Forces officers thought that once Perez Balladares won the election they would return to power, the source said. According to the source, as far as the FP officials are concerned, "it is impossible to incorporate those officers into the FP because they are accustomed to repressing civilians and violating human rights. How can they be part of an organization created to defend democracy and the rights of citizens?" The source also said that Balbina Herrera is the PRD member who is the most upset with Perez Balladares' conduct.
