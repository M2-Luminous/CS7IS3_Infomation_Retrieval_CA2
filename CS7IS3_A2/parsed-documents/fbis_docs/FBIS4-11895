The U.S. statement was issued in Addis Ababa on 1 April. The foreign minister said that Sudan, on the basis of its overall national strategy, had striven to establish some kind of normal and warm relations with the United States through dialogue, a system adopted by the revolution. Dr. Abu-Salih said that the Sudanese Government had sent numerous letters concerning dialogue between Sudan and the United States, and had addressed correspondence to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. There were talks in November 1992, and in August 1993. He said that the U.S. Government had, without any preliminaries, placed Sudan on the list of states which fostered terrorism -- without any evidence. His excellency made it clear that Sudan had earlier, four months before the declaration, received notification that it had been placed on the list of states under supervision, but not as a state fostering terrorism. The foreign minister stated that Sudan had welcomed Madeleine Albright's visit to confirm the revolution's intention to attain good relations. He pointed out that the president of the Republic, Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, held a 70-minute meeting with Mrs. Albright, the U.S. envoy. It was a responsible and frank dialogue and a start to serious dialogue. Dr. Abu-Salih added: We do not know the reasons for Albright's statement in Addis Ababa, or why it was not made in Khartoum. His excellency denied what was said in Albright's statement in Addis Ababa. He said that what she said about the issue of peace in Sudan confirmed what was known by the government and people of Sudan: That the war had been imposed on them, as well as the fact that Sudan was striving in all seriousness with the goal of reaching peace to stop everything that fanned the war. He said that Sudan wanted peace. Moreover, Sudan had communicated to the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD] states its adherence to their initiative, and to making it a successful initiative. Dr. Abu-Salih said that the IGADD states should know that there were obstructions to the peace process from certain quarters, which back the rebels with weapons, ammunition, and money, and which want the fragmentation of Sudan and the promotion of war. With regard to Albright's comment that Sudan was obstructing relief operations, Dr. Abu-Salih said that her comment in this regard was strange, pointing out that Sudan had concluded many agreements with many quarters, including the Operation Lifeline, which was considered a model for providing relief supplies. He said that Sudan was satisfied with the commendation it received from the third committee three months ago. That committee had praised Sudan's role in conveying food to the famine victims and the needy. As to Albright's remarks about terrorism, Dr. Abu-Salih said: We ask the U.S. Administration to provide evidence for these accusations and to remove the name of Sudan from the list of countries fostering terrorism. [passage omitted] As to what Albright said about Sudan's violation of human rights, Abu-Salih said: We in Sudan believe in human rights on the basis of the tenets of our religion, and we do not need directions from anyone on good conduct. The U.S. Administration should present its authority on this. He said that Sudan had records of human rights violations in a number of states, including Israel and the United States, and was ready to provide evidence concerning this.
