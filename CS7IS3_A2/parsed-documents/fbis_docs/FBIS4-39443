Shokhin is in charge of preparations for signing the agreement. As the aide said, the problems, that could hinder the signing of the agreement during the EU summit to be held on the Greek Island of Corfu on June 24-26, have virtually been resolved. Only the insignificant differences with Greece concerning privileges for merchant ships remain to be settled. Greece wants such privileges to be spread to its ships going under the flags of other countries, such as Panama and Liberia. As for Russia, it insists that the privileges must be applied only to the ships going under their own nation's flag. According to the source, these differences can be viewed as "technical issues". He said he is firmly confident that the agreement between Russia and the EU will be signed during the upcoming EU summit. Earlier, during a visit to Moscow by France's Foreign Minister, Alan Juppe, and his talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Paris withdrew its reservations concerning Russia's trade in nuclear materials. It's common knowledge that, like Russia, France is a major supplier of fuel for nuclear-power plants in Europe.
