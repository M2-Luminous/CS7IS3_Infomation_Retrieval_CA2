The project is now at the preparatory stage and the construction of the main project will soon be started. To decrease risks, shorten construction period and save costs, the Three Gorges project construction committee of the State Council has authorized the China Chang Jiang Three Gorges Development Corporation to take charge of the examination of the technical design. To fulfill the task, the corporation has set up a technical committee and eight expert groups which will thoroughly examine eight major topics, including the dam, the power plant houses, a permanent floodgate, a ship lift, a deepwater coffer dam, sand and mud at the dam area and generation installation. Foreign institutions and experts will be invited for consultation if necessary, according to Lu Youmei, general manager of the corporation. Discussion of the site and the preliminary design have taken several decades and Chinese experts concluded after lengthy study that China definitely has the ability to solve major technical problems. Soon ten symposiums will be held on technical issues concerning the project and some major technical issues will be deeply discussed. From now on the technical committee will start an overall examination of the general layout, the design principle, major and key indices of every single project.
