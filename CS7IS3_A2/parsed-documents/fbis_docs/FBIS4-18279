More than 200 vehicles were damaged, a dozen fires started as several groups of marchers got out of control, smashing up to sixty shop front windows and looting several shops, police said. The rallies were called to celebrate a climbdown by Balladur over a cut-price youth wage scheme. Police estimated the number of Paris marchers at 26,000. "Despite repeated appeals from the organisers and the security forces for people to disperse, several hundred individuals refused to leave," police said in a statement. In Nantes in western France, up to a thousand youths were continuing to confront police late Thursday after several hours of head-on battles. Earlier, around 20,000 people had marched through the town, organizers said, though the police put the figure at 16,000. One person had been arrested and several shop fronts had been smashed in the clashes, police sources said. Police charged the demonstrators and scattered many of them with tear gas cannisters and water cannon.
