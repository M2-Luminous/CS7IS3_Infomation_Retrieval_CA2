Alain Juppe reaffirmed the strict humanitarian character of the operation proposed by France. He also insisted that France will not and cannot go alone to Rwanda: [Begin Juppe recording] We have said very clearly that our intervention should be given the green light by the United Nations. We are examining the type of resolution that could give a mandate to member states to intervene to save the population, which is the prime concern. Several European countries that we have contacted have told us, some publicly, that they approve of the principle of the operation. I spoke to my Italian, Spanish, and British colleagues, and other contacts have been made in Paris. Several African countries have also expressed their support in principle. We are now examining the concrete modalities of the operation, whose duration should be limited; it should have precise objectives and should be exclusively humanitarian. The aim is to save people who might be wiped out within the next few days. It should be carried out by several countries. To avoid any ambiguity, France does not wish to go in alone. [end recording]
