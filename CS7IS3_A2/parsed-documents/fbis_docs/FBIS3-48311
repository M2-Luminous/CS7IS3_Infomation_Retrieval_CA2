The decision eliminates all economic sanctions against South Africa with the exception of a blanket ban on the export of weapons to all countries. The decision, effective from January 28, will release for export a range of previously restricted products including computers and four-wheel-drive vehicles for use by the South African military and police forces. The government has already lifted bans on flights between Japan and South Africa and on investment in that country. A new South African Constitution, drawn up after two years of negotiations, guarantees a formal end to the legalized system of racial discrimination known as apartheid following the nation's first all-race elections on April 27.
