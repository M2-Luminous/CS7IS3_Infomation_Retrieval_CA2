However, he would also like to see the list of criteria needed for passing into the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) completed and its timetable of application reviewed. Finally he pleads for a peaceful solution to be found in the former Yugoslavia, for an accelerated peace process in the Middle East, and for increased cooperation with South Africa. [Graviere] You are faced with a Europe in crisis. What will be the Greek presidency's priorities for meeting this challenge? [Pangalos] Our priority is obviously the White Paper on Growth, Competition, and Employment adopted in December by the European Council in Brussels. The peoples of Europe are primarily concerned with unemployment. However, it is only if we can convince them that we are doing something about the economy and unemployment that we will persuade them that a united Europe is a good thing. Our aim is that the major projects outlined in this document should start to contribute to the recovery of the European economy from the start of next year. A set of specified projects must be decided on in June at the Corfu meeting of the European Council. We have set in place a working timetable. The so-called Christophersen group which will work on the transport networks has already met once. The so-called Bangeman group on telecommunications is to start work next week. The white paper is on the agenda at all our Council meetings. [Graviere] What are the projects you want to see completed? The TGV-East [high-speed train]? [Pangalos] We will have to examine the costs and the financial resources available. It seems to me that the TGV-East is well placed. However, we will have to make other decisions. [Graviere] What is the second priority, after the white paper? [Pangalos] Expansion. Four candidate countries could become members in 1995. We will push for their fate to be decided at the end of our six-month term of presidency. This would let them attend the Corfu summit, at least as associate members. We have a deadline for the end of negotiations -- 1 March. I have scheduled an extraordinary Council meeting for 21 and 22 February plus a jumbo Council session on 25 to 28 February. Moreover, the question must be asked if we will succeed with all of them, or just some of them. It is a difficult challenge, but it is not impossible. We need the cooperation of the member states (it is important that no country raises new problems as some may be tempted to do). Also, the candidate countries must accept all Community accession negotiations, including the agricultural provisions. The Community cannot have a system where prices differ from one country to the next -- that would be stepping back 10 years. On the contrary, the candidate countries can increase their support for their farmers, for example by taxing those citizens who would benefit considerably from a sharp drop in farm prices caused by the introduction of the CAP [common agricultural policy] in these countries. [Graviere] Are starting the second phase of the EMU and improving convergence of Community economies also challenges that the Greek presidency hopes to meet? [Pangalos] Most countries currently do not conform to the Maastricht criteria. Not only are we not converging at the European level, we are increasingly diverging, as is shown in the worsening German budget deficit. We have to revise, if not these criteria then at least the timetable for passing to the third stage of EMU. This is all the more true since it is almost impossible to reconcile a policy of budget constraint that we would need to reach these criteria with the current economic situation. Therefore we are asking for the introduction of supplementary criteria that cater more to the real economic situation and, in particular, criteria relative to the increase in national income, the rate of investment, and employment. The monetarist approach has shown its limitations, and this is proved by the crisis of the last few years. [Graviere] You also have to manage the crisis in Yugoslavia and the evolution of the peace process in the Middle East. What are you doing? [Pangalos] Where Yugoslavia is concerned, we have a peace plan and we still think it is the only valid one. In Greece, even if we did not want to veto the decision made by NATO last week concerning a possible intervention, we think it is dangerous to exercise military force in this region. In the Middle East, we have promised $600 million. However, before we "sign the check" there must be an agreement, and it must be clear who the authority is who will be controlling the occupied territories. We are also busy in South Africa. We have set up an office with regard to the elections and to prepare our future cooperation with the new government. [Graviere] Finally, what do you want to achieve to call the Greek presidency a success at the June Corfu summit? [Pangalos] If we arrive at a sufficiently precise program outlining measures to implement the proposals of the white paper, if the Community is enlarged even partially, and if a peaceful solution is found to the problems in Yugoslavia, then the Greek term of office will have been a good presidency...and I will be a happy man.
