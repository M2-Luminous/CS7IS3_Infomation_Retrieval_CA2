FR940303-2-00176 FR940303-2-00093 The average test weight of the total light truck fleet increased by 32 pounds over that for MY 1992. The stability of the 20.8 mpg CAFE level between MYs 1992 and 1993 may be attributed to the small increase in shares of compact vans and special purpose vehicles and the small increase in the use of lockup converter clutches and four forward speed automatic transmissions, offsetting the increased popularity of large pickups and heavier trucks. Diesel engine usage declined in light trucks to 0.07 percent in MY 1993 from 0.09 percent in MY 1992. The imported share of the MY 1993 light truck fleet decreased to 14.9 percent, 2.4 percent lower than MY 1992 and the lowest share since light truck fuel economy standards were established.
