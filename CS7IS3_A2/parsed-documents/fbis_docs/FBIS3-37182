This was announced on Sunday in Lvov by the chairman of the local branch of the Ukrainian National Assembly (UNA), Andrey Shkil. The Ukrainian National Assembly is an ultra-nationalist organization formed in 1990. USDO paramilitary units were formed under UNA auspices in early 1992. The same year its members joined military actions in Moldova on the side of the self-proclaimed Republic of Trans-Dniester on the pretext of protecting ethnic Ukrainians in the area. In early 1993 about 100 USDO fighters joined hostilities between Georgians and Abkhazians on the side of Georgians. Addressing the 2nd regional conference convened by the UNA and USDO, Shkil said that the arrests in Kiev had been followed by searches at his organization's headquarters and at the flats of 3 USDO activists. The police confiscated various documents, identity cards of candidates for parliamentary elections, and registration lists. With reference to the arrests Andrey Shkil declared, "This was the first day of reprisals against the UNA. We are beginning to inspire fear, because we have become a powerful force." The UNA/USDO was prepared for such confrontation when it was taking its decision to join the election campaign, he said. "We'll come to power anyway, even if all our members are arrested," he declared. The press center of Ukraine's Security Service told Interfax-Ukraina that the Service is aware of the measures the police took recently toward the UNA/USDO. "But this is a police matter," spokesmen for the Service stressed. USDO's commander in chief, Yuriy Shukhevich, told journalists: "We are ready to fight anywhere -- in the Crimea, in the Donetsk coal mining area, in Moscow, in St.Petersburg -- wherever a war is on." The UNA/USDO conference demanded that its members be freed, and declared that it views their arrest as the beginning of repression on the eve of elections. Shkil also said: "We shall not issue declarations concerning developments in the Crimea. We are men of action: the Crimea will be either Ukrainian, or depopulated." On Sunday the UNA\USDO leadership published data on their membership: there are 510 UNA/USDO members in Lvov Region. Besides, there are 388 USDO "fighters" and 286 candidates for "fighters" in Lvov Region. 865 men are viewed as reservists. 400 more members of the organization are known to live in Ternopol, Povno and Western Ukraine.
