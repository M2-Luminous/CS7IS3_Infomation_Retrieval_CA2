At this price, the ships were equipped with 5,000 tonnes of ammunition (including 1,550 guided missiles) and spare parts for five years. The person who held the negotiations with German authorities was Feisal Tanjung, chief of ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] General Staff at that time and who is now ABRI commander. After negotiations, the price was reduced to 20 million German marks or U.S. $12.7 million. The ships had not been used for three years. Just like a car which is parked in the garage for a long time, the ships first must be serviced before being used. Their seaworthiness must be checked for long-distance voyages and this requires expenditures. Well, we did not know the exact condition of the ships because we had neither seen the ships nor made any payment. We looked at the deal only at the macro level, namely with the purchase of the ships; we need more ports. From [Indonesia's most western point] Sabang to [Indonesia's most eastern point] Merauke, there are 26 ports which the Indonesian Navy says need upgrading, but no funds have ever been allocated. Now the minimum amount we need is U.S. $482,355,422 and this figure includes 5,000 tonnes of ammunition, 1,550 guided missiles, and other ammunition. On the importance of the ships [Habibie] The Indonesian Navy has 82 ships, 42 of which are more than 40 years old and ready to be withdrawn from service. Therefore, I called on then Finance Minister Sumarlin to allocate funds for our navy. Earlier, I thought the ceiling for our allocation was U.S. $3.5 million, but we managed to raise it to U.S. $12.7 million. We can use the ships for about 20 years. As we were able to reduce their price, we were granted one-third of the allocation ceiling. Now with the allocated funds at U.S.$1.1 billion, the amount will also include the construction of facilities for the ships. We then visited Germany and tried to adjust our needs to the available budget. It turned out we had to reduce our budget. Therefore, we decided to pay special attention to the ships and construction of ports. However, as the ships were not used for some time, they had to be examined first before embarking on the long voyage to Indonesia. Navigation equipment using satellite technology also had to be installed. As the climate in Germany is always cold, the ships do not require air conditioning and they instead required heating systems. This is something different from our country where air conditioning systems are badly needed. Indeed there are many things that need improvement, but as a combat unit, the ships have a considerable amount of power capable of keeping the old West German Navy at bay. Reasons for not purchasing new ships [Habibie] The price of each new ship may reach U.S. $200 million and this does not include ammunition. We are not so stupid to increase our budget for nothing. It is noteworthy that a neighboring country also wants to buy those ships even though that country does not need them badly. Besides, if we were late in buying them, the Germans might as well sell them to us at a higher price. On Habibie's conflict with Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad [Habibie] We have confirmed the purchase of the ships and I dared not make the decision to buy them if there was no approval issued by the president, who is the mandate holder of the People's Consultative Assembly. Actually, I knew nothing about the ships and my duty was to complete the deal. At that time, suddenly we had two obstacles, namely we had to obtain approval from the UN Security Council and NATO. The idea was that the purchase should not lead to regional tension, but I managed to convince them that if the ships belong to Indonesia, they will instead benefit the region because they will safeguard the region's stability and national development. The fact that I managed to convince them was unusual because the Dili incident had just broken out at that time. On the condition of the 29 ships [Habibie] They are all fine. If you want to test them, you can do it by computer. Or if you want to have a simulated crash, the cost, of course, will be very high. However, the recent accident [in Bay of Biscay] is good proof that the ships' design is excellent. If it was poorly designed, it would have sunk in less than five minutes. I want to remind you that three LSTs [landing ship tank] have arrived in Indonesia. One of them also had one of its front doors open during bad weather, but it was shut again.
