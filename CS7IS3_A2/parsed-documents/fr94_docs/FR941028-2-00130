FR941028-2-00130 FR941028-2-00092 [Release No. 34&hyph;34876; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;17] Self Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 2 to a Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to Firm Quote Responsibilities October 21, 1994. I. Introduction On June 7, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to increase from 10 to 100 the firm quote contract size minimum applicable to Designated Primary Market Makers (``DPMs'') in classes of interest rate options for which Public Automated Routing System (``PAR'') workstations are available. On June 17, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 3 The proposed rule change, as amended, was published for comment in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994. 4 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The Exchange filed Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change on September 22, 1994. 5 This order approves the proposal, as amended. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 In Amendment No. 1, the CBOE states that the reference to ``public customer orders'' in its proposal is synonymous with, and should be understood to mean, ``non-broker-dealer customer orders.'' In addition, Amendment No. 1 states that the phrase ``public customer'' in Exhibit A to the CBOE's filing should read ``non-broker-dealer customer,'' thereby making the phraseology consistent with the language used in CBOE Rule 8.51. See Letter from Dan W. Schneider, Schiff Hardin & Waite, to Thomas McManus, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated June 16, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34262 (June 27, 1994), 59 FR 33991. 5 In Amendment No. 2, the CBOE revises its proposed Regulatory Circular to clarify that it is the introduction of the PAR workstation in combination with the existing Autoquote System that enables a DPM to revise automatically his market in 100 lot sizes without undue risk. Thus, the revised proposed Regulatory Circular introduces an explicit reference to the CBOE's Autoquote System. See letter from Michael L. Meyer, Schiff Hardin & Waite, to Fancois Mazur, Attorney Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated September 22, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''). In addition, Amendment No. 2 states that currently there are seven PAR workstations installed at the CBOE: one assigned to the DPM at the post where 30-year bond interest rate options are traded; and six assigned to floor brokers at various posts. No additional DPMs currently are scheduled to receive PAR workstations. Id . II. Description of Proposal The CBOE proposes to require DPMs using PAR workstations to provide firm quotes of up to 100 contracts on interest rate options for non-broker-dealer customer orders. This quote size minimum is substantially higher than the 10 contract minimum otherwise applicable to DPMs under CBOE Rule 8.51 and prior Regulatory Circulars. 6 The 100 contract minimum will be operative initially only in 30-year bond interest rate options, since this is the first class for which a PAR workstation will be assigned. The Exchange expects that the 100-contract minimum will be extended gradually to other classes of interest rate options, as the use of PAR workstations expands to these classes. The CBOE will issue a Regulatory Circular describing the details of its proposal. 7 6 The applicability of CBOE Rule 8.51 to DPMs is provided for in Regulatory Circular 93&hyph;31 (May 7, 1993). Prior to the issuance of Regulatory Circular 93&hyph;31, the CBOE required DPMs to assure that each disseminated market quotation in all expiration months for all appointed option classes be honored up to five contracts, both for broker-dealer and non-broker-dealer customer orders. See CBOE Rule 8.80(c)(2). Pursuant to Regulatory Circular 93&hyph;31, DPMs became obligated to ensure that the disseminated market quotation be firm for the two near-term expiration series for up to ten contracts for non-broker-dealer customer orders only. See Regulatory Circular 93&hyph;31, Thus, DPMs became subject to the same, less stringent, obligations of the trading crowds adopted in July 1989 in the floor-wide firm quote rule. See CBOE Rule 8.51(b). 7 See Exhibit A, SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;17; and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 supra notes 3 & 5, respectively. The Exchange believes that this change in DPM quote commitment levels will enhance the depth and liquidity of its markets in interest rate options. Currently, much of the trading in interest rate derivatives is done in markets where quoted or negotiated prices can be obtained in transaction sizes larger than is guaranteed at the CBOE. The Exchange believes that increasing the firm quote size minimum should enable it to compete more effectively for order flow and trading activity in interest rate options. The Exchange also believes that the DPMs affected by the rule change will be able to meet the higher commitment levels without incurring undue financial risk because of the inherent efficiencies of the PAR workstations combined with the efficiencies already existing with respect to the Exchange's Autoquote System. 8 A PAR workstation is a newly-developed, automated, computer-based workstation that provides users with the ability to execute trades, transmit trade reports, and enter other data and commands at the touch of a screen, thereby eliminating the delay inherent in a keyboard-based system. The Exchange's Autoquote System enables DPMs to change their published quotes almost instantaneously in response to changed market conditions, which in combination with the PAR workstations should permit DPMs to manage the risk of quoting 100-contract markets. 9 8 See Amendment No. 2 supra note 5. Essentially, Autoquote is a computer algorithm that allows a market-maker to update his quotes in all option series (based on his quote for near-term in-the-money options) automatically to reflect a price change in the underlying security. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24934 (September 22, 1987), 52 FR 36122. 9 See Amendment No. 2, supra note 5. As indicated above, under this proposed rule change and in accordance with CBOE Rule 8.51, affected DPMs will be obligated to provide firm quotes for up to 100 contracts on non-broker-dealer customer orders only. Under the proposal, the firm quote size minimum will not apply whenever a ``fast market'' is declared, 10 and may be suspended for any class or series on a case by case basis as determined by the CBOE's Market Performance Committee (``MPC''). These exceptions are consistent with the firm quote commitment requirements for other options traded on the Exchange. 11 10 Generally, CBOE Rule 6.6 provides that whenever in the judgment of any two floor officials, because of an influx of orders or other unusual conditions or circumstances, or in the interest of maintaining a fair and orderly market, those floor officials may declare the market in one or more classes of option contracts to be ``fast''. See CBOE Rule 6.6(a). 11 CBOE Rule 8.51(b) states that the firm quote requirements do not apply when a ``fast market'' has been declared in a class of options pursuant to CBOE Rule 6.6. In addition, CBOE Rule 8.51(c) gives the MPC authority to grant exemptions to the firm quote requirements for either a class, or series within a class, if it is determined that the individual situation warrants such action.
