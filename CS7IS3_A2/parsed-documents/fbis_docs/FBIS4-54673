"It is an extraordinary honor for me to welcome the best sons of Croatia on behalf of the HSP's Headquarters and to congratulate you on the third anniversary of your founding and combat activity," said Assembly deputy Ante Prkacin on the occasion of the formal commemoration of the third anniversary of the founding of the Sir Rafael Boban 9th Battalion of the 114th Brigade on Sunday at the Visoka barracks. Later in his speech, Prkacin spoke about the unfavorable external and internal reasons that led to the collapse of the NDH [Independent State of Croatia], emphasizing that at that time the Croatian people was not as cohesive and homogeneous as today in fulfilling the Croatian state, but the leadership at that time was well aware who the enemies of the Croatian people were, creating a strong anti-Serbian front from members of the Croatian and Muslim population, ready to give their own lives for freedom. The members of the 9th Battalion were also congratulated on the third anniversary of the founding of the Sir Rafael Boban battalion by the commander, Major Marko Skejo, Major General Mate Sarlija Daidza, and Mate Gotovac, president of the HSP's Kastelanec branch. Major Marko Skejo emphasized that the members of the Sir Rafael Boban battalion had fought bravely throughout Croatia, and commented that the heroic unit had more dead and wounded than some entire Croatian parishes. "The families of the dead are therefore sacred to us, and our concern for them must never cease," Skejo said, adding that the members of the HOS [Croatian Defense Forces] were precisely the ones who had frightened the Greater-Serbian enemy the most with their courage, and put an end to Yugoslavia and communism. Finally, Skejo emphasized that the motives of the grandfathers and fathers who had once fought for Croatia, and the motives of their sons, were completely identical, namely love for their homeland, and he warned that cheap political games could not be played with respect to members of the HOS, and demanded the same status for all Croatian defenders who rose in defense of our homeland. A review of the Sir Rafael Boban 9th Battalion was also conducted at the Visoka barracks, with the anthem "Lijepa nasa" being sung, and deputy commander Mice Cuk presented a report to the battalion's commander, Major Marko Skejo. Finally, refreshments were arranged, and thanks were expressed to the members of the Sir Rafael Boban battalion.
