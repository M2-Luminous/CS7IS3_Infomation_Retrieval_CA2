FR940713-1-00039 FR940713-1-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Parts 152 and 174 [OPP&hyph;250095; FRL&hyph;4874&hyph;9] Notification to the Secretary of Agriculture of a Proposed Rule on Plant-Pesticides Subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notification to the Secretary of Agriculture. SUMMARY: Notice is given that the Administrator of EPA has forwarded to the Secretary of Agrculture, as required by section 25(a)(2) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), a proposed rule under sections 3 and section 25(a) and (b) of FIFRA. EPA proposes to amend an existing regulation and to create a new regulation to clarify the relationship between plants and plant-pesticides and their regulatory status under FIFRA. EPA also proposes to exempt from FIFRA requirements classes of plant-pesticides that the Agency has determined pose low probability of risk and are not likely to cause unreasonable adverse affects on the environment. Recognizing the unique characteristics of plant-pesticides, the Agency proposes to create a new part in the CFR for regulations unique to plant-pesticides.
