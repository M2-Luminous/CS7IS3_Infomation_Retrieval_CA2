The guidelines, product of a government policy review that started in the previous administration, was signed by President Bill Clinton earlier this week, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake said. "The central conclusion of the study is that properly conceived and well-executed peacekeeping can be a very important and useful tool of American foreign policy," Lake told a press briefing at the White House. Under the guidelines, Lake said, Washington would seek to: -- Ensure that the United States supports "the right operations." The U.S. would only support or take part in missions that advance U.S. interests and the operations should have clear mandate, objectives and with forces and funds available. -- Reduce the cost of peacekeeping. The U.S. now pays for less than one-third of UN peacekeeping operations. Lake urged "other newly-rich countries" to "pay their fair share." -- Improve UN peacekeeping capabilities, enhancing planning, logistics, procurement, command and control, public affairs, intelligence and civilian policing. -- To ensure that there is effective command and control of American forces when they are engaged in peacekeeping operations. "The President will never relinquish command of United States forces," said Lieutenant General Wesley Clark, director for strategic plans and policy of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "That is inviolable" although U.S. troops could be under "operational control" of foreign commanders, Clark told the same press briefing. "The larger the U.S. military role, the more likely that the operations involved entail combat, then the less likely we are to place those forces under foreign operational control," Clark said.
