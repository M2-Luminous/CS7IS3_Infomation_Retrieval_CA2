He said: The only way to salvage and reconstruct Afghanistan is to revive the spirit of selflessness and sacrifice, and to encourage the jehadi groups to unite around the axis of Islam. Addressing the participants in today's session of the third assembly of poetry on Islamic revolution in Afghanistan, the president referred to 14 years of jehad and struggle by the Afghan people against the occupiers, and their eventual victory over one of the world's largest powers. He considered this victory as a glorious historical chapter and a glittering episode in the life of the people of Afghanistan. He said that this was the result of the nation's sacrifices, and the presence of the spirit of cooperation and unity among them. Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed concern over the present situation in Afghanistan where increasingly more damage is being caused as a result of the spread of war and bloodshed in that country. He said: Given the Islamic homogeneity of the Afghan nation, and the presence of the ethos of faith and hard work among them, the present situation in that country has in effect marred the shining record of the Islamic struggles of the nation, and will no doubt leave negative and undesirable traits in the history of that country. The president added: If the foundation for all action is built on the use of force and military might, then the process of bloodshed and destruction will intensify, and discord and hostility among different groups will spread. Afghanistan, however, cannot endure any more damage. Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani then said that the spiritual power and influence of our late imam [Khomeyni], both before and after the Islamic revolution, had acted like a guiding light for the Muslim nation of Iran. The safeguarding of this guiding light, he added, is a role that is being fulfilled by the eminent leader [Khamene'i] at present. He said: The leaders of jehadi groups must consciously obey a single leader chosen from their midst. In this way they will be able to safeguard the achievements of the Islamic revolution of Afghanistan, and find the opportunity to repair the damage and reconstruct their country. [passage omitted]
