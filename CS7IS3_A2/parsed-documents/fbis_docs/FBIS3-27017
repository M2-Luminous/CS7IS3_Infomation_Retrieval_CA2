However, this was tempered by a narrowed surplus margin due to sluggish export prices, Chinese Customs announced yesterday. The processing trade is defined as the importing of raw materials and processing them into higher value-added finished goods before exporting them. The volume accounted for almost half of the country's overall foreign trade of $195.7 billion last year. A large number of Chinese enterprises, mainly in the eastern coastal region, have been engaged in processing imported raw materials for exports during the last few years, taking advantage of local cheap labour. There now seems to be potential, however, for more of the processing trade to extend into the hinterland areas, as coastal regions switch to more capital- and technological-intensive projects. The Customs figures put China's surplus of processing trade at $7.9 billion, down from the 1992 level of $8.1 billion. It was the third consecutive drop in such surplus since 1991, and Customs officials have predicted a further decline despite continued growth of the export volume. The exports in the processing trade picked up ll.7 percent to total $44.2 billion last year, accounting for 48 per cent of the country's overall exports. The imported raw materials were valued at $36.3 billion, up 15.4 percent. The major export items (made of processed raw materials) included machinery and electronics, garments, shoes, textiles, dolls, luggage, plastic products and so on. The exports of machinery and electronics made of foreign raw materials were $16.2 billion, making up 71.5 per cent of China's total exports in that sector. The bulk of the country's overall exports of garments, luggage, shoes, dolls and woven units were made of raw materials which were supplied mainly by Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. And nearly 94 per cent of China's processing trade was still centered in the coastal regions, like Guangdong, Jiangsu and Fujian provinces. In particular, Guangdong Province offered two-thirds of the country's overall exports made of foreign raw materials. More than half of the exports ended up in the United States, Japan and European Union (EU), with a combined value of $24.1 billion. And exports to Hong Kong reached $12.9 billion, 70 percent of which are being re-exported to the U.S., Japan and EU.
