The first slogan is the strategy, and the last two slogans are the tactics. The general spirit is to take economic construction as the central link. The sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy is the foundation for social stability and will also provide a favorable economic and social environment for the smooth advancement of reform. Stability is the precondition for reform and development, and without a stable social environment, nothing can be accomplished. Only by persisting in reform and opening and by developing the economy can China maintain fundamental stability. However, according to sources in Beijing, the strategy and tactics for economic development laid down by the authorities were not completely understood by local leaders at various levels, therefore, they were not properly put into practice. In view of this situation, the CPC authorities held a special enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau in early April to reiterate that leaders at the central, ministerial-provincial, and prefectural-city levels must unify their thinking and should fully understand and earnestly implement the principle of ensuring the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, and the meeting also stressed that in the next few years, the whole party should give top priority to stability and take it as the overwhelming task above everything else. General Secretary Jiang Zemin also spoke at the meeting, and he particularly mentioned the importance of stability. Jiang Zemin said: How to properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability is a key factor concerning whether there is sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. "The central leadership holds that development is the objective, reform is the driving force, and stability is the guarantee. Stability is the precondition for development and reform. Without a stable political and social environment, development and reform are impossible. In this sense, stability is of primary importance, and stability overrides everything [wending yadao yiqie di 4489 1353 1090 0227 0001 0434 4104]. Without stability, nothing can be accomplished. In fact, Western capitalist countries, developing countries, and socialist countries as well, all give top priority to the work of maintaining social stability. During the period of the "two sessions" (referring to the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress and the session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Comrade Xiaoping once again pointed out that we had paid our tuition fees in this regard and should now become clever. Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were still paying their tuition fees." Jiang Zemin added: "The Central Political Bureau unanimously understands the importance of stability overriding everything. Therefore, it explicitly pointed out that all reform policies and development measures which have a major impact on the stability of the situation and social stability, and which may cause major shocks to society, must be suspended immediately. This is an attitude of being faithful to the people's interests, to the state interests, and to the party's cause, and is a realistic attitude. At the same time, this is also a major criterion for judging whether leaders at various levels are keeping in line with the central leadership [yu zhong yang bao chi chi yi zhi 5280 0022 1135 0202 2170 0001 5268]." People in political and economic circles in Beijing also said that since the beginning of this year, the Beijing authorities have been continuously stressing the importance of stability. Now, Jiang Zemin has further set forth the slogan that "stability is the overwhelming priority [wending yadao yiqie 4489 1353 1090 0227 0001 0434]." This indicates that the authorities's deep concern about instability outweighs their considerations of reform and development. This is related to the heavy tasks of reform this year. On the part of the CPC, this year is a key year for implementing the "50 points" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee for turning the planned economy into a market economy structure, and is thus a year in which reforms will be carried out most intensively. Reforms will at least be carried out in three major fields. First, major reform measures will be adopted in the fiscal and taxation, banking, and investment systems for the purpose of establishing and improving the macroeconomic control system; second, a modern enterprise system will be introduced in state-owned enterprises; and third, price reform will be further advanced in order to develop and improve the market structure. All of these reforms must be carried out; otherwise, reform will get nowhere. Although the reforms mentioned above cannot be completed in one year, the main steps must be taken within this year through careful arrangements so that significant breakthroughs can be made in some key points. As reform has to deal with tough issues and has to be carried out in many fields at the same time, it could go beyond the people's endurance. If the situation goes beyond the people's endurance, turmoil could occur. Therefore, the central authorities also explicitly pointed out that two principles must be observed in the process of reform and opening: First, the principle of being generally beneficial; that is, the adoption of any reform measure must bring benefits to most people and must not cause most people to suffer losses. Second, the principle of overall endurance; that is, the overall endurance capacity must be taken into consideration, reform measures that go beyond the people's endurance should not be adopted even if the measures are correct, and the timing of the adoption of such measures should be decided according to current conditions. The sources said that reform will be carried out according to the principles of general benefits and overall endurance, and this means that reform measures will be adopted, but will be adopted very prudently. This is correct. However, if the authorities just stress that "stability is the overwhelming priority," reform and development may be hindered. Without reform, it will not be possible to build up a correct path of development, and without development, it will not possible to maintain stability over a the long term. Therefore, reform, development, and stability are three interdependent things, and the slogan that "stability is the overwhelming priority" may not be appropriate. The sources said that State Council Vice Premier Zhu Rongji also spoke at the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau. He said that in order to ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, an important factor is to consolidate party and government leading bodies at all levels. There are three criteria for judging whether a party and government leading body is a good one: 1) whether it consistently takes economic construction as the central task; 2) whether it is honest and incorrupt and is carrying out down-to-earth work; and 3) whether it keeps in line with the central leadership. People in political and economic circles in Beijing say that as explicit principles and policies for developing the national economy have been laid down, Zhu Rongji grasped the key link by stressing the role of leading bodies at all levels. Zhu set forth three criteria requiring leading bodies to focus attention on the central task without deviation, perform public duties honestly without corruption, and obey the central authorities for the sake of the overall public interest. They said that there are still many problems in China, and the most prominent problem is that some localities are not obeying the central authorities. For example, inflation could not be effectively curbed and was getting more and more serious, and this was related to the fact that the local authorities were still doing: things in their own way without regard to central instructions. Beijing and Guangdong were criticized by the central authorities for raising prices. The sources said that these local leaders were daring to do this even while Deng Xiaoping was still alive; once Deng passed away, there would be a situation of separatist rule by local lords. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct education for party and government leading cadres in this regard and make them understand: In the past 15 years since the beginning of reform, the general trend was the devolution of power, with the central authorities delegating powers to the local authorities; however, at the present stage of building the market economy system, the situation in which "the central government is poor while the local governments are rich" must be changed, because only when the central government has sufficient financial resources can local governments also benefit. However, in today's market economy, it is very hard to make people accept the idea of taking the whole country into account. The best way is to establish a legal system by means of legislation so that the distribution of wealth can be determined by laws. This will be an extremely arduous project of legislation!
