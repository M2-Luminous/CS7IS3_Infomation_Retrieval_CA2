With the increasing human tragedy of the military fall of Gorazde and increased world demands for military intervention against the Serbs, new overtures are being made by foreign countries involved in the Bosnian crisis to give the Serbs a free hand to intensify their aggression. The United Nations has withdrawn its limited forces from the oppressed city of Gorazde on various pretexts. There was never more than 15 UN soldiers protecting this city, which was declared a so-called safe haven by the United Nations, and its 70,000 inhabitants from the Serbs' immense military power. But even these 15 UN soldiers were withdrawn from Gorazde at a time of danger, which is exactly the time when they should have carried out their duties. The United Nations is now pursuing a policy that the presence or absence of forces is ineffective, therefore it is better to leave Bosnia. Thus, the Serbs have received the initial green light from the United Nations for their future crimes. Following this step by the United Nations, which definitely stems from the decision by the Western countries and others involved in the Bosnian problem, Russia has also stated that it will soon end its mediatory role with the Serbs. This stance by Russia has of course been adopted within the framework of condemning the Serbs. However, when Russia ends its mediatory role it will be shunning responsibility for the Serbs' actions and will be giving them a free hand to commit other crimes. In addition, in closing this channel of contact the possibility of inflicting pressure on the Serbs will decrease. Russia is continuing its indirect support for the Serbs and has stated that it opposes any type of blind bombing of Serb positions. This is at a time when the blind bombing and the unrestrained massacre of the Muslims in Gorazde have--according to various news agencies--filled the streets of the city with the corpses of Bosnian martyrs and wounded. In parallel with the new policy of the United Nations and Russia, NATO has also stated that it will not take any military step without the approval of NATO members. Thus, the main foreign powers involved in the Bosnian crisis have washed their hands of world demands for serious action against the Serbs. This clearly means that the Serbs have been given a free hand and the green light for their crimes. Something that further clarifies the new program of the United Nations and the will of the world powers is the brief but horrific news about returning the Serbian heavy artillery centers around the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo to the Serbs. Thus, the United Nations should expect a heavier tragedy than that of Gorazde. This also clarifies the fate of the world of Islam, too. If the world of Islam does not adopt a serious approach on the Gorazde tragedy, the Western countries, the United Nations, and the Serbs are ready to create new tragedies. In the midst of all these bitter and soul-rending incidents, the Muslims should once again realize the fact that in this era of force their only alternative to continue to live is to become more powerful.
