Eyadema, in a statement sent to AFP, said opposition leaders had told him they could not "draft a list of candidates," although they had "committed themselves to do so." He said the officials, whom he met Saturday, were unable to assemble a list "because the rank and file members are at odds with their leaders." The two parties, the Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) and the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), agreed on March 26 to put forward CAR leader Yao Agboyibor as their choice for prime minister. But General Eyadema called for a list of several candidates, a request the two parties have so far been unable to meet. The opposition coalition won 43 seats in February's legislative elections to the 81-member parliament, with CAR capturing 36 and the UTD seven. But the supreme court subsequently invalidated the election of three of its members. As a result, CAR currently controls 34 seats and the UTD six. Eyadema said in his statement he could "only express surprise at the sluggish pace at which the leaders of the majority parties are trying to draft a list of candidates for prime minister." He reiterated his readiness to continue discussions with Agboyibor and UTD head Edem Kodjo. But the parties on Saturday vowed to boycott parliament to protest the court decision invalidating the election of three oppostion deputies. The coalition said the action would last "until the situation is clarified." The supreme court nullified the election of the three deputies for technical reasons in one case and because of "trouble" during election day in the two others. The opposition rejected all three decisions, charging that election day "trouble" had been the work of the pro-Eyadema faction.
