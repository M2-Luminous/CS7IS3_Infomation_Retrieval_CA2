"All this, however, is reminiscent of the corresponding period in the history of the Ukrainian People's Republic. If Ukraine really gives up its nuclear weapons by being promised some mythical compensation, and not just gives them up, but removes its weapons to Russian territory, it will be a step that will be conducive to the liquidation of Ukraine's statehood."
