The chairman of the State Duma hoped that multi-faceted ties will develop between the Republic of Korea and Russia and that contacts between their supreme legislative bodies--the Federal Assembly of Russia and the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea--play a proper part in this. In reply Kim Yong-sam said he was delighted to meet the leaders of a parliament that was elected in free elections for the first time in Russia. He expressed gratitude to the State Duma for its adoption of a legislative act rehabilitating repressed Koreans in Russia and touched on the problems of nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula and Russia's participation in the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation program. The Korean president expressed the hope that his "visit will serve as a stimulus for shifting our bilateral relations onto a qualitatively new and higher level of constructive and mutually complementary partnership."
