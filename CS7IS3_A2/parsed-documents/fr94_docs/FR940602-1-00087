FR940602-1-00087 FR940602-1-00014 The draft strategy has many components and implementing all of its aspects will take time. Today's notice is the first regulatory action that EPA has taken under the draft strategy; it addresses public participation and several improvements to the RCRA permitting program that EPA had envisioned prior to the development of the draft strategy. Specifically, EPA proposes to: (1) Expand opportunities for timely and effective public involvement in the permitting process for all types of units; (2) improve the regulations pertaining to permit modifications, specifically, to clarify combustion modification classifications; and (3) align certain interim status requirements for combustion units with the more stringent permit standards for new units, particularly with regard to trial burns. Although the Draft Waste Minimization and Combustion Strategy focuses on combustion units, many of the requirements EPA is proposing today are more encompassing and apply to all RCRA facilities. Additional efforts are underway to continue to improve EPA's hazardous waste management standards and to implement other components of the Agency's Draft Waste Minimization and Combustion Strategy. Today's proposed rule is only one piece of an integrated and comprehensive set of regulatory, non-regulatory, and guidance materials intended to support the Agency's Draft Waste Minimization and Combustion Strategy. EPA has taken administrative steps to address the section of the draft strategy that discusses the Agency's permit denial and appeals process. In particular, the draft strategy indicates that EPA will evaluate ways to limit the burning of hazardous waste in interim status units during the administrative appeal of a permit denial, prior to a final decision. EPA considered a number of options for implementing this aspect of the draft strategy and selected one that could be effected immediately. The Agency issued a directive under Administrator Browner's signature, on March 16, 1994, to prioritize and expedite the review by the Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) of Federal RCRA permit denials. Under the procedures set forth in the directive, entitled Expedited Administrative Review of Appeals of RCRA Permit Denials Filed by Interim Status Hazardous Waste Combustion Facilities, the Administrator directed the EAB to take final action on any combustion permit denial no later than 90 days from the receipt of a petition for review. EPA believes that these procedures will promote the draft strategy's goal of limiting burning of waste during the potentially lengthy appeals process, during which interim status facilities whose permits were denied were entitled to continue operating under interim status, without infringing upon important rights of appeal. III. Section by Section Analysis A. Expanded Public Participation Requirements for All RCRA Facilities 1. Purpose of Public Involvement in Today's Rule The purpose of this section of the proposed rule is to enhance public involvement in the RCRA permit process by improving and increasing the opportunities for public participation. The permitting agency should carry out these new opportunities concurrently with the existing permitting process. Today's proposed requirements should not delay the process. ``Public participation'' is part of the process leading to a final EPA or State permit decision; it provides an opportunity for the public to express its views to the permitting authority and the applicant, and enables both to give due consideration to the public's concerns. Today's proposal will establish procedures to promote better and more timely information-sharing, not only between the public and the permitting agency, but among the facility applicant, EPA (or the State) and the public. In particular, the rule places new responsibilities on the permit applicant. The Agency believes that the permit applicant, who is responsible for initiating the permit process, is a key participant in the public participation process because it is the permit applicant who must interact and operate within the community. Although this portion of today's proposal applies to all applicants for new RCRA permits, certain aspects of the proposal specifically respond to the Agency's Draft Waste Minimization and Combustion Strategy (see the Background Section of today's preamble for further discussion of the draft strategy). As noted above, one component of the draft strategy specifically calls for greater and earlier public involvement in the hazardous waste permitting process. Accordingly, EPA proposes to amend the hazardous waste regulations to provide for earlier public involvement in the permitting process and, in the case of combustion units, to ensure public involvement at the trial burn plan stage. For example, today's regulations propose specific provisions to: solicit public participation at the beginning of the permit process for all new and interim status facilities; maintain open lines of communication with the public throughout the permit process; and increase public involvement with regard to trial burn plans at combustion facilities. These provisions will provide the public an expanded role in the permitting process by promoting community participation and input at all decision-making levels. These provisions will also help the permitting authority to better address public concerns during the permitting process and foster continued community involvement after facilities are permitted. These procedures are consistent with, and in furtherance of, the congressional mandate, expressed in RCRA section 7004(b)(1), to ``encourage'' and ``assist'' public involvement in implementation of the permit program. 2. Current Public Participation Requirements in the RCRA Permit Process Today's proposed public involvement requirements build upon the current RCRA public participation process. EPA does not intend for the proposed provisions to replace or delete the existing public participation requirements in 40 CFR part 124 and 40 CFR 270.42; these requirements form the foundation for public involvement activities during the RCRA permitting process. Four steps make up the existing RCRA permitting decision process: (1) Receipt and review of the permit application; (2) preparation of draft permit or decision to deny; (3) public comment period; and (4) final permit decision. EPA regulations currently require public involvement activities during two of the four steps. The first step in the decision process begins when the permitting agency receives the permit application from the facility. Under the existing federal rules, no direct public involvement activities occur at this stage; however, the permitting agency begins to assemble a mailing list of appropriate government agencies and individuals, including interested members of the public, as required by ยง124.10(c). The permitting agency uses the list to distribute information about meetings, hearings, and available reports and documents later in the permit process. In addition, the permitting agency may periodically publicize the existence of this list and solicit additions to it.
