The committee deals with cultural, educational, sports, media, minority, and church policy issues. At a press conference following the session, committee Co-Chairmen Gyorgy Janosi (MSZP) and Gabor Fodor (SZDSZ) said the two delegations worked in a very constructive atmosphere. As regards the relationship with churches, the coordinated position of the committee was that the separation of church and state should be implemented in full. The committee discussed the situation of minorities in Hungary and agreed that the existing minority law is a good starting point from which to determine which tasks relating to minorities must be given priority by the government. At the same time, they believe that parliamentary representation for minorities is an issue which remains to be solved. The committee began discussions about media-policy issues, but intends to complete these deliberations only on Friday [17 June]. A decisive issue, according to both parties, is to prepare and work out a media bill as soon as possible. According to Fodor, this implies the earliest possible enactment of a law on genuinely free radio and television. Janosi added that the opposition should be involved in the process, in order to reach consensus. He said all parties have learned from the events of the previous parliamentary cycle, and have appraised the consequences of the lack of legal regulations for the media. Speaking to reporters after the session, both Janosi and Fodor reacted to the announcement by Prime Minister Peter Boross that he would initiate relieving the vice-presidents of Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television of their posts. Janosi said that had Boross taken this step earlier it would have elicited political recognition and would have received support from the media workers. The fact that this step is being taken directly before the change in government confirms the suspicion that "this is an escape route from extensive economic, financial, and labor-rights investigations." According to the MSZP politician, such an investigation must be carried out on the previous activities of the two media vice-presidents. According to Gabor Fodor, with this announcement the prime minister has acknowledged that the two vice-presidents are unsuited for the work they have been doing so far. The SZDSZ politician added it would have been useful if the step had been taken earlier, as it now has little significance. Fodor was also of the opinion that offering to relieve the two vice-presidents is a last action to save the two leaders, in order for them to escape being held responsible for their actions. According to Fodor, it would have been more correct for the two vice-presidents to resign, and for the new government to evaluate whether or not they had done everything possible to create an impartial public service media.
