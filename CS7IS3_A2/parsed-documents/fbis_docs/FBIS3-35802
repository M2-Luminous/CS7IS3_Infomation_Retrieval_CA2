The answer is Janusz Bryczkowski, a businessman and founder of the "Self-Defense" national front. Formerly a "green," later a supporter of the extremist farmers' party, he now works with the Communists in the patriotic association "Grunwald." "I am on very good terms with Zhirinovskiy," Bryczkowski stated. "I shall do everything to make him a friend of Poland. I am sure that he is a future leader [vozhd] of Russia." "Why is this leader of the brownshirts being allowed in here?" the Poles ask anxiously. "After all, other countries which he has not threatened as overtly as Poland have refused him a visa or have promptly booted him out: Germany, Bulgaria, France, Australia...." But a Russian citizen does not ned a visa to enter Poland. "If Zhirinovskiy has the correctly completed documents, there are no formal obstacles to his entry into Poland," Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski noted. Admittedly there is a secret list of people whose presence in Poland is considered undesirable. That list is based on information from the Prosecutor's Office, the Foreign Ministry, Interpol, the police, and the Border Guard Forces. Zhirinovskiy is not on that list. However, even though the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] has given an assurance that he loves Poland and has even promised to return Lvov to the Poles, he may be expelled from the country if he commits a provocative act. For example, were he to make the kind of attacks here that he made in Bulgaria against President Zhelyu Zhelev, then under Polish law he would face the threat of between six months and eight years in jail. No serious Polish politician, from the president to the ministers and deputies, intends sitting at the same table with Zhirinovskiy. Closing the border to him means giving a clear signal to his Russian followers that they are marching to nowhere. Aleksander Hall, leader of the Conservative Party, has said that there should be no fuss created around this figure, that he should not be given free publicity, and that his scandalous comments should not be carried in the press. "More stable countries which are better versed in the subtleties of democracy have treated him as nothing more or less than a scoundrel," the newspaper ZYCIE WARSZAWY says to its readers and colleagues. "Let us not be original, let us ignore him too." Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will arrive in Warsaw on Sunday, 30 January. "All Poland will meet me!" the LDPR leader has stated. Zhirinovskiy will visit the Grunwald battlefield [scene of 1410 battle in which Poles defeated Teutonic knights] and the country estate of his host, Janusz Bryczkowski. "I would be a complete idiot if I did not receive the future president of Russia at my home and drink vodka with him," the latter stated.
