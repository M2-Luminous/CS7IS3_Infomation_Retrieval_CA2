FBIS4-7830 "dreeu067_i_94013" FBIS-EEU-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Battle for Gorazde Continuing Battle for Gorazde Continuing 16 Serbs Killed LD0604214294 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 2000 GMT 6 Apr 94 LD0604214294 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Report by Enes Musovic from the Gorazde Press Center for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio-Television] [Text] Chetniks today continued their bloody offensive against Gorazde unhindered and with their ferocity unabated. They are getting closer and closer to the center of the town. The chetniks are destroying and torching everything in their path along the road which they had previously showered with shells. They are destroying house after house in Vitkovici, Baljci, and Zupnici. A stream of refugees is pouring in the town itself and its residents do not know where to go or what to do. Many people, mostly women, children, and the elderly have remained among the ruins, on the charred remains of their homes under the chetnik boot, which is blind to everything but a desire to kill and conquer. They launched their most ferocious offensive using tanks and other weapons against (?Bilin). From one of their notorious strongholds -- Cajnice Kozara -- they are trying to organize a tank and infantry breakthrough toward Donja Potkozara and Zupcici in order to further tighten the ring around the town center. Members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, under the command of the eastern Bosnian operational zone and units of the Gorazde MUP [Ministry of Interior], are putting up a remarkable resistance to the aggressor. Even those with light injuries -- having received first aid -- are returning of their own free will to help their fellow fighters in order to save the free Gorazde territory. Mature and younger women are willingly joining our army units. Their message is that they will defend this free territory to the last. The latest reports, which we received just before this bulletin from the furthest locations on the front -- Dobrijevici, Cador, and (?Vrazalici) -- say that the situation here has been infernal both in early evening and throughout the day. On several occasions the chetniks launched combined artillery-infantry attacks in an attempt to break through the defense line, but Gorazde's courageous defenders repelled all attacks inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Heavy fighting was today also reported on the front between Kopaci and Ustipraca, where Bosnia-Herzegovina Army fighters repelled the aggressor's attacks in an efficient action. This afternoon, chetniks attempted an infantry breakthrough toward Uhotici Brdo, but were taught a real lesson when our defenders responded with efficiency, putting 16 chetniks out of action and wounding a large number of them. Gorazde citizens were today awaiting General Rose's arrival as a ray of hope and salvation, but the conscience of mankind has once again failed the test and Gorazde is once again dying alone. Rijad Rasic, the president of the region's assembly, and Gorazde Mayor Ismet Briga, today sent an open letter to the U.S. President, NATO, the chairman of the UN Security Council, the UN secretary general, the president of the ICO [Islamic Conference Organization], the EU [European Union], the president of France, the prime minister of Great Britain, and all world media. The letter reads: Dear gentlemen, you who know about the difficult and dramatic situation in Gorazde caused by the several- day-long offensive against the town by the Serb and Montenegrin aggressors, you have allowed a high-ranking UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] officer, General Michael Rose, and the aggressor's side to play with the fate of thousands of people. You denied us the right to self-defense two years ago when you introduced the arms embargo, and your officers -- in open cooperation with the aggressor's side -- are now denying us the right to live. While the (?surroundings) and the valley of Gorazde are in flames, and shells are destroying the town, high-ranking UNPROFOR officer, Gen. Michael Rose, is using cheap tricks to avoid visiting Gorazde, thereby deliberately making it possible for the aggressor to destroy what has not been destroyed yet and to kill who has not been killed. Gen. Michael Rose's failure to come here has not come as a great surprise to the Gorazde residents. We are now certain about something we guessed at before: The international community has taken part in the plot against this nation only because it has its own culture, its own past, and its own religion different from the religion of those who are killing us and those who have the moral and legal obligation -- assumed by international conventions --- to help us. You, who promised a just peace to the protected zone of Gorazde, are now enabling the aggressor to kill innocent civilians every day, to destroy the town, the industrial infrastructure, and the homes of those who have survived the two years of trauma caused by the aggressor's shells. The Gorazde residents have sent appeals to the international community on several occasions, asking it to halt (?repeated) massacres in the valley of the Drina River. Now we can see and feel that it was all in vain. This is why we are addressing you for the last time, warning you that our suffering will lie on your conscience. Dear gentlemen, we will no longer remind you of your resolutions referring to the UN Protected Area of Gorazde. Let the future generations judge your attitude, and everything you had to do but failed to do for this nation. This is stated in an open letter by Gorazde Assembly President Rijad Rasic and Gorazde Mayor Ismet Briga.
