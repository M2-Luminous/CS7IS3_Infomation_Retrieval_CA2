Rocha has thus become the first candidate to be officially nominated by his party to seek President Franco's office. Rocha, who is unknown to the public, will use the eight-minute television time allotted daily to his party to exclusively defend his proposal for a single tax. Rocha's immediate objective is to preserve an alliance with little-known groups that will guarantee him a reasonable share of TV time. Rocha is hoping to get a significant number of votes during the first round so that in the run-off he can exact a commitment for his single tax proposal from one of the two candidates. Drawing on his family fortune built on profits from the Riachuelo chain of stores, Rocha already has visited nearly 100 Brazilian cities on board his private jet. In just the past 45 days, the PL candidate's flying time stood at more than 200 hours and he plans to visit a minimum of 500 cities. At 36, Rocha is serving his second term as a federal deputy and will be the youngest presidential candidate in Brazilian history. In the February PL primaries, he defeated retired Brigadier Ivan Frota, who obtained only 19 percent of the votes.
