The County Council Association will look into the situation in the other Danish counties. The Public Health Administration is preparing a new nationwide AIDS campaign. The County Council Association will now look into whether counties are providing enough information about AIDS. This action is being taken following criticism of inadequate information efforts in Frederiksborg County. After the short-term so-called CEN/LOK [central/local] campaign in the Danish counties ended, the work of informing the public about AIDS was supposed to be continued locally in an effort to change people's attitudes and sexual behavior in the long term. No Overview Mayor Knud Andersen (Liberal) of Bornholm County, chairman of the County Council Association's hospital and health committee, has no overview of whether the long-term AIDS information work is functioning in the counties. ``But I intend to look into how the campaign went and also suggest new measures from the central office if they are needed,'' he said. The Public Health Administration is preparing a new campaign on HIV and AIDS for 1994. After the Copenhagen area and Arhus County, Frederiksborg County is the area of the country that has the most registered patients with full-blown AIDS, currently 62. Lack of Initiatives Despite this the county does not provide people with enough information about the disease, criticized Claus Krygell, who was coordinator of the county's CEN/LOK campaign from 1991 to 1992. ``The short-term goals--to increase people's knowledge about the disease--was achieved to a large extent, but the county has had little to offer since the summer of 1992,'' Krygell said. The chairman of the county's AIDS committee, medical officer Jens Steensberg, admits that information activity has declined somewhat. This is due to changes in the county's administration where AIDS information was not given top priority. ``But if people from outside provide ideas for activities, funds are available for them,'' he said. Tove Tougaard, office manager of the county social and health administration, expects activity to pick up in the fall and winter. The county is planning to distribute information and set up condom dispensers at senior high schools and vocational schools and is also planning activities for World AIDS Day, 1 December. In the first half of 1993 around 8,000 condoms were distributed in connection with information activity. Bjorn Knudsen of the Public Health Administration's AIDS office is of the opinion that the level of county activity differs widely. ``But it is natural to see a drop in activity after a campaign,'' he said.
