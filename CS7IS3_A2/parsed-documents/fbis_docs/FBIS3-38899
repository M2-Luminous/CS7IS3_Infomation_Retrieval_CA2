After a tight electoral campaign between the two candidates, both of whom were clearly pro-European, the success of Social Democrat Ahtisaari -- a diplomat who had been long removed from the national political arena -- seems to stem from his commitment to the fight against unemployment (in a country where over 20 percent of the population is out of a job) as well as the population's discontent with its traditional politicians. To the population's double appeal for more jobs and more innovation in politics, the new president -- who will take office on 1 March -- has this answer: "Europe." According to him, only the European Union will make it possible to create the new economic and political framework that Finland needs. However, it seems that the negotiations currently in progress in Brussels between the Twelve and four candidate members -- including Finland -- will be particularly tense with respect to matters such as agriculture, regional aid, or the contribution of candidate members to the Community's budget. Indeed, the deadline for the completion of the negotiations, which remains scheduled for 1 March, appears problematic despite the two additional sessions announced last week by the Greek presidency. [Graviere] What is the first priority for Finland's new president of the Republic? [Ahtisaari] Employment is undoubtedly our society's main challenge. As president of the Republic, I have a duty to help return Finland as quickly as possible to a state of economic development likely to ensure a strong reduction in unemployment over the next few years. To achieve this, we must, among other things, implement economic support measures, diversify our core industrial production, and become an active member of the European Union. [Graviere] You find yourself in a "French-style" situation where the president and the prime minister do not belong to the same political groups. How will you cooperate with current head of government Esko Aho, especially in economic matters, where your analysis differs from his own? [Ahtisaari] In Finland, the government is clearly responsible for the country's economic policy. However, I said that I consider the president to be responsible for the welfare of the citizens. My role will not be to prescribe -- even less so since the government enjoys the support of a parliament chosen by a broad majority of the Finnish people -- but to influence and to convince. The government can alter the course of its current policy; I shall work toward this goal. [Graviere] You have always stressed your commitment to European membership. Why is this so important for Finland? [Ahtisaari] The main motive is economic. The European economic space, of which we are already a member, does not make it possible to exert significant influence on the European construction process. We need to be present inside the European Union, make our positions heard, prevent decisions which run counter to our interests. Also, another pro-European argument often heard concerns security. I my opinion, this argument is also based on economic grounds, since economic cooperation strengthens security, whereas isolation fosters insecurity. [Graviere] The current negotiations with Brussels are proving particularly difficult. Do you think Helsinki can reach an agreement with the Twelve before the (early March) deadline? [Ahtisaari] The main stumbling block today is unquestionably the farming issue. Everything considered, what we want can be summed up in one sentence: To be granted the same conditions as other member states are currently enjoying, in particular with regard to the their less-favored regions, which indisputably also apply to our northern regions. However, I am convinced that an agreement will be found, even if the negotiation deadline is delayed.
