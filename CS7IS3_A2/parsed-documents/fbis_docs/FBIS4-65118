On the contrary, through the presence of one of its members in the Viminale [Interior Ministry], the federalist Northern League will guarantee Italy's unity." Barely a few minutes after the official announcement of his appointment to the Interior Ministry, Bobo "the mediator" [Roberto Maroni] -- staying in his Lozza cottage -- was already thinking of the future and of the president's doubts. For his part, [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi learned the news in his office in Via Bellerio. He had been unavailable for the whole day, not answering phone calls, and giving rise to some concern, especially in Rome, that he might be in the throes of a brainstorm. For the time being, Bossi limited himself to a few spirited remarks: "I am satisfied with the whole government team. It is made up of fairly young people. Besides, there are few recycled individuals, and this, too, is an important factor." Later on, an official communique arrived in which the League secretary confirmed the "democratic guarantor's role fulfilled by the League through the Interior Ministry." In the economic field, the League ministers will play "a reformist role" while, through the Institutional Reform Ministry, the League will pursue a twofold objective: "Reforming the existing republican Constitution along federalist lines," and embodying the local governments' competences in a new ministry. Yesterday was Bobo Maroni's day, however. Sitting on the red and green sofa in his living room, holding hands with his wife Emi while his children played in the garden, Maroni waited for the official announcement on television. "Moved, touched -- I defy anybody not to be," he said, but he then returned to politics. "I was not worried. We were in no doubt. Early in the afternoon [Prime Minister-designate] Berlusconi phoned to tell me `everything is in order.'" Not even the story of the exchange of letters between Scalfaro and Berlusconi had shaken Maroni's confidence: "I would myself have signed the letter that Berlusconi sent to the president of the Republic," he remarked in the morning. "Scalfaro's letter," he now added, "was intended, in a sense, to make Berlusconi assume responsibility for the fact that he was appointing a League member to the Interior Ministry. Under the circumstances, I believe that the prime minister behaved like a true prime minister." Maroni then resumed the tones of political and institutional reassurance: "Today, through the signature of the state's highest authority, it has become apparent that federalism and national unity are not incompatible, that federalism is not the same thing as separatism." The new interior minister made a promise: "I will not tell you what my first measure will be, it will be a surprise -- but, paradoxically, I who am a northerner by definition, will have the moral obligation to tackle and solve the South's problems -- I am fully aware of this." What about the protests from high-ranking bureaucrats and the prefects? "I have been told that the Interior Ministry has a very efficient structure. I will spend the first few months studying and observing matters, meeting with senior officials and staff, as well as traveling." He then promised: "I will be prudent. You see, the first phone call I received this afternoon, after the news came that the government had been formed, was not from a fellow party member or a politician, but from a police inspector whom I did not know. He congratulated me and wished me all the best, and told me not to worry. This pleased me very much." Yesterday was not only Maroni's day, however. It was also the first time the League has been in government and at the Viminale -- a true miracle in which, up to a few months ago, only Bossi seriously believed. Yesterday he said that, during the consultations, he provokingly proposed himself for the Interior Ministry: "They all jumped to their feet," he recalled, "crying out against subversion." Early in the morning on Tuesday [10 May], in the yard of party headquarters, he told of how his decision to aim for the government had been reached on the night Patelli was arrested. It was in the course of a dinner at the "Patrizia" pizzeria that the League's leader outlined the path that, months later, enabled his party to obtain the appointment of the first non-confessional interior minister in close to 50 years, as well as four other portfolios. "We came out of this in tiptop form," Maroni said. "We are part of the government, we have been legitimized by the voters, by the ministries, and by our visibility within the majority. The League is a political subject."
