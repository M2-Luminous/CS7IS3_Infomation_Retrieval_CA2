Akashi, the UN secretary-general's special envoy and director of civil affairs of the peacekeeping forces in former Yugoslavia, told reporters that they discussed how to push the peace process in Bosnia and that the talks were "fruitful". Although "regrettable", the UN peacekeeping forces' demand for NATO air strikes against Serb positions was "necessary," as the safety of UN military observers and residents in the Muslim enclave of Gorazde was being threatened, he said. He restated that the UN peacekeeping forces would strictly remain neutral and not be partial to any side. After NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serb positions near the UN-designated "safe area" of Gorazde on April 10 and 11, the Serbs suspended all contacts with the UN peacekeeping forces, especially the commander of the UN forces in Bosnia Michael Rose, who ordered the air strikes. As a result, the relations between the Serbs and the UN forces have reached an impasse. The Serbs accused the United Nations of siding with the Muslims and being directly involved in the Bosnian civil war. During his talks with Akashi, Karadzic said that the UN peacekeeping forces had not made Gorazde a de-militarized zone in accordance with an agreement in 1993. He said that the Muslims owned powerful military forces in Gorazde and constantly launched attacks on the Serb positions. He also said that it was necessary for the Serbs to keep political contacts with the UN civil leaders as they could not cooperate with the military leaders of the UN peacekeeping forces for a certain period of time. Karadzic described today's meeting, approved by the supreme headquarters of the Serb forces, as "a good thing." The supreme headquarters of the Serb forces met this afternoon on the military and political situation in Bosnia after the NATO air strikes. The Serb military leaders said that conditions for normalizing their ties with the UN forces' military leaders were not ripe at present, but agreed that the Serb leader could keep contacts with the UN forces' civil leaders when necessary. Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin and co-chairmen of the international conference on former Yugoslavia David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenburg have been working to bring the Serbs back to the negotiating table. As a result of the efforts by the three mediators, Bosnian Serbs had made some compromise to ease the rising tension in the area. Stoltenburg termed the talks between Karadzic and Akashi, which were held when relations between Serbs and the UN peacekeeping forces worsened, as "very important." Churkin said that make some progress was made at the talks in solving the Bosnia conflict.
