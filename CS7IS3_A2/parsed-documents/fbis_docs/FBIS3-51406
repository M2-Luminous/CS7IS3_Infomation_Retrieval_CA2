Hugo Rios spoke to Roberto Robaina only minutes before he left that nation on the so-called Dark Continent. Shortly before concluding his three-day visit to Zimbabwe, Robaina told Rios that: We are leaving Zimbabwe with more motivation to feel a part of Africa. In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Robaina said that during those three days, he felt he was back in Cuba, adding that the environment is good for the strengthening of ties between the two countries. Robaina was bid farewell at the Harare airport by Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira with whom he met three times on the last day of his official visit to that country. According to Rios' exclusive report for the "Doing Radio" newscast, Robaina and Shamuyarira discussed the international situation, the two countries' determination to strengthen bilateral relations, and reciprocal ties of solidarity and friendship were reiterated. Shamuyarira told PRENSA LATINA that not only Zimbabwe but all of Africa is indebted to Cuba. The Zimbabwean foreign minister had said these same words on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the triumph of the Cuban Revolution and reiterated them in his statements to PRENSA LATINA. After bidding farewell to Robaina, who has now left for Zambia, Shamuyarira said he shared Robaina's feelings of happiness about the meeting. During his stay in Zimbabwe, Foreign Minister Robaina also met with the higher education, health, interior, agriculture, and information ministers, and with the industry and commerce deputy minister. Robaina met with the mayor of Harare, with Cubans who work in Zimbabwe, and with the board of directors of the Zimbabwe-Cuba Friendship Association. During this morning's telephone conversation with Hugo Rios, we also learned that Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce Minister Christopher Ushewokunze was killed in a car accident last night. The government has reported that the minister was on the road that links Harare to (Balaguayo), in southern Zimbabwe, when he crashed into a military vehicle.
