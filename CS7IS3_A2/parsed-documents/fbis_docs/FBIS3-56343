Recent polls conducted by the "Sotsiomarket" Research Center show that the people are by no means delighted with the state of affairs in the republic. Some 46.4 percent of respondents in principle do not approve the very idea of a referendum. Almost a quarter of them are prepared to vote against the incumbent head of state. The reason is plain to see: 38.9 percent of respondents believe that the republic is rushing headlong into a crisis, while 29.3 percent are convinced that disaster has already struck. You can understand their viewpoint. The average wage in the republic is under 150 soms (around 20,000 rubles). While unemployment is putting more and more "surplus" manpower out of work at plants and factories. The newspaper VECHERNIY BISHKEK has reported that the opposition wasted no time in holding a "Last Supper" to discuss the possible situation: What is to be done if Akayev does not win the people's support? It was decided then to "nominate" for president Feliks Kulov, a 44-year-old militia general and head of the Tashkent Oblast Administration, and offer the post of parliament speaker to 75-year-old Turdakun Usubaliyev, the former "top man," who ruled the republic for almost 25 years. Interestingly, the latter seems to be already prepared to take on this role. When asked whether he would cope with the workload, Usubaliyev calmly remarked; "Gaydar Aliyev is doing OK...." Kulov, however, quickly rejected the "honor" he was accorded by the opposition and said that he is convinced that Askar Akayev will be victorious. There is every indication that the president has no intention of letting the referendum take its own course. Local observers assessed Askar Akayev's recent statement of his readiness to grant dual citizenship to Russians and Germans as a desire to win their votes -- and they represent almost one-fourth of all voters. But the president immediately met with opposition. Communists, republicans, and social democrats who think that dual citizenship will halt the wave of Russian migration and strengthen ties with Russia as Bishkek's strategic partner side with Askar Akayev. Political circles do not hide the fact that Askar Akayev is very much counting on Boris Yeltsin's support; the latter is expected to visit Kyrgyzstan on the eve of the referendum.
