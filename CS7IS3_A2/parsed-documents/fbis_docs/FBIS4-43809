Most writers hesitated, however, to draw firm conclusions about the impact of the vote on the remainder of the 1994 political calendar, including the 16 October Bundestag election. Many commentators saw Free Democratic Party [FDP] Chairman Klaus Kinkel's decision to back Herzog rather than Social Democratic Party [SPD] candidate Johannes Rau in the election runoff as a crucial choice--one which, for better or worse, inextricably tied the FDP's political fate to that of its CDU/CSU coalition partners. Press examinations of the SPD's reaction to its loss focused on the public dissatisfaction of party Chairman Rudolf Scharping and other SPD leaders with the indirect electoral process, which allowed Herzog to become president despite an apparent popular preference for Rau. Commentators typically criticized the SPD's disgruntlement as politically ill-advised and stylistically distasteful. Those who also examined the merits of the SPD's arguments in favor of direct presidential elections generally opposed such a system as counter to the intent of the Basic Law, or constitution. Some, however, still worried that partisan politics had played too great a role in Herzog's election. Kohl Seen Gaining in Short Term Reflecting mainstream press opinion on the election results, commentator Udo Bergdoll wrote in the 25 May SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that Helmut Kohl "is the big winner of 23 May." Bergdoll's conclusion was based on the fact that the election kept the (officially suprapartisan) presidency in CDU hands and gave Kohl a victory in Germany's last electoral contest before 12 June -- the date for local votes in several laender and a nationwide poll for the European Parliament. Even commentaries critical of the electoral process and its outcome, like Werner A. Perger's front-page essay in the 27 May DIE ZEIT, conceded that Kohl had won the election because he had succeeded in defining it as a cold-blooded contest between "a change of power and retention of power." At least one writer went a step further, seeing Herzog's victory as an omen for future contests. Martin S. Lambeck, writing in the 24 May edition of DIE WELT, suggested that Herzog's election was the strongest sign yet of increasing popular support for the CDU. The victory, Lambeck argued, was a "political signal of important weight," and "an encouraging sign for a continuation of the [CDU/CSU-FDP] coalition beyond election day in October." Most writers, however, hesitated to draw many conclusions about the remainder of the political year from the results of the presidential race, and some actively disputed any such connection. Perger's DIE ZEIT commentary, for example, cautioned that the 12 June contests "follow other laws" and refused to accept Herzog's victory as a "preliminary decision for the Bundestag election." Bergdoll, too, warned in his 25 May SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG analysis that Kohl's short-term win could turn into a "Pyrrhic victory" if the FDP's strategy of loyalty to the coalition caused Kinkel's party to lose support in the fall, threatening the government's Bundestag majority. FDP's Future Seen at Stake The wisdom of the FDP's decision to support its CDU/CSU coalition partners was the focus of much commentary, with most writers seeing it as a crucial choice which could make or break the party's future. In the 25 May edition of DIE WELT, Hans-Peter Schwarz described the decision of most FDP delegates to follow Kinkel and vote for Herzog over Rau as a "landmark decision on the course of [the party's] coalition policy." The FDP, which had traditionally drawn its voters from both the CDU and SPD camps, had now "defined itself by a strong majority as a party of the nonsocialist center, and thus against the SPD." While the FDP, for pragmatic reasons, might still decide on a coalition with the SPD after the Bundestag vote, the fate of Kinkel's party in the fall now depended on its ability to attract as much support as possible "from the reservoir of potential CDU/CSU voters." Bergdoll's commentary in the 25 May SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG went further, suggesting that the FDP had effectively abandoned its traditional position as holder of the balance of power between the two large parties. While this might seem like "liberation" in the short run, "the hangover will come later," Bergdoll warned, because some voters would interpret the party's choice as surrendering its separate identity to the CDU for the sake of a continued role in the government. Perger, in the 27 May DIE ZEIT, provided a hint of the potential backlash, denouncing the FDP as "obsessed with power" and available "to the highest bidder" and sarcastically praising Kinkel as a diligent student of Kohl's "brazenness." Claus Leggewie, writing in the 25 May DIE TAGESZEITUNG, struck a similar tone, arguing that the FDP had "once again proven its dispensability and opportunism" and even calling on those dissatisfied with the party's behavior to see to it that the "special-interest party FDP shrinks down to its puny stock of regular customers." SPD Viewed as "Bad Loser" Most commentators who examined the SPD's public reaction to Herzog's win echoed Chancellor Kohl's description of the Social Democrats as "bad losers" for their postelection complaints. These writers typically pointed out that such behavior was poor form and bad--even dangerous--politics. Rudolf Augstein, in a 30 May DER SPIEGEL commentary, called the SPD's attacks on the FDP for backing Herzog "useless and unjustified" and recalled that the CDU accepted a similar 1974 presidential loss more gracefully. Similarly, Peter Gillies, writing in DIE WELT of 25 May, described the SPD's "gripes" as being "of depressing mediocrity," and Eckhard Fuhr, in the 26 May FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, compared the party to a child who, having lost at a game, blames the rules. Pointing out that such conduct also has political consequences, Leggewie, in his 25 May DIE TAGESZEITUNG commentary, noted that Scharping "has yet again lost a few points" because of his "huffed" reaction to Herzog's win. In DIE WELT of 26 May, Ulrich Rosenbaum remarked that Scharping's attacks on the FDP, if overdone, could effectively eliminate any coalition options involving both parties. Since Scharping had already virtually ruled out a grand coalition with the CDU, Rosenbaum argued, the SPD leader would be forcing himself into a--politically very risky--coalition with the Greens. Looking beyond the immediate consequences for party politics, several writers warned that the SPD was undermining the legitimacy of the presidency and the Federal Republic itself by criticizing the result of a constitutional process as somehow undemocratic. Eckhard Fuhr's commentary in the 26 May FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, for example, accused the SPD of trying to make "political capital" at the expense of the Basic Law and federal institutions by implying that Rau had been cheated out of the presidency and by calling on voters to exact revenge in the 12 June European Parliament vote. Several other writers also complained about this campaign strategy, which included a poster with the line, "You Will Decide This Election." Juergen Busche summed up press opinion on the SPD's tactics in the 24 May SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG when he wrote that "this is the way one stirs up public mistrust of the institutions of a democratic state." Direct Election Rejected Most commentators also rejected SPD suggestions on their merits that direct election of the president might be preferable to the existing system, which entrusts the vote to a Federal Assembly reflecting the distribution of power in the Bundestag. Some writers simply expressed a desire to leave well enough alone and a fear of tinkering with tested institutions. Augstein, for example, wrote in his 30 May DER SPIEGEL commentary that the Basic Law "does not want a president who depends on the will of the people," and that the document "has proven its worth." Gillies, in his 25 May DIE WELT column, similarly maintained that "the fathers of the Basic Law based the election of the federal president on the principles of democracy, rather than those of public opinion polling, for good reason," though he failed to explain what the reason might be. Other commentators--including Busche in the 24 May SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, Fuhr in the 26 May FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, and Rainer Nahrendorf in the 25 May HANDELSBLATT--expressed concern that direct election would destroy the suprapolitical, unifying role of the president by making him beholden to particular interests, or lead inevitably to an undesirable expansion of the office's powers. Leggewie's 25 May DIE TAGESZEITUNG commentary, for example, worried that such a presidency would be too vulnerable to waves of extremist popular opinion and too powerful if an ideologue ever reached office. Role of Parties Criticized Despite this general rejection of a constitutional shift to direct presidential elections, press commentary reflected widespread dissatisfaction with the dominant role of party politics in Herzog's election. FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU commentator Astrid Hoelscher, for example, described the vote in that paper's 24 May issue as "remote from the people" [volksfern] and maintained that Herzog had been elected due only to "the strength of his party, and not his persuasive power as an individual." A 24 May DIE TAGESZEITUNG commentary criticized the "automatism" of assembly delegates who voted with their party rather than their conscience, and Perger, in the 27 May DIE ZEIT, complained that "the presidential election was turned...into a kind of chancellorship election," where delegates were really voting for Scharping or Kohl as party leaders, rather than for Rau or Herzog as individuals. Perhaps the best summation of the lingering dissatisfaction with the election came from Busche's commentary in the 24 May SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, which argued that the delegates' party-line voting was a violation, not only of the spirit of the Basic Law, but also of the public trust. "There is no reason," Busche concluded, "for the parties now to turn in satisfaction to their agenda of the day. Even if the demand for direct elections was ill-considered, the criticism of the parties is not."
