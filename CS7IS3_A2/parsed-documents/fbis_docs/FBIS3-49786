Bulgarian anti-terror department director Feodor Vladimirov told AA that they have met with Turkish officials in July and have signed a cooperation protocol against international terror organizations. He added that the matter had been kept in secret so far, for security reasons. During the meeting Turkish officials briefed their Bulgarian colleagues on the terror organization in Turkey and gave detailed information on the connections of these in Europe. Vladimirov said that Bulgaria was being used as a bridge in drug and arms smuggling. "We also know that some separatist terrorists are temporarily staying in Bulgaria when they flee to Europe. However, terror groups are not using Bulgaria as a shelter," he said.
