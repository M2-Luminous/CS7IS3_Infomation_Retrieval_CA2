FR940819-0-00072 FR940819-0-00018 Friday August 19, 1994 Part V Department of Transportation Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 168 Escort Vessels for Certain Tankers; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 160␣/␣Friday, August 19, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 168 [CGD 91&hyph;202] RIN 2115&hyph;AE10 Escort Vessels for Certain Tankers AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is requiring escort vessels for certain oil tankers transiting Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Puget Sound, Washington. This rulemaking is mandated by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). The regulations will reduce the chances of a tanker running aground or colliding as a result of loss of propulsion or steering control, thereby potentially reducing the risk of an oil spill. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Unless otherwise indicated, documents referred to in this preamble are available for inspection or copying at the office of the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., room 3406, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001 between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas Jordan, Project Manager, OPA 90 Staff, at (202) 267&hyph;6751. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Thomas Jordan, Project Manager, Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) Staff, and Mary-Jo Cooney, Project Counsel, Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) Staff. Regulatory History On July 7, 1992, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled ``Escort Vessels for Certain Oil Tankers'' in the Federal Register (57 FR 30058). When the Coast Guard received comments to the NPRM which were not as extensive as expected, it reopened the comment period (58 FR 16391, March 26, 1993) to solicit more specific comments on certain issues. The Coast Guard also published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) (58 FR 25766, April 27, 1993) seeking comment on other U.S. waters where an escort should be required, and other vessels that should also be escorted. That regulatory project (CGD 91&hyph;202a) is ongoing. In response to many comments, public hearings were held in Anchorage, Alaska on June 3, 1993, Valdez, Alaska on June 5, 1993 and Seattle, Washington on June 7, 1993 (58 FR 25959, April 29, 1993; and 58 FR 29157, May 19, 1993). The Alaska hearings were also teleconferenced to include several outlying communities in the Exxon Valdez impact area. Transcripts of those hearings have been placed in the public dockets for these rulemakings (CGD 91&hyph;202 and CGD 91&hyph;202a) and are available for inspection or copying at room 3406, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters. At this time, the Prince William Sound Disabled Tanker Towing Study (DTTS) Group is sponsoring a special study concerning the present tanker escort operations in Prince William Sound (PWS). The study group is made up of representatives from five regional interest groups: the PWS Tanker Association, the PWS Regional Citizens' Advisory Council, Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, and the Coast Guard. Although the DTTS is a separate project from this rulemaking, it is of particular value to this rulemaking because of the technical information it will develop on the maneuvering characteristics of disabled tankers under the control of different combinations of escort vessels. Part 1 of the DTTS, entitled ``Evaluation of Existing Equipment, Personnel and Procedures,'' has been completed and is available to the public through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). The Coast Guard published a notice of availability (NOA) (59 FR 1411; January 10, 1994) for Part 1. The NOA reprinted the Executive Summary from Part 1, and provided information for ordering copies of the study from NTIS. Part 2 of the study is expected to be completed in spring 1994; the Coast Guard will publish another NOA when details are available. Background and Purpose Section 4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380) requires the Secretary of Transportation to initiate rulemaking to define areas where single-hulled tankers over 5,000 gross tons (GT) transporting oil in bulk must be escorted by at least two ``towing vessels'' (as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101) or by some other vessels which the Secretary considers appropriate. By statute, these defined areas must include Prince William Sound, Alaska, and Rosario Strait and Puget Sound, Washington (including those portions of the Strait of Juan de Fuca east of Port Angeles, Haro Strait, and the Strait of Georgia subject to United States jurisdiction). The Secretary also has the authority to extend the escort rule to other U.S. waters as appropriate. The rulemaking authority has been delegated to the Coast Guard, which will implement section 4116(c) in two separate rulemaking projects: CGD 91&hyph;202 addresses escort requirements for the Prince William Sound and Puget Sound waters named in the statute, and CGD 91&hyph;202a addresses escort requirements for other waters. Discussion of Comments and Changes Comments received by the Coast Guard in response to the NPRM and public hearings are discussed as follows:
