The leader of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] said that the problem does not mainly concern all personnel issues, but the understanding of the government's activities, the method of administering the country, and discussion over the concept of the economy. "It is serious," admitted Kwasniewski and indirectly confirmed that Marek Borowski discussed the possibility of handing in his resignation ("he is an obstinate man"). However, he was of the opinion that he would be able to get everything cleared up during his "meeting of three" with Waldemar Pawlak and Marek Borowski, scheduled for Thursday [3 February] evening. "The entire affair is unfortunate, and it was done in the wrong manner, but today conclusions must be drawn from it," said the SLD leader. "It is not a problem of resignation, which only expedited the difficult talks within the coalition, but a problem of the continuation of the economic policy, which is put under question by statements such as those made by Minister Podkanski on the agreement with General Motors." Kwasniewski refused to answer the question of what he would do if he did not manage to reach agreement. He merely added that Borowski is a very competent and valuable politician and that the main problem of the coalition should be the budget (which should take the economic realities into account) and not disputes over the cadres. Asked about the resignation of Under Secretary Miroslaw Stec from the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], he said that the SLD expects URM to submit a concept for the state administration and that this will also be discussed in the talks with the prime minister. "It is a difficult coalition, and I have never concealed this; however, there is no alternative to it. Therefore, we must act in such a way as to allow the government to act efficiently," said Aleksander Kwasniewski. Deputies of the Polish Peasant Party (such as Tadeusz Sytek and Piotr Chojnacki) believe that the prime minister did what he should have done and that he does not have to explain his decision to anyone. Jerzy Pistelok told us that this issue is not of very great importance; it had been discussed in the Presidium of the government before, and Minister Borowski should have demanded that resignation himself. Becaise he did not do this, the prime minister had the right to recall the deputy minister because he had made too many mistakes. "We are absolutely sure that the prime minister's decision was correct, and so are many colleagues in the SLD," said Pistelok. Jozef Oleksy and Aleksander Kwasniewski denied that there were such discussions because this issue was not important enough to discuss in the coalition. "I believe that Prime Minister Pawlak feels good when he makes cadre changes," we learned from former Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka, of the Democratic Union [UD]. "He probably thinks that this is how his power is expressed. The prime minister may recall a deputy minister without the consent of the minister, but only when he asks that the deputy minister be recalled and the minister does not want to do that. This coalition has the will to survive, and this is why it will not present the PSL with the bill." "The SLD will not present the bill to the PSL for fear of the coalition's integrity; however, it will show that something important has happened," says UD's Grazyna Staniszewska. "The reason the prime minister has acted this way is that the PSL has an SLD complex; another reason was the pressure on Waldemar Pawlak, exerted at various levels, to prepare posts for people who are already waiting for them." "This is a family quarrel, and we will not meddle in it," said Wojciech Borowik, of Union of Labor. "If a bill is presented, it will not be very large because both parties want the coalition to survive."
