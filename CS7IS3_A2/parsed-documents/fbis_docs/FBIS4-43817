Member nations of the Western European Union (WEU) offered logistical support to the proposed French-led intervention to end the slaughter in the central African country, but Paris failed to win pledges of troops. French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur admitted Tuesday to members of the National Assembly in Paris that "only" Italy in Europe and "only" Senegal among African states were prepared to commit troops. Balladur stressed any deployment would require authorisation from the United Nations. French officials, who had planned to send 1,000-2,000 troops, said they still intended to press for a Security Council vote on Wednesday. The troops would be stationed in Zaire close to the border, but not on Rwandan territory and their operations would be strictly humanitarian, the premier was quoted as saying by a leader of his parliamentary group. Balladur also stressed that other countries would have to send troops and that the force would "in no case" carry out operations "in the heart of Rwanda." "Most WEU countries are ready to provide logistical support of one kind or another," one diplomat said after a meeting here of ambassadors in the WEU, which includes all European Union countries apart from Denmark and Ireland. But the support was conditional on a new UN Security Council resolution backing France and the WEU wanted African troops to be part of the force. In Ottawa, the Canadian foreign ministry said Tuesday it was prepared to send 350 communications specialists to Rwanda within weeks if requested by the United Nations. At UN headquarters in New York, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reaffirmed his support for the French plan for intervention in Rwanda, his spokesman said. Boutros-Ghali is aware of members' concerns about the proposed military mission to end the bloodbath that began April 6, but will not back down from his support for the plan, said Joe Sills. A French military "assessment" team of some 15 soldiers arrived Monday in Goma, eastern Zaire, to prepare for the planned intervention, sources in Kinshasa close to the operation code-named "Turquoise" said. But the French plan aroused bitter hostility from the mainly Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which accuses Paris of arming government troops and being indirectly responsible for massacres carried out by extremist militias of the Hutu majority. [passage omitted] Paris wants to deploy the force until Boutros-Ghali succeeds in a bid to boost the UN mission from just 495 men to about 5,500, mainly troops from Africa, which could take three months.
