Cz., E.K., J.B.L., and Ma. S.: "Before the Coalition Summit: Prime Minister Pawlak Accepts Marek Borowski's Resignation"] [Text] "Yes, I think Mr. Borowski's decision was made with deliberation and consideration, and it should be treated as such," said Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak in a television interview in reply to the question of whether he would accept the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Borowski. "I am prepared for a compromise," commented Aleksander Kwasniewski on the prime minister's statement. "I believe that the prime minister's statement offers a chance for such a compromise. We will talk." The meeting of the coalition, which has been planned for a few days now, will be held this evening. The leadership of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], which held a session yesterday, gave definite support to the prime minister. The leaders of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] publicly and personally forwarded several invitations to talks on the government conflict to Prime Minister Pawlak. They did not want to comment on the fact that, since Saturday [5 February], the prime minister has failed to devote a couple of hours to such a meeting. They did not have an agreed opinion on how internal PSL conflicts affect the personality of the prime minister and to what extent decisions of the SLD leadership will be binding on his behavior. However, the dominant opinion in the SLD faction was that, in the current economic situation, neither side intends to risk another early parliamentary election, and the conflict has to be settled by Wednesday. A private conversation between Kwasniewski and Pawlak alone will resolve the problem. According to unofficial information, such a meeting had to take place before the Monday meeting of the PSL leadership. Kwasniewski had said at a previous meeting of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement Council [OPZZ] that he would try to persuade the prime minister to not accept Marek Borowski's resignation. He had also mentioned the possibility of achieving a compromise. As we were told in the faction, in case a timely agreement was not reached, the only obscure issue could be the behavior of the president, who had thus far kept silent but who could also appear in Warsaw at any time, convene the government, and join the game. He is entitled to do this by Paragraph 2 of Article 38 of the Small Constitution, which reads: In matters of exceptional importance to the state, the president can convene and preside over a meeting of the Council of Ministers. During Saturday's meeting of the leaders of the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP], one of the left-wing politicians stated that the entire conflict actually resolved itself into a reply to the question of how to manage the government efficiently. This quite deceitful formulation originated from the reluctance to tease the partner's ambition anew. However, a reply to this question is essential, and Deputy Prime Minister Borowski's resignation was a tactical game that sooner or later will force the leaders of the coalition to discuss the essence of this matter. PSL: To Survive, Not To Yield to Domination Retain the coalition, accept Borowski's resignation (that is, decline his demands), and not be dominated or incapacitated by the SLD--this is what members of the Chief Executive Committee and the Chief Council advised the prime minister to do on Monday night. Opinions on the crisis and the methods for settling it seem to have been very concurrent among the leadership. Following an hour-and-a-half-long meeting closed to the press, Prime Minister Pawlak and Minister Strak left by the underground garage, avoiding journalists. Vice Chairman Stefaniuk said that the PSL did not see any danger to the longevity of the coalition, nor did the PSL threaten the coalition in any way. In Jozef Zych's opinion, the SdRP resolution adopted on Sunday "creates the basis for an optimistic view of cooperation with the PSL." Zych stressed carefully that the PSL will not get involved in the government matters to which he ascribed Borowski's resignation and his demands. Meanwhile, the problem of the coalition or the PSL also includes the establishment of principles in the economic, social, and staff policy. "This coalition was born in a difficult situation, and we must not allow some problem that I am convinced is not the most significant one to decide whether the coalition exists," said Zych. The unanimous opinion prevailing among the PSL leadership is that the fact that Pawlak held back last week's outburst of the SLD's dissatisfaction, even at the cost of losing some supporters among his constituents, is positive. Had the prime minister applied the same weapon--toughness--and presented his own blatant version of developments, had he listed the points of the agreement that the SLD failed to execute, the coalition would not have been able to meet in its current composition. These points include, for example, Leszek Miller's demands to amend the budget ("Does the prime minister have to discipline the number two person in SLD?") and the OPZZ's draft law on repealing taxes on excessive wage increases submitted in early December. Borowski's resignation is perceived within PSL circles as a tactical maneuver aimed at scoring some propaganda success for the sake of athe SLD and thus aimed at taking success away from the PSL and the prime minister, who is Kwasniewski's potential competitor in the presidential race. Activists for the peasant movement are saying that the dismissal of Kawalec had been agreed upon by leaders for both parties two weeks before he was dismissed by the prime minister. Pawlak dismissed Kawalec because he waited in vain for a decision by Borowski. The conflict inside the coalition did not have an impact on increasing tensions within the PSL. On the contrary, Chairman Pawlak's opponents inside the party expressed their unanimous support for him. Prime Minister's Methods Depending on the situation, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak applies two methods alternately (sometimes simultaneously): silence and disappearance. The most recent case (before the PSL authorities held a session) of the prime minister appearing in public was at 1400 on Friday. From what he said at the time, it could not be concluded that he intends to reject the conditions set by the coalition partner. After that, he was simply unavailable, and not only to journalists. On Saturday evening, Aleksander Kwasniewski, while commenting on reports that the prime minister went to meet with fire brigade members, said with malice that he does not think the situation amounted to a trouble spot yet. One of the SLD leaders, who expressed his irritation while responding to a question on how it feels to talk to the prime minister, said Pawlak is a black box: You talk to him and there is no response. You do not know what he thinks because he does not reply; he does not even show on his face whether he even hears you. As can be concluded from statements by members of the Cabinet, the prime minister's silence is his usual style and not just a mask he puts on for journalists. So far, both methods have proved effective. The net result is that it is the coalition members who get anxious and nervous; they keep looking for the prime minister, and they wait for a message from him. And he, having failed to make any declarations, has all of the possible paths open in front of him, and he keeps gaining time, which he needs if only to think things through. The Consequences of That It is the SLD politicians who made efforts to clear up the conflict as soon as possible and to hold a meeting among the coalition members. But Prime Minister Pawlak announced as early as Friday that negotiations within the coalition would take place on Tuesday. He was right. The SLD made it possible for it to be maneuvered into the position of someone trying to obtain something. This was determined first of all by the situation arrangement and not by mistakes by SLD leaders, at least at the point when the conflict became publicly apparent. Waldemar Pawlak is the prime minister. He can continue to be the government's chief, even if the SLD ministers leave. It would be a minority cabinet then, even if Sejm deputies for the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms and the Confederation for an Independent Poland joined in. It seems that, at least for the moment, that is the only possibility with this parliament. The Union of Labor stresses its similarities with the PSL in terms of party programs but not with such a minority arrangement. A government with neither the SLD nor the Democratic Union must be condemned to the Belweder's support. The prime minister's dependence on the president and his minister of state would then increase along with the term of office of the minority cabinet. Then Waldemar Pawlak, instead of strengthening his position (which is most probably what he is after right now), would be strongly dependent on another power center. Speaking during a television interview, in which he reported that he will accept the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Borowski, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak expressed his conviction that the coalition continues to function. "Every one of us, while making a decision, should consider its consequences very carefully. We have opportunities to work for Poland in different posts," he said. According to the prime minister, the dispute is not about procedural issues but about an answer to the question: Are we going on, down the road of a simple, liberal continuation, or will we be creating a prosocial policy that would be open to the needs of the economy but also to those of society? Speaking on the topic of differences in approaching the budget, he admitted that a budget does not necessarily have to be a convenient formula that can be easily summed up on paper. But what it must do is meet society's expectations. But the government will not present a new draft budget because it bears full responsibility for what it already submitted. He said the budget is based on the real situation and that it is implementable. "We have an excellent candidate for the post (occupied by Marek Borowski). He is a member of our party, but I cannot reveal his name before I talk to the prime minister," Kwasniewski told REUTER late last night. The information was denied by Zbigniew Siemiatkowski of the SLD.
