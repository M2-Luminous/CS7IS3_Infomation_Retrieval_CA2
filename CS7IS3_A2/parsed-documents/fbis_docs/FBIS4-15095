While preparing it, the possibility of joint constructive (?work between) various branches of power, parties and trade unions has become apparent. The text prepared by the working group is being distributed for publication and general discussion. But no less complex and important stages lie ahead. In this connection I want to share my thoughts about the idea of civic peace and accord and further possible measures. Need for Agreement The Agreement on achieving civic accord in Russia arises from what has happened in the political life of the country -- no matter how contradictory it may seem -- and from the need to ensure political stability in society and to encourage the shoots of civic peace. Not a single serious problem of economic and social change can be solved without this. The agreement would help to protect the emerging Russian democracy against political extremism. So far we, in fact, have only one democratic instrument to protect society and the state -- the new Constitution. This is not enough. Besides the Main Law, democratic traditions and a culture of dialogue, compromise and partnership are needed. The recent elections in March showed how justified is the concern expressed in the address of the Russian president regarding the alienation of society from power and the population from politics. Only by proving to people that politicians, parties and state institutes can come to an agreement, find common positions and effectively solve important public tasks can one hope to overcome this alienation. The Possibility of an Agreement Skeptical voices are heard saying that in the present condition of society an agreement is impossible. This point of view leads down a blind alley. I consider that the adoption and implementation of an agreement are realistic. Society is tired of confrontation, it is demanding civic peace, consensus, stability (not, however, the stability of immobility, but the stability of movement, economic and political reformation). The people's need is sensed by the politicians, and this is clearly heard in the individual statements and declarations of the most varied political forces. An agreement is furthermore possible because it reflects and consolidates mechanisms of consensus that have already started to operate, which is attested by the examples of joint work by the representatives of different branches of power on specific problems. The whole population, the majority of political parties and a considerable proportion of the corps of deputies have an interest in consensus and political stability. With what political explosions are fraught is clear to all. At the same time -- and this is fully justified -- many are counting on legal mechanisms of obtaining power, which work only amid political stability. Main Tasks of Agreement The tasks of the agreement on achieving civic accord in Russia arise from the interests of the overwhelming proportion of the population. I would formulate them briefly as follows: 1. To ensure political stability by bringing into play the mechanisms of accord to be used permanently, in order to help resolve contradictions at early stages without them resulting in a confrontation, and in order to create in society and among the political elite an atmosphere of rejecting and denouncing extremism; 2. to form new political traditions and a new political culture; 3. to overcome the alienation of society from power by demonstrating real accord and the effectiveness and openness of politics; 4. to make the structures of civic society more active by involving them in discussing and tackling important problems; 5. to stimulate and speed up the adoption of laws necessary for extricating Russia from the economic crisis; 6. to create a favorable social atmosphere: A feeling of stability, confidence in power and an understanding of it. What is Most Important in the Agreement The most important thing is that the agreement on achieving civic accord in Russia should set in motion a permanent mechanism of accord and maintain it. For this it is proposed (in accordance with the existing text) to set up a conciliation commission from representatives of the parties. Its main function is to create and maintain the work of permanent round tables for the main directions: Social and economic policy, security, culture, national problems and so forth. These round tables will analyze the situation, single out important specific problems and set up temporary working groups from representatives of the interested parties to discuss them and to elaborate recommendations. The strength of such groups lies in the fact that the recommendations drawn up by them will emphasize key contradictions at an early stage and will find agreed ways of solving them precisely because it is easier to come to an agreement on specific issues. I am sure that this agreement will be achieved if we can maintain such conciliatory procedures for specific problems and make use of their results. Completing Work on the Text of the Agreement To complete work on the text of the agreement it is proposed to set up a working group, which would include two representatives from the following parties: - the Russian president, the Federation Council, the State Duma, the Russian Government, the Public Chamber, religious organizations, trade unions, associations of entrepreneurs and industrialists, creative associations. I should regard it as useful to adopt a procedure whereby each of the parties could veto the inclusion of any of the proposed candidates in the group. This would enable a composition to be achieved that could work smoothly and make decisions by consensus. In that case, the text of an agreement that had had the finishing touches applied to it by the group could be signed without any further discussion. The text of the current draft agreement as published in the press should be discussed, and recommendations, proposals and amendments should be drawn up and then sent to the president's administration for forwarding to the working group that is now operating. Then, one day in the second half of April, a further working conference can be convened, attended by representatives of the above-mentioned parties to the agreement and leaders of parliamentary groups in the State Duma. The purpose of such a conference is to endorse the composition of the group working on the text and (to endorse) the signing procedure. After this meeting, the newly formed group will be given no more than seven days to complete its work on the text, so that the signing may take place on 28 April. Signing of the Agreement I imagine that the parties from the above-mentioned list must decide for themselves which of them will be delegated for the ceremonial signing of the text of the agreement. I daresay there may be proposals to broaden the group of signatories by means of regional or wider political representation (this may be a topic for discussion at the next conference). The delegations of the parties sign the text of the agreement. It is then published with an appeal by the parties to accede to the agreement. Following publication of the text, the body set up in accordance with the adopted agreement (in the current text, that is the Conciliation Commission) is given the powers to organize an open signing of the agreement. This may, for example, take the form of decisions to accede to the agreement adopted and sent in by various organizations. A list of such organizations may be published regularly in the newspapers by the Conciliation Commission. I am sincerely confident that the agreement on achieving civic accord in Russia is both possible and necessary today for all of us -- the politicians and citizens of Russia. The agreement will demonstrate that our new political system is strengthening and maturing, that we are becoming stronger and more responsible and that political ambitions and speculative interests are taking hold of us less frequently. But the process of completing, adopting and implementing the agreement can easily be wrecked; mutual mistrust and the tendency to achieve victories at the expense of one's opponent and not together with him is still great. We must never forget this if we sincerely believe in our desire for accord and civic peace in Russia.
