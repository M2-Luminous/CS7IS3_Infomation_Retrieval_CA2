FR941221-2-00056 FR941221-2-00047 [Docket No. 94N&hyph;0435] Public Forum on Informed Consent in Clinical Research Conducted in Emergency Circumstances; Notice of Meeting AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are co-sponsoring a public meeting on informed consent in clinical research conducted in emergency circumstances. The purpose of the public meeting is to gather information and solicit the views of interested parties regarding issues related to the application of informed consent requirements in clinical research performed in emergency circumstances. Presentations and discussions will address ethical, medical, scientific, regulatory, and legal standards for the conduct of clinical research in emergency circumstances where obtaining the consent of the research subject or the authorized representative is not possible. Here, research in emergency circumstances relates to the testing of experimental therapies for individuals in life threatening circumstances rather than to public health emergencies. Several case studies that illustrate relevant issues will be presented and discussed. Critical elements in the design of clinical trials to test new therapeutic approaches in emergency circumstances also will be discussed. Participants will be provided opportunities to share their views and information regarding protocol design, study conduct, and patient experiences in clinical research in emergency circumstances within current regulatory guidelines. DATES: The public meeting will be held on January 9, 1995, 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and January 10, 1995, 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Because seating space is limited, early registration is recommended and pre-registrants will have seating preference. Submit written comments by February 7, 1995.
