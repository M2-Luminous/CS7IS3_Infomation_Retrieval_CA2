Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and industry minister for international affairs, and Jeffrey Garten, commerce undersecretary, will probably meet in Tokyo for three days, said the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), who declined to be named. The planned talks will follow ongoing working-level auto and auto parts negotiations that started Thursday in Washington for a two-day run. The coming high-level meeting is designed to set objective criteria as a tool to measure the openness of Japan's auto markets and as a mechanism to review progress in bilateral auto trade, the MITI official said. During the Okamatsu-Garten meeting, Washington will also give a specific response to measures on auto trade adopted by Japan as part of its market-opening measures announced at the end of March, the official said. In the ongoing working-level talks in Washington, the official said the U.S. "Highly appreciated" the Japanese measures, which focus on voluntary industry efforts to expand purchases of U.S.-made cars under the "cooperation approach."
