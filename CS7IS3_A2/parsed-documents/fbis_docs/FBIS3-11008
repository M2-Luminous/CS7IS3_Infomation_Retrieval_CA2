Meta has Senator Jorge Ariel Infante, and Quindio has Samuel Grisales. At the Chamber of Representatives, the dark spots are Amazonas, which lost Milquesedec Lopez and Jairo Jose Ruiz Medina, Guainia, which lost the seat of Guillermo Britto, and Vaupes, which had Alfonso Gonzalez Vargas. These last three departments are in a serious situation, if one considers the fact they were completely erased from the parliamentary map; this shows how the struggle among the traditional politicians to get votes from all over the country-- thanks to the nationwide electoral conscription--does not always work out, silencing regions that have always been forgotten by the state.
