According to a participant in yesterday's session of the State Duma Council, over the two festive weeks a series of intensive consultations took place between leaders of the republic's Defense Ministry and the Duma Defense Committee on one hand, and representatives of the Russian Federation Economy Ministry and Finance Ministry on the other. Presidential national security adviser Yuriy Baturin took part in the negotiations on behalf of the Russian Federation administration. The subject of discussion was the proposal by the above committee, submitted officially to parliament as an amendment to the draft 1994 state budget whereby the overall limit of spending on defense items should be increased from 37 to 55 trillion rubles, i.e., almost one and a half times. State Duma Budget Committee head Mikhail Zadornov refused to comment on these reports in detail, noting only that he "would be very cautious about any such proposals." Some of his colleagues, however, were more forthright: Journalists were told that the committee coordinating the entire discussion of the draft budget knows nothing about which sources the authors of the grandiose amendment intend to tap to compensate for the increase in state spending. Nonetheless, the same sources indicate that President Yeltsin has been fairly well disposed toward the solicitation of the defense lobby. The text of the Duma committee proposal was sent to Viktor Chernomyrdin with an endorsement saying, "I deem it reasonable to agree" [sshchitayu tselesoobraznym soglasitsya]. The presidential resolution, it should be noted, appears extremely interesting owing to the peculiarities of Russian syntax which has confronted interpreters with just another puzzle of the "execute" and "pardon" kind [reference to phrase "kaznit nelzya pomilovat" which, depending on where the comma is placed, can read either "To be executed, cannot be pardoned" or "Cannot be executed, must be pardoned"]. Its exact meaning depends crucially on whether the original copy of the document has a period or at least a comma before the word "to agree." If so, then the lobbyists' success is almost a foregone conclusion.
