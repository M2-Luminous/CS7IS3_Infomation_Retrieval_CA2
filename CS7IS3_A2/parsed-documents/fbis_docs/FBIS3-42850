Gamova; place and date not given: "The Roots of the Mutual Relations Between Moldova and Ukraine Go Back Centuries"] [Text] More than 600,000 Ukrainians live in Moldova today. This and also being Ukraine's immediate neighbor dictate the interest of the people living in our republic in the mutual relations of the two states. The interview with Vitaliy Boyko, Ukraine's ambassador in Moldova, is about this. [Gamova] Vitaliy Fedorovich, how are Ukraine's relations with Moldova developing, and what in them is determinative? [Boyko] Moldova is viewed in a strategic sense as a very close neighbor with which it is possible to build normal friendly relations. Ukraine's position is built on recognition of the unity and indivisibility of Moldova's borders. This has been repeatedly confirmed by Ukraine President L. Kravchuk. But as a very close neighbor, Ukraine is alarmed by the problems associated with the Dnestr area conflict. Especially because the conflict occurred on the borders with Ukraine, and this speaks of possible moral and material losses for us. In addition, every seventh resident in Moldova is of Ukrainian origin. Moreover, a majority of Ukrainians are residents of the Left Bank. This is a feature that we cannot fail to take into account. Therefore, at the last meeting in Kiev, Leonid Kravchuk expressed Ukraine's intention to promote a settlement of the conflict in the Dnestr area. Adhering, as I have already noted, to the principle of the unity and indivisibility of Moldova, Ukraine thinks that the possibility of allotting special status to the eastern rayons of Moldova, with definite guarantees in the event of changes in the status of Moldova itself, is a step that could remove the existing problems. Since the proclamation of independence of our states, their mutual relations are being placed on a legal basis. A treaty on good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation between Ukraine and Moldova was signed in October 1993. About 30 intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements on different directions of cooperation were concluded on the basis of this treaty. It is characteristic that the year 1993 ended with another meeting of President Snegur and President Kravchuk in Kiev. Documents were signed at it in the sphere of protection of the rights of citizens: Ukrainians in Moldova and Moldovans in Ukraine. These concern basically social protection, for example, of pensioners. Although it would be nice if the number of these documents increased, inasmuch as other problems also exist. Essentially, there is no state border between Moldova and Ukraine, there is an administrative-territorial one. Meanwhile, the state border is the sign of an independent state. You know, you somehow feel more confident with a neighbor when a boundary is drawn between your plot and his. At the Kiev meeting the presidents talked about the need to accelerate resolution of this question. [Gamova] Customs posts are also a sign of independent states... [Boyko] There is a lot of unfavorable criticism of the existing customs barriers. Things have developed in such a way that there are blood ties connecting the residents of Ukraine and Moldova. In this connection, round trips are quite natural. In the process of inheritance among citizens of Moldova it can happen that their home and vegetable garden are in a Ukrainian village. But a person has to pay to transport across the border what he has raised in his very own garden--the customs duties are such that it is cheaper to buy food products at the market. Recently, to officially register a crossing of the Ukrainian border, customs charged $5 from each vehicle. This kind of $5-customs barrier turned out in fact to be a closing of the Ukrainian border. It is true that this measure existed for only two weeks; however, it evoked colossal indignation. Errors like this cost us a lot, inasmuch as they have a negative effect on the assessment of Ukraine. [Gamova] In your opinion, is anything changing in the conditions in which the Ukrainian diaspora has to live in Moldova? [Boyko] There are some changes for the better in the revival of Ukrainian culture and language. I detect in this the policy of the president of Moldova and on the whole of the authorities of the republic who are trying to create a definite base for the future. Ukrainian groups are being created in Moldovan VUZ's [higher educational institutions]. The university in the capital will prepare elementary grade teachers for Ukrainian schools. Two groups have been formed in the Lipkany teachers college for the training of educators for Ukrainian kindergartens. According to the joint agreement of ministries that are in charge of questions of education, a student exchange is being conducted, and young boys and girls of Ukrainian nationality from Moldova can receive an education in Ukraine, and vice versa. State policy in Moldova is directed at the creation of conditions for the revival of national cultures. This is also indicated by support at government level of Ukrainian cultural societies in Moldova. [Gamova] Are requests addressed to you at the embassy concerning the granting of Ukrainian citizenship? [Boyko] There are such requests. But the fact is that the laws of Ukraine do not envision granting Ukrainian citizenship to persons who live outside its borders. Only those who have moved to a permanent place of residence in Ukrainian cities and villages can become citizens of Ukraine. Meanwhile, our legislation permits dual citizenship on the basis of intergovernmental agreements. Except for Tajikistan, this practice as such does not exist in the CIS. As a lawyer, I am interested, for example, in what the basis is for such an agreement between Russia and Tajikistan. This question is being studied at the expert level in Ukraine and Russia. In the future, it can also come up against the background of our relations with Moldova, and what is meant here is the development of a special interstate agreement. Although numerous questions crop up here. Including also the question of obligations with respect to the state whose citizenship a person is assuming. In dual citizenship, perhaps, only his rights are being looked into. Nevertheless, the statement of the issue of dual citizenship itself is important, if at least because requests regarding adoption of Ukrainian citizenship are numerous. They are especially being looked at in the Dnestr area and the rayons bordering Ukraine. The residents of these rayons, referring to the fact that until 1940 they were in the structure of Ukraine, are insisting on confirmation of their Ukrainian citizenship, although, however, citizenship of Ukraine as such did not exist before 1940. [Gamova] What would you wish for the readers of KISHINEVSKIYE NOVOSTI in the New Year? [Boyko] Returning to the meeting of the presidents of Moldova and Ukraine, I would wish for the results of the agreements achieved in it to be filled with a good deal of substance. So that their implementation will proceed for the good of both the Ukrainian and Moldovan people. For the readers of your newspaper--happiness, health, and abundant peace in the New Year.
