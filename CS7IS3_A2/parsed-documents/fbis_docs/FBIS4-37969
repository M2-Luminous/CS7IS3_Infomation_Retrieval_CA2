FBIS4-37969 "drnes123_j_94026" FBIS-NES-94-123 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 Arabian Peninsula Minister Denies Reports of Violation Minister Denies Reports of Violation NC2706091594 Cairo MENA in Arabic 0704 GMT 27 Jun 94 NC2706091594 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Sanaa, 27 Jun (MENA) -- Yemeni Information Minister Hasan al-Lawzi has denied reports claiming that the armed forces, "the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy," violated the cease-fire announced the day before yesterday and that came into force at midnight on Saturday [25 June]. He told MENA's correspondent in Sanaa that the forces of "unity and constitutional legitimacy" fully complied with the cease-fire decision on the Aden and Hadhramaut axes according to the Defense Ministry's instructions to the commanders of these two axes in every sector. But, he added, continuing their line of rejecting all national initiatives, the "forces of rebellion" resumed their attacks on the armed forces units in several places inside Aden. He went on to say that these forces carried out air raids on the Bi'r 'Asakir and Sabir Districts of Hadhramaut Governorate and on civilian installations in the Lahij Governorate's capital city of al-Hawtah. These forces, he noted, are continuing their attacks despite all the military units' commitment to the cease-fire, patience, and nonretaliation in appreciation of UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali's appeal and in response to the brothers and friends' good offices. The Yemeni information minister told MENA that the "rebels" believe their voice can only be heard amid the fighting and reports on the fighting. This, he said, prompts them to foil every serious effort toward stabilizing the situation without achieving even part of a foreign political step to serve their illegitimate goals. He noted that these goals have met no clear response, only explicit financial backing from a minority and propaganda support that the facts will soon reveal. He explained that if the armed forces were not extremely concerned about the lives of Aden citizens and civilian and economic installations in the city they would have been inside Aden city. He said the "renegades" realize this fact before anyone else and continue to count on it. He added that the armed forces would work to end their use of this, employing great patience throughout every violation and attack. He said all the state authorities, primarily the people's armed forces, will remain extremely concerned for citizens' lives, for the Yemeni homeland's economic and trade capital, and for the people's gains in the Aden infrastructure.
