The inconsistency seen in the model results by vehicle class is, to some extent, the result of the smaller range of the metric within any subgroup of vehicles together with the inherent variability in the data. These analyses and the analyses of benefits and costs discussed later, indicate that different minimum standards for passenger cars and light trucks cannot be supported using either tilt table angle or critical sliding velocity.
