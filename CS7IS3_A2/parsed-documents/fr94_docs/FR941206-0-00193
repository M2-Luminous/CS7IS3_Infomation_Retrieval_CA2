FR941206-0-00193 FR941206-0-00019 (ii) Results of the waste determination performed or requested by the Regional Administrator showing that the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste at the point of waste origination is equal to or greater than 100 ppmw shall constitute noncompliance with this subpart except in a case as provided for in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section. (iii) For the case when the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste at the point of waste origination previously has been determined by the owner or operator using an averaging period greater than 1 hour to be less than 100 ppmw but because of normal operating process variations the VO concentration of the hazardous waste determined by direct measurement for any given 1-hour period may be equal to or greater than 100 ppmw, information that was used by the owner or operator to determine the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste (e.g., test results, measurements, calculations, and other documentation) and recorded in the facility records in accordance with the requirements of §265.1084(a) and §265.1090 of this subpart shall be considered by the Regional Administrator together with the results of the waste determination performed or requested by the Regional Administrator in establishing compliance with this subpart. §265.1084 Waste determination procedures. (a) Waste determination procedure for volatile organic (VO) concentration of a hazardous waste at the point of waste origination. (1) An owner or operator shall determine the average VO concentration at the point of waste origination for each hazardous waste placed in a waste management unit exempted under the provisions of §265.1083(c)(1) of this subpart from using air emission controls in accordance with standards specified in §265.1085 through §265.1088 of this subpart, as applicable to the waste management unit. (2) When the facility owner or operator is the generator of the hazardous waste, the owner or operator shall determine the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste using either direct measurement as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section or knowledge of the waste as specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section for each hazardous waste generated as follows: (i) When the hazardous waste is generated as part of a continuous process, the owner or operator shall: (A) Perform an initial waste determination of the average VO concentration of the waste stream before the first time any portion of the material in the waste stream is placed in a waste management unit subject to this subpart, and thereafter update the information used for the waste determination at least once every 12 months following the date of the initial waste determination; and (B) Perform a new waste determination whenever changes to the source generating the waste stream are reasonably likely to cause the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste to increase to a level that is equal to or greater than the applicable VO concentration limits specified in §265.1083 of this subpart. (ii) When the hazardous waste is generated as part of a batch process that is performed repeatedly but not necessarily continuously, the owner or operator shall: (A) Perform an initial waste determination of the average VO concentration for one or more representative waste batches generated by the process before the first time any portion of the material in the batches is placed in a waste management unit subject to this subpart, and thereafter update the information used for the waste determination at least once every 12 months following the date of the initial waste determination; and (B) Perform a new waste determination whenever changes to the process generating the waste batches are reasonably likely to cause the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste to increase to a level that is equal to or greater than the applicable VO concentration limits specified in §265.1083 of this subpart. (3) When the facility owner and operator is not the generator of the hazardous waste, the owner or operator shall determine the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste using either direct measurement as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section or knowledge of the waste as specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section for each hazardous waste entering the facility as follows: (i) When the hazardous waste enters the facility as a continuous flow of material through a pipeline or other means (e.g., wastewater stream), the owner or operator shall: (A) Perform an initial waste determination of the waste stream before the first time any portion of the material in the waste stream is placed in a waste management unit subject to this subpart, and thereafter update the information used for the waste determination at least once every 12 months following the date of the initial waste determination; and (B) Perform a new waste determination whenever changes to the source generating the waste stream are reasonably likely to cause the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste to increase to a level that is equal to or greater than the applicable VO concentration limits specified in §265.1083 of this subpart. (ii) When the hazardous waste enters the facility in a container, the owner or operator shall perform a waste determination for the material held in each container. (4) For the case when the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste is determined by the owner or operator to be less than 100 ppmw, but because of normal operating variations in the source or process generating the hazardous waste the VO concentration of the hazardous waste may be equal to or greater than 100 ppmw at any given time during the averaging period, the owner or operator shall prepare and enter in the facility operating record information that specifies the following: (i) The maximum and minimum VO concentration values for the hazardous waste that occur during that averaging period used for the waste determination; (ii) The operating conditions or circumstances under which the VO concentration of the hazardous waste will be equal to or greater than 100 ppmw, and; (iii) The information and calculations used by the owner or operator to determine the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste. (5) Procedure for using direct measurement to determine average VO concentration of a hazardous waste at the point of waste origination. (i) The owner or operator shall identify and record the point of waste origination for the hazardous waste. All waste samples used to determine the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste shall be collected at this point. (ii) The owner or operator shall designate and record the averaging period to be used for determining the average VO concentration for the hazardous waste. The averaging period shall not exceed 1 year. An initial waste determination shall be performed for each averaging period. (iii) The owner or operator shall identify each discrete quantity of the material composing the hazardous waste represented by the averaging period designated in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section. An example of a discrete quantity of material composing a hazardous waste generated as part of a continuous process is the quantity of material generated during a process operating mode defined by a specific set of operating conditions which are normal for the process. An example of a discrete quantity of material composing a hazardous waste generated as part of a batch process that is performed repeatedly but not necessarily continuously is the total quantity of material composing a single batch generated by the process. An example of a discrete quantity of material composing a hazardous waste delivered to a facility in a container is the total quantity of material held in the container. (iv) The following procedure shall be used measure the VO concentration for each discrete quantity of material identified in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section:
