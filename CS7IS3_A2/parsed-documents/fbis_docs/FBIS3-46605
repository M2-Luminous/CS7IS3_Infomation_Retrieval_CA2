The elimination of these 406 tariffs will mean that more than $2.5 billion [Singapore currency] worth of imports annually will be able to enter Singapore duty-free from tomorrow. The duty foregone from these imports is estimated at $60 million. The products include birds' eggs, candy, biscuits, artificial sweeteners, clothing, flourescent tubes, headgear, leather handbags, imitation jewellery and furniture. The huge GATT accord, formally approved on Dec 15 by 114 nations, is expected to eliminate trade barriers and lower tariffs around the world. For the first time, there will be rules to govern trade in agriculture, textiles and services. Protection of intellectual property rights wll be strengthened, barriers to foreign investment levelled and a new World Trade Organization set up to police the new deal. The agreement is widely expected to stimulate more trade, thereby pulling world economies out of recession and promoting new jobs. Trade is also being liberalised in ASEAN under the AFTA agreement. Under the plan, intra-regional tariffs on all manufactured and processed products will be capped at 5 percent by the year 2008.
