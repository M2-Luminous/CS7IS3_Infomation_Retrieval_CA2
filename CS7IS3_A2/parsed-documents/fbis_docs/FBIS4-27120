This is the highest honor and a historic event for all the leaders of Cambodia present here and the Cambodian people. In the name of all Cambodian people, I am extending the noblest, everlasting wholehearted gratitude to Your Excellency, the father of the Korean people, independence, and prosperity, reflecting our highest respect and emotion. Your Excellency, most esteemed Generalissimo, president of the Republic: Cambodia which formally restored independence, territorial integrity, national unity and peace following the signing of the Paris peace accord on October 23, 1991, has striven to substantually restore national unity and peace up until now, but no success worth mentioning has been made. Unfortunately, the civil war is going on between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Democratic Cambodia side, imposing ineffable sufferings upon the innocent peaceable population of Cambodia. A roundtable conference, a top-level conference for peace and national reconciliation between the factions of Cambodia, had to be organized very urgently with a view to ending this tragic civil war for today and tomorrow of Cambodia and the Cambodian nation. Very significant and noteworthy here is that the Cambodian leaders have reached a consensus on choosing Pyongyang, the attractive capital of the so glorious, friendly and fraternal Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as the venue of the conference. The fact that all the leaders of Cambodia have chosen Pyongyang as the historical place of the roundtable conference for peace and national reconciliation, their summit conference, is an expression of Cambodia's full trust in your excellency the prominent President Generalissimo Kim Il-song, the most intimate friend and steadfast supporter of the Cambodian people. Your excellency most respected and beloved generalissimo, president of the Republic: Allow me to express our noblest, courteous and eternal thanks to your excellency for the warm kindness, goodwill and incomparably excellent hospitality accorded us, for the flawless preparations you have let competent officials of Korea make for our roundtable conference, thus making it possible for the leaders of the State of Cambodia and the Democratic Cambodia side to achieve positive results of unanimous support to the principles of effecting a cease-fire, though the date is yet to be designated, defending the national and territorial unity of the country, forming a standing committee made up of the factions of Cambodia whose mission it will be to discuss and solve one by one the pending issues between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Democratic Cambodia side, and of maintaining fraternal working ties, at the current conference for Cambodia and its people. I express boundless admiration in the name of Cambodia and its people to you who have made immortal, tireless efforts for the liberation of Korea and her all-around development of high degree and made historical contributions to a victory of the struggle of the third world peoples for freedom, dignity, justice, peace and progress. Royal Cambodia has always stood on your side from 1965 and constantly expressed its full and unflinching support for your most patriotic and heroic policies of opposing all forms of outside interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK including the national defence issue and rejecting threats from big powers, and this position will never change in the future. We also firmly support and will support in the future, too, the lucid and wise and most patriotic proposals made by you for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. Out of this sentiment, in the name of the Cambodians present here, I propose a toast to the everlasting good health and long life, and everlasting glory of your excellency generalissimo, president of the DPRK, Kim Il-song, the respected and beloved great leader of the Korean nation and people; to the good health, long life, and glory of his excellency Marshal Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of the Korean people and the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army; to the good health of esteemed Madame Kim Song-ae; to the everlasting friendship and invincible unity between the Kingdom of Cambodia and the DPRK; to the good health of your excellency Premier Kang Song-san and his wife; to the good health of your excellency Vice President Yi Chong-ok; to the good health of your excellencies of Korea and their wives present here; and to the good health of the Korean friends present here.
