The two presidents, who are currently visiting the United States, had breakfast together on Tuesday at their common residence, the Ritz Carlton Hotel, prior to leaving for their meeting with President Bill Clinton. After the working breakfast, Goncz and Kovac said in a statment that reconciliation was made more difficult by mutually established misunderstandings about relations between the two countries. In their view, the first misunderstanding is that the wounds which Hungarians and Slovaks have caused to each other are too deep to heal quickly. However, the reality is that the two nations have lived side by side for many centuries, in spite of the conflicts, and have enriched each other both materially and culturally. The presidents stressed their firm resolve to overcome psychological obstacles in the way of cooperation. According to their joint statement, the second misunderstanding, often used for advantage by extremist elements, is that the minorities could endanger the unity and integrity of the individual countries. The statement declares that the presidents are convinced that ethnic linguistic and cultural diversity is beneficial not only for their countries, but for international relations as well. Presidents Goncz and Kovac added that the sole authentic and effective minority policy must be based on international law and the measures set down in the approved international documents relating to minorities. They also stressed that a proper approach could disperse all misunderstandings. Presidents Goncz and Kovac voiced their readiness to support the enforcement of minority rights and to mutually work toward elevating cooperation between their states to a new standard. They are of the opinion that a readiness for closer ties is beginning to emerge in both countries. "We support the efforts of the political leaders in our countries to intensify bilateral cooperation and to reach agreement in the matter of a contract which -- based on respect for territorial integrity and the existing borders -- will guarantee good neighbourly relations and minority rights in both countries," they stated. The presidents also called attention to the fact that intensifying bilateral relations could promote the integration of Hungary and Slovakia into the western economic, political and security structure. President Goncz and President Kovac believe that the distinction which is to be conferred on them by the Institute for East-West Studies indicates that the United States understands and appreciates these efforts, while the meeting scheduled with President Bill Clinton demonstrates that the U.S. Administration supports the goals of the two countries.
