The U.S. President talked about the major current issues, such as GATT, the G-7, Bosnia, and Europe. Clinton and Balladur also talked with journalists for a while. The French prime minister seized this opportunity to say how much he appreciated U.S. security policy in Europe: [Begin Balladur recording] I still have confidence in the U.S. Administration and in the actions of President Clinton. We may not hold the same views on some issues -- the opposite would be surprising -- but what is of the utmost importance is our common desire to maintain peace and security in Europe. I must say that I found President Clinton to be very open-minded with regard to European issues and the need for Europe to be better organized. This is what he repeated earlier as we were finishing our lunch. I think that most of the reasons why we may have misunderstood each other have now disappeared. [end recording]
