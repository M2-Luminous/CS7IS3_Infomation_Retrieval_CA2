Nurkadilov's successor, Shalbay Kulmakhanov, was chairman of the oblast soviet executive committee and chief of the oblast administration), our new mayor likes to meet the press. And not only employees of municipal television, what is more. And he is altogether more open and democratic than the severe Zamanbek Kalabayevich. It is troubling, though, that the new chief, like the old one, is a builder by education and service record. This is a wonderful and the most peaceful profession on earth, but the coincidence is still disturbing. Especially since with a diplomatic evasiveness typical, most likely, of all builder-mayors, Sh. Kulmakhanov successfully turned down the offer an interview with this issue of KARAVAN-BLITS.
