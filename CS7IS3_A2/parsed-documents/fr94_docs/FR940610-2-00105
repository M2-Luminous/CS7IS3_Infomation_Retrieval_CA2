This proceeding is related to a petition for exemption filed concurrently in Joel T. Williams, III, Roy C. Coffee, Jr., Rafael Fernandez-Macgregor, Bristol Investment Co., Inc._Continuance in Control Exemption_Cen-Tex Rail Link, Ltd. and South Orient Railroad Company, Ltd., in Finance Docket No. 32478, wherein Joel T. Williams, III et al. have concurrently filed a petition for exemption to continue in control of Cen-Tex and South Orient Railroad Company, Ltd. when the former becomes a rail carrier upon consummation of the transaction described in this notice. Cen-Tex will also acquire incidental overhead trackage rights: (i) On the ATSF line between Ricker, TX (approximately milepost 134 + 2,171 feet on ATSF's Dublin Subdivision) and San Angelo Junction, TX (approximately milepost 0 + 330 feet on ATSF's San Angelo Subdivision), (ii) on the ATSF line between milepost 1 + 1,541 feet (ATSF Dublin Subdivision) and milepost 368.5 (ATSF Fort Worth Subdivision) for certain intermodal produce shipments, and (iii) on the ATSF line between milepost 1 + 1,541 feet and milepost 0 + 4,752 feet on ATSF's Dublin Subdivision, to reach other carriers in Ft. Worth, TX. Cen-Tex's acquisition of the properties is expected to be consummated and operations to begin upon or soon after the effective date of this exemption. 2 2 Shortly after consummation, Cen-Tex will sell the subject rail lines (but not the incidental trackage rights and other assets) to the Centex Rural Rail Transportation District. However, Cen-Tex will retain all of its common carrier operating rights on the lines under a permanent freight railroad operations easement. Any comments must be filed with the Commission and served on: Kevin M. Sheys, Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly, 1020 19th St., NW., Suite 400, Washington, DC 20036. This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1150.31. If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Decided: June 3, 1994.
