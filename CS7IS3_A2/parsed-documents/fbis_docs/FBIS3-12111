We do this by virtue of the powers granted to the CEN in Article 159 of our statutes and by the powers granted to political parties in Article 41 of the Political Constitution of the United States of Mexico. We are gathered here today, united in the purpose of giving continuity and validity to the postulates of the Mexican Revolution. We are gathered here today, deeply moved and aware of our responsibility to Mexico. At this time, we are strengthened by Luis Donaldo Colosio's undying course of action. Attentive to the Mexico he saw, deeply convinced of the reason as well as the political and human validity of the ideals he offered the nation, PRI members must continue along the path he outlined for us with his thoughts and example. All of Mexico is in mourning and PRI members are offended. This ideological and political legacy, however, is also a commitment for undertaking new tasks. In the PRI, we must continue with his campaign for the sake of democracy and social justice, our party's slogans which Luis Donaldo gave new meaning and deep projections. The National Executive Committee unanimously appoints our companion and friend, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, as the PRI candidate for the presidency of the republic. [applause] Ernesto Zedillo is a great member of our party. He is well acquainted with Luis Donaldo Colosio's thinking, a politician committed to the theories and principles of our party and to this campaign's political platform. Ernesto Zedillo is the best man we have to lead the PRI's efforts to win the elections on 21 August. This appointment is also fully supported by our governors and by members of our party in the country's many states. They joined the CEN in signing this appointment. We are convinced that Ernesto Zedillo is the best member of the PRI; he is the person to whom Luis Donaldo Colosio entrusted the coordination of his campaign. We, the members of the CEN, are certain that Ernesto Zedillo has the boldness and conviction to continue on the path that Luis Donaldo Colosio initiated. As I stand before the general public and our party members, I wish to reaffirm the ideals and positions [banderas] the party is raising in this campaign. The profound injustice that has caused Luis Donaldo Colosio to disappear from our midst cannot be tolerated, nor, unfortunately, can it be repaired. The proposal he set forth to the Mexican people, however, remains alive. Today, PRI members entrust to Ernesto Zedillo the leadership of the PRI's efforts in the electoral race. If the Mexican people freely and sovereignly so decide, the PRI's national ideals, Colosio's pledges, his plans, and the services he rendered to the Mexican people will become law and a way of government. We know that the future of the fatherland demands unity, devotion, and loyalty. The PRI is hereby resuming its campaign to win the people's vote of conviction. It is resuming its campaign for change with responsibility and direction. The PRI is resuming its campaign for democracy and social justice. We are going for victory and the progress the Mexican people are demanding; we are going for the democracy that all Mexicans hope for; we are going for victory with Ernesto Zedillo. A united PRI will confirm that it has the strength to conquer, to win by convincing society, to fulfill the national plan the Mexican people want. Let us achieve victory, united and strong with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. [applause]
