Lamers had demanded the establishment of common European export rules. This would make arms exports easier than they are in line with the current German regulations. The Federal Government, too, is skeptical about this suggestion. So far, it has been assumed that a memorandum of the Foreign Policy Working Group, headlined "Common European Defense -- Common Arms Market -- Common Arms Export Policy," which was drawn up with Lamers' participation, meets with approval by the Bundestag group. This memorandum, which was published at the end of November, is now causing excitement with some delay. On Wednesday [5 January] deputy group chairman Gerster came out against loosening the German export rules. Before one can think of approving regulated arms exports along broader lines and for larger areas, one must emphatically counteract excessive illegal deliveries of armament materiel in an internationally coordinated action. CDU Deputy Eppelmann, the former GDR defense minister, thinks that it is rather necessary to tighten the arms export rules instead of loosening them. To combat illegal arms trade, Gerster demands additional legal regulations. It must be possible to use evidence the Federal Intelligence Office [BND] has obtained from monitoring German arms dealers in court. Germany must not become the turntable for weapons from the former East Bloc. Therefore, checks at the borders must be tightened not only by the Customs Administration and the Federal Border Police, but also with the help of the Bundeswehr. Eppelmann criticized the Lamers' proposal and the Foreign Policy Working Group for not aiming at solving conflicts. Lamers does not speak of disarmament; the working group seems to want to resign itself to current conditions. As was confirmed on Wednesday, the Federal Government does not intend to follow the demand for loosening the export guidelines and export control regulations. However, there are indications of considerations to change the examination and licensing procedures with the final decision in the Federal Security Council. This is aimed at making the German armament industry better able to cooperate in Europe. This would be a reaction to complaints from the armament industry that purely private cooperation projects between German and European companies are delayed so much by the licensing procedures that German companies are on the brink of becoming incapable of cooperation. The procedures should be made equal to those for the smoother official cooperation projects initiated by the state. In the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] it has been confirmed that it opposes any loosening of regulations both for arms exports as well as for civilian supplies that can be used for armament. SPD economic expert Schwanhold said that the Military Materiel Control Law and the Foreign Trade Law must continue to be handled strictly. The strict German rules should, if possible, become the standard for harmonization in the European Union. The goal of German policy in the new role of the country must be worldwide disarmament and the conversion of armament industries to civilian production facilities. Deputy SPD Chairwoman Wieczorek-Zeul said that arms exports cannot safeguard Germany as an industrial location. Arms exports would only hurt Germany's reputation in the world.
