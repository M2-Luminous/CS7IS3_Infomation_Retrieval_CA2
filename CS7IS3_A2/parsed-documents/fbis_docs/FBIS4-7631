The newly emerged "81 + 27" hybrid is, however, more reason for lament than pleasure. The "81 + 27" project assumes for the first senate elections 27 constituencies, in which the citizens would have three votes to cast in three smaller (sub)wards. While we would have 81 small wards, the citizen would not vote for a single senator in his ward, as proposed by the traditional majority system, but also in two additional ones. Moreover, these 81 wards are to exist only the first time around. In the subsequent senate elections, the citizens would only vote for one candidate in 27 large constituencies, as the smaller coalition parties headed by the Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA] demanded from the very beginning. In other words, the deputies propose: In the first year, we will satisfy the ODS's demand for 81 wards (no longer according to the pure majority principle of one candidate-one vote), and, in subsequent years, we will transfer to the ODA system. Every second year, then, a single senator would be elected in each of the 27 wards. In the meantime, the ODS proposal has the citizen elect his senator once in six years. Why, however, is the president so pleased with this pseudocompromise, when he recently declared that he likes the idea of small single-seat constituencies, calling it a pure majority system as prescribed by the Constitution? It seems that, at the last moment, the president revised his opinion so he does not have to support the ODS in its struggle against the ODA and the Christian and Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party [KDU-CSL]. The meeting on Thursday [24 March] between the president and [ODA chairman] Jan Kalvoda and [KDU-CSL chairman] Josef Lux (for the second time in absence of Vaclav Klaus] indicates that a certain triumvirate is emerging for defense against the prime minister and his party. There is nothing wrong with Havel, Lux, and Kalvoda feeling the need to join hands and face the hegemony of Czech politics together. Nevertheless, it is no reason for the president to turn away from the practical project of the ODS, which complies with the constitutional stipulations better than any of the other projects.
