FR940304-1-00147 FR940304-1-00014 3. Significance of Energy Savings To estimate the energy savings by the year 2030 due to revised standards, the energy consumption of new mobile home furnaces under the base case is compared to the energy consumption of those sold under the candidate standard levels. For the candidate energy conservation standards, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model projects that over the period 1996&hyph;2030, the following energy savings would result for all classes of the product: Level 1_0.02 Quad Level 2_0.05 Quad Level 3_0.05 Quad Level 4_0.03 Quad Level 5_0.11 Quad Level 6_^0.02 Quad The above energy savings are smaller than anticipated because the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Residential Energy Model predicts fuel switching from gas to electricity at trial standard levels 2 and above as shown in Table 3.4 of the Technical Support Document. However, the Department finds that each of the increased standards levels considered above except for level 6, the max tech level, would result in a significant conservation of energy. 4. Economic Justification. A. Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers. The Department is refraining from publishing the per-unit increased cost to manufacturers to meet the trial standard levels for mobile home furnaces due to confidentiality considerations. The Department has determined that the data provided is confidential pursuant to 10 CFR 1004.11. There are only two manufacturers of this product, and they would provide data only if DOE agreed not to publish the data. Today's proposed rule is based upon the Department's consideration of these data, and others, e.g., data from component suppliers, as described in Section 1.5 of the Technical Support Document. At the considered levels of efficiency, the consumer price increases are $5.74 for level 1 and $76.80, $186.35, $273.71, $569.32, and $1151.56 for standard levels 2&hyph;6, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at level 1 is $9.56 for the representative class; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $25.71; standard level 3 by $35.54; standard level 4 by $44.96; standard level 5 by $83.20; and standard level 6 by $100.15. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1.
