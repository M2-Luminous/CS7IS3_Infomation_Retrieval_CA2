However, the replacement of one uniform by another is by no means the hardest stage on the way to creating a national army. Particularly when it is being formed under conditions of an undeclared war and a solid transport blockade which is paralyzing practically all industry in the republic. "If we could have established a lull on the border with Azerbaijan, even for about eight months, but still better for a year, we would already have at our disposal the army that we need," Major General Mkrtich Abramyan, Armenian deputy minister of defense, maintains. The republic's Ministry of Defense maintains that Armenian officers in the former Soviet Army were surpassed in numbers only by Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians. Armenians in uniform -- from lieutenants to colonels -- were sought throughout the territory of the former Union, but by no means all were attracted by service in a republic experiencing the incredible difficulties of a blockade. No more than 5-7 percent of Armenian officers responded to the call to continue their service in Armenia -- which, of course, could not resolve the cadre problem. Then it was necessary to appeal to officers who had been transferred to the reserve five, 10 or even 15 years ago. Armenia needs its own military school, maybe more than one. But there are no instructors. Unwise steps in respect of Armenia's Russian-speaking population have caused a considerable number of experienced military instructors at Yerevan's higher educational institutions to leave the republic. Thus, just six of the 30 officers who were working recently in the military department of the capital's Polytechnical Institute are left. The Defense Ministry has sent a certain number of students to study in Russian and Belarusian military schools, but this is very costly. Another equally important problem is being resolved with considerably more success than the process of forming the officer corps -- the problem of drafting people for active service. The last draft, which was completed last fall, was 105 percent fulfilled. Gen. Abramyan resolutely refuses to regard Azerbaijan as a possible enemy, since Yerevan has not had and does not have any territorial claims on Baku. As regards neighboring Turkey, the warming of the international situation and also the ongoing process of rapprochement between military blocs provide no grounds for treating this NATO member country as a military enemy either, Mkrtich Abramyan believes. "The skies over Yerevan, as well as Armenia's entire airspace, incidentally, are reliably protected by air defense facilities. We can see an aerial enemy from afar and are capable of hitting him at any altitude," I was told at the Defense Ministry. Combat operations have been going on for approximately two years now all along the perimeter of the land border with Azerbaijan. Many Armenian officers are amassing knowledge and experience on company, battalion, and regiment exercises being conducted by Russian Army subunits stationed in Armenia. Since all the combat and technical facilities in Armenia's arsenal were inherited from the former Soviet Union, Russian military specialists are teaching their colleagues how to competently store, repair, and operate complex combat hardware. Apart from the arms handed over to the republic by the command of the former Soviet Army, Armenia does not purchase or acquire anything else.
