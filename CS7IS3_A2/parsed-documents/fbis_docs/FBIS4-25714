We will continue to stabilize and improve the policy that will remain unchanged for a long time to come -- that of letting farmers cultivate land independently and herdsmen own the domestic animals they raise and conduct their own management. We will also institute measures to ensure that land acreage will not change with the increase or decrease in the number of people working on it; implement a licensing system for grassland utilization; clearly define grassland utilization rights; and gradually institute the system of transferring, on a voluntary basis, the right to use land and grassland in return for payments without changing the ownership and designated uses of land and grassland. We should increase the proportion of fiscal and credit input in fixed assets related to agriculture and animal husbandry, and will encourage collectives and individuals to increase input in agriculture and animal husbandry. In accordance with market demand, we will revamp the crop and plant cultivation structure while ensuring steady increases in grain output, focusing on the Yarlung Zangbo-Lhasa-Nyang Qu Valley and the Nyang He Valley. We will gradually switch to a three-crop structure based on grain, cash, and feed crops. We will make active efforts to develop animal husbandry in rural areas, promote local grain conversion, and speed up the construction of bases for fattening cattle and goats. In his report, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu noted: In developing village and town enterprises, we should proceed from local conditions, map out rational and overall plans, and concentrate such enterprises in cities and towns where energy supplies are assured, transportation facilities are developed, and the economies are relatively brisk. In accordance with market demand and local resources, we should launch projects geared to whichever sector can be developed. We should organize production and management in whichever way is beneficial to development. Localities with the right conditions may set up joint enterprises across township and county lines. The departments concerned should lend full support to the development of village and town enterprises in terms of capital, technology, manpower, and information, and provide sound guidance and service. The report said: With the marketing of newly harvested grain this year, we will increase the procurement prices of wheat and rapeseeds. After adjusting the price of chemical fertilizer, we will convert into direct subsidies for peasant households any funds made available as a result of reduced subsidies to agriculture-supporting enterprises as compensation for policy-induced losses. Both the autonomous region and all prefectures, cities, and counties should establish risk-control funds for agriculture and animal husbandry, and ensure the sustained development of these two sectors. The autonomous region has created a leading group for aid-the-poor projects, which will specifically take charge of aid-the-poor projects across the region. It will actively aid the poor through development, science and technology, and resource exploitation so that a number of people will be lifted out of poverty within specified periods and become better-off gradually.
