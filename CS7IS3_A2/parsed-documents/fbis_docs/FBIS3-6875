Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans says Australia supports any action the United Nations Security Council may consider necessary in the matter. Senator Evans told the Australian Parliament that this week's decision by the International Atomic Energy Agency to refer the matter to the Security Council is a measure of how seriously the internatioanal community is treating the issue. Sen. Evans also revealed Australia had expressed its concerns directly to North Korea. [Begin Evans recording] We sent a message to North Korea ourselves last Friday (?with the idea) to allow IAEA inspections to be completed as a means of restarting the dialogue process. Regretably, the DPRK has not so far seen its interest as apparently being best served by proceeding in this fashion, but we hope, as it has on previous occasions when the situation, the pressure that is being mounted and the attitude of (?IAEA) and the attitude of the international community is clear, that North Korea will consider its position.
