The ACC set a good example for promoting joint Arab action in the interest of the Arab nation and its fateful causes. The launching of the ACC was an enlightened and rational response to the challenges and dangers facing the nation, particularly after the intensification of military conflicts in the region and after the pan-Arab and national security of ACC members was jeopardized, not to mention the growing inclination of world states to establish economic groupings to protect their national interests. The announcement launching the ACC was widely welcomed and supported by the Arabs. People maintained that Iraq's ACC membership, given its powerful national and pan-Arab weight, would prompt the ACC to take a serious course in joint Arab action. That is why the obstruction of the ACC work was one of the objectives of the U.S.-Atlantic-Zionist conspiracy, to which Iraq was exposed. The Egyptian regime's announcement to suspend Egypt's ACC membership has confirmed the U.S. desire to thwart the ACC's noble pan-Arab objectives. The Egyptian regime's decision was met with extensive and broad opposition in Egypt. This opposition was reflected in the arguments exchanged by the Egyptian People's Assembly members when they debated the future of the ACC on 8 February 1994. The Assembly's debate on the issue showed a massive support for Iraq. The deputies condemned the embargo, and urged Arab states to lift the embargo on Iraq. A large number of Egyptian parliamentarians urged support for Iraq so that it may confront plots, and so that it may become, once again, the mainstay of pan-Arab resurgence. The National Progressive Unionist Grouping [NPUG] is one of the parties that expressed support for Iraq. NPUG representative Khalid Muhyi-al-Din asserted that the embargo is aimed at destroying Iraq and destabilizing the Arabs. For his part, Fikri al-Jazzar, speaking for independents at the People's Assembly, urged the Arab states to shoulder their pan-Arab responsibilities, and to wage a battle to lift the embargo imposed on Iraq. Hence, the positions of the people's representatives were made clear when they debated the future of the ACC. They emphasized that the role of the ACC must be rehabilitated at the current phase, particularly since it constitutes a nucleus for Arab unity. They added that foreign pressures must be shunned, because foreigners deem any Arab grouping a threat to their interests and evil objectives. This was explained by Diya'-al-Din Dawud, secretary general of the Nasirite Party, who asserted that if it revokes its ACC membership, Egypt will confirm that this will be in response to foreign and colonialist dictates, which aim to isolate Egypt from the Arab homeland.
