Government Is Recommended to Give a Meaning to its Policy"] [Text] As KOMMERSANT-DAILY already wrote on 20 and 22 April, the parliamentary hearings on foreign economic activities organized by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the Duma Economic Policy Committee, are unlikely to alter appreciably the Chernomyrdin cabinet's foreign economic policy. The committee's recommendations can still be considered as a rather promising option in a bid to improve Russia's foreign economic ties. The Economic Policy Committee proceeds in its recommendations from the fact that "a sensible state foreign economic policy is absent." This finds an expression in that Russian exports are increasingly raw-material-oriented which adds no hard currency sources for the Russian budget. Besides, Sergey Glazyev believes, the existing sources for adding to the budget from foreign economic activities are far from being fully used. He is confident that a tougher control over customs and hard currency, coupled with the abolition of invalid easy terms, can alone add to the budget between $8 billion to $12 billion. The committee also asked the Duma to expedite the passing of a package of three economic laws that propose to delimit clearly the functions of the authorities, to define the rights and duties of the participants in foreign economic activities, as well as to set the norms on non-tariff regulation and export control. As for the government, it was recommended to submit to the Duma a program for expanding the export of finished products, to coordinate the industrial, foreign economic, scientific and technical policy, to make public the procedure for the registration of special exporters, as well as to join hands with the Central Bank to impede the outflow of capital abroad. Burdened with the current problems (including those created by the foreign economic activities lobby), the government is hardly enthusiastic about Glazyev's recommendations -- they cause irritation because, from the political point of view, they detract from the professional prestige of the executive branch. Many others are also unhappy with Sergey Glazyev's persistence. For example, as he was preparing the foreign economic activities hearings, he applied to the "Rosvooruzheniye" state corporation but its chiefs declined to provide information about its operations. In response, the Committee decided to hold on 24 May hearings on military-technical cooperation.
