Beilin said this was not a case of lip service, seeing that it is inconceivable that Iranian officials should be given an audience while Ron Arad is rotting in captivity. During his three-day stay, Deputy Minister Beilin conferred with top German Foreign Ministry officials, including the deputy foreign minister. Kinkel earlier conferred with Arab League Chairman 'Abd-al-Majid, who was visiting Bonn. He told Beilin that there is a chance the Arab League might lift the boycott on subsidiary companies, due to the positive developments in the peace process, and that, contrary to his custom, 'Abd-al-Majid sounded optimistic about the success of the peace process. Kinkel opined that failure to comply with the timetable for withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho could affect credibility in the negotiations with the Palestinians. The foreign minister promised to support Israel and facilitate its discussions with the European Union on the renewal of trade agreements when Germany has its turn as president in the second half of 1994. Also, Germany will reconsider its involvement in the multilateral talks in view of Israel's contentions that it has neglected and ignored the subject compared to Japan and the United States. Kinkel stressed to Beilin that Germany will continue to uphold its special bilateral relations with the State of Israel. He evinced interest in the referendum on a Golan withdrawal and the possibility of intense negotiations with the Syrians in anticipation of a peace agreement.
