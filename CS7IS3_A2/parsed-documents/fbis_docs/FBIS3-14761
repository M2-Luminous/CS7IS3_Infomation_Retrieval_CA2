Not only is the fact of inviting a professional economist "from abroad" to take the post of premier interesting in itself, but so is the possibility of verifying in practice the efficacy of approaches to implementing reforms and overcoming the severest economic crisis other than those applied in Russia. Saburov's name first became widely known when in August 1991 he took up the post of deputy chairman of the RSFSR Council of Ministers, and minister of the economy in I. Silayev's government. He executed this role for just a few months, however, and he was not invited to join the new Gaydar "government of reforms." Yevgeniy Fedorov is 48 years old. He was born in Yalta (his mother still lives there). He graduated from the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, gained a profound knowledge of economics, and became the author of the economic program "Twelve Steps From the Abyss." He is a man of many interests, with a creative streak: He has published his own play, and he is fascinated by philosophy, and theology.... He has been the director of the Center for Information and Social Technologies under the Russian Government since January 1992. On becoming prime minister of the Crimean Government he decided to remain simultaneously the center's scientific leader: "The brain trust will help me resolve difficult problems...." [Golovachev] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, to what extent has the experience of Russian reforms fitted you for Crimea? How do you, in general, evaluate what has happened in Russia in the space of two years? [Saburov] The situation in which the Russian economy now finds itself is extremely complex. This, in my view, is the consequence of major errors committed while implementing reforms. What is most tiresome is that many errors could have been avoided, as the government was warned about them in advance; but, alas, the warnings were not heeded. Take, for instance, the idea for the speedy integration of our economy into the world market system. In the overall scheme of things, this was an excellent, and right-minded idea -- there is no argument about this. At the same time, however, it would have been necessary to take account of the fact that our economy is self-devouring, "inverted." The main economic "bricks" -- prices, profitability, profit -- are not compatible with the world market. Because cheap raw materials, cheap transport, and a completely different price structure lay at the basis of accounting in our country. In Russia, whichever example you may take -- a sofa, a door handle, a gadget of some description -- everything, by foreign standards, is loss-making, and elsewhere they simply would not undertake to do this because, according to that system of accounting and price structure, it is not profitable. Our reformers, of course, knew that the economy was "distorted," but they did not understand the most important thing: So monstrous is the extent of this distortion that no monetarist methods, no financial manipulations will aid "recovery" here. Yes, a rigid monetary and credit policy was essential. But at the same time, institutional changes concerning the infrastructure of the market, property, and so on were also required. This sort of thing cannot be done in a month, nor in three months. Without understanding all this, they tried overnight, and without pause for thought, to combine incompatible systems, and the result was the destruction of the economy.... [Golovachev] Do you believe that there was an alternative route to the market? [Saburov] It is not just that I believe this, but economic theory and the experience of other countries indicates this. To be brief, it was necessary from the very outset to apply a well-known tactic which is called "Go and Stop, Stop and Go." That is, to go part of the way, stop, adjust, and then move on. It is easy to see that we are talking about a gradual, more harmonious restructuring of the economy. Take, for instance, the fact that the correlation of prices has altered. The price structure is, indeed, different, but it is still far from the foreign mold. Now the economy must be given a chance to adapt to these new prices, and specific structural changes in industry must take place.... [Golovachev] This is all very well in theory. But what about in practice? Prices were deregulated 2 January 1992, and they took off [oni i poshli]. So what you are saying to them is -- stop, take time to adapt, and then we will move further.... [Saburov] But why just talk when it is essential to act? It is necessary to conduct reforms on the basis of a pact of national accord. All social forces should agree on price reform, and on the most important stages. A situation whereby certain sectors, enjoying a monopoly position and the fact that it is impossible to manage without their products, pump up prices, profitability, and earnings for their workers while other sectors end up in a state of collapse and impoverishment -- this is not what it is about at all. To avoid this, it was essential from the very outset to agree a restriction on the transition period for income growth, a restriction on profitability, and a number of other important things (including the "currency anchor," that is, smoothing out the fluctuations in the ruble rate against the dollar). I am speaking precisely of a voluntary, conscious agreement, because you will achieve nothing through an order "from above." For 70 years directors learned how to deceive all controllers, how to get around any rules. So what is needed is self-regulation (within sensible, agreed frameworks) under the eye of the state. This will help to slow down inflation, and to render the process manageable. But the reformers embarked on quite a different path. You will remember the declaration of market prices and market wages. This was a splendid slogan, but a profoundly erroneous approach. The market does not exist yet, and market regulators do not operate -- that is, prices will not be balanced by the market, but "blown off course," and wages for some will be enormous while for others they will be miserly. A sizable wage, like an engine, will ultimately create a momentum in its wake, dragging along with it the salaries in other sectors -- and an inflationary spiral is guaranteed. In the majority of countries which have attained success in the economy it is obligatory at a specific stage to implement sensible restrictions on the growth of incomes and profitability. This, incidentally, was one of the fundamental points of Balcerowicz's program in Poland. But in Russia, for some reason, they decided to be "cleverer" than all the rest. Today, we are reaping the results.... [Golovachev] But how is it possible to restrict income even further, when one-third of the country is already on the poverty line? [Saburov] This is precisely the result of the fact that there was no well-conceived incomes policy, there were no restrictions: some sectors "got fat," and others are on the brink of extinction. Of course, the "Stop and Go" tactic -- with its pauses, its delays -- will not be ideal. But the economy needs a breather, it needs time to adapt. It is better to move slowly but surely toward a goal than to charge at something head on and find yourself in a dead end. Obviously, the former is far harder: It requires daily, difficult, and painstaking work, great skill, and professionalism -- and not only in the economic sphere but also in the sphere of management. However, the road to success is never easy.... [Golovachev] Okay, what is done is done. But how do we get out of the crisis today? Nonpayments have almost paralyzed the economy. If you print a heap of money, you will present enterprises with hyperinflation. If you do not, the result is a financial clinch, production stoppage, and mass unemployment. What is the solution? [Saburov] Indeed, it is always harder to extinguish a full-blown conflagration than a small fire. But we must not, of course, lose heart. Right now it is essential to steer the ship with particular caution and the greatest of dexterity. Credit must be issued very sparingly -- by no means to everybody -- and for specific projects (not flimsy "rough sketches," but genuine business plans.) Moreover, it should be issued under strict controls. And there should be urgent talks between the government and the sectors, and between sectors and the various social forces, on the new "rules of the game": a temporary restriction on income growth, profitability, and so on. A great deal depends upon the professionalism of the government -- it must come out with very precise, specific proposals, so that it is clear what needs to be agreed.... [Golovachev] In your view, is the economic situation in Crimea better or worse than in Russia? [Saburov] Worse, of course. A lot worse. There are bread lines, there is poverty, electricity is cut off for long periods at a time, health sanatoriums are not heated.... [Golovachev] Can you employ in Crimea the "Stop and Go" tactic and other recommendations you have mentioned? [Saburov] It is difficult to compare conditions for the pursuit of reforms in Crimea and Russia. There is no Central Bank in Crimea, and the Crimean Republic on its own is in no position to rein in the devaluation of the currency (although we will, of course, try to exert influence, pressure if you like, on the Central Bank of Ukraine). Economic instruments in conducting reforms are all we can use, as there are no others. [Golovachev] Will the Russian ruble circulate officially in Crimea? [Saburov] This would be sensible. And to some extent this situation already exists "de facto." However, it is vital to work out mutually acceptable projections. [Golovachev] How much Russian currency will be required? [Saburov] It is hard to say. It is essential to bear in mind that money for investments is one thing, and money in current circulation is another.... But, in general, we could be talking about hundreds of billions of rubles. [Golovachev] Do you intend to bring in foreign capital? [Saburov] Yes, and we will do everything possible to bring this about. It is a matter of approaching banks and entrepreneurs in distant foreign countries, and in Russia. Their activity will be granted most-favored status. This concerns taxes, customs policy, and much more. It is very important to guarantee stability in the sphere of legislation and finances. It is wrong to alter the laws every quarter. If we create attractive, advantageous conditions, capital will come flooding into Crimea. After all, this is a prosperous region, one of the best resort locations, and it has considerable industrial, scientific, and agricultural potential. Particular attention will be given to creating new and maintaining existing jobs, revitalizing sanatorium facilities and local industry, producing competitive goods, and developing the vacation industry and tourism.... [Golovachev] You talked to Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin a few days ago. What was your conversation about? [Saburov] It was about the need to restore economic links between Russia and Crimea, the possibilities for more extensive Russian interest in vacationing in Crimea, and other questions. [Golovachev] Nowadays only millionaires can take a vacation in Crimean health sanatoriums..... [Saburov] But why? There are Russian enterprises which pay for trips (either completely, or in part) and send their workers to Crimea. Moreover, this is cheaper than flying to Miami, where, as TRUD reported, Russian oil workers are taking their vacations. At the same time, there is quality medical provision available in Crimean sanatoriums, which you cannot get abroad. [Golovachev] A few days ago, an official in Kiev announced that a citizen of another country (that is, you) cannot be prime minister of the Crimean Government inasmuch as a foreigner should not be given access to state secrets.... [Saburov] This is simply ludicrous. What state secrets are there in Crimea? A ravaged economy? People have known about that for a long time.... And what kind of "foreigner" am I? I was born and raised in Crimea, and I have never considered myself to be a "foreigner" there. [Golovachev] When do you leave for your new job in Simferopol? [Saburov] In the next few days. [Golovachev] Now for a few purely personal questions. Are you a religious man? [Saburov] Yes. [Golovachev] I was told that you were christened by Father Aleksandr Men.... [Saburov] This was a great moment for me. Incidentally, this happened in 1968 -- at a time when the official authorities did not look upon the church particularly favorably. [Golovachev] You realized, of course, that you would no longer be able to pursue a scientific career? [Saburov] Just what is meant by a scientific career? I knew that I, as a nonparty individual, would not climb any higher than "lab chief" in the institute. This was my "ceiling." But the scientific work I did do was pretty good. [Golovachev] You write plays, poetry. How well do the precise sciences -- mathematics and economics -- mix with the unfettered imagination without which poetry is impossible? [Saburov] They mix very well. Poetic thinking is very specific. The poet sees not simply a bird but something quite specific -- for instance, a white crane, sitting in a nest. On the other hand, economics is a very "creative" science. Indeed, is it a science at all? So in this sense I can see a combination, a harmony of interests, and not their differences. Incidentally, many poets in the pre-Soviet era occupied government posts.... [Golovachev] And one final question. How do you view the future -- more with optimism, or with pessimism? Will we get ourselves out of this rut without bloodshed, and without concentration camps? [Saburov] We have to. People have become highly resistent to "blood and concentration camps." And you cannot reverse the course of history. We are merely required to make fewer errors. Right now, an acute shortage of common sense and professionalism is seen in the conduct of the reforms. But I am convinced: Common sense will triumph, and good will be victorious....
