FR940302-2-00039 FR940302-2-00025 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;139&hyph;000] Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co.; Notice of Request Under Blanket Authorization February 24, 1994. Take notice that on February 18, 1994, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company (Williston Basin), filed a request for a one-time waiver of the requirements of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1 (tariff), so as to allow any shipper to change its method of fuel reimbursement effective April 1, 1994. Williston Basin states that its tariff allows shippers to change its election of the method to be used to reimburse Williston Basin for fuel use, lost and unaccounted for gas on the dates Williston Basin revises its fuel reimbursement rate (February 1 and August 1 of each year) pursuant to Section 38 of the General Terms and Conditions of such Tariff. Since this was the shippers' first opportunity to make such a change in its election and due to certain shippers' confusion over the implementation dates of the fuel reimbursement election, Williston Basin herewith seeks a one-time waiver of its tariff requirements to allow any and all shippers the one-time opportunity to change its method of fuel reimbursement effective April 1, 1994. Any such changes made effective pursuant to this waiver would be effective from April 1, 1994, forward until changed in accordance with Section 38 of the General Terms and Conditions of Williston Basin's Tariff. Williston Basin will post this one-time waiver of its tariff on its Electronic Bulletin Board and notify each shipper via written correspondence. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before March 3, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A. Watson, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4711 Filed 3&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
