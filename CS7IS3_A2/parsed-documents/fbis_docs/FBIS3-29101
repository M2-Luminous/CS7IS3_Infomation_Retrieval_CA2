It said: "The meeting of the presidential council of the WFTU bitterly denounces all the moves of the imperialists against the DPRK and holds that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be solved peacefully through the DPRK-U.S. talks, not by pressure or threat. "The meeting expresses full support and solidarity for the Korean workers and people in their struggle for reunifying the country through confederacy based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments in accordance with the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity."
