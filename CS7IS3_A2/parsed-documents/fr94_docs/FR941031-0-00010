FR941031-0-00010 FR941031-0-00003 A Committee implemented merchandising incentive program promotes the consumption of California raisins in foreign markets. For various countries, cash rebates and advertising/promotion incentives are offered to qualifying importers. Funds used to pay the incentives are derived from reserve pool sales. The Committee's MPP match of $2,239,775 will be made up of $1,249,775 in Committee domestic and overseas administration costs and $990,000 in industry market promotion funds. Domestic administration costs include $283,560 in employee salaries and benefits and $252,215 for MPP overhead costs. The overhead costs include expenditures for Committee staff to travel overseas ($100,000), Committee delegation trips ($50,000), rent ($28,500), insurance ($1,600), telephone ($7,500), postage ($6,000), office supplies, ($2,500), repairs and maintenance ($2,000), audit fees ($15,000), local travel ($3,000), equipment ($5,000), and miscellaneous expenses ($31,715). The overseas costs of $714,000 include funding for the Committee's overseas marketing representatives and their staffs for nine countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, China, and Hong Kong). The costs include salaries and benefits, travel, office rent, office supplies, utilities, and postage. The representatives will handle the administration and day-to-day details of the marketing activities conducted in these countries. The domestic and overseas administrative and overhead costs for the MPP will be paid with handler administrative assessments and reserve pool proceeds. Most of the major expense items for the MPP (employees salaries and benefits, domestic and overseas travel, and office rent) will be shared equally between administrative and reserve pool funds. A total of $1,442,325 is presently available for the Committee's merchandising incentive program. Of that amount, a total of $990,000 will qualify for the MPP match. The Committee plans to use these funds for authorized promotion activities in Japan. The Committee unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $4.00 per ton, which is $2.20 more than last year. This rate, when applied to anticipated acquisitions of 331,000 tons, will yield $1,324,000 in assessment income, which will be adequate to cover anticipated administrative expenses. Any unexpended assessment funds from the crop year are required to be credited or refunded to the handlers from whom collected. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers and producers, the costs on handlers are in the form of uniform assessments, and those on producers will be shared equally by all equity holders in the 1994&hyph;95 reserve pool for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the crop year began on August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the crop year apply to all assessable raisins handled during the crop year; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and it is similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 60-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.
