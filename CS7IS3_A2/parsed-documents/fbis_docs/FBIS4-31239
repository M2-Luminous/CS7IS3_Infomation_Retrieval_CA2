FBIS4-31239 "dreeu109_p_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-109 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 POLAND Poll on Implementing Government Promises Poll on Implementing Government Promises WS0606150294 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 6 Jun 94 p 7 WS0606150294 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA Polish BFN [Article by A.Sl.: "Public Opinion Research Institute for RZECZPOSPOLITA on Inflation, Wages, and Unemployment; Faith in the Government Increases Along With Incomes"] [Text] Only 20 percent of adult Poles believe in the government's promises that inflation will be decreased to less than 10 percent by 1997 and that the number of unemployed will be limited to 2.7 million people. Slightly more--27 percent--believe that the real wages will be rising at the announced rate of 1.5 to 2 percent a year. These are the results of a poll carried out by the Public Opinion Research Institute [PBS] in Sopot. People with higher education more frequently than others believe in the plans for decreasing unemployment and increasing real wages (23.5 percent and 34 percent, respectively). However, they are least convinced about the promises of limiting inflation (17 percent). Generally, the research suggests that various social, professional, and age groups have extremely varied views regarding the wage increase and unemployment limitation. Opinions concerning the lowering of inflation are similar. It is also difficult to say that one group trusts the government promises more than other groups do. Least skeptical about the promise of decreasing inflation are people employed on farms (25 percent believe in it), and about the promise of limiting unemployment--the employees of private companies (25 percent believe in it). The promise concerning higher real wages convinces the budget sphere the most (36 percent). The material situation does not greatly influence opinions concerning inflation. However, there is a certain pattern in the evaluation of plans concerning an increase in wages: The trust increases along with higher incomes. Among persons with less than 700,000 zlotys [Z] per capita, this trust amounts to only 21 percent; among persons earning over Z3 million, to 42 percent. A similar pattern can be observed in the evaluations of the forecasts concerning unemployment: The optimism increases along with incomes. Most skeptical about an increase in real wages are peasants (18 percent believe in it), and the group that believes in it the most are managers--39 percent. Plans for limiting unemployment seem feasible primarily to private entrepreneurs (31 percent); housewives are most skeptical about it--only 13 percent believe in it. School and university students constitute the group that believes in decreasing inflation the most--23 percent; housewives--14 percent. It is worth noting that each time the greatest number of undecided people is among peasants and farm employees--from 35 to 41 percent. Is faith in the government's promises of a political nature? This question can be answered after an analysis of the results and the political sympathies of the respondents. The government's promises concerning decreasing inflation is least trusted by the supporters of the Confederation for an Independent Poland, the former Liberal-Democratic Congress, and the Center Accord (10 in each case). Those who trust those promises the most are the voters of the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms (as many as 41 percent). For the sake of comparison, among the supporters of the governing coalition--the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance--faith in limiting inflation is 22 and 24 percent, respectively. Supporters of the Union for Real Politics and of the Coalition for the Republic are those who most strongly believe in plans for limiting unemployment. Voters of the Labor Union believe in this promise the least. The research was conducted by PBS in Sopot on 14 and 15 May on a 1,010-person representative sample of adult inhabitants of Poland. In line with the government's plans, in 1997 inflation is supposed to drop below 10 percent. Do you believe that the government will put its plan into effect? 60 percent--No, I do not. 18 percent--Yes, I do. 22 percent--It is hard to tell. The government claims that real wages will increase by 1.5 to 2.5 percent a year in the coming years. Do you believe that the government will put its plans into effect? People with not more than Z700,000 per capita: Yes--21 percent. People with Z701,000-1 million per capita: Yes--23 percent. People with Z1 million-1.5 million per capita: Yes--24 percent. People with Z1.6 million-2 million per capita: Yes--31 percent. People with Z2 million-3 million per capita: Yes--27 percent. People with over Z3 million per capita: Yes--42 percent.
