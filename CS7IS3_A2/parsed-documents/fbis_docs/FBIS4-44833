With the help of a new process from the French company Agicom, tools made out of iron, cast iron and steel can now be cold polished. The technique is much more cost effective than the usual [method of] polishing at a temperature of 140ï¿½. Furthermore, the manufacturer can dispense with the strongly alkaline solvent which was previously necessary and required special safety precautions. The tool is immersed in a cold alkaline solution only for cleaning. The actual bath in the polishing fluid is amazingly brief: the process is completed in one to three minutes. Protective rust-resistant and water repellent films can be applied in additional steps. The comparatively small investment costs for the installation of such equipment make polishing castings affordable for the first time to small and medium-sized companies, according to Agicom (13 rue Louis Gameray, F-06300 Nice). Smaller quantities can also be processed at reasonable cost, because the immersion bath always stands ready [for use] and requires less energy than the previous, hot techniques. In addition, the method does not require elaborate safety measures: there is no fear of hot steam which could lead to undesirable side reactions. Finally, it is argued that polishing at room temperature also benefits the tools, which are easily deformed in heat.
