"I welcome the amnesty if it leads to stabilisation of the political situation in the country", Barannikov was quoted as saying by his lawyer Dmitriy Matveyenko on Friday. Matveyenko, however, told TASS that the former minister understands that an amnesty covers only guilty people and "does not consider himself to be such a man". Barannikov is currently staying at home. He was transferred from prison to hospital because of heart problems and later released on condition that he stays in moscow. The lawyer said his client had been already discharged from hospital and his state of health is satisfactory.
