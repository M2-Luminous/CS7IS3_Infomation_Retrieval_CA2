The paper in an editorial dedicated to the birthday of the great leader President Kim Il-song stresses that the whole history of the Korean revolution is proud annals which have seen the achievement of the perfect unity between the leader and the revolutionary soldiers, between the leader and the people and victorious advance of the revolution based on its might. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: "Since the dawn of our revolution, the Korean communists have been convinced that they could carve out the thorny revolutionary road only under the leadership of the great Comrade Kim Il-song, and have won victories, enduring all ordeals, and lived and fought with everlasting, single-hearted loyalty to him, entrusting their destinies entirely to him." The editorial continues: Since the beginning of his revolutionary activities, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has always believed in the people and found himself among them in leading the revolution, unreservedly displaying the qualities and traits of a great leader of the people. The great leader believes in the people and the latter trust and follow him. The bonds between them are those of kinship between the father and his children; they are so unbreakable that they can withstand any storm and stress and accomplish anything. Thus, the Korean revolution began with the harmonious unity between the leader and the people and has traversed a brilliant course on the basis of its might. The perfect unity between the leader and the people is a mighty strength in resolutely defending the cause of Korean-style socialism. The might of perfect unity between the leader and the people is fully demonstrated in the Korean revolution because it is one living body of common destiny and an integral whole in ideology and purpose. He has always sincerely trusted the revolutionary soldiers and people and regarded their destiny as his own, while the people have absolutely trusted him as the centre and top brain of their lives and resolutely defended him. Still today he is leading the people along the road of socialism, unswervingly assuming responsibility for their destiny, and the people are entrusting their destiny to the party and the leader and fighting with the unshakable resolve to follow them forever. Our people have staunchly fought, taking the immortal chuche idea as their unshakable faith and the only banner of unity since the great leader founded this revolutionary idea. The unity of our people in ideology and purpose is growing stronger because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is constantly developing the chuche idea to perfection. The perfect unity between the leader and the people is mighty because it is being carried forward and consolidated through generations for the accomplishment of the cause of socialism. The vigorous advance of the whole party, the entire people and the whole army closely united behind the dear leader shows that the harmonious unity between the leader and the people, which has been formed and consolidated through history, is being successfully carried forward with eternal vitality. The source of the solidity of our perfect harmony is the great leader's idea of "believing in the people as in heaven." Our perfect harmony based on this great idea will never be broken. The integral whole of the leader, the party and the people has been, is and will remain the lifeline of our socialism and the all- conquering banner. We must make the advance of our revolution a history of the most tight bonds of kinship between the leader and the people, between the leader and the soldiers in the future, too.
