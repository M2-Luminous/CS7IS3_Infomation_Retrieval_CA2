The paper notes that Christopher lacks optimism about the outcome of his upcoming tour even before it has begun. The commentary speculates that this is due to the current situation of the peace process. As the U.S. Administration knows, this process is now backed up against an impasse due to its constant collision with the Israeli position, which rejects the bases and principles of this process as well as the only objective for which this process was unleashed; namely, establishing a real peace based on the literal implementation of the Madrid formula, the relevant UN resolutions, and the land-for-peace principle. AL-THAWRAH adds: If we analyze the Israeli position on this process, we will find that Israel rejects the Madrid formula and bases in order to replace them with another formula that conforms to Israel's expansionist objectives after Israel has discovered that this formula--which seeks a just and comprehensive peace--conflicts with what Israel wants and seeks to achieve through the kind of peace it seeks. Noting the Israeli officials' intransigent positions on Jerusalem, withdrawal from the Golan, and settlements, the paper says: These positions irrevocably confirm that Israel is not seeking a balanced and durable peace; it is only seeking a partial solution that would maintain its occupation of the Arab territories or at least the largest portion of these territories. AL-THAWRAH continues: As long as the set objective of Christopher's upcoming regional tour is to secure a breakthrough on all tracks of the peace talks, it is better for this tour to focus on removing the reasons behind both the stumbling peace process and the tense regional situation. Naturally, all these are caused by Israel in a bid to ensure success for its objectives. Concluding its commentary, the paper urges the U.S. Administration to exert the utmost pressures on Israel in order to make it yield to international will and legitimacy. In another commentary on the same topic, AL-THAWRAH says: Christopher has stated that his tour will remarkably routine, that it will be devoid of any U.S. peace plans, and that he does not expect it to bring any effective detente. These statements remove, in advance, any remaining optimism and dash the hopes for a possible circumvention of the current impasse and deadlock in the peace process or for activating the talks which have stumbled due to Israeli intransigence. The paper adds: Given this new tone, which is in harmony with both the U.S. statements and shipments of financial, military, and political aid to Israel--which reached a peak recently--we must wonder: What interest does peace have in all this? What interest does the U.S. people have in keeping the region volatile, subject to setbacks, and mortgaged to Israeli terrorism and occupation that violates all values and defies all international norms and laws and human rights? Concluding its comment, AL-THAWRAH says: As long as U.S. political decisionmaking is biased toward Israel, and as long as the Security Council resolutions are not implemented, efforts will continue to be a waste of time and peace will not be achieved if the occupied Arab territories and rights are not regained.
