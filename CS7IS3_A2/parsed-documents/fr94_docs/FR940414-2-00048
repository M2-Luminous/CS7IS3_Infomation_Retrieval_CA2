FR940414-2-00048 FR940414-2-00030 [Docket No. 92E&hyph;0133] Determination of Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent Extension; Supprelin 速 ; Correction AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice; correction. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a notice that appeared in the Federal Register of June 2, 1992 (57 FR 23237), that announced its determination of the regulatory review period for purposes of patent extension for Supprelin 速 (histrelin acetate). The document was published with some mathematical errors. The document incorrectly stated, ``FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Supprelin 速 is 2,876 days. Of this time, 1,930 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 946 days occurred during the approval phase.'' It should have stated, ``FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Supprelin 速 is 2,878 days. Of this time, 1,931 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 947 days occurred during the approval phase.'' This document corrects those errors.
