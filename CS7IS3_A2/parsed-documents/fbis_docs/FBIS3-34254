This is due to the fact that the Israeli side is continuing its intransigent stands and policies, which lack a real desire to submit to the principles of international legitimacy. It is well known that the 12th round was held after a four-month hiatus in the Arab-Israeli negotiations during which time many diplomatic efforts and contacts were exerted on the highest official levels in order to get the parties together again at the negotiating table in Washington. Hence, it was logical to believe that the results of this round should come as the crowning achievement of all these efforts and contacts. However, certain things took place during the past two weeks -- the timeframe for this round -- as if the negotiations in Washington were a means in themselves. This was especially the case for the U.S. cosponsor, which exerted intensive diplomatic efforts to hold this round, even if was on the level of chief delegates, in order to keep the peace process alive in spite of Israeli signals that a step down the desired road would not be taken. Moreover, although there is already talk about holding a new round of these negotiations in the middle of this month, we question the usefulness of continuing such rounds, which waste time and effort and whose lengthy sessions will not result in cracking open even a small hole in the wall of Israel's intransigent stand. We also question the purpose of continuing such rounds without any signs that their continuation will serve the interest of peace in the Middle East. As we are already aware that the U.S. stand will continue to be that of an observer rather than an effective mediator, we doubt the use of continuing such a formula of negotiations, even if it takes place behind closed doors and away from the press and the media. This calls for a real review of the current policy of negotiations and an examination of more practical alternatives. Perhaps this would place the Middle East on the track of desired peace rather than the track of negotiations for the sake of negotiations.
