In the interview al-Zandani expressed the Yemeni people's appreciation for the State of Qatar and the brotherly people who proved that they support the right, principles, and unity of Yemen. He said the Yemeni people will never forget this noble and fraternal position of our brothers in Qatar. The brother Presidential Council member said that countries which respect their pledges and agreements, maintain their credibility, and are eager to preserve security and peace are the ones that supported Yemeni unity, and continue to adopt the same position. On the allegations that what is going on in Yemen is a sectarian conflict, Shaykh al-Zandani explained that the Yemenis are one people with one religion, and that there are no sects in Yemen. He said our people lived under the brotherhood of Islam for more than 1,000 years and that colonialism was responsible for dividing the country. As for the sectarian or racial calls, they have been incited by the secessionists in the Socialist Party with the aim of dismantling the unity of the Yemeni people. He said we consider these calls as having foreign political motives and that they are paid for in order to terminate unity, but the secessionists only reaped disappointment. Our Yemeni people and all their groups and governorates are standing against the clique that rebelled against our people and carried weapons in their faces to incite a rift. On the Security Council resolution, he said the government appreciates the resolution and announced that it will deal with the resolution in a positive manner, and will cooperate with the international envoy and the fact-finding mission. He said we are satisfied because the Security Council resolution has tackled the problem as a united political entity that is the Republic of Yemen, and we hope that the United Nations will be able to understand what is going on in Yemen.
