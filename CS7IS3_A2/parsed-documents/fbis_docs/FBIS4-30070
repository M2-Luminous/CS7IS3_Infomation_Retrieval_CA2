Another major Japanese supermarket chain Yaohan International Group headquartered in Hong Kong, opened an outlet in Shanghai in May and has announced it will open 1,000 more outlets in the area from Shanghai to Beijing. However, Daiei is the first Japanese supermarket chain eyeing nationwide operations in China. Learning China plans to give a license for nationwide operations to only one or two foreign retailers, Nakauchi said he recently visited the country and applied for a license. Daiei will pump about 3 billion yen into the planned Shanghai outlet, which is going to be a full-scale supermarket store to serve as a pilot outlet on Chinese soil, he said. Daiei will establish joint ventures with Chinese companies, Nakauchi said, adding that Shanghai is now examining candidate Chinese firms. He said he has not decided on the number of outlets to be opened in the country, although some industry people estimate the number will be around 300. Industry sources said China will decide on a license after seeing how Daiei's Shanghai outlet does. There are competitors from the United States and Europe also applying for licenses, they added.
