Sources from the Liaoning Provincial Planning Committee said that 500 out of the 600 enterprises that have adopted new management systems have improved their economic efficiency. Last year, profits achieved by state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises topped 7.32 billion yuan, 70.6 percent of all the industrial profits achieved in the province. A leading industrial center in China, the province now has 1,263 large and medium-sized enterprises, accounting for about one-tenth of China's total. Most of those enterprises were built during the 1950s and 1960s under a highly planned economy, and had served as a leading factor in national economic growth in the past decades. But many problems in the management systems, plus in many cases their backward conception of the market, had led to lower economic efficiency, economic experts noted. In the transition of the planned economy to a market economy, many poorly-run enterprises were plunged into the red, and outdated equipment rubbed still more salt into the wounds of the state-owned enterprises. Zhao Xinliang, director of the Provincial Planning Commission, said that during the past few years, several new management mechanisms were introduced into state-owned enterprises. Reforms in labor, wage and personnel systems were also carried out. The provincial government has offered financial help to them. More money has been spent on the technical renovation of these enterprises. More than 33 billion yuan was invested in the renovation of 1,800 projects during the past three years. As a result, the renovated projects created an additional output value of 10 billion yuan last year, compared with the pre-renovation period. Tax and profits totalled three billion yuan and export volume reached 180 million U.S. dollars. Zhao said many state-owned enterprises have adjusted themselves so well that they have even started to March toward the international market. They include a large zinc mill in Huludao Island, a tractor plant in Anshan city and an automobile factory in Dandong city. "We hope the province will again become one of the most developed areas in China in 10 to 15 years," said Wen Shizhen, acting governor of the province.
