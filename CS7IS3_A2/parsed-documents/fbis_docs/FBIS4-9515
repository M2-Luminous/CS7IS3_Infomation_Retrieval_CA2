Today, we are returning to additional important items mentioned in the second part of the introductory remarks made by the minister of defense of the Czech Republic, Antonin Baudys. Without a doubt, everyone is interested in what is actually facing the Ministry of Defense this year. Certainly, it will be a time of further progress regarding deep changes of its entire organism. Toward that end, the minister of defense said the following at the news conference: In the Army of the Czech Republic The decisive phase of transforming the Army of the Czech Republic [ACR] will be realized with the reorganization of the Western Military Command and the Central Military Command into army corps commands, the transfer of the 4th Division into a brigade-type structure, and the creation of two tactical- and transport-aviation bases. The establishment of a rapid-deployment brigade will be finalized, as will the establishment of additional (a total of 11) territorial defense brigades. There will be a fundamental melding of the newly organized staffs and military units, their personnel stabilization, and improvements in training. The military railroad components will be eliminated. Legislative, organizational, and social conditions will be created to facilitate the essential increase in the number of professionals, particularly among the group of so-called career soldiers. A military strategy for the defense of the Czech Republic will be worked out and a concept for the development of the ACR through the year 2000 will be prepared. In the Realm of Personnel Work and Education Principal attention will be concentrated on personnel support for the transformation of the ACR, accompanied by the assertion of principles of the concept of personnel and social policy of the Ministry of Defense. The personnel policy and social support for military personnel will be legislatively assured. There will be a transformation of the military education system and a gradual realization of the concept of scientific work within the ACR. Attention will be focused also on assuring quality training for the Army sports representatives at the XVII Winter Olympic Games (ZOH). In Terms of Financing and Logistics and Ministry of Defense Economics The following principal tasks evolve from the concept of transforming the ACR and the method involved in the introduction of the PPBS [Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System]: - Preparation of the budget for 1995 in its program composition. - Definition of decisive acquisition projects. - Transition to double-entry bookkeeping, with a deadline for realization of 31 December 1994. - Creation of military financial offices and logistics structures, including appropriate information systems. - Consistent adherence to koruna controls during the transition period. - Working out a uniform materials catalogue, working out standards and financial standards. - Disestablishment of military construction battalions. - Privatization of state enterprises. - Transformation of military spa and recreational facilities. - Transformation of the military-scientific base. In Matters of Civil Defense The reorganization of control organs of civil defense, of civil defense formations, will be finalized, as will the integration and material support of executive elements of civil defense into regional and local rescue systems; a civil defense logistics base will be created. Principles of a civil defense law will be worked out for discussion within the government, and appropriate standard operating procedures for directing civil defense will be worked out as well. Cooperation with neighboring countries in resolving civil defense problems and the elimination of the consequences of disasters and catastrophes that transcend national borders will be assured. The establishment of an information system for civil defense as a component of the national information system will be finalized. In the Area of Foreign Relations The principal tasks in 1994 will be concentrated on the following activities in solving tasks in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: - Actively participate in the NATO Partnership Program for Peace and still further deepen the bilateral contacts between the ACR and NATO member countries and neighboring countries; set priorities for ACR collaboration with specific armies. - Prepare a proposal for the concept of ACR participation in peaceful operations sponsored by the United Nations and the CSCE, to be submitted for discussion to the government and the parliament of the Czech Republic. - Prepare directives, regulations, and international ministerial agreements for the realization of military exercises at the international level, for the establishment and training of units preordained to participate in peaceful operations (this stems from the agreement on the Partnership for Peace and from the establishment of so-called standby forces of the United Nations). - Prepare courses for military inspectors of verification centers at Komorni Hradek and an international NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council] for members of peacekeeping forces at Cesky Krumlov. - Prepare to mount a UN peacekeeping battalion for Yugoslavia and carry out its rotation in April and November. - Support the training of military observers, their rotation in existing missions, and their dispatch according to the requirements of the government (Ministry of Foreign Affairs). - Fulfill tasks stemming from the realization of the KOS [expansion unknown] agreements in Europe and the treaty on open skies. - Improve the quality of language training and specialized training for members of the ACR. - Work out annual exchange and statistical information according to the KOS agreements, the VD-92, and the treaty on open skies and the newly adopted recommendations stemming from the meeting of foreign ministers of countries that are signatories to the CSCE in Rome. - Continue active participation in negotiations of the CSCE, the KOS agreements, negotiations regarding open skies, and in other international security forums. In the Area of Command and Control Stabilize the new system of control at the level of the Ministry of Defense and the ACR, clearly outlining jurisdictions and personal responsibilities and creation of the necessary room for initiative solution of tasks at all levels of command. Deepen the effectiveness of control, focused from the level of the Ministry of Defense, on the course of the transformation of the ACR; adherence to basic human rights and freedoms with respect to soldiers and focused on economic control. In the legislative area, focus on working out proposals for laws that were begun in 1993, bringing them to the level of principles, and focus on reevaluating internal ministerial standard operating procedures in harmony with the changes that have occurred within the ministry. In military counterintelligence, orient activities toward specifically improving intelligence protection for the ministry as well as the Army, concentrate on improving the results of work and on personnel and technical support for this service. * * * At the press conference, the minister of defense also responded to questions by journalists. We present two of them below: [Journalist] In recent times, I have noted that not only journalists, but also professional soldiers are expressing high criticism with regard to the situation in the Army.... [Baudys] I believe that it is not abnormal for me to be criticized by professional soldiers. This tends to indicate that something is beginning to be in order within the Army. The Army is not such an organization in which a subordinate officer could not criticize a superior. You obviously have in mind the more extensive article written by Colonel Stetka in CESKY DENIK; if I disregard NECENZUROVANE NOVINY, I know of no other public criticism. A number of the remarks made by Col. Stetka are relevant, but, as far as criticism of General Nekvasil is concerned, I am afraid it is not based on objective facts. I do not reject criticism by soldiers, no matter what rank they may be--I would be opposed to myself. My effort is to have the Army be functional, and that is why I must listen to all voices. [Journalist] A year ago you stated that those officers who agreed with the occupation by the Soviet military on our territory had committed treason. Do you still hold that opinion today? If so, how did that view manifest itself in the directives governing the extraordinary evaluations, as well as in their practical implementation? [Baudys] I have not changed my view. However, the facts are such that not all dossiers contain supplemental biographic data that contain this fact. Taken through to its consequences, I would most likely, or rather certainly, have to say that, as of 5 January 1993, we are dissolving the Army and are beginning to create it completely anew. Those who did not agree with the occupation represent a negligible quantity. Your question, which is put in a highly categorical manner with a great deal of moral conviction, could thus have only a single consistent answer--the dissolution of the Army. But it is a question of discussion as to whether we would be capable of creating a new functional army within such a historically short period. If someone signed to indicate he agreed with the occupation, this does not mean that he is not prepared to defend his country despite the fact that, from a moral standpoint, I continue to believe that this was treason. I did not decide to dissolve the Army; after all, it is not even within my jurisdiction to do so--and, consequently, it was not even reflected in the appropriate order.
