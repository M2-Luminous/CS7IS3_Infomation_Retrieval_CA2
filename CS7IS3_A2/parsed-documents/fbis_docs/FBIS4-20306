CPC committee secretaries, commissioners, mayors from all the province's prefectures and cities, leaders of provincial departments, county CPC committee secretaries and county magistrates from all counties, as well as leaders of all prefecture and city bureaus, committees, and offices concerned attended the conference. In his report, Sun Wensheng emphasized several points concerning the province's economic work and reform tasks for 1994. First, he spoke about economic work during 1993 and the current situation in the province. He said that in 1993 new achievements had been scored in economic construction, reform and opening to the outside world, and work in all regards. These were manifested mostly in the following: 1) Sustained and rapid growth of the national economy, with across-the-board growth of the three major industries. According to preliminary estimates, the province's GNP for the year reached 62 billion yuan, an approximately 12 percent increase over 1992. The rural economy saw all around increase. Gross output of grain reached 9.902 billion kilograms, up 15.4 percent from 1992 and exceeding the all-time high. Township and town enterprise gross output value increased by more than 70 percent. Industrial gross output value for the year (not including industries at the village level and below) totaled 62.6 million yuan, up 11 percent from 1992. Tertiary industries grew very rapidly. Social commodity retail sales were up 14 percent over 1992. 2) The "three constructions." In the important project construction realm, as of the end of November, cumulative investment in capital construction in the main areas of energy, transportation, communications, water conservancy, and raw and processed materials production totaled 8.81 billion yuan, and investment in technological transformation totaled 2.62 billion yuan. This was a respective 37.3 and 34.6 percent increase over the same period in 1992. 3) Results were achieved in macroeconomic regulation and control, marked improvements occurring in finance and banking and fiscal revenue procedures. Overly rapid rise in prices was held down, and the province's fiscal revenues for the year totaled 6.7 billion yuan, up 16 percent from 1992. 4) The intensity of economic system reform increased, substantial advances being made. The 14 business decision making rights were substantially applied in most enterprises. Pilot projects for the transportation of operating mechanisms moved ahead smoothly in 100 large- and medium-sized enterprises, the number of enterprises instituting internal "three systems reforms" totaling more than 3,000. The number of share system enterprises increased from 64 in 1992 to 260 in 1993, the amount of equity capital totaling 3.5 billion yuan. The Fenjiu Share Corporation's open issuance and listing of share succeeded. Joint stock system enterprises proliferated in cities and in the countryside throughout the province. 5) Achievements in opening to the outside world to bring in and use foreign capital were rather outstanding. Eight economic development zones are operating in the province. The four province-level development zones in Taiyuan, Datong, Changzhi, and Fenglingdu signed 220 project contracts for a total investment of 1.5 billion yuan. The province's foreign trade exports earned a total of $634 million, up 9 percent from 1992. 6) Heartening advances were made in linking scientific and technical education to the economy, the enthusiasm of scientific and technical personnel for making a contribution on the main battlefield of economic construction finding further expression thereby. The provincial CPC committee and government publicized the experiences of Yangquan, Jincheng, and Luliang prefectures in linking "agriculture and scientific education." Despite a funds shortage, funds were appropriated for the payment of special technical vocational allowances to highly qualified intellectuals, and to increase the wages of middle and primary school teachers. 7) The income of both city and countryside residents further increased, peasant per capita net earnings exceeding the 70 to 80 yuan increase set at the beginning of the year. The per capita income available for living expenses of city and town residents reached 1,680 yuan, an 18 percent increase over 1992. Peasant per capita income was 718.33 yuan, up 14.6 percent from 1992. Second, in talking about economic development goals and the work emphasis for 1994, acting provincial governor Sun said that in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Fourteenth Party Congress and the plenary session of the provincial CPC committee, the guiding thought in the province's economic work during 1994 is as follows: to take the building of a socialist market economic system as the goal, to seize new opportunities for reform and development, to blaze new trails in the enterprise system, to expand the opening to the outside world, to accelerate structural readjustments, to promote technological progress, to continue the further building of the "three foundations," to strive to improve overall economic returns, to improve further the people's livelihood, and to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development throughout the province. By way of following this guiding thought, the provincial government has preliminarily set the main economic development goals for 1994. The provincial CPC committee and the provincial government believe that attainment of these goals requires adherence to the "three principles," and close attention to the "five tasks." The first of the three principles is to give priority to economic returns. Attention to economic returns is necessary to the operation of a market economy. With reform of the taxation and finance and banking systems, and commercialization of the specialized banks, a large number of not well run enterprises making poor returns are facing a grim situation in which the banks provide no loans, the treasury provides no refunds, and there are no tax reductions or exemptions. Unless they improve their earnings, they are in danger of having to halt production or close their doors. This may give rise to social problems. Therefore, the more the market economy develops, the more the main emphasis in economic work must be on improvement of economic returns. The second of the three principles is making scientific and technical progress first. With reform of the investment system, enterprises will increasingly become main investment entities. If they continue to follow the old road of expansion rather than internal improvements, not only will finding the money for construction become the greatest problem, but existing concerns -- particularly old concerns -- will be unable to carry out technological transformation. The most direct and effective means to promote scientific and technical progress is to speed up the technological transformation of existing enterprises, applying new techniques to the creation of new technologies for the development of new products and improve the inherent quality of products. The third of the three principles is balanced and coordinated development. The essence of the development of a market economy is effective exercise of the market's role in the allocation of resources. It cannot be denied, however, that a market economy operates blindly in some respects. When market signals are distorted, in particular, a rush headlong into mass action, redundant construction, and blind competition are most likely to occur. In Shanxi Province, pronounced problems exist in the production, sale, and transportation of coal. Beginning now, governments at all levels must pay close attention to the adoption of policies to provide guidance and needed organizational coordination measures to ensure that output is based on sales and on transportation capacity. Next, acting governor Sun talked about close attention to the "five tasks" in building the province's economy during 1992. The first of the five tasks is to make increase in peasants income the main goal, making a major effort to develop the rural economy. The main tasks in the province's rural work during 1994 are as follows: to carry out the spirit of the central government's rural work conference, to buttress the basis position of agriculture, to readjust the province's industrial structure, to increase the peasants' income, and to advance all-around development of the rural economy. Leaders at all levels must pay close attention to agriculture, to the peasants, and to rural problems. They must use the spirit of the central government's rural work conference as a vehicle for unifying thinking. Peasant enthusiasm must be rallied, protected, and brought into play. The key issue is paying a high degree of attention to the peasants' interests, doing all possible to increase peasant income. Township and town enterprises must be developed further. Attention must be given to linking the development of township and town enterprises with the development of three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, private enterprises, and cooperative share enterprises, to linking readjustment of the rural industrial structure and development of high yield, high returns, premium quality agriculture, and linking improvement of the socialized services system and the integration of trade, industry, and agriculture. The second main task is emphasizing readjustment of the product mix and the industrial structure to hasten industrial development that improves economic returns. Improvement of economic returns and the technical level must be the goals. The future readjustment focus and development orientation of existing enterprises must be spelled out while simultaneously providing active support to the development of new industries and dominant industries. Investment in fixed assets must be prudently redirected, investment in technological transformation increased, investment in some redundant construction and low returns capital construction projects curtailed, the scale of investment in some projects cut back, and priority given to ensuring urgently needed enterprise technological transformation. An enterprise research and development system must be established and strengthened, more attention given to translating research into production. High technology industries must gradually become a new growth point for the province's national economy. The third main task is liberalizing policies to accelerate development of tertiary industries. We must make sure that the state, collectives, and individuals rise together. Specifically, we must use policy guidance for the vigorous development of the non state-owned component of the economy. The fourth main task is continued close attention to the building of key projects and infrastructure. The province's key projects and infrastructure constitute the reserve strength for the entire province's economic development. The tasks have been set; now they must be carried out unflaggingly year after year. In capital construction, energies must be focused on key points. Projects that are inconsistent with national industrial possible, for which market prospects are difficult to predict, and for which no investment is available must be resolutely halted. There can be no yielding on this issue, and positively no vacillation. The fifth task is close attention to fiscal and price matters. A firm hand must be taken on fiscal matters at the very beginning of the year, tax collection and supervision improved according to law to ensure payment of tax revenues into the treasury. At the same time, unnecessary fiscal expenditures must be controlled and held down. The stabilization of prices, and holding down inflation must be given an important place in the economy, the degree of increase in retail prices for the whole year held within 10 percent. Acting governor Sun also set forth requirements for reform in the province as follows: 1) Do a good job of dovetailing work with reform of the national macroeconomic regulation and control system. 2) Strive for marked progress in the six key fields that the provincial CPC committee has set. 3) Transform functions, actively moving ahead with reform of administrative control organizations. Finally, acting governor Sun emphasized that reform and construction tasks for 1994 are very strenuous. Smooth completion of all the 1994 tasks will require that leading cadres at all levels diligently study, update their concepts, rally their spirits, do solid work, improve their sense of urgency, their sense of responsibility, and their sense of mission, and unify and guide the people of the whole province in their efforts.
