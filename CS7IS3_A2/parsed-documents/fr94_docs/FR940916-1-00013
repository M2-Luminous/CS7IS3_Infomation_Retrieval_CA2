FR940916-1-00013 FR940916-1-00004 Similarly, OSHA does not intend its proposal to apply to private vehicles. OSHA has no authority to regulate smoking in cars and trucks used privately or for commuting. The objective of this proposed rule is to protect nonsmoking employees from the effects of passive smoke. Therefore, OSHA also does not intend to limit smoking in any type of work vehicle where the only employee(s) present are smokers. OSHA does not intend to regulate taxis and limousines, which are pervasively regulated by state and local governments. Also, such regulation could pose serious feasibility problems if the proposal were applicable. However, OSHA expects comment on whether the standard should regulate smoking in other kinds of employer-owned work vehicles when nonsmoking employees are present. Similar scope issues arise as to other forms of transportation such as ships, trailers, and busses used as offices, etc. Witnesses may wish to discuss this matter so that OSHA's consideration of the issue will include additional relevant evidence. Some participants have expressed uncertainty as to the extent to which a final standard would preempt state and local regulation of smoking and other indoor air quality issues. It is OSHA's intent that state and local laws consistent with this standard shall remain in effect to the full extent permissible. As OSHA pointed out at 59 FR 16033, Section 18 of the OSH Act expresses Congress' intent to preempt state rules that establish occupational safety and health standards with respect to issues covered by OSHA standards, unless the state rules are part of an approved state plan. But Section 18 does not preempt state or local laws of general applicability that do not conflict with OSHA standards and that regulate the conduct of workers and non-workers alike. See Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Association, 112 S. Ct. 2374 (1992). Such laws regulate workers simply as members of the general public. OSHA recognizes that many state and local governments have enacted provisions designed to protect the health of their residents by addressing indoor air quality issues, including exposure to ETS. Finally, OSHA notes that it proposed that the final standard not take effect until 14 months after its publication. Specifically paragraph (i) stated that the effective date would be 60 days after the date of the publication of a final rule in the Federal Register and that all provisions would be implemented by one year after that date. 59 FR 16038. OSHA requested comment and testimony on whether those dates, or longer or shorter dates were appropriate or whether the start-up dates should vary by provision. 59 FR 16033. Hearing participants may also wish to address whether the start-up dates should vary by type of establishment. Participants have also raised the issue whether the start-up dates for the ventilation provisions of the standard should take account of the contract provisions of leases and the ventilation provisions' impact on lessors and lessees. It has been suggested, for example, that it might be appropriate to relate the dates at which employers must comply with the ventilation provisions to the renewal dates of their commercial leases so that the lessor and lessee may negotiate the financial impact of these provisions. Witnesses may wish to testify further on this issue, including its health implications. OSHA noted in the summary to the proposal that it might be appropriate to publish subsequent Federal Register notices after considering the views presented by the public. 59 FR 15968. OSHA has now received in excess of 100,000 comments and will be receiving extensive testimony at the hearing. In light of the intense interest in the rule, the large volume of evidence presented, and the complexity of the issues, OSHA will carefully consider whether it is appropriate to issue a further proposal in the Federal Register discussing the issues and evidence and giving the public a further opportunity to comment. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 14th day of September 1994. Joseph A. Dear, Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health.
