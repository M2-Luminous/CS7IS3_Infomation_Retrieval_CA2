L.: "The Most Important Thing -- End of the War"] [Text] The European plan for an approach to solving the crisis in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is better and more realistic than the United States' plan and it is good that it prevailed at the meeting in Geneva. Of course, there are bound to be problems, but they can be solved. The most important thing is that this plan envisages the cessation of hostilities, which means the continuation of the peace talks, Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the Serbian republic, told Radio Kragujevac yesterday. Commenting on the declaration of the ministerial council in Geneva, and the proposed division of territory -- 49 percent for the Serbs, 51 percent for the Muslims and Croats -- he said that the Serbian side was ready to correct the borders if functional entities are created, that is, if the quality and quantity of territory are treated equally.
