During an interview by reporters, Qinghai Governor Tian Chengping, who is a deputy to the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], said confidently: "Everybody is talking about opportunities. Qinghai Province is similarly faced with very rare development opportunities." Such opportunities primarily signify that this year's surging tide of reform will breathe new life into Qinghai's economy. Meanwhile, the current NPC session has given the people of Qinghai a profound sense that economic development in west China is commanding growing attention. A review of their past achievements gives the people of Qinghai both gratification and anxiety. In 1993, Qinghai Province topped the 10-billion-yuan mark in two areas, achieving 10.1 billion yuan in total output value of goods and services and 10.2 billion yuan in total industrial and agricultural output value. There were more than 60 "partly or wholly foreign-owned" enterprises. For the people of Qinghai, these figures were not achieved easily. The numbers pale in comparison with those of economically developed provinces. The people of Qinghai cannot but face this harsh reality: they are lagging further and further behind the eastern regions in economic development. In light of this disparity, the people of Qinghai are beginning to reevaluate their advantages and disadvantages. Tian Chengping first touted Qinghai's enviable "resources" in front of the reporters. Qinghai has energy resources. Located in the upper reaches of the Huang He, it abounds in hydroelectric resources, which are mainly concentrated in the Longyang Gorge. Its salt lakes contain vast, high-grade resources. Western Qinghai has ample petroleum and natural gas resources, and its proven natural gas resources are the country's fifth largest. Qinghai is also endowed with abundant nonferrous metals, and flocks of cattle and sheep can be seen everywhere. Why, then, have the people of Qinghai suffered privation while guarding their "gold mountain"? There are many reasons. Qinghai is an outlying province which lacks advanced communications facilities, funds, and skilled manpower. Tian Chengping did not dwell on these problems, though. He maintained: Although Qinghai must improve these conditions for the sake of economic development, its most important task is to change its concepts and move quickly to foster new notions, ideas, and thinking suited to the market economy. Tian Chengping said: The people of Qinghai must at least change their "mentalities" in the following four areas: 1) They should abandon the concept born of a self-contained, conservative, and self-sufficient small-scale peasant economy, moving quickly to foster commodity and market concepts. Take animal husbandry as an example. They should no longer feel honored by the "large number of livestock in their possession" but should improve the slaughter rate in every possible way. 2) They should modify the concept born of excessive reliance under the planned economy of the past, in favor of a concept that favors competition in the market and independent development. In recent years, Qinghai provided highway construction jobs in lieu of relief, creating a good opportunity for increasing income. The jobs were taken up by laborers from the eastern regions because some local people were unwilling to take them. Instead of helping themselves, these people would rather wait for state relief. 3) They should discard the notion that encourages seclusion, moving to foster a concept that favors opening up in all directions. They should no longer think that they will suffer at the hands of outsiders and lose their benefits to the latter. In any event, we have witnessed appreciable changes in this respect. In recent years, Qinghai established partnership relationships with 14 counties and cities in Shandong by which the two sides exchanged cadres and harnessed their respective strengths for mutual benefit and common development. The practice was very successful. 4) Cadres and people should foster a new concept that encourages bold action to overtake others, discarding the previous notion that a peaceful life will suffice. They should no longer aim for only a moderate level of prosperity, should stop muddling along, and should no longer revert to lounging in the sunshine despite what they think and say. They should truly rouse themselves to action and swim courageously in the ocean of the market economy. At this point, Tian Chengping sounded very excited. This man from northern China had performed brilliantly in Beijing's Xicheng District before being transferred to Qinghai to serve as its governor. He is now working heroically and enthusiastically on the loess soil of Qinghai. He told reporters: On the one hand, we should urge the state to give the western regions preferential treatment in terms of policy and funds; on the other hand, we should liberate our minds, change our concepts, rely on ourselves, and carry out arduous pioneering work. Only by doing so can we push Qinghai's economy onto the path toward prosperity and strength at an early date. At the end of the interview, Tian Chengping said: "Qinghai will not and should not remain poor forever."
