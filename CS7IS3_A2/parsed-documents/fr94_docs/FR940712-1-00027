ACTION: Proposed rule; Supplemental. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (hereinafter the Service) is proposing to establish the 1994&hyph;95 early-season hunting regulations for certain migratory game birds. The Service annually prescribes frameworks, or outer limits, for dates and times when hunting may occur and the maximum number of birds that may be taken and possessed in early seasons. These frameworks are necessary to allow State selections of final seasons and limits and to allow recreational harvest at levels compatible with population status and habitat conditions. DATES: The comment period for proposed early-season frameworks will end on July 21, 1994; and for late-season proposals on August 29, 1994. A public hearing on late-season regulations will be held on August 4, 1994, starting at 9 a.m. ADDRESSES: The August 4 public hearing will be held in the Auditorium of the Department of the Interior Building, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC. Written comments on these proposals and notice of intention to participate in the late-season hearing should be sent in writing to the Chief, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, room 634_Arlington Square, Washington, DC 20240. Comments received will be available for public inspection during normal business hours in room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul R. Schmidt, Chief, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, room 634_Arlington Square, Washington, DC 20240, (703) 358&hyph;1714. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations Schedule for 1994 On April 7, 1994, the Service published for public comment in the Federal Register (59 FR 16762) a proposal to amend 50 CFR part 20, with comment periods ending as noted earlier. On June 8, 1994, the Service published for public comment a second document (59 FR 29700) which provided supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting regulations frameworks. On June 23, 1994, a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, as announced in the April 7 and June 8 Federal Registers to review the status of migratory shore and upland game birds. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these species and for other early seasons. This document is the third in a series of proposed, supplemental, and final rulemaking documents for migratory bird hunting regulations and deals specifically with proposed frameworks for early-season regulations. It will lead to final frameworks from which States may select season dates, shooting hours, and daily bag and possession limits for the 1994&hyph;95 season. All pertinent comments received through June 23, 1994, have been considered in developing this document. In addition, new proposals for certain early-season regulations are provided for public comment. Comment periods are specified above under DATES . Final regulatory frameworks for early seasons are scheduled for publication in the Federal Register on or about August 16, 1994. This supplemental proposed rulemaking consolidates further changes in the original framework proposals published in the April 7 Federal Register . The regulations for early waterfowl hunting seasons proposed in this document are based on the most current information available about the status of waterfowl populations and habitat conditions on the breeding grounds. Presentations at Public Hearing Four Service employees presented reports on the status of various migratory bird species for which early hunting seasons are being proposed. These reports are briefly reviewed as a matter of public information. Dr. John Bruggink, Woodcock Specialist, reported on the 1994 status of American woodcock. Age-ratio information from harvested woodcock indicated that the 1993 recruitment index (ratio of immatures to adult females) was 23.5 percent below the long-term average in the Eastern Region and 11.8 percent lower than the long-term average in the Central Region. Daily hunting success in the Eastern Region decreased from 2.0 woodcock bagged per hunter in 1992 to 1.9 woodcock bagged per hunter in 1993 (&hyph;5 percent). The seasonal-hunting-success index decreased from 9.7 to 7.0 woodcock per hunter (&hyph;27.8 percent). In the Central Region, the daily-success index decreased from 2.4 birds per hunter in 1992 to 2.3 birds per hunter in 1993 (&hyph;4.2 percent), and the seasonal success index decreased from 11.7 to 11.0 woodcock bagged per hunter (&hyph;6 percent). Analysis of data from the Singing-ground Survey indicated that the number of woodcock declined between 1993 and 1994 in the Eastern and Central Regions. Ten-year (1985&hyph;94) trends from the Singing-ground Survey also indicated declining populations. Since 1968, breeding population indices declined 1.9 percent per year in the Eastern Region and 1.1 percent per year in the Central Region. Mr. David Dolton, Dove Specialist, presented the status of mourning doves in 1994. The report summarized call-count information gathered over the past 29 years. Trends were calculated for the most recent 10&hyph;year interval and for the entire 29&hyph;year period. Between 1993 and 1994, the average number of doves heard per route did not significantly change in any of the 3 management units. No significant trend was found in doves heard in the Eastern or Central Units for either the 10&hyph; or 29&hyph;year time frames. In the Western Unit, no trend was evident over the most recent 10 years, but there has been a significant decline over the past 29 years. Trends for doves seen at the unit level over the 10&hyph; and 29&hyph;year periods agreed with trends for doves heard. Mr. Dolton also presented the status of western white-winged doves in Arizona. Whitewing populations declined rapidly in the 1970's, and have since remained relatively stable at a reduced level. In 1993, the Arizona whitewing harvest of 91,000 birds declined 3.7 percent from the harvest in 1992 and was 30 percent below the 1980&hyph;89 mean. The 1994 whitewing call-count survey indicated an 18 percent decrease from 1993. Mr. Dolton then reported on the status of eastern white-winged doves and white-tipped doves in Texas. Results of the 1994 whitewing call-count survey indicated that 615,000 birds were nesting in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Starr, Hidalgo, Cameron, and Willacy Counties. This estimate represents a 40 percent increase from 1993 and is 22 percent above the 33-year average of 501,000. In upper south Texas, more than 577,000 whitewings were nesting throughout a 19&hyph;county area. This is a 20 percent increase over last year's population and marks the sixth year of a population expansion in this portion of the State. West Texas supports a small population of whitewings. The 1994 estimate of 17,000 birds was 10 percent below the 1993 estimate. For white-tipped doves, an average of 0.78 birds were heard per stop in both brush and citrus locations in 1994. This is 30 percent below the 1993 level. Finally, Mr. Dolton presented population and harvest information for band-tailed pigeons. This species is managed as two separate populations: the Coastal Population (California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) and the Four-Corners or Interior Population (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah). For the Coastal Population, the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) indicated a significant decline between 1968 and 1993. However, the population apparently has stabilized in the 9 years from 1985 to 1993. Mineral-spring counts conducted in Oregon suggest that bandtails experienced a precipitous decline in 1973 and again in 1985. Since 1985, these counts indicate that the population has been increasing gradually, but it remains at a lower level than during the 1970's. The 1993 count decreased 1.6 percent from 1992. Washington's call-count survey yielded a 1993 index 44 percent above that of 1992, although this change was not statistically significant. Two indirect population estimates in 1992 suggested that the population ranged between 2.4 and 3.1 million birds. The estimated harvest in 1993 was 6,000 birds in California and 3,200 in Oregon. Washington did not have a bandtail season in 1993. In the Four-Corners area, BBS data indicated a stable population between 1968 and 1993. The combined harvest for all four States in 1993 was 828 birds. This was a decrease of 60 percent from more than 2,000 bandtails harvested in 1992. Dr. Jim Dubovsky, Waterfowl Specialist, presented information on 1994 habitat conditions for waterfowl and preliminary estimates of blue-winged teal abundance and harvests. A video was shown depicting wetland and upland conditions in the Dakotas and the Prairie Provinces of Canada. Generally, nesting conditions were favorable throughout most of the survey area, with abundant wetlands and improved upland cover. Biologists in several regions stated that conditions were the best they have observed since the 1970's. There were approximately 6 million ponds in Prairie Canada and the northcentral U.S. This estimate is significantly greater than the estimate for 1993 and the long-term average. The 1994 May breeding population survey yielded an estimate of 4.6 million blue-winged teal, 45 percent higher than the 1993 estimate of 3.2 million. The 1994 estimate was also 14 percent above the long-term average. The estimated harvest of blue-winged teal during the 1993 September teal season was approximately 134,000 birds, 30 percent below the outcome of the 1992 teal season. The combined September and regular-season harvest of all teal was approximately 1.03 million, 42 percent below the 1985&hyph;87 average. Harvest rates of blue-winged teal remained low during 1993&hyph;94 and were not different from those of last year or the 1985&hyph;87 period. Mr. David Sharp, Central Flyway Representative, reported on the status and harvests of sandhill cranes. The Mid-Continent Population appears to have stabilized following dramatic increases in the early 1980's. The preliminary 1994 spring index for the Central Platte River Valley, uncorrected for visibility, was about 384,850. This index is 52 percent larger than the 1993 index of 253,800. The photo-corrected 3&hyph;year average for the 1991&hyph;93 period was 375,300, which is within the established population-objective range of 343,000&hyph;465,000 cranes. All Central Flyway States, except Nebraska, elected to allow crane hunting in portions of their respective States in 1993&hyph;94; about 19,000 permits were issued and approximately 7,200 permittees hunted one or more times. Compared to the previous year's seasons, the number of permittees increased about 10 percent and active hunters increased 35 percent. About 19,000 cranes were harvested in 1993&hyph;94, a 53 percent increase from the 12,433 harvested in 1992&hyph;93. In Canada, the retrieved harvest fell (51%) from 5,600 in the 1992&hyph;93 seasons to 2,800 in the 1993&hyph;94 seasons. Also, Mid-Continent cranes are hunted in Alaska and Mexico. Data for these areas are not yet available, but the combined harvest should not exceed 3,500 during the 1993&hyph;94 seasons. The total North American sport harvest was estimated to be about 30,200 cranes, which is near (&hyph;5%) the record high reported in the 1990&hyph;91 seasons (31,700), and only the second time the total has exceeded the 30,000 level. Annual surveys of the Rocky Mountain Population, which migrates through the San Luis Valley of Colorado in March, suggest that the population has been relatively stable since 1984. The 1994 index of 17,214 cranes (uncorrected for visibility bias) was near the established objective range of 18,000&hyph;22,000. Limited special seasons were held during 1993 in portions of Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, and resulted in an estimated harvest of 704 cranes. Comments Received at Public Hearing Mr. Charles D. Kelley, representing the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, reiterated the request made by a majority of States in the Southeast to prohibit dove hunting over top-sown wheat and urged the Service to include this prohibition in its final revision of the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR). He also expressed opposition to the proposed inclusion of wounded birds in the daily bag limit. Mr. Ron Stromstad, representing the Central Flyway Council and the North Dakota Game and Fish Department, stated that he appreciated the work of the Service Regulations Committee in developing this year's annual hunting-season proposals. He indicated that the Central Flyway Council looked forward to working with the recently established Mid-Continent Population Sandhill Crane Working Group to revise the harvest strategy for this population. He supported the Central Flyway Council's recommendations regarding the conduct of September teal seasons and emphasized that evaluation of any proposed changes to these seasons should be undertaken on a flyway basis. He supported the Texas request for dove hunting during 3 time periods in the Central and Southern Zones. He appreciated the proposed change in the aggregate bag limit for white-winged doves from 2 to 6 in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. He noted that over the past 3 years, whitewings have expanded their range and populations have grown significantly. In the Rio Grande Valley, numbers are now well above average. With regard to the proposed revision of 50 CFR, he encouraged the Service to proceed slowly in the development of the proposed rule and suggested that the Service continue to work closely with the States. He supported the recommendations from the other Flyway Councils, with the exception of the proposed changes in the woodcock season in Tennessee. He emphasized that the record should clearly indicate that the Conservation Reserve Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is providing secure nesting habitats for grassland-nesting migratory birds. Improved water conditions on the prairies, coupled with the millions of acres of secure nesting cover, will undoubtedly have a significant beneficial effect on this year's recruitment of nesting birds in the northcentral States. Written Comments Received The preliminary proposed rulemaking, which appeared in the April 7 Federal Register , opened the public comment period for migratory game bird hunting regulations. As of June 23, 1994, the Service had received 22 comments; 6 of these specifically addressed early-season issues. These early-season comments are summarized below and numbered in the order used in the April 7 Federal Register . Only the numbered items pertaining to early seasons for which written comments were received are included. The Service received recommendations from all four Flyway Councils. Some recommendations supported continuation of last year's frameworks. Due to the comprehensive nature of the annual review of the frameworks performed by the Councils, support for continuation of last year's frameworks is also assumed for items for which no recommendations were received. Council recommendations for changes in the frameworks are summarized below. General Written Comments: An individual from Minnesota expressed concern that the Service is de-emphasizing waterfowl in terms of habitat, predator control, enforcement of regulations, and support for the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. He noted that waterfowl hunters help pay for management programs through purchase of ``duck stamps,'' excise taxes, and donations to private conservation organizations. 1. Ducks The categories used to discuss issues related to duck harvest management are as follows: (A) General Harvest Strategy, (B) Framework Dates, (C) Season Length, (D) Closed Seasons, (E) Bag Limits, (F) Zones and Split Seasons, and (G) Special Seasons/Species Management. Only those categories containing substantial recommendations are included below. G. Special Seasons/Species Management i. September Teal Seasons In the April 9, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 37830), the Service reiterated that, consistent with the strategy for the use of shooting hours developed by the Service in 1990, shooting hours will begin at sunrise unless States can demonstrate that the impact of presunrise shooting hours on nontarget duck species is negligible. States will be allowed to continue presunrise shooting hours during their September seasons under the condition that they conduct studies or provide information that demonstrates a negligible impact on nontarget duck species during the one-half hour period prior to sunrise. Three States in the Mississippi Flyway (Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana) and five in the Central Flyway (Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico) conducted hunter observations during the 1993 September teal season that demonstrated that the attempted harvest of non-target species was no different between pre- and post-sunrise periods. Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council recommended that September teal season shooting hours begin one-half hour before sunrise to sunset without further evaluation for all non-production Central Flyway States. The Central Flyway Council recommended that the Service review the guidelines for establishing a September teal season for any new requests for seasons. The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that Michigan be permitted to hold an experimental September teal season in southeastern portions of the State. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that September teal season shooting hours beginning one-half hour before sunrise be made operational and that no further evaluation of shooting hours be required. Written Comments: An individual representing a group of duck hunters from Wisconsin expressed concern that some States with a September teal season are allowed shooting hours that begin one-half hour before sunrise. He believes that hunters are unable to identify ducks and that most crippling loss occurs prior to sunrise. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources requested that Michigan be allowed to conduct a teal season in areas where teal concentrate. They proposed limiting the season to no more than 2,000 hunters and believed that hunters' skills at identifying waterfowl are better now than they were during initial evaluations of teal seasons in the 1960's. Four individuals from Michigan supported the proposed September teal season for portions of Michigan. ii. September Duck Seasons A cooperative Wood Duck Initiative undertaken by the Service and the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyway Councils in 1991 is designed to improve banding programs and evaluate techniques for obtaining estimates of breeding population size and production. The Service does not propose to discontinue the September wood duck/teal seasons in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida or expand seasons elsewhere until this initiative has been completed. Furthermore, the Service requests an updated report on these seasons for Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida, by February 1, 1995. These reports should contain wood duck recovery and survival rates, harvest, and the derivation of banded birds harvested during these seasons. The Service has published a strategy concerning shooting hours which indicates that during species-specific duck seasons, shooting hours will begin at sunrise unless States can demonstrate that the impact of presunrise shooting hours on nontarget duck species is negligible. The Service received information from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida regarding the effect of presunrise shooting hours. This information was deemed sufficient to demonstrate a negligible impact of presunrise shooting hours on nontarget duck species during seasons directed at both teal and wood ducks. Therefore, Florida, Kentucky, and Tennessee will be allowed to continue presunrise shooting hours during their September seasons without further evaluation. Council Recommendations: The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that Iowa be permitted to hold a portion of their regular duck season in September to increase harvest opportunity on blue-winged teal. Written Comments: One individual and a petition with 467 signatures requested nine additional days of duck hunting in Wisconsin. The request notes that the efforts of duck hunters, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Ducks Unlimited, and various sportsmen's organizations have resulted in record levels of duck production. The additional nine days of duck hunting would make Wisconsin's season equal in length to certain other States in the Mississippi Flyway that are permitted a September teal season. 3. Sea Ducks Since 1992, the Service has expressed its concern about the status of sea ducks and the potential impact that increased hunting activity could have on these species. In 1993, the Service reduced bag limits on scoters from 7 to 4 within an overall 7&hyph;bird sea duck limit. Although data needed to monitor these species remain less than satisfactory, the Service reiterates its request that the Flyway Councils continue to review the status of sea ducks and complete management plans. States are asked to participate in improving population surveys, harvest estimates, and production indices. 4. Canada Geese A. Special Seasons Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that West Virginia be permitted to initiate a 3-year experimental resident Canada goose season during September 1&hyph;15. The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended modifications to hunt zones for September seasons on resident Canada geese in Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania (Northwestern and Southeastern Zones), and Virginia. These proposed changes would be experimental. The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council made the following recommendations pertaining to special Canada goose seasons: In Indiana, expand the September season hunting area to Statewide with a September 1&hyph;15 framework. The proposed changes would not be experimental. In Michigan, extend the seasons in the northern Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula for 2 additional years and expand the zone in the Upper Peninsula to approximately the eastern half of the Peninsula; change the season length in the southern part of the Lower Peninsula from 10 to 15 days (September 1&hyph;15) for 3 years and include the southern portions of Tuscola and Huron Counties. The proposed changes would be experimental. In Minnesota, expand the Fergus Falls/Alexandria Zone and extend the framework for the 10-day season to September 1&hyph;16 for 3 years. The proposed changes would be experimental. In Ohio, expand the September-season hunting area to Statewide with a September 1&hyph;15 framework. The proposed changes would not be experimental. In Wisconsin, enlarge the size of the Southeastern Wisconsin Zone and continue as a special season with a September 1&hyph;13 framework. The proposed changes would not be experimental. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that the Service closely monitor all Canada goose seasons and fully analyze data from existing special or experimental seasons before expanding seasons that cumulatively might increase harvest of the Southern James Bay Population. Also, current special seasons should adhere to present criteria designed by the Service. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council also requested that a 3-year experimental, 10-day September Canada goose season be permitted in the eastern portion of Tennessee. B. Regular Seasons Council Recommendations: The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the early-season frameworks provide for the opening of regular goose seasons in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as early as September 24. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that the Service closely monitor all Canada goose seasons and fully analyze data from existing special or experimental seasons before expanding seasons that cumulatively might increase harvest of the Southern James Bay Population of Canada geese. The Pacific Flyway Council seeks a limited resumption of cackling Canada goose hunting throughout their range and recommends that the Service provide an expedited review of their recommended changes in cackling Canada goose regulations for impacts on Aleutian Canada geese under the Section 7 consultation process. Written Comments: The Michigan Department of Natural Resources believes that regular goose seasons should be allowed to open as early as September 24 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. They noted that significant numbers of migrant geese begin arriving in the Upper Peninsula during September 20&hyph;24 in most years. They anticipate that harvest in this region would remain small compared to the rest of the State. They also believe that nearly all Canada geese harvested in this region are of the giant subspecies or the Mississippi Valley Population. Finally, they noted that allowing a September 24 opening would provide equitable hunting opportunity compared to other areas because most geese leave this region by early November. The Association of Village Council Presidents, representing Native American interests in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta area, supported modest liberalizations of white-fronted goose seasons in Alaska and Washington. However, they did not support further liberlizations in Oregon or California, noting that liberalizations occurred during each of the preceding years and that it was difficult to measure the effects of these incremental changes. 9. Sandhill Cranes In 1993, the Central and Pacific Flyways completed a revision of the Cooperative Management Plan for the Mid-Continent Population of sandhill cranes. This revision established a goal of a stable population at levels observed during the 1982&hyph;92 period and removed the harvest threshold (25,000) that had been in place since 1981. The Service believes that future management actions for Mid-Continent cranes should be based on the recognition of biologically discrete subpopulations, which would necessitate the development of data collection efforts at the subspecies level. In the April 9, 1993, Federal Register (59 FR 16765), the Service reiterated its concern that overall harvest levels should not be increased and that there should be no increase or shift in harvest toward the Gulf Coast Subpopulation or to the greater sandhill crane component. Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council recommended no changes in the Federal frameworks for the hunting of Mid-Continent cranes during the 1994&hyph;95 seasons. Written Comments: The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department responded to statements in the April 7, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 16765) that indicated that there should be no increase or shift in crane harvest toward the Gulf Coast Subpopulation of Mid-Continent Sandhill Cranes and especially the greater sandhill crane component. They noted that the Central Flyway Council did not propose any framework changes for the 1994&hyph;95 seasons and asked for clarification of the reasons for this concern, especially since the population remains stable. In this regard, they suggested that the Service provide a harvest objective, rationale and method of evaluation of any harvest reduction proposed. Furthermore, the appropriate level of management should be clearly identified, i.e. population, subpopulation, or subspecies level. Biologists working in Texas support management at the population or subpopulation level. They indicated that zoning for the hunting of cranes could not be attempted until these issues had been resolved. 14. Woodcock The Service is concerned about the gradual long-term declines in woodcock populations in both the Eastern and Central Management Regions. Although habitat changes appear to be the primary factor in the declines, adjustment of harvest opportunities may be appropriate in light of current population trends. The Service and Flyway Councils should review the status of woodcock and cooperatively develop a harvest-management strategy. Council Recommendations: The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that Tennessee be allowed to divide the State into 2 zones (East and West) for woodcock hunting. 16. Mourning Doves Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council recommended that Texas be allowed an increase in the number of segments from 2 to 3 in 2 of the 3 mourning dove hunting zones now offered to Texas. 17. White-winged and White-tipped doves In the August 23, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 44581), the Service stated that with continued improvement in the whitewing population in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, serious consideration would be given to a request to increase the number of whitewings in the aggregate bag limit in the special white-winged dove area in 1994 from 2 to 6 during the regular mourning dove season. Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council recommended that the number of white-winged doves allowed in the 12-bird aggregate bag limit during the mourning dove season be increased from 2 to 6 in the Texas Counties of Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, and Willacy. 18. Alaska The Service proposed in the April 9, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 19008-19012) to manage the harvest of canvasbacks based on a single, continental breeding population. The Service does not envision that full-season bag limits of 2 canvasbacks per day could be offered nationwide in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Service proposes to reduce the bag limit in Alaska from 2 to 1 canvasback per day. Council Recommendations: The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that Alaska be allowed no more than 1 Canada goose in the daily bag for Unit 9E and the western portions of Unit 18. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that the Statewide closure on cackling Canada geese be removed. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended removal of restrictive bag limits for white-fronted geese in Units 1&hyph;9 and 14&hyph;18 in Alaska. The goose limit will be 6 daily and 12 in possession, of which no more than 4 daily and 8 in possession could be any combination of Canada or white-fronted geese. Written Comments: The Association of Village Council Presidents, representing Native American interests in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta area, supported modest liberalizations of white-fronted goose seasons in Alaska and Washington. Public Comment Invited Based on the results of migratory game bird studies now in progress and having due consideration for any data or views submitted by interested parties, the possible amendments resulting from this supplemental rulemaking will specify open seasons, shooting hours, and bag and possession limits for designated migratory game birds in the United States. The Service intends that adopted final rules be as responsive as possible to all concerned interests, and therefore solicits the comments and suggestions of the public, other concerned governmental agencies, and private interests on these proposals. Such comments, and any additional information received, may lead to final regulations that differ from these proposals. Special circumstances are involved in the establishment of these regulations which limit the amount of time that the Service can allow for public comment. Specifically, two considerations compress the time in which the rulemaking process must operate: (1) the need to establish final rules at a point early enough in the summer to allow affected State agencies to appropriately adjust their licensing and regulatory mechanisms; and (2) the unavailability before mid-June of specific, reliable data on this year's status of some waterfowl and migratory shore and upland game bird populations. Therefore, the Service believes that to allow comment periods past the dates specified is contrary to the public interest. Comment Procedure It is the policy of the Department of the Interior, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may participate by submitting written comments to the Chief, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, room 634, Arlington Square, Washington, DC 20240. Comments received will be available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Service's office in room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia. All relevant comments received during the comment period will be considered. The Service will attempt to acknowledge comments received, but substantive responses to individual comments may not be provided. NEPA Consideration NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document, ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds'' (FSES 88-14), filed with EPA on June 9, 1988. Notice of Availability was published in the Federal Register on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). The Service's Record of Decision was published on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). Copies of these documents are available from the Service at the address indicated under the caption ADDRESSES. Endangered Species Act Consideration The Division of Endangered Species is completing a biological opinion on the proposed action. As in the past, hunting regulations this year will be designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between seasons for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species. The Service's biological opinions resulting from consultations under Section 7 are considered public documents and are available for inspection in the Division of Endangered Species (room 432) and the Office of Migratory Bird Management (room 634), Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia. Regulatory Flexibility Act; Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 and the Paperwork Reduction Act In the Federal Register dated April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16762), the Service reported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Executive Order. These included preparing an Analysis of Regulatory Effects and an updated Final Regulatory Impact Analysis, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq), and publication of a summary of the latter. This information is included in the present document by reference. This action was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under E.O. 12866. This rule does not contain any information collection requiring approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3504.
