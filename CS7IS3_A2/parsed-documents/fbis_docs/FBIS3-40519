It is a non-profit corporation for public interest, and the successor to Chubu Aerospace Industry and Technology Promotion Conference, which ceased to exist with the incorporation of the other. The new corporation intends to promote various business plans aimed at the realization of ``Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept,'' to realize the project in the very near future. As a start, it will work up a plan for establishing a ``wind tunnel research facility'' and will solicit the central government to bring it to this area, and it will collect related information available from NTIS (U.S. National Technical Information Service), especially in the material science field, and from other sources to build a database to provide the information to the local industries. The following is the transcript of Mr. Kamesaburo Matsunaga's answers to questions regarding future business plans and the like. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: First of all, why was it necessary for the Chubu Aerospace Industry and Technology Promotion Conference, an arbitrary juridical person, to be disbanded to be reborn as the Chubu Aerospace Industry and Technology Promotion Center, Inc.? MATSUNAGA: It has been three years and ten months since the Chubu Aerospace Industry and Technology Promotion Conference was established in October 1989. During that period, (1) it held technology-exchange conferences and symposia in order to familiarize the local industries with aerospace-related technologies and to transfer the technologies to them; (2) it conducted surveys and studies on the technology transfer and the aerospace-related test-and-evaluation facilities; and (3) it solicited the government for national projects (research facilities such as a wind tunnel). While we were busying ourselves in these activities, we began to hear the member companies and the local governments voice their requests for our organization to expand its activities and for the need for our organization to increase its influence on the central government. Upon hearing those requests and opinions, we studied the method of expanding the activities, including the matter of incorporation, at the study committee held in August last year. In June of this year, a meeting of promoters for establishing a non-profit corporation was held, officially initiating the discussions on that matter. The conclusion of the discussions that followed was that what was needed most was to keep the gist of the establishment of the Conference and to further enhance and expand. More specifically, we agreed that it was essential that we do the following: (1) exchange research and offer information in order to acquaint people with and promote aerospace-related technologies; (2) vitalize the project planning and proposal activities, targeting the central government and others (promotion of research activities); and (3) enhance the organization, including the administration office, in order to implement those activities. I believe this will greatly contribute to the formation of ``the central region of industrial technology,'' and to the vitalization of the local communities. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What are the future business plans? MATSUNAGA: In terms of our business plans, we have the following five categories of activities we wish to pursue in order to promote the concentration of the aerospace industry and its research capabilities, as well as the sophistication of related industries, in the Chubu district. We will conduct, first, the surveys and studies, as well as planning, necessary for the promotion of the concentration of aerospace industry and its research capabilities, as well as the sophistication of related industries; second, exchange of research in order to achieve synergistic effects between the aerospace industry and other industries; third, collection and supply of information regarding aerospace industries; fourth, familiarization and educational activities; and fifth, coordination and cooperation with related organizations. During the next two years, in terms of the activities of the first category, we will concentrate our efforts on the following: (1) studies on the preferred format for the information network; (2) project planning regarding the wind tunnel proposed in the Chubu Aerospace Technology Park; (3) surveys on technology needs and seeds; and (4) project planning in the aerospace-related arena. In the second category, we will hold technology-exchange conferences (forums) with limited members on various specific themes. In the third category, we will work on expanding our capability to collect related information available from NTIS (the U.S. National Technical Information Service) and other sources, particularly, on materials science data, in order to build a database to provide the information to the local industries. In the fourth, we will organize lecture meetings and seminars and international aerospace symposia every other year (beginning in 1994), and we will issue an information periodical. As to the fifth category, in the next two years, we will exchange views and information with aerospace organizations in other areas, submit our opinions to the government so that they be reflected in the national policies, coordinate and cooperate with the government and its subordinate organizations, and participate in various related events. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: How are your solicitation activities on national research facilities working out? MATSUNAGA: We believe it is not only necessary, but also more effective to work with local government and economic organizations when it comes to the solicitation activities. Therefore, we think it is more appropriate for this Center to assume the role of a coordinator. Of course, there is a case when it is better that we be the principal player. For example, in terms of the ``wind tunnel research facility'' we have been pursuing as one of the focal points of our own studies since the days of the previous organization, we will continue our activities, carefully watching the move of the central government. In order to achieve the objective in this matter, we will try to collect information from related government branches and their subordinate research organizations through conferences (in Tokyo) and individual visits. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: How do you intend to proceed on the Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept from now on? MATSUNAGA: The concept consists of seven projects: (1) Large Evaluation Test Center; (2) Space Technology Center, (3) Earth Observation Center, (4) National Aerospace Research Facility, (5) Aerospace Information Center, (6) Flight Test Center, and (7) Aerospace Science and Technology Recreation Arena. Of those, the Information Center has already been realized, as the gist of its activities is built into the activities plan of this Promotion Center. As for the other projects in the concept, we will be studying implementation plans and we will move swiftly on to the solicitation activities when the plans are completed; however, we will concentrate on the realization of the wind tunnel research facility for the time being. In addition to the above, we are also evaluating the ``Aerospace-Related Arena'' as a part of next year's survey and study activities. NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: How many members do you have at the moment, and what are the benefits of being a member? MATSUNAGA: We have about 150 full members (consisting of companies, local governments, economic organizations, etc.) and a few supporting members. There are quite a few merits to being a member. For example, the members will be able to have access to NTIS research papers (3,000-4,000 each year) free of charge. The members can meet with various people from industry, government, and academic circles, including people from different industries through various technical conferences and forums. Also, as a member, you can attend the lectures, seminars and symposiums presented by authorities and specialists, and even consult them on specific matters. We are planning to invite authorities to our office as advisors once a week. The members can participate in various field trips and visits to special places, generally free of charge; the members will also receive an information periodical (of the Center). NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Thank you very much for your comments. Address: 3-1-1, Sakae, Naka-ku, Nagoya. [Box] Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept The intention of the Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept is to bring a core research-and-development organization into the Chubu district plus, at the same time, taking advantage of the concentration of aerospace industry, sophisticated machining and assembling technologies, research-and-production technologies on new materials such as fine ceramics, which already exist in this district, in order to form a general research-and-production complex in this district. It also aims at the integration and sophistication of local industries through technology exchange with the aerospace industry, which is an amalgamation of advanced technologies, and, moreover, the creation of new industries based on such advanced technologies in the district. The concept was generated by the Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept Realization Committee of the Chubu Regional Bureau of International Trade and Industry in June 1990. The Chubu district has the concentration of major aerospace technology provided by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawaaski Heavy Industries, and Fuji Heavy Industries, and the output of that industry in this district represents more than half of the national output. It claims a concentration of various world-class frontier industry and research organizations, so that the district has a great potential for becoming the leader of the aerospace industry in the future.
