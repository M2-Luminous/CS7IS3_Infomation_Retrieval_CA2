Ambassador Mondale is scheduled to pay a courtesy call on Governor Ota on 10 April. After receiving his courtesy visit, Governor Ota plans to petition him for the solution of those issues. Director Takayama said: "The Okinawa Prefectural Office heartily welcomes Ambassador Mondale's visit. In fact, we would like to arrange a meeting with him aside from his courtesy call. However, since his itinerary is crammed, we want to call on him to solve the issues immediately after receiving his courtesy visit."
