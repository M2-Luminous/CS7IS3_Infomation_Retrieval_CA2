Rocha said: "The Armed Forces belong to the nation, and they have the constitutional right to be wherever they want to be in accordance with their needs." He said, however, that this does not mean that the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) is not capable of keeping order in the conflictive region of Chapare, in Cochabamba Department. Asked about the alleged formation of irregular groups financed by drug trafficking, General Rocha said that the police intelligence services have not confirmed their presence, but that the situation is being investigated because of the latent threat of criminal groups linked to drug trafficking. He also indicated that the investigation is being carried out jointly with Army intelligence. Answering reporters, Rocha said: "All the actions are of course being coordinated with the Armed Forces." He added that the current situation does not demand an increase in the FELCN presence in the Chapare. On the contrary, he said, there are enough agents there to maintain control over any possible conflict.
