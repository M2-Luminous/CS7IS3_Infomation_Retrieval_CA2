FR940902-2-00146 FR940902-2-00060 The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is necessary because the Exchange has identified the need to attract new specialist units and to retain and encourage existing specialists units to vigorously trade existing options classes as well as to aggressively seek and apply for newly allocated classes. The Phlx understands that for the most part, specialist units can seek specialist privileges or the equivalent lead market maker status for any particular multiply listed options class on other national securities exchanges. Therefore, in order to compete for specialist capital and market making talent with other national securities exchanges which list options, the Phlx believes it is necessary to be able to afford its specialist units with some form of enhanced parity split treatment. Specifically, in order to address these factors, the Exchange has determined to implement this one-year pilot program to increase the specialist's participation in certain trades where the specialist is on parity with one or more ROTs. The Exchange represents that while ROTs provide critical liquidity to the market making process at the Phlx, under the Phlx's specialist system, the role of the specialist is to provide leadership, liquidity, and continuity, and to satisfy market making obligations in multiply listed options classes, particularly at the incipiency of competition for a multiply traded issue. For the options classes that will be eligible for multiple listing, the Exchange represents that specialists have also taken on a larger market making obligation in order to accommodate customers in the hope of garnering critical loyalty that will lead to sustained order flow whether the class is or is not ever actually multiply traded. As a point of clarification, the Exchange states that this proposed rule change will operate in tandem with the enhanced specialist participation provided for new specialist units pursuant to Phlx Rule 1014, Commentary .17. 12 Upon approval of the proposed rule change, a specialist will only be eligible to receive the Enhanced Parity Split described herein once the specialist is no longer eligible for the enhanced treatment available pursuant to Commentary .17 to Rule 1014. 13 12 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34109 (May 24, 1994), 59 FR 28570 (June 2, 1994) (``New Unit Enhanced Split Order''). 13 See Amendment No. 2, supra note 6. Pursuant to Commentary .17 to Rule 1014, new specialist units trading new options classes would be entitled to execute 50% of the contracts in transactions where the new specialist unit is on parity with one ROT, and 40% of the contracts in a transaction where the new specialist unit is on parity with two or more ROTs. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34109 (May 25, 1994), 59 FR 28570 (June 2, 1994). Comment Letter The comment letter received opposing the proposed rule change offered two arguments as to why the proposed rule change is inappropriate. 14 The commenter first argues that the proposed rule is anti-competitive and will ultimately harm public customers by acting as a disincentive for ROTs to make competitive markets. Secondly, the commenter argues that a floor official will be unable to determine whether a customer order is ``disadvantaged'' as prohibited by the rule. He further argues that tracking which options are entitled to the Enhanced Parity Split and which are not will be a difficult chore and that the need for elaborate review machinery to assure compliance with the proposed rule change is evidence that the rule is unmanageable. 14 See Comment Letter, supra note 4. Phlx Response Because this commenter raises the same objections that were raised in connection with the Phlx proposal approved in the New Unit Enhanced Split Order, 15 the Phlx relies on its previous response letter in order to address the objections raised in the Comment Letter. 16 In response to the commenter's claims that the rule will work to the detriment of the trading public, the Phlx believes that the proposal will in fact add liquidity to the market, thus directly benefitting public customers. The Phlx believes the proposal will attract new specialists to the Exchange and will encourage new and existing specialists to make tight markets in their selected options classes in order to attract order flow to the Exchange. The Phlx argues that because every newly listed options class is subject to multiple listing, disincentives are created which discourage specialists from acting as specialists for those new classes of options. The Phlx believes that the Enhanced Parity Split will counteract these disincentives by offering specialists a direct benefit if they are able to attract order flow to the Exchange. The Exchange further believes the specialists will be able to attract this order flow, and thus capitalize on the Enhanced Parity Split, only if they maintain tight markets in their selected options classes. Furthermore, the proposed rule change provides that the Enhanced Parity Split may not disadvantage an order submitted by a public customer. 17 As a result, the Phlx believes that public customers will directly benefit from the proposed rule change. 15 See supra note 12. 16 See File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;29; and Letter from William Uchimoto, Vice President and General Counsel, Phlx, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, OMS, Division, Commission, dated February 23, 1994. 17 See Amendment No. 2, supra note 6. In response to the commenter's claims that market makers are unfairly disadvantaged by this proposal, the Phlx makes several arguments. First, the Phlx disagrees with the commenter's contention that any enhanced split is anti-competitive because a ROT can always establish priority in a trade by improving the market or by being the first in establishing a market that would otherwise be on parity. Secondly, the Phlx argues that specialists have responsibilities and are subject to certain costs that market makers do not have, such as, updating and disseminating quotes, reflecting all market interest in the displayed quotes, and the fixed staffing cost committed to market making in a particular issue whether it is active or not. In order to attract specialist units to the Exchange who are willing to accept these responsibilities, the Phlx believes it is necessary to provide specialists with some benefits that are not available to ROTs. The Phlx believes that any negative impact to ROTs that may be caused by this proposal is more than offset by the benefit to the Exchange and its customers of attracting new specialist units to the Exchange and retaining the services of existing specialist units.
