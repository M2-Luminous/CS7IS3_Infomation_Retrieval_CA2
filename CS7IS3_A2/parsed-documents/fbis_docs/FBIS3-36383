Russians in Tatarstan Worried About Their Fate"] [Excerpts] Talks between Russia and Tatarstan on a treaty formalizing the republic's special status will begin in Moscow today. The two sides will probably agree that Tatarstan, unlike other regions, will become an associate member of the federation. KOMMERSANT-DAILY will report on the results of the talks crowning the post-communist period of tensions in relations between Moscow and Kazan once the talks are completed. At this stage, however, Russians living in Tatarstan are seriously concerned about their fate. [passage omitted] In everyday life, antagonisms between the Russian and the Tatar parts of the republic's population are not so striking and the authorities have been nearly ritualistically appealing to the united people of Tatarstan. It has taken the Tatarstan leadership a great deal of effort, however, to keep the Tatar national movement, which demands a complete break with Russia, within the limits of political correctness. According to observers, now it is less "visible" politicians, but still advocates of Tatarstan's gradual secession from the federation, who are coming to the fore. "On the surface it has really become quieter in Tatarstan, but this is only scenery behind which a gradual removal of Russians to secondary roles is taking place," Yuriy Rostovshchikov, leader of the Social Democrats in Kazan and candidate for the State Duma, told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent. As he put it, this is reflected in the "progressive Tatarization of government." According to the "Russian Federation Citizens" movement, in a republic where Russians make up around 43 percent of the population, Tatars account for 92 percent of government ministers, state committee chairmen, and administration chiefs; 77 percent of Supreme Soviet standing commission chairmen; and 76 percent of rayon administration chiefs. "The trend is such that soon there will be no Russians holding government offices or high posts in industry. Then mid-level chiefs will have to go, too," said Nikolay Borisov, chairman of the Russian National Assembly's Duma. This organization has proposed, among other things, the introduction of a proportional ethnic representation in legislative, executive, and judicial bodies; and a parliament made up of a Russian Duma and a Tatar National Assembly. In observers' view, the slogans of Russian patriots may gain wide popular appeal among Russian residents of Tatarstan. If the plunge in living standards of the republic's Russian population (and defense enterprises with a predominantly Russian work force are beset by economic woes) causes strikes, that same Russian Assembly will find it easy to add nationalist slogans to the workers' economic demands.
