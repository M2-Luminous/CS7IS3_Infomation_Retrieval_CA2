This development, as should have been expected, has drawn a mixed reaction in the republic. Some people welcome the decision, but most citizens are worried, expecting a new, this time even more dangerous surge in crime rates. These worries are far from groundless. According to the Moldovan Internal Affairs Ministry, this year alone the number of crimes involving firearms has almost trebled against 1993. Specialists think that lots of the weapons involved are still kept from the armed conflict on the Dniester in the summer of 1992. Plus, of course, what has been obtained recently on the side by criminal gangs that clash in increasingly frequent bloody showdowns. So, an ordinary person also needs the chance to defend himself, runs the argument taken up by those favoring the open sale of weapons. Yes he does, the law's opponents counter, but such weapons will be too expensive for the ordinary person for a long time to come. Look, a citizen does not have enough money even to pay for his apartment. As a result, the right to armed defense could become an exclusive privilege of the rich. Most important, as readers point out in the local press very frequently, the adoption of such a law will mean that the state recognizes its impotence in ensuring the security of its own citizens.
