Last year alone exports to this region increased by 11.9 percent, while overall exports went down. Even though Japan remained the most important market in the Far East despite its recession and the resulting decline in Austrian exports, deliveries to most other Far Eastern countries also increased. Thus, last year exports to South Korea went up by 50 percent, those to China and Thailand by about 40 percent, to Indonesia by 24 percent, to Hong Kong by 11 percent, and to Taiwan and Singapore by almost 7 percent. Heavy losses had to be accepted in India, however, Prospects for the Future Despite the increase in exports, the share of the Far East in Austria's total exports is rather modest with 5.3 percent. In 1989 it was, however, just 4 percent. Egon Winkler, head of the Foreign Trade Department of the Economic Chamber, told DIE PRESSE that this region is still underrepresented compared with comparable states, such as Denmark, Sweden, or the Netherlands. However, there is the hope that the exports to the Far East will continue to rise this year and in the coming years despite the potential membership in the European Union [EU], because, after all, this is economically the most dynamic area of the world, which has also contributed to the success of domestic exports. However, it was also the losses in Austrian exports to the EU that made the Austrian companies get more interested in the Asian market. Winkler stresses that the programs of his organization have proved their worth in the Far East. The number of Austrian companies in the Far East is rising constantly: At the moment there are about 800 such companies. In 1993 imports from the Far East declined by 2.1 percent, the share in overall imports is 9.15 percent. The Austrian trade balance deficit, however, is gigantic: Exports are only half as high as imports.
