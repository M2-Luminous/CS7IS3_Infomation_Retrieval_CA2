[peace be upon him]. Since June 20, 1981, the people of Iran have been victimized by this terrorist outfit that has always underestimated the resolve and the indomitable spirit of the people of Iran, a spirit that will not allow the MKO to reach its unholy aims. The formation of the so called Liberation Army in Iraq on the part of the MKO at a time when parts of Islamic Iran was occupied by Ba'thist forces was another vain attempt by MKO to get out of the impasse in which they found themselves. Repeated setbacks, including their notorious failure in Mersad operations, caused many of MKO rank and file to be disenchanted with the leadership. Most political observers believe that by targeting the people as they did today they are stepping on the same path as Saddam's regime that victimized the Iranian civilian populace instead of facing the valiant Iranian forces at the front. As a matter of fact the post-revolution history of MKO testifies to the fact that they have preferred to target the innocent people. Just recently, a failed attempt by MKO on the life of Hojjatoleslam Abaie, the Friday prayer leader of Mashhad, was meant to create the same sense of insecurity here in this city. Today's crime in the mausoleum of Imam Reza was a terrorist act for which the MKO is directly held responsible. In addition to the terrorist MKO, their supporters such as Saddam's regime, the U.S., Britain and some European countries who have spared no efforts in supporting the terrorist outfit have to answer to the people of Iran why the innocent people were so butchered today at a mausoleum whose sanctity for centuries no one had dared to violate, a place wherein up to today no one had dared to shed anyone's blood.
