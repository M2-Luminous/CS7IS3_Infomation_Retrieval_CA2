Our ailing economy is graphic confirmation of this. But how are the reforms progressing in the armed forces? What problems are cropping up? Finally, what is the country's top leadership's assessment of them? The president recently delivered a message to parliament "On Strengthening the Russian State." A whole section of it is devoted to an analysis and assessment of the reforms in the Army, to what the Armed Forces are to be like in the immediate future. What is the situation? The reforms in the Army and Navy are going according to plan: in line with the blueprint for the organizational development of the Armed Forces devised by the Defense Ministry, the Law "On Defense," and the defense minister's order. Since 7 May 1992 -- following the president's edict on the creation of the Russian Army -- 11 basic laws regulating the activities of the Armed Forces in the Russian Federation security system and more than 100 normative legal acts have been devised and adopted. Parliament has ratified 14 international treaties and agreements in the military policy sphere. As is known, the organizational development of the Armed Forces has been mapped out in three stages. The first ended in 1992. Its tasks have been resolved. The decline in the level of combat readiness has been halted. Approaches to the creation of groupings of forces and general-purpose forces have been revised. The formation of new groupings has been started in connection with the changes in state borders -- which applies primarily to the Moscow and North Caucasus Military Districts. Not everything has gone as smoothly as one would have liked, perhaps. At one stage it was necessary to adjust certain provisions of the blueprint for the organizational evolution of the Army, in particular those connected with the prospects for its development. The General Staff conducted a careful analysis and adjustment of the Armed Forces personnel in 1994-1995. Not surprisingly, since the reform began the authorized strength has been cut by nearly half a million men (457,000). Three military district directorates, eight Army directorates, one Army corps directorate, 19 divisional directorates, and eight military schools have been disbanded. The process of reducing the number of formations and combined units and higher educational establishments, scientific research institutions, and redundant and parallel management organs continues. The tasks the Army was set for this period were implemented by and large, Colonel General V. Zhurbenko, first deputy chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, believes. The reforms in the Armed Forces have gone according to plan. What now? What can one expect in military policy in the immediate future? Before answering these questions let us stress that the president categorized the further reform of the Armed Forces as a priority state task. "The content of the message gives some confidence that the correct reform path has been chosen," Lieutenant General G. Ivanov, chief of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Military Organizational Development and Reforms Directorate, believes. "The message lays down the main guidelines for the organizational development of the Armed Forces and provides an assessment of the actual state of the forces: They are battleworthy. We saw this assessment as a confirmation of the correctness of the chosen course of army development and improvement." The basic structure of the Armed Forces is clearly going to be preserved until 1996. But if we are talking about future reforms, then the entire complexion of the Armed Forces is probably going to be fundamentally transformed. Which will also affect the operational and strategic levels. Depending on the country's economic potential, of course. What new contours are discernible right now in the structural makeup of the Armed Forces? Let us examine just some of the components. Strategic Armed Forces. An analysis of the status of the Russian Armed Forces showed that in present-day conditions the Strategic Nuclear Forces have been and remain the real guarantor of Russia's security in the military sphere. This was confirmed in the president's message. It is enshrined in the military doctrine and in the blueprint for the organizational development of the Army and Navy. General-Purpose Forces. The nature of Russia's geopolitical position and the reduction of the numerical strength of the Armed Forces demonstrate that it is impossible to have a grouping of forces along the entire length of the border, as was the case before. So their organizational development is based on the principle of mobile defense. Its implementation presupposes the availability of small but sufficiently powerful forces, ready for operational employment wherever a real threat to Russia's security occurs. Mobile forces are being created that are operationally maneuverable and capable of tackling tasks in various regions. Military-Technical Policy. The priorities here include maintaining nuclear security; equipping mobile forces; providing the Army and Navy with modern means of battle command and control, communications, intelligence, and electronic warfare; and improving their reliability and survivability. The Military Law Base. The entire legal foundation of the organizational development and activity of the Armed Forces has to be brought in line with the Constitution and basic provisions of the Russian Federation's military doctrine. Proposals have been prepared on adjusting existing laws in the defense sphere, and around 20 new draft laws will need adopting. In particular, "On Martial Law," "On the Military Police," and "On Naval Vessels." The plan is to give military lawyers the job of providing legal protection for Armed Forces servicemen and civilian personnel. To that end the possibility of creating a body of military lawyers, which we have never had before, is being considered. In other words law, above all, must replace ideology in the Armed Forces. The plan is to complete the elaboration of a blueprint for military law reform by mid-1994. As for the military budget, it has not yet been approved for 1994, unfortunately. Although the Defense Ministry has made all the necessary calculations and they have been submitted to the Russian Federation Finance Ministry and Economy Ministry. The fact is that until very recently the country did not even have a general budget. So financing will be on a month-to-month basis. "Certainly we are not getting everything we need by any means," Major General V. Burov, chief of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Main Military Budget and Financing Directorate Economic Directorate, said. "In January we only managed to provide pay and allowances and wages and tackle urgent tasks. The situation was the same in February. It is clearly not going to be any better in March...." Nonetheless, the president's message does give some cause for optimism. When he delivered it he made it plain that military expenditure is not expenditure on war. This money is used to finance a substantial section of our science, to construct housing for "homeless officers," and to maintain our children serving in the Armed Forces. Today the Armed Forces embark on the second stage of their reform, which will be completed in 1995. I believe that its tasks will be resolved, despite the complex economic situation in the country. The guarantor of this is the state itself, in which the Army remains a very important factor not only of external security but also of the stability of our society.
