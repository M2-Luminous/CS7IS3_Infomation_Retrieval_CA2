FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia W. Silvey, Director, Office of Standards, Regulations and Variances, MSHA (703) 235&hyph;1910. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 2, 1994, MSHA published a proposed rule (59 FR 54855) to establish uniform, due-process procedures for decertifying persons who have been designated as MSHA-approved instructors and individuals certified or qualified to perform certain mining related tasks under the applicable training and safety and health regulations. The comment period was scheduled to close on January 6, 1995. The mining community has requested a 30-day extension of the comment period because of anticipated holiday schedules and the desire of commenters to gather information about States' decertification procedures.
