FR941103-0-00118 FR941103-0-00016 (B) The vertical shear stress generated by a normal operating accelerative force equal to 0.35 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly of a trailer; or the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall; (C) The lateral shear stress generated by a normal operating lateral accelerative force equal to 0.2 times the vertical reaction at each suspension assembly of a trailer, applied at the road surface, and as transmitted to the cargo tank wall through the suspension assembly of a trailer, and the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall; and (D) The torsional shear stress generated by the same lateral forces as described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C) of this section. (2) Extreme dynamic loadings. The following procedure addresses stress in the tank shell resulting from extreme dynamic loadings. The effective stress (the maximum principal stress at any point) must be determined by the following formula: S = 0.5(S y + S x ) # [0.25(S y - S x )2 + S S 2] 0.5 Where: (i) S = effective stress at any given point under a combination of static and extreme dynamic loadings that can occur at the same time, in psi. (ii) S y = circumferential stress generated by MAWP and external pressure, when applicable, plus static head, in psi. (iii) S x = the following net longitudinal stress generated by the following static and extreme dynamic loading conditions, in psi: (A) The longitudinal stresses resulting from the MAWP and external pressure, when applicable, plus static head, in combination with the bending stress generated by the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the tank wall; (B) The tensile or compressive stress resulting from extreme longitudinal acceleration or deceleration. In each case the forces applied must be 0.7 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly, applied at the road surface, and as transmitted to the cargo tank wall through the suspension assembly of a trailer during deceleration; or the horizontal pivot of the tractor or converter dolly fifth wheel, or the drawbar hinge on the fixed dolly during acceleration; or the anchoring and support members of a truck during acceleration and deceleration, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall. The following loadings must be included: ( 1 ) The axial load generated by a decelerative force; ( 2 ) The bending moment generated by a decelerative force; ( 3 ) The axial load generated by an accelerative force; and ( 4 ) The bending moment generated by an accelerative force; and (C) The tensile or compressive stress generated by the bending moment resulting from an extreme vertical accelerative force equal to 0.7 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly of a trailer, and the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or the anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall. (iv) S S = The following shear stresses generated by static and extreme dynamic loading conditions, in psi: (A) The static shear stress resulting from the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly of a trailer, and the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall; (B) The vertical shear stress generated by an extreme vertical accelerative force equal to 0.7 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly of a trailer, and the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall; (C) The lateral shear stress generated by an extreme lateral accelerative force equal to 0.4 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly of a trailer, applied at the road surface, and as transmitted to the cargo tank wall through the suspension assembly of a trailer, and the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall; and (D) The torsional shear stress generated by the same lateral forces as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section. * * * * *
