Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry officials declined to comment on this step. A responsible source told a MENA correspondent that this recall is routine and does not have other connotations. However, observers in Kuwait say that the recall of the Kuwaiti ambassador comes in the wake of tense relations between the two countries after Qatari Television over the past few days screened video reports from inside Iraq on the negative effect of the economic blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. Observers said Qatari Television on Friday carried an interview with Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf. Kuwaiti officials interpreted this action as being tantamount to Qatar's adoption of the Iraqi viewpoint. The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry on Sunday summoned Qatari Ambassador Ahmad Bin-Ghanim al-Rumayhi and conveyed to him unfriendly and unofficial criticism of the Qatari stand. The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry also expressed apprehension about this rapprochement between Qatar and Iraq and asked him to explain the Qatari view on this subject. Press reports today said that Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad sent a strongly worded letter to Shaykh Fahim al-Qasimi, secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council on the recent rapprochement between Qatar and the Iraqi regime.
