It is fully possible to accomplish normal fluctuation to control the renminbi exchange rate at a rational level in the future. First, China has strengthened macroeconomic regulation and control and the annual growth rate of the national economy in the 1990's will stay at 8 to 9 percent, this year it will be 9 percent. The national economy is growing at an optimum rate and total import demand, that is, total scale of annual spending of foreign exchange, can be brought under effective control. Second, there are conditions for China's exports to develop at a rate slightly higher than that of the growth of the national economy. The export growth rate last year was lower than the growth rate of the national economy but the annual average export growth rate in the 15 years since reform and opening-up is 16 percent, higher than the average growth rate of the national economy. The rapid growth of the national economy in the past few years has built a number of new production capacities, introduced a number of advanced technologies and equipment, and stepped up China's economic strength and export material basis. The reform measures introduced this year have created favorable conditions for the development of foreign trade exports. Both opportunities and challenges exist in the international trade environment but, taken as a whole, there are more opportunities than challenges. It is possible for China's exports to accomplish growth at a rate slightly higher than that of the growth of the national economy. Thus, the total amount of foreign exchange supply can be guaranteed. Third, China has introduced a number of measures to control inflation and the index of price increases this year should be controlled within 10 percent, with gradual reductions in ensuing years. The total average of export selling prices can still be increased somewhat. A balance between the two will not cause any great impact on the fluctuation of the renminbi exchange rate. Fourth, with the reform of the enterprise system, various types of enterprises are improving the operational mechanism of enjoying decisionmaking power over operations, assuming sole responsibility for their own profits and losses, self-development, and self-restraint. They are paying attention to the cost of using foreign exchange and reducing blindness in its use. Fifth, the state has introduced measures for stabilizing exchange quotations. Judged by last year's practices, under effective macroeconomic regulation and control, China is fully capable of introducing measures to stabilize exchange quotations. Sixth, we must maintain a favorable foreign trade management order and effectively guard against forcing up commodity prices, panic buying at home, and competing for sales by cutting prices in pursuit of exchange rates in the international market and thereby increasing export costs. We are making vigorous efforts to do a good job in this respect. Therefore, it is groundless to worry about large-scale fluctuations of the renminbi exchange rate. Foreign Trade Restructuring Is Favorable to Foreign Exchange Earnings and Income From Exports To change the quotas of foreign exchange earnings and income from exports into guiding plans is favorable in itself for foreign trade enterprises to transform the operational mechanism, reinvigorate management, and increase foreign exchange earnings and income from exports. Moreover, a number of economic measures have been introduced to encourage enterprises to export more products and accrue more foreign exchange income. First, an exchange rate system favorable to exports has been introduced. The standard exchange rate level enables enterprises to gain rational profits under normal management conditions. Second, a standardized export tax reimbursement system, capable of accomplishing full and timely tax reimbursement and whose formalities are as simple and convenient as possible, is being implemented and it is still necessary to guard against illegal tax evasion. Third, set up an import and export bank is being set up to render funds support for the export of machinery and electronics products. Fourth, an export development fund and risk fund is being set up to support the stable development of some commodities whose prices fluctuate by a big margin on the international market, to develop new export commodities, and to provide risk guarantees for developing new markets and for exports to markets which have larger risks. Fifth, we must carry out credit policies favorable to foreign trade exports with the state rendering key supplies to export credit for various types of enterprises and the growth scale of loans should match the growth of exports. Sixth, according to the rights and duties which GATT developing country signatory parties should enjoy, China is in a position to enjoy fair competition treatment for exports of some primary products. Seventh, corresponding export promotion policies should be pursued and wages and bonuses in foreign trade enterprises should be linked with foreign exchange income from exports. Introduction of these policies and measures can basically overcome the contradiction whereby export sales are not as good as domestic sales, thus enabling China's commodities to compete on an equal basis with the same kinds of commodities made by other countries in the international market. Exchange Rate Reform Will Not Affect Normal Exports China is a developing country and to increase foreign exchange income from exports is mainly with the purpose of importing more advanced technology, equipment, and goods and materials required by the modernization program, as well as importing daily necessities for the people. This is what we must consider in working out reform policies. After the present exchange rate reform, there have been increases in exchange conversion, customs duty, and the circulating tax base and import costs have gone up correspondingly. However, these will not affect normal imports and the moderate growth of imports because, before the unification of the exchange rate, the import costs of 80 percent of the foreign exchange used for imports were calculated by exchange quotations on the swap market. Imports stayed high under the circumstances that foreign exchange swap prices were so high during the first half of last year but there is less chance that the exchange rate after unification will affect normal imports. The financial budget has been increased correspondingly for that portion of foreign exchange used for imports with foregin exchange at state-fixed prices if the imports are still arranged by the state. This will not affect normal imports. The tax base for customs duty and circulation tax has been raised but China will this year again take the initiative by reducing the customs duty rate for 2,898 kinds of commodities. The margin of total customs duty reduction is 8.8 percent. China has made commitments to foreign countries that with the progress of substantive negotiations on the resumption of China's GATT signatory state status, China's total level of customs duty should be reduced by 50 percent on the basis of 1992. This can offset import cost increases as a result of increases in the tax base. Thus, it can be seen that normal imports will not be affected but we must guard against importing blindly and this has also been taken into consideration in the present exchange rate reform. China Still Does Not Have the Conditions To Abolish the Permit System in Foreign Trade Operations The permit system in foreign trade operations is an important measure taken by some developing countries to strengthen foreign trade macroeconomic regulation and control and it is also a transitional measure. It will be abolished in the ordinary course of events after foreign trade legislation becomes sound and the market mechanism matures but China still does not have the conditions to abolish it. It has not been long since China carried out the policy of opening-up, understanding of the law of operations in international markets is inadequate, and there is an eager desire to speed up the development of foreign trade. Under such circumstances, if we slacken the necessary management, blindness will easily emerge. In the first half of 1988, we transferred to the lower levels the power to examine and approve production enterprises to engage in foreign trade by themselves. Within three months, the number of units engaged in foreign trade increased by two-thirds and many of them basically did not have anyn of the conditions so to do. It resulted in serious chaos in the operational order and affected the normal development of foreign trade. Finally, we could not but carry out rectification and control. China has a population of nearly 1.2 billion, the development level of the productive forces remains very low and the contradiction stands out sharply that total social supply cannot meet total demand. The things China exports are squeezed out and the training of China's foreign trade managerial staff cannot meet the needs. Under such circumstances, blindly setting up many enterprises engaged in foreign trade without taking conditions into account will inevitably lead to a situation whereby "the gruel is meager and the monks are many" and further to a situation wherein there are more monks than there is gruel available, affecting the normal development of foreign trade. Moreover, it is unfavorable to the realization of scale operation in foreign trade, to improving economic performance, and also unfavorable to upholding China's good reputation in the world. Permits to engage in foreign trade are just to examine the qualification and ability of operations without restricting quantity. We should emphasize both having the necessary conditions to acquire the power to engage in foreign trade and performing export duties to acquire such power. Some people say that the power to engage in foreign trade should be given but whether or not the enterprises export is for themselves to decide. Such a statement is incorrect. The purpose of granting enterprises with the conditions the power to engage in foreign trade is to enable them to make use of the markets and resources, both at home and overseas, to reinvigorate their operations and also to promote heightening the technological and management level after participating in competition in the international market. If enterprises have the power to engage in foreign trade and yet do not export, it is not only difficult to ensure the state's foreign exchange income but this is also unfavorable to the progress of enterprises. What then is the use of having the power to engage in foreign trade?! It is not an easy job to develop the international market. We must build up relationships of mutual trust with our clients with a continuous and stable supply of goods, otherwise it will be very difficult to occupy the market. If we retreat easily from the market and lose our credit, then we have to pay several times the original price to redevelop the market again. Considered from the interests of the state and the interests of enterprises, we must never be careless about this issue. Effectively Stop Forcing Prices Up, Panic Buying, and Competing for Sales By Cutting Prices Due to the introduction of new pricing reform measures, the production costs of related products have increased and it is understandable to raise the prices of goods supplied for export appropriately but it is absolutely not allowed to exploit the advantage of reform and raise prices unscrupulously at will. Such prices of supplying goods are unacceptable and should be reported to commodity price management departments. Goods can only be purchased at prices of domestic market supply according to the principle of fluctuation in line with market conditions. We should resolutely stand up against prices being forced down by foreign businessmen. The exchange prices of commodities in the international market are determined by the social average labor of mankind and fluctuate rationally according to supply and demand relations. It is an unreasonable demand for foreign businessmen to force prices down and share the benefits of China's unification of exchange rates. The dollar has lost half its value against the Japanese yen over nearly 10 years. Can we succeed in demanding that U.S. businessmen lower their export prices?! Foreign trade enterprises must not be too weak and far less should they use this as a pretext to compete for sales by cutting prices. It is a key to success in foreign trade reform to effectively stop forcing up prices, panic buying, and competing for sales by cutting prices and to maintain good order in foreign trade operations. Forcing up prices, panic buying, and competing for sales by cutting prices affect the normal fluctuations of the exchange rate and weaken the benefits from the unification of the exchange rates. They affect domestic price raises and influence popular feelings, stability, and social stability. They cause benefits to flow out and lower the performance of foreign trade operations. They also harm the reputation of China's commodities and cause the confidence of foreign businessmen to waver in handling Chinese products. They lead to antidumping measures by foreign countries and cause the deterioration of the foreign trade operations environment. They cause blind development of production and affect the rational readjustment of the industrial structure. We must arouse the serious attention of the foreign trade management departments, enterprises, and the parties concerned. We should unite as one, take practical measures, maintain good order in foreign trade operations, ensure the successful progress of foreign trade reform, and promote a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of China's foreign trade.
