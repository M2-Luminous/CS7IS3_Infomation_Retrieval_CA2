Twenty-four Taiwanese tourists and eight mainland guides and crew were robbed and burned to death in the lower-deck cabin of a pleasure boat on which they were touring Lake Qiandao in Zhejiang Province on March 31. Beijing initially claimed the deaths were accidental, but then said robbery and arson were to blame after a blistering attack by Taipei questioning the account of the incident. It finally arrested four men for their involvement in the crime after Taipei implemented a tour-group boycott of the mainland, among other measures. In a letter to the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] requesting June talks, the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], the intermediary body set up to handle cross-strait exchanges, said the incident had inflicted unprecedented damages on the relationship that had been burgeoning since civilian exchanges between the two countries began in 1987. SEF insisted in the letter that mainland authorities still need to make public a thorough report on the case as soon as possible, even though Beijing has said the case is closed. The mainland, it added, should properly compensate the victim's relatives, who it said have suffered immensely as a result of the tragedy. A SEF delegation, accompanied by lawyers, criminal investigators and relatives of the victims, visited the lake and met mainland law enforcement officials earlier this month, and voiced its doubts about the results of the investigation by mainland authorities. In the past two months, ARATS has ignored seven requests by SEF to hold talks on the incident, saying it would need more time to prepare for negotiations.
