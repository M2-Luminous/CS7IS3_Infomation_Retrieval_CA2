Likewise, the latest report states 799 companies in the northern region of the country were subject to fines or penalties. Studies conducted in this field indicate the effects of industrial development encouraged for 10 years along Mexico's border with the United States have resulted in severe basic infrastructure and environmental protection problems. International organizations, such as the World Bank, granted several lines of credit for environmental projects in 1993. The line of credit granted by the World Bank stipulates that one of the two lines of credit granted $1.8 billion for regional environmental projects. The Mexican and U.S. Governments came to the conclusion, however, the northern region needs $500 million to supply water, $2.8 million to treat municipal and industrial waste, $235 million to treat solid waste, and $750 million to treat and eliminate toxic waste. Approximately $277 million were appropriated last year for regional infrastructure projects. The amount is equivalent to a 60.11-percent annual growth if compared to the 1992 budget. The government budgeted $173 million two years ago to build facilities for the treatment of water, elimination of solid waste, highways and transportation, settlements, and human infrastructure. In sum, the government spent $1.5 billion between 1991 and 1993 to finance solutions to environmental problems caused by industrial development along the border. The problems and backwardness in environmental technology, equipment, and information sectors, particularly evident at the country's northern border, are not new within an international context.
