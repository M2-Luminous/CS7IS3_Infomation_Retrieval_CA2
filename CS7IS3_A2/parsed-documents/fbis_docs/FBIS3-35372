He revealed that, at President Yasir 'Arafat's request, African leader Nelson Mandela agreed not to visit Israel before the emergence of the Palestinian national authority. He stressed the importance of the boycott card to the Palestinian negotiators. In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Sha'th said that it would not be proper for the Israeli Labor Party to offer the Palestinian less than what Likud offered for peace with Egypt. He stressed that four categories now have the right to return. They are the 1967 refugees, investors, officers and soldiers, and members of the national authority in the family reunion framework. He also confirmed that the PLO is in favor of a general amnesty for collaborators with the occupation authorities "with the exception of those who have killed Palestinians." Sha'th warned against Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's backtracking from the commitment to the dates for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. He also said that "the Israeli Army's assumption of responsibility for the negotiations does not necessarily mean obstructing these negotiations." On this week's negotiation agenda, Sha'th said: "The negotiators will complete discussion of the security procedures for Gaza and Jericho, particularly in relation to the coast, the air, and the sea." He said he does not expect the discussion of these procedures to last "longer than this week, and that includes agreement on the security corridor between Gaza and Jericho." He added that "what is required during this round is that we should have a final draft agreement and the text pertaining to the presence of UN forces." He said that the water issue will be discussed by the committee responsible for the transfer of civilian authority on Thursday [24 February] following the completion last week of the discussions of issues related to antiquities, state land, and regional planning. Discussion of the issues of the detainees in the context of a document of general amnesty for the Palestinian detainees will also be resumed, he added. He also said: "We will spend two nights drafting the final agreement, but it will only be complete next week, at the end of which President 'Arafat and Rabin will supposedly be invited to resolve six pending issues and then sign the final agreement." Sha'th said that Rado Meister, head of the International Red Cross Commission in Israel and the occupied territory, handed him in Taba last week a list containing the number of registered detainees based on the latest statistics, totaling 9,400 detainees. Sha'th cautioned that despite the expectations "it is difficult to give a specific date for the signing because of certain issues, some related and some not related to the agreement." They include "the continuous Israeli attempts to pit the Israeli-Syrian track against the Israeli-Palestinian track and delay one on account of the other," and they also include "exploitation of the internal situation in Israel and Rabin's attempts to exert pressure for retreat from what is known as the sacred dates." Sha'th said that one "should beware of Rabin's attempts to waive the commitment on dates" because "the sanctity of the dates, as opposed to lack of it, is one of the most important positive aspects of the Oslo agreement. By that I mean the fact that there is a specific timetable for each step." Giving his explanation of the fact that the Palestinian side has recently been speaking of positive developments in the negotiations despite the fears resulting from the Israeli Army's interference in the negotiation process, Sha'th said that "it is partly a question of who is negotiating.... The army does not necessarily always obstruct, but the Israeli Army wanted to have control of the negotiating process." He added: "When civilians conduct the negotiations, the army obstructs the process and when (Shim'on) Peres negotiates, Rabin obstructs...but, ultimately, all the Israeli parties, with the exception of the right-wing hardliners and some Likud leaders, want a solution because peace is more in the interest of Israel than it is in the interest of the Palestinians although peace is more urgent for us." He added that when "one party takes charge of the negotiations it tries to make progress, contrary to its predecessor." On the question of Rabin linking the issue of the release of detainees to an amnesty for agents or "collaborators" and their absorption in Palestinian society, Sha'th said that "the PLO is not less formidable than Hamas, which has opened the way for the collaborators to join it..., because we should give everyone who collaborated with the Israelis under pressure and terrorization a chance, with the exception of the collaborators who committed murder crimes against Palestinian citizens, for as Israel made all the strugglers accountable for every killing operation even though that was legitimate resistance, the least we can do is make the collaborators accountable for their crims." Sha'th emphasized that "the PLO is not against a general amnesty for all those who made mistakes, so they can return and participate in building their homeland." He revealed that, in Rabin's view, the general amnesty should cover the Israeli soldiers who opened fire on Palestinians without orders. He pointed out that the target "is an amnesty for all the Palestinians and Israelis who took part in battles." On the Arab League's announcement that the question of ending the third-degree Arab boycott of companies dealing with Israel would be raised at the Arab League Council's meeting on 27 March, Sha'th criticized the calls for an end to the boycott and emphasized that "we should not pay a price to the Israelis in advance because they charge us for every centimeter, every line, and every word. Everything should be taken into account." He added: "There can be no naivete in politics. Some say we should concede to the Israelis and God will reward us." Sha'th proposed "a timetable for comprehensive peace, similar to the interim timetable for negotiations on the Palestinian-Israeli track." Asked if the PLO has held consultations with some Arab parties to halt their drive toward discussion of joint projects with Israel, Sha'th disclosed that there have been "Palestinian efforts on that matter." He added that "African leader Nelson Mandela responded to a request by President 'Arafat -- during their meeting in the Netherlands last week -- not to accept an invitation to visit Israel until after the establishment of the Palestinian national authority." He continued: "If Mandela has responded it is even more appropriate that the Arab brothers should respond." On Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' statements about not allowing the Palestinians in the diaspora to return and whether that matter was raised in the negotiations, Sha'th said: "Any Palestinian in the diaspora who decides to go to Gaza or Jericho is entitled to an entry visa from the national authority which can be extended to any period under one year..., and any Palestinian in the diaspora who wants a permanent residence can now have that in the context of family reunion, and that covers investors, officers and soldiers, members of the national authority, and everyone who has been out of the country since 1967." He added: "The Palestinians in the diaspora since 1948 who do not fall under the aforementioned categories are now entitled to visit, but the question of full repatriation for them will be resolved when the refugee problem is solved." On 'Arafat's assertion, before the signing of the Cairo agreement, that "Palestine is back on the map," and whether that reflects a conviction that the agreement was the first step toward a Palestinian state, Sha'th said: "There can be no solution without a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital..., and there is no such thing as comprehensive and durable peace without Israeli withdrawal from every inch occupied in 1967.... The Egyptians fought six years for every last inch of Taba, where we are holding our negotiations, and did not leave a single settler on that territory." He added: "Likud accepted that. So the Labor Party should not offer us anything less than Likud did." He continued: "Every current step is a step toward a state, but everything at the appropriate time and stage."
