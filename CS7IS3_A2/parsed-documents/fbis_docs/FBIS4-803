There has been more fighting in the capital today. The road between Kigali and the town of (Kitarama), southwest of the capital, is choked by more than 5,000 refugees. A BBC correspondent who has driven through the area said that at several checkpoints he saw the corpses of refugees apparently killed by local militia on suspicion of being Tutsis or sympathizers with the rebels. He said lorries and convicts from Kigali prison are being used to remove the bodies. At the border between Rwanda and Burundi, the United Nations is now dealing with more than 3,000 Burundians who had previously fled ethnic killing in their own country last year and now want to go back to Burundi. A UN spokesman says Rwanda has closed its border with Zaire, halting the flow of refugees.
