Mr Spring said it was not a walkout, but he had to be back in Dublin tonight for a cabinet meeting. An Irish Government spokesman admitted: "He would have stayed longer if he had thought there was any chance of reaching agreement today." Mr Spring said the failure to decide the balance of voting in the enlarged European Union was a failure of leadership. "This is not the best example to be giving. We may well be running out of time." He said there was no sign at all of a compromise by Britain and Spain -- both fighting to keep the "blocking minority" vote at 23 -- and the other 10 -- insisting it must increase to 27. "I have difficulty understanding the British position," said Mr Spring. "If we don't resolve this then we will be facing a very difficult situation. Positions have not changed today," added Mr Spring. He left the talks after an inconclusive lunch between the foreign ministers and amid signs of a tougher stand on both sides. Officials said Britain was pressing for a "protocol" formally limiting the blocking minority vote to 23. In what was seen as a sign of growing frustration Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg retaliated with a threat to hold the "qualified majority" at 54. This would neatly turn the tables on Mr Hurd by demanding a freeze at present levels on the voting balance in favour instead of against Euro legislation. The effect would be to make agreements easier -- and push up the "blocking minority" to 37. Mr Spring said he hoped to see signs of compromise from Britain when foreign ministers meet in Greece at the weekend. Other member states were talking of imposing a two-week deadline on Britain to give Mr Hurd a breathing space to talk the Tory Euro sceptics round to what is seen as inevitable -- a legal requirement for a new "blocking minority" of 27.
