The text of the treaty has already been coordinated, and it has been signed by Lithuanian National Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius. Lamassoure said that he would take this treaty to French Defense Francois Leotard, who intends to visit Lithuania this year. The purpose of the current official visit by Lamassoure is to establish economic and political contacts between France and Lithuania. According to Lamassoure, his visit has been speeded up by the parliamentary elections in Russia, because France has always supported the struggle of the Baltic countries for freedom, and it feels its responsibility regarding the situation here. France thinks that North and Central European countries should have associated membership in the West European Union, a defense organization uniting nine West European states, Lamassoure said. France also has other initiatives concerning Lithuania. Negotiations on a trade agreement between Lithuania and the states of the European Union are taking place. Lamassoure said that this involves not only economic but also political agreement, which may decide Lithuania's admission to the European Union, if this Lithuania's wish. Yet another proposal by France is the so-called Balladur plan-- submitted by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur--which concerns countries having problems with their neighbors or with national minorities. This is a kind of peace conference where the countries of the European Union would be mediators. It is planned to convene such a conference in Paris next April. Lamassoure met on Friday the chairman of the Seimas, Ceslovas Jursenas, members of the Seimas Foreign Affairs Committee, representatives of all political forces, Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys, Defense Minister Linkevicius, and the leader of the opposition, Vytautas Landsbergis. He is meeting Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius today. Lamassoure will go from Vilnius to Latvia.
