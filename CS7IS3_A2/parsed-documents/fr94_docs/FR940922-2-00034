FR940922-2-00034 FR940922-2-00013 Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed Greybull Irrigation Dam, Cheyenne, WY AGENCIES: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District, DOD; U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Wyoming, DOI. SPONSORS: Greybull Valley Irrigation District, Emblem, Wyoming; Wyoming Water Development Commission, Cheyenne, Wyoming. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The proposed action is to construct a 150-foot high zoned earth embankment dam at the lower end of Roach Gulch, a dry tributary to the Greybull River. The dam would be 1700 feet long with a 150-foot wide earth channel spillway on the left abutment, and would be located primarily in the SW1/4SW1/4 of Section 23, T 51 N, R 98 W of Big Horn county. Water from the Greybull River would be diverted by means of a gated structure and delivered to the reservoir area via a 6-mile supply canal, some of which is existing. Water would be released from the dam back into the Greybull River by means of an 1100-foot earth channel, providing late-season irrigation water for 25,000 acres in the lower Greybull Valley. The project may provide secondary fishery benefits by providing winter minimum flows from the proposed dam and Upper and Lower Sunshine Reservoirs. The Greybull River Valley is located in southern Park and Big Horn counties in northwest Wyoming, approximately 25 miles southeast of Cody, Wyoming. Alternatives being evaluated by the applicant include similar diversions into Blackstone Gulch or Rawhide Creek, as well as the enlargement of Upper Sunshine Reservoir, an existing storage reservoir. Conservation of existing water supplies, utilization of groundwater, as well as the ``no action'' alternative will be considered. DATES: Public Scoping Meeting, October 26, 1994, 7:00 p.m. Emblem Gym, 3400 Road 10, Emblem, Wyoming. ADDRESSES: Omaha District, Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CEMRO-PD-M, 215 N. 17th St., Omaha, Nebraska 68102&hyph;4978. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Robert S. Nebel, Chief, Environmental Analysis, Planning Division, (402) 221&hyph;4598. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Future Schedule Following review of comments received during scoping, data collection and analysis will begin for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS). The Corps anticipates that the DEIS will be released for public review in June 1995. A Final Environmental Impact Statement is anticipated to be completed in early 1996. Kenneth L.
