As Dzhumshud Nuriyev, the republic's deputy minister of agriculture and chairman of the parliament commission on budget control, told the ANS-PRESS agency, because of the high rate of inflation it is currently not expedient to approve a state budget for the entire year. Therefore, the plan is to approve at the upcoming session a draft state budget for the first half-year and to set target figures for the annual budget, which will then be considered and approved quarterly or monthly. Vakhid Akhundov, adviser to the Republic of Azerbaijan president on economic issues, shares this opinion. According to him, "Indicators in our country become outdated even before the ink dries."
