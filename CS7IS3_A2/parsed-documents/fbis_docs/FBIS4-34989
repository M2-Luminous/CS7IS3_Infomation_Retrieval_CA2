Reina stressed that even if the United Nations made this request, he would not support an initiative to invade another nation. The Honduran president also confirmed that his country is a favorite for the establishment of a regional center to combat drug trafficking. This issue was discussed on Saturday during the visit of William Perry, the U.S. secretary of defense. "We are no longer in the context of the Cold War. We are no longer in the stage of a war of polarized blocs. This is why we want to take advantage of international cooperation to defend ourselves from vices such as drug trafficking and other world scourges," he said. According to Perry, the installation of a regional center to combat drug trafficking means the possible transfer to Honduras of the aircraft the United States has in the Southern Command bases in Panama. This does not mean that the U.S. military presence would increase in Honduras where currently approximately 1,200 soldiers are stationed. These soldiers are replaced every three to four months. Rather, Reina noted, this would mean "more dialogue." Reina recalled that military relations between Honduras and the United States are outlined in an agreement that goes back to 1954. The Honduran Legislative Assembly did not see the agreement when it was signed, he noted. In this regard, he indicated that any agreement on new military relations with the United States should be discussed by the Legislative Assembly. The president said that the presence of drug traffickers in his country is on the rise, which he labeled as "very serious." Therefore, he noted, all the nations need help and Honduras should take advantage of its "prime" geographic position. The regional center could operate in Palmerola, a local air base constructed by the U.S. Army in the eighties when Washington attempted -- without success -- to topple Nicaragua's Sandinist regime through the "contras," who it armed and financed in Honduras. Palmerola is located approximately 80 km north of Tegucigalpa and its runway has the capacity to receive any type of combat plane or the gigantic C-5 Galaxy.
