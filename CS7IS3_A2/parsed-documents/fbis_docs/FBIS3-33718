He stressed that he would not relinquish power even if international military intervention takes place against him. [passage omitted] Furthermore, Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani stressed that his forces are in control of the strategic city of Baghlan and the surrounding areas in northern Afghanistan. He said that Uzbek militia forces and Hezb-e Eslami forces have surrendered with all their military equipment to government forces. In his statement to AL-HAYAH yesterday Rabbani rejected any offers to internationalize the Afghan crisis, because "it is primarily an Islamic problem and concerns Islamic institutions, organizations, and states." Rabbani denied that he intends to submit his resignation. He said, "I will not submit my resignation except after the remaining six months of my term have elapsed. I will not step down even if military and international intervention takes place. Because I refuse to surrender to pressure, conspiracies, and broken pledges. I am here because I was selected by all Afghan leaders." Rabbani pointed out that "so far all mediations have failed to find a solution to the problem or secure a cease-fire." [passage omitted]
