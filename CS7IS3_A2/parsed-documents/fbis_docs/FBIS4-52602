The council was established six months ago to address environmental issues and is chaired by former Prime Minister Anan Panyarachun. The five projects are: pesticide-free agricultural villages, renovation of Khlong Lot, study of lignite and its impact on the environment, environmental conservation circle (ECC), and green labelling. The council's objectives are: to provide reliable information and guidance to distinguish genuine environment-friendly products; to encourage the production of green products using clean technologies; to promote energy conservation and recycling; to promote the establishment of a third-party labeller who can offer an unbiased opinion to back up marketing claims, to establish more demanding standards for companies to make environmentally sound products; and to promote environmental awareness among manufacturers and consumers. Chaiyot Bunyakitdi, director of the Thailand Environment Institute's business and environment programme, said the green labelling project will be significant in helping identify projects that have proven to be less destructive to the environment. To date, 19 member firms have agreed to participate in the labelling project. Environment-friendly products have achieved international popularity among environment-conscious consumers. Mr Chaiyot said the council will vigorously promote this project and hopes to establish guidelines to assist firms in their marketing claims, often not entirely accurate, of products less damaging to the environment. The Thailand Business Council for Sustainable Development (TBCSD) has proposed establishing a committee, to be chaired by Permanent Secretary for Industry Siwawong Changkhasiri, on green labelling guidelines and comprising representatives from the Federation of Thai Industries, Board of Trade, Thai Industrial Standards Institute, Office of Consumer Protection, Environmental Engineering Association of Thailand, Press Association, Public Relations Confederation of Thailand, Marketing Association of Thailand and no more than 25 representatives from TBCSD.
