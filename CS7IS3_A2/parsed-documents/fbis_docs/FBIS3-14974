The sitting is to discuss a package of agreements on practical implementation of the treaty on economic union between the Commonwealth's countries. The conference is to consider a protocol to the agreement concerning general conditions and mechanisms to support development of cooperation between industrial enterprises and the various sectors, an agreement on cooperation in the sphere of labor migration and social security for workers-migrants. In addition, the session is scheduled to discuss a package of documents of a humanitarian nature: on benefits and guarantees to the veterans of the WW ll, Afghan war veterans, and families of perished servicemen, on preparation for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of Victory Day, on citizens' rights in the sphere of benefits and compensations for children, as well as other issues. The vice premiers will first discuss proposals to the agenda of the upcoming summit of heads of CIS governments and states. According to Korotchenya, the session is supposed to discuss a package of military problems as well. Korotchenya reported to Interfax that the issue on Ukraine's joining the economic union as an associate member had not been prepared yet. He explained that it is difficult to solve this issue in a situation where Kiev has not signed the CIS Charter nor other important documents of the Commonwealth, has not determined the conditions and mechanisms for Ukraine's participation in CIS projects. Korotchenya added that the issue on Ukraine's associate membership in the economic union would be probably solved at the summit of CIS leaders. As Korotchenya, CIS executive secretary, said, Kazakhstan's Prime Minister Sergei Tereshchenko voiced an initiative to unite separate sittings of the council of heads of governments and the council of the heads of states scheduled for March into a joint sitting on March 31 in Moscow. The present task of the CCC is to prepare documents for a CIS summit. Korotchenya also reported that in the course of his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev on Monday in Moscow they reached an agreement to hold a joint session of the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers and CIS Council of Defense Ministers.
