In a report submitted to Hata and prepared by its study group, the PHP Institute said the government should trim state expenditures in a step-by-step manner starting in 1995 to avoid raising taxes. Among key proposals in the report: The government should -- Privatize state universities immediately -- Abolish the food agency which tightly regulates rice production and distribution -- Ban special entities under the jurisdiction of government ministries which absorb retired ex-bureaucrats -- Reduce the number of seats in the House of Representatives to 250 from the current 511 and that in the House of Councillors to 50 from the current 252 -- Reduce the number of national government employees by 45 percent or 520,000 over the next five years -- Integrate the current 21 government ministries and agencies and one office into six offices. The institute also said the government could save a total of 111 trillion yen by the year 2004 if it set aside the money saved under fiscal and administrative reforms for a fund for welfare purposes. More than half of the fund should be used for raising welfare standards to achieve a welfare nation without any tax in the year 2005, it said. The report is roughly in line with a persistent opinion expressed by the institute's founder, the late Konosuke Matsushita, founder of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Matsushita had said, "a high tax erodes the will to work. The nation should be run without any tax."
