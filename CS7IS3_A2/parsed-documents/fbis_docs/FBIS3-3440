Shumeyko, also chairman of the conference, made the statement at the opening ceremony of the conference's fourth session held in St. Petersburg. He stressed that the CIS members should make joint efforts to tide over the economic crisis which the 12 countries have suffered since the 1991 disintegration of the former Soviet Union. Only eight of the 16 CIS states, including Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Armenia, attended the conference. The conference today also approved its own peacekeeping role, saying it should take an active part in resolving regional and ethnic disputes on the CIS countries, including conflicts in Abkhazia, Georgia, and in Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan.
