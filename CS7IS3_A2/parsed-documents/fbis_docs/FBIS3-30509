However, the debate did not happen. More from our colleague, editor of the weekly PRACE Renata Havranova. [Havranova] Today was a tense, chaotic, and at times very undignified day for the deputies of the Slovak parliament. After a three-hour long delay, the session started with an argument about who was entitled to chair it. The deputies voted to take away the right of chairing the session from Ivan Gasparovic [chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic] for failing to keep time and authorized Ludovit Cernak [chairman of the Slovak National Party and deputy chairman of parliament] to do so. Gasparovic protested that only he, as chairman of parliament, had the right to call and chair the session. He therefore announced a recess. Prime Minister Meciar, who wanted to withdraw the bill on large-scale privatization but failed, demonstratively left the chamber [declaring] that he did not accept the chairmanship of Ludovit Cernak. Since morning, the game in parliament was all about nerves and time. The coalition, in an attempt to equalize the voting score of opposition, is alleged to have brought by police helicopter Deputy [Peter] Brnak [Slovak National Party (SNS)] from medical treatment and Augustin Marian Huska [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)], who is in serious medical condition, straight from the hospital. Even so, they did not match the opposition votes. In the meantime, the cross-party parliamentary standing committee decided to continue the debate. Soon after the opening, deputy [Tibor] Cabaj from the HZDS announced that the coalition clubs of deputies considered the withdrawal of Ivan Gasparovic's right to chair the debate to be anticonstitutional and therefore proposed that the matter be decided by the Constitutional Court. Until its decision, the HZDS deputies and some of SNS deputies would not be taking part in parliamentary meetings. Deputies of both parliamentary clubs then left the chamber. The remaining deputies took strong exception to such procedure. They said that it was an intentional attempt to avoid a debate on such a very important law as was the law on large-scale privatization. For Slovakia, it was tragic behavior. According to the opposition deputies, the principle of parliamentarism was put in doubt, and that was particularly dangerous for Slovakia in the present political situation. The majority of the cross-party standing committee that met after this situation had arisen, agreed to adjourn the meeting until tomorrow morning.
