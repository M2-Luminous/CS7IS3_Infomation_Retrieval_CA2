What is your goal for the elections? Do you want to become so strong that you no longer depend on the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] as the junior partner? [Vranitzky] Such a goal must always exist. Of course, one's sense of reality sets certain limits. We have a coalition agreement with the OeVP, which is valid until the last day of the legislative period. Anything else must be discussed after the elections. [Kotanko] Have the Greens become more predictable, more serious for you as a result of their changed attitude toward the European Union [EU] membership treaty? [Vranitzky] I admire people like Johannes Voggenhuber, who, despite their anti-EU conviction, accept the clear decision of the people after the referendum as Voggenhuber did [he said that he will vote for the EU membership treaty in parliament as a result of the positive referendum]. However, that does not yet build any bridge for a future coalition. [passage omitted] [Kotanko] Many people expect a "duel" between Vranitzky and Haider in the election campaign. The Freedom Party chairman wants to gather the "real patriots" around himself. [Vranitzky] I believe there is a difference between "real patriots" and patriots. And, after all, Haider does not look so glorious now, after the referendum. He has suffered an enormous defeat and then called this a climax..
