FR940112-0-00022 FR940112-0-00012 16 CFR Part 305 RIN 3084&hyph;AA26 Rule Concerning Disclosures of Energy Consumption and Water Use Information About Certain Home Appliances and Other Products Required Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act AGENCY: Federal Trade Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Under the Energy and Water Use Rule, each required label on a covered appliance must show a range, or scale, indicating the range of energy costs or efficiencies for all models of a size or capacity comparable to the labeled model. This notice publishes the new range figures, which, under §§305.10, 305.11 and 305.14 of the rule must be used on labels on dishwashers manufactured on and after April 12, 1994, and in advertising of dishwashers beginning April 12, 1994. Properly labeled dishwashers manufactured prior to the effective date need not be relabeled. Catalogs printed prior to the effective date in accordance with 16 CFR 305.14 need not be revised. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Mills, Attorney, 202&hyph;326&hyph;3035, Division of Enforcement, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 324 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA) 1 requires the Federal Trade Commission to consider labeling rules for the disclosure of estimated annual energy cost or alternative energy consumption information for at least thirteen categories of appliances. Dishwashers are included as one of the categories. Before these labeling requirements may be prescribed, the statute requires the Department of Energy (``DOE'') to develop test procedures that measure how much energy the appliances use. In addition, DOE is required to determine the representative average cost a customer pays for the different types of energy available. 1 42 U.S.C. 6294. On November 19, 1979, the Commission issued a final rule 2 covering seven of the thirteen appliance categories, including dishwashers. The rule requires that energy costs and related information be disclosed on labels and in retail sales catalogs for all dishwashers presently manufactured. Certain point-of-sale promotional materials must disclose the availability of energy usage information. If a dishwasher is advertised in a catalog from which it may be purchased by cash, charge account or credit terms, then on each page of the catalog that lists the product shall be included the range of estimated annual energy costs for the product. The required disclosures and all claims concerning energy consumption made in writing or in broadcast advertisements must be based on the results of the DOE test procedures. 2 44 FR 66466. On December 10, 1987 (52 FR 46888), the Commission amended the Appliance Labeling Rule by extending coverage to include central air conditioners and heat pumps. On October 25, 1993 (58 FR 54955), the Commission extended the Rule's coverage to include certain plumbing products (showerheads, faucets, water closets and urinals). Section 305.8(b) of the rule requires manufacturers, after filing an initial report, to report annually by specified dates for each product type. 3 The data submitted by manufacturers are based, in part, on the representative average unit cost of the type of energy used to run the appliances tested. According to §305.9 of the rule, these average energy costs, which are provided by DOE, will be periodically revised by the Commission, but not more often than annually. Because the costs for the various types of energy change yearly, and because manufacturers regularly add new models to their lines, improve existing models and drop others, the data base from which the ranges of comparability are calculated is constantly changing. To keep the required information in line with these changes, the Commission is empowered, under §305.10 of the rule, to publish new ranges (but not more often than annually) if an analysis of the new data indicates that the upper or lower limits of the ranges have changed by more than 15%. 3 Reports for dishwashers are due by June 1. The new figures for the estimated annual costs of operation for dishwashers, which were calculated using the 1993 representative average energy costs published by DOE on January 5, 1993, 4 have been submitted and have been analyzed by the Commission. New ranges based upon them are herewith published. 4 58 FR 345. The Commission published these figures on January 25, 1993, at 58 FR 5925. The cost for electricity was published as 8.30 cents per kilowatt-hour; for natural gas: 59.46 cents per therm; for propane: 73 cents per gallon; for No. 2 heating oil: $1.00 per gallon. In consideration of the foregoing, the Commission amends appendix C of its Energy and Water Use Rule by publishing the following ranges of comparability for use in the labeling and advertising of dishwashers beginning April 12, 1994. List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 305 Advertising, Energy conservation, Household appliances, Labeling, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, 16 CFR part 305 is amended as follows: PART 305_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 305 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 6294. 2. In appendix C, Paragraph 1 and the introductory text in Paragraph 2 are revised to read as follows: Appendices to Part 305 * * * * * Appendix C to Part 305_Dishwashers 1.
