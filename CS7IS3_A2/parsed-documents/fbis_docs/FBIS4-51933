The government will begin concrete consultations following the inauguration of the new administration. Because the South African Government used to practice a policy of apartheid, Japan's ODA has been limited to small amounts of aid provided in grants to private organizations which were engaged in activities in South Africa's black society. However, the new administration will be established following the general election in which people of all races participated. In response, the government has decided to positively promote ODA to South Africa. According to a senior Foreign Ministry official, the government has concluded that Japan "needs to highly evaluate the process for democratization in that country and support their efforts."
