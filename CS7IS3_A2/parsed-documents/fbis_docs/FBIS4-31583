Their results are not quite identical. We have asked Ludmila Benkovicova, of the Slovak Statistical Office, to compare the results and explain the differences in the methodology used. As she noted in an introductory letter to her article, she had consulted the problems under review with the FOCUS agency and Slovak Radio. As an important contribution of this activity, they agreed on the need to coordinate in the future at least the use of terminology because, as she writes, "the differences disconcert all of us." Why do different polls produce different results? I will mention at least the most important factors influencing the ascertained results of public-opinion surveys. Generally, it holds true that the obtained empirical data are significantly determined by the time of collection of information in the field. Public opinion is a dynamic phenomenon. It reacts with particular sensitivity to events in public and political life, new facts and information, politicians' statements and speeches. A shift of a few days in the collection of data, especially if these days are packed with political activities, can find its expression in changes of opinion among a part of the population and, hence, in altered results. A problem in its own right is when to perceive differentiation of data as true differences and when certain differences are still within the norm. Some commentators and users interpret as a difference even a decline or rise by a few tenths of a percent. It is necessary to clearly realize that surveys working with select samples--and this is true of all public-opinion surveys without exception--are surveys of likelihood nature [vyskumy pravdepodobnostneho charakteru]. They produce data, the validity of which is not absolute but that are always valid, with a certain probability within a certain interval of reliability. The interval of reliability has its lower and upper limit, and the figure that is given as the result is the midpoint of the interval. This means, for example, that the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], which, according to the May 1994 survey of the Slovak Statistical Office, availed itself of 11 percent of votes, would have received in "May" elections, with a likelihood of 95 percent (the margin of error is 5 percent!), 8.7-12.7 percent of the votes of participants in the elections. The final results are also affected by the research method that is used, starting with the method of establishing the select sample, through the method of data collection, all the way down to the specific wording of the question put to the respondent. Let us take a closer look at the questions used by various institutions. Slovak Radio's Research Department, whose electoral surveys frequently appear in the mass media, uses the following question: "Imagine that parliamentary elections were to take place this week. For which party or movement would you opt?" This question is put to every respondent. The respondent can select his reply from 20 entities running in the elections (out of more than 50 officially registered parties and movements). He is free to supplement his reply with any other party, but he can also reply "I am not going to vote," "I do not want to reply," or "I do not know." The sum of all replies adds up to 100 percent. The FOCUS agency asks two questions. In the first, it ascertains interest in participation in the elections, and, in the second, it surveys how the respondent would vote. It offers a choice of 15 entities running in the elections and, simultaneously, the replies "I am not going to vote," "I do not know for whom I will vote," and "I do not want to reply." The two questions are put to all people included in the select sample. By means of combining replies to the first and second questions, the FOCUS agency obtains the electoral preferences of individual parties. The Slovak Statistical Office addresses to all citizens polled a question concerning their participation in the coming elections. The second question--"For which political party or movement would you vote if elections to the National Council of the Slovak Republic were to be held today?"--is put to only those respondents who said at the time of the survey that they are determined to vote or that they are likely to vote. It offers a list of 18 entities running in the elections, the possibility of naming any party not included in the list, and the reply "I do not know for whom I will vote." The electoral decisions of those of the respondents who want to participate in the elections are then interpreted as electoral preferences. The aim of this methodological procedure is to come as close as possible to the actual "pure" situation of casting the vote. The electoral results are directly determined by those who come to the ballot box. Even the most unbending sympathizer of a party cannot support "his" party with his vote if he does not turn up at the polling station. It would be appropriate to pay more heed to this trivial fact when presenting the results of preelection polls. The use of a different term (such as, for example, "political sympathy," "political orientation of the population," etc.) could therefore be considered for expressing attitude. The term electoral preferences should be reserved for the electoral decisions of participants in the elections--that is, those who want to come to the ballot box on the last day of September or the first day of October. The reality of the '94 elections will test not only the validity of various preelection prognoses but also the theoretical justification of the methods used. For the time being, the reader and user who is seriously interested in preelection surveys has no choice but to pay heed not only to the "figures" themselves, but also to the wording of the question, the wording of all of the optional replies, and to what each item of data actually expresses.
