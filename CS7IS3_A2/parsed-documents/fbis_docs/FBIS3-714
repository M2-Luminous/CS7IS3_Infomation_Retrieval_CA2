"I can tell you officially and I repeat what was said on Tuesday eighth March by the spokesman of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs that none of them is present in Bakassi", Garrigue-Guyonnaud said. Garrigue-Guyonnaud told newsmen at a press conference that France had historical ties and cooperation agreements with Cameroon and that it was in response to a request by the Cameroonian Government that it had sent two helicopters and 15 military assistants to Yaounde on what he called a "logistics mission." He said that the level of French assistance to Cameroon had not been increased since the crisis began three weeks ago, with a reported shoot out between Cameroonian gendarmes and Nigerian troops in the peninsula, a border area of 1,000 square kilometres disputed by the two countries. On the French frigate reported to have arrived in Douala to reinforce French presence in the peninsula, Garrigue-Guyonnaud said it was part of a routine visit carried out all year round along the Atlantic coast of Africa. He said the frigate, the Vendemiaire, left Douala on 6 March and is no longer in Cameroon. The ambassador said another warship, the "Jacoubet, arrived in Douala on 7 March as part of a long-standing agreement and is expected to leave today. "These visits are not related to the present situation. A scheduled visit of the vessel took place in Accra a few weeks ago," he said. Commenting on the five-day joint military exercises between France and Benin, which are to end today, he said they took place west of the Couffo River, near Togo and bear no relation whatsoever to the territorial dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria. Benin lies on Nigeria's western border. "The men and equipment are being transported back to France today and tomorrow, at the end of the manoeuvres to which Nigeria sent two military observers," he said. The ambassador said France has relations dating 20 years with Nigeria despite its historical links with Cameroon, and for this reason, supported a peaceful solution to the crisis. "Our position is clear and has been consistent. We seek a peaceful settlement and we have informed the Nigerian authorities at the highest level," he said. [passage omitted]
