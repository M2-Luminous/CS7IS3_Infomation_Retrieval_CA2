Hu] [Text] Washington, April 14 (CNA) -- The state-run Taiwan Power Company will begin commercial single-cycle operation of its Hsinta plant near Tainan in mid-1995, with gas turbines and other power generation equipment provided by Siemens, a global electronics-electrical firm. Siemens' Milwaukee-based Power Generation Group (PWU) said Thursday [14 April] that at least eight of the 15 gas turbines ordered by Taipower will be manufactured, assembled, and shipped to Taiwan soon. With the equipment, Taipower's Hsinta plant will become the largest power plant on the island, a facility capable of producing 2,364 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power a city of more than two million residents. When the Hsinta plant begins combined-cycle operation in 1998, it will become the world's largest power plant for 60-hertz cycle generation. Electricity in Taiwan, like in North America and several other countries in Asia, is generated on a 60-hertz cycle, it added. The gas turbines to be installed in the Hsinta plant are worth about US$500 million, and are Taipower's second order from Siemens. The first gas turbines manufactured at the PWU were exported to Taipower's Nan Pu Combined-Cycle Power Station in 1992. In addition to the gas turbines, Siemens will supply five steam turbines, 15 heat recovery steam generators, plant instrumentation and controls, and other equipment to Taipower. Taipower will begin to add the steam turbines to the Hsinta plant's gas turbine operation in late 1996.
