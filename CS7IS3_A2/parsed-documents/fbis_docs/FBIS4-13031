The INA political editor commented: The objective of propagating such lies is to tarnish the reputation of Iraq and its clear, faithful pan-Arab policy, which is not built on the basis of rotten corridor deals and narrow interests. The political editor added: Such things are useless attempts to peddle exposed lies which no longer fool anybody.
