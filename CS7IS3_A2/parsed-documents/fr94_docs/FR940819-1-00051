FR940819-1-00051 FR940819-1-00011 Regulatory Impact Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This proposed rulemaking has been evaluated in accordance with existing regulatory policies and procedures and is considered to be a nonsignificant regulatory action under DOT policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). This NPRM also had been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and is considered ``nonsignificant'' under that Order. Although the rulemaking is ``nonsignificant,'' FRA nonetheless has prepared a regulatory evaluation addressing the economic impact of the proposed rule. The regulatory evaluation estimates the economic costs and consequences of this proposed rule as well as its anticipated benefits and impacts. This regulatory evaluation has been placed in the docket and is available for public inspection and copying during normal business hours in Room 8201, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Copies may also be obtained by submitting a written request to the FRA Docket Clerk at the above address. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .) requires a review of proposed rules to assess their impact on small entities, unless the Secretary certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. There is no direct or indirect economic impact on small units of government, businesses, or other organizations. Therefore, it is certified that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule contains proposed information collection requirements. FRA will submit these information collection requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq . FRA has endeavored to keep the burden associated with this proposal as simple and minimal as possible. The sections that contain the new and/or revised information collection requirements and the estimated time to fulfill each requirement are set forth in the table below. Note that for easy reference, when an information collection requirement has been revised, the old burden estimate appears in parentheses beside the new burden. ␣ 1Proposed section 1Brief description 1New burden (estimated) 1Previous burden 225.19(c), 225.21(b) Form FRA F 6180.54_Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report 2 hrs (2 hrs.) 225.19(d), 225.21(c) Form FRA F 6180.55a_Railroad Injury and Illness Summary (Continuation Sheet) 10 min (5 min.) 225.21(b) Form FRA F 6180.55_Railroad Injury and Illness Summary 45 min (45 min.) 225.21(d) Form FRA F 6180.56_Annual Railroad Report of Manhours and Casualties, by State 3 hrs (3 hrs.) 225.19(b), 225.21(e) Form FRA F 6180.57_Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report 4 hrs (3 hrs.) 225.21(g) Form FRA F 6180.78_Notice to Railroad Worker Involved in Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Attributed to Worker Human Factor; Worker Statement Supplementing Railroad Accident Report 15 min (15 min.) 225.21(h), 225.25(a) Form FRA F 6180.xx_Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log 30 min (22 min.) 225.21(i), 225.25(b) Form FRA F 6180.xx(a)_Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Log 30 min (New) 225.21(j), 225.25(b) Form FRA F 6180.xx_Property Damage Estimate Worksheet and Record 45 min (New) 225.25(e) Monthly List of Injuries and Illnesses 5 hrs (Class I RR) ␣ l 30 min.
