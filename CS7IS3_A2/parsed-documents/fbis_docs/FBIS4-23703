In response to questions at a press conference at the World Economic Forum [WEF] conference in Cape Town, he said the proposed "truth commission" as announced this week by the Minister of Justice Dullah Omar had not been "agreed- upon policy". He, Mr de Klerk, had not been consulted about the announcement. But ministers in the government of national unity had been charged with looking at the matter from all angles and had to "come up with a co-ordinated approach". Mr de Klerk said Mr Omar's announcement should be seen as "part of growing pains", but it should be remembered that Mr Omar had said he was putting on the table a basic approach. Mr Omar had made it clear a final decision would be taken only after all views had been gathered and presented to the government. It was not a sign of tension in the government, Mr de Klerk said. Mr Omar had also said in Parliament that the government was not looking for a witch-hunt or Nuremburg-style trials. Mr de Klerk said he had spoken "cursorally" to Mr Mandela and Mr Mandela had given him certain assurances about details "which convinces me we will be able to reach some kind of consensus on this issue". Mr de Klerk said he would be telling a WEF open session on Friday night that South Africa's past would have to be dealt with in such a way that "we don't get involved in vendettas and witch-hunts". Asked about possible pitfalls, Mr de Klerk said a truth commission would not promote reconciliation if double standards were applied. But he did not wish to enter into a debate through the media while negotiations on the issue were under way. "Whatever is decided must promote reconciliation."
