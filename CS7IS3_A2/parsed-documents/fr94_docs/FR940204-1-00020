FR940204-1-00020 FR940204-1-00002 3. Responsibilities of Banks Proposed §630.4(c) sets forth the banks' responsibilities for furnishing and updating information to be used by the Funding Corporation for preparation of the report to investors and would require each bank to provide annual, quarterly, and other interim financial information to the Funding Corporation in accordance with Funding Corporation instructions. Proposed §630.4(c)(5) would require several certifications from bank management relating to the information submitted to the Funding Corporation for inclusion in the report to investors. Banks must certify to the Funding Corporation that all information has been submitted in accordance with the Funding Corporation's instructions; that the information submitted is prepared in accordance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements; and that the information is true, accurate, and complete. Certifications to the Funding Corporation are to be signed on behalf of the board of a bank by an officer(s) designated by the bank board and by the chief executive officer. It would be the Funding Corporation's responsibility to determine the form of the certification to be made by each bank for compliance with the requirements of proposed §630.4(c)(5). 4. Responsibilities of Associations Under the proposed regulations, associations have no direct responsibility for preparation of the report to investors. The associations' responsibilities for preparing combined financial statements with related banks are governed by part 620 of this chapter. However, banks must be able to follow up on issues that may arise in connection with association financial information that banks will be using to prepare their information for submission to the Funding Corporation. Therefore, proposed §630.4(d) would require each association to provide in the engagement letter with its external auditor that the external auditor shall notify the association and respond to inquiries of the related bank pertaining to the preparation of the combined financial data of the association and its related bank. D. Prohibition Against Incomplete, Inaccurate, or Misleading Disclosure Proposed §630.5 prohibits incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading disclosure by any of the parties involved in the preparation of the report to investors. If, in the judgment of the FCA, an incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading disclosure has been made, the party responsible is obligated under this section to provide correct information to allow the Funding Corporation to rectify the erroneous disclosure. If a party discovers, prior to publication, that incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading disclosure has been made, the erroneous disclosure must be corrected before it is incorporated into the report. If a report containing erroneous disclosure has been published, the Funding Corporation would be required to take corrective actions as soon as possible to ensure that the reported information presents a fair and accurate picture of the System's results of operations and financial condition. Other disclosure entities would be required to furnish the information needed by the Funding Corporation to make the correction. In addition to corrective actions by System institutions, where appropriate, the FCA may use its enforcement powers under title V, part C of the 1971 Act to enforce proposed §630.5. E. Audit Committees Audit committees are a key component of an institution's corporate governance. Section 630.6(a) is proposed to formalize the existing System Audit Committee function and should have minimal effect on current operations of the System Audit Committee. Proposed §630.6(a) (1) through (3) would require a System Audit Committee consisting of no fewer than three members. The System Audit Committee would report to the board of the Funding Corporation. Members selected to serve on the committee must be independent of management of any disclosure entity and association and must have financial management expertise sufficient to carry out their oversight role. A person who is an officer or employee of a disclosure entity or an association would not be considered independent of management. The committee must be given adequate resources and authorities to discharge its responsibilities, including the ability to consult with the Funding Corporation's general counsel and outside counsel to discuss legal matters that may have a significant impact on the Systemwide combined financial statements and related analyses. Proposed §630.6(a)(4) prescribes the minimum responsibilities of the System Audit Committee. These responsibilities would include: (1) Making recommendations on the selection of an independent auditor for audits of Systemwide combined financial statements; (2) overseeing the Funding Corporation management's preparation of the report to investors; (3) reviewing the impact of significant accounting and auditing developments and approving accounting policy changes for the Systemwide combined financial statements; (4) reviewing each report and interim disclosure to investors prior to its release; and (5) overseeing the internal control system over Systemwide financial reporting for preparation of reports to investors. Lastly, the names of the System Audit Committee members must be disclosed pursuant to proposed §630.20(n).
