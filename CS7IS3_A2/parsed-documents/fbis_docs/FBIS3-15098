What prospects do you see for cooperation with the Russians? [Karimov] I have always said and I wish to reiterate once more today that, Uzbekistan cannot see its future without Russia. Regardless of the difficulties or artificial barriers that are raised between us on issues of cooperation and economic ties, and relations in other directions as well, I have always been convinced and remain convinced that Russia and Uzbekistan should be together in the most difficult conditions through which we are living today. Of course, I am also convinced that there will be prosperity which we will both share. It is difficult to specify the directions in which we can cooperate. The fact is the directions and forms of cooperation as well as their depth are so boundless that it is difficult to speak about some specific direction. Today, at every step we feel the breakdown in economic ties, difficulties in economic relations, as well as on questions of payments, more so since we introduced our own currency. Every day, at every turn, and at every step we feel that we cannot live without one another. I would once more like to emphasize the significance of our visit. I am confident the hopes which the Russian and Uzbek people place on us, on our meeting, and on the signing of documents which we are counting on, will be invariably justified. [Ganiyeva] Islam Abduganiyevich, very briefly, what documents will be signed as a result of this visit? [Karimov] First of all there will be the document on deepening economic integration in relations between Russia and Uzbekistan. Second there will be the document on general guidelines for deepening all-around cooperation between Russia and Uzbekistan. The third document will be on cooperation in military technical spheres.
