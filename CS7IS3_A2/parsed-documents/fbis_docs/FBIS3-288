He was welcomed upon his descent from the plane by Mrs. Sy Kadiatou Sow, the minister of foreign affairs, Malians abroad and African integration and Jean-Didier Roisin, the French ambassador to Mali. The French cooperation minister spoke, among other things, on the backup measures taken by France in the wake of the devaluation. [passage omitted] Concerning an eventual second devaluation, an issue raised at the recent African finance ministers meeting in Libreville, this is what Mr. Roussin had to say: [Begin Roussin recording] I was not in Libreville. However, I had the pleasure of holding a telephone conversation with President Bongo. I also read the report from that meeting, and I did not glean anywhere the possibility of a second devaluation. The wisdom of the African heads of state is such that this information seems to me erroneous. [end recording]
