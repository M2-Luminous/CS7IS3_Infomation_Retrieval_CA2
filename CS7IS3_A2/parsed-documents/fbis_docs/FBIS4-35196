This observation was made yesterday by Hisham 'Abd-al-Razzaq, a senior Fatah official in the Gaza Strip. "I pity the council members, who are forced to keep promises they are unable to keep." 'Abd-al-Razzaq was chiefly referring to the fact that Western countries had pledged donations and loans to the Palestinians, but have so far failed to make any payments. "The world only cares when it sees blood. It acts only when faced with tragic situations. Not only will the agreement fail, it will become a major atomic bomb if the economic situation in Gaza does not improve." 'Abd-al-Razzaq said the council's performance and the success of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement depended on three conditions: -- The Israeli labor market must be open to all Palestinians (and not merely to the 23,000 who had work permits prior to February). -- Donation funds should start arriving at once, and the positions and tasks in the council and the Palestinian self-rule's institutions should be properly distributed. -- "All those who gave all they could and devoted themselves to the Palestinian struggle should be taken into account" when appointments are made. A month ago 'Abd-al-Razzaq, who spent about 20 years in prison, was mentioned as a possible appointment to the Autonomy Council; this fact was received with great satisfaction in Gaza. "I learned about my alleged appointment from the media, and personally, I would prefer not to take on this thankless job," he told HA'ARETZ yesterday. "But the noninclusion of people who were devoted to the struggle is liable to lead to dire consequence." 'Abd-al-Razzaq went on: "When a man is bitter, when he sees no reward to his deeds and sacrifice, he will not settle for personal disappointment. We are talking here about people who devoted their lives to the struggle. These people's disappointment will have a direct impact on the street." 'Abd-al-Razzaq did not answer our question on whether he and his associates have apprised PLO-Tunis of the importance of incorporating field activists in the council. "It would be better for them to reach this conclusion on their own. I cannot believe they do not understand it," he said. A delegation of about 20 Israeli Arabs, including Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, visited Gaza yesterday. They met with Nasr Yusuf, the General Security commander, in his office situated in what was the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] division building until two weeks ago. Yusuf told the visitors: "We cannot say we are independent yet, but this is our first step to independence." He called for stronger ties between the two parts of the Palestinian people -- "those outside (in the territories) and inside (in Israel)." Dr. al-Tibi echoed the statement that the agreement was the fist step toward full independence, adding that "we will always say that Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state."
