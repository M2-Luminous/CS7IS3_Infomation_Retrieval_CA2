FR940527-1-00203 FR940527-1-00014 We then determined old and new capital amounts for FY 1992 using the PPS&hyph;9 cost reports as the first source of data. Since we matched only 4,653 PPS&hyph;9 cost reports, we also used the provider-specific file for old capital information. Even in cases where a cost report was available, the break out of old and new capital was not always available. In these cases, we used the old capital amounts and new capital ratios from the provider-specific file. If these were missing we derived the old capital amount from the hospital specific rate. Finally, we used the intermediary audit file to develop obligated capital amounts. Some hospitals had indicated that they could not bring the obligated capital on line before the expiration of this provision, so we excluded the obligated amounts for these hospitals from the budget neutrality determination. Since the obligated amounts are aggregate projected amounts, we computed a Medicare capital cost per admission associated with these amounts. We adjusted the aggregate amounts by the following factors: (1) Medicare inpatient share of capital. This was derived from cost reports and was limited to the Medicare share of total inpatient days. It was necessary to limit the Medicare share because of data integrity problems. Medicare share of inpatient days is a reasonably good proxy for allocating capital. However, it may be understated if Medicare utilization is high, and may be overstated because it ignores the outpatient share of capital. (2) Capitalization factor. This factor allocates the aggregate amount of obligated capital to depreciation and interest amounts. Consistent with the assumptions in the capital input price index, we used a 25-year life for fixed capital and a 10-year life for movable capital, and an average projected interest rate of 6.7 percent. We also assumed that fixed capital acquisitions are about one-half of total capital. In conjunction with the useful life and interest rate assumptions, the resulting capitalized fixed capital is about one-half of total capitalization. This is consistent with the allocations between fixed and movable capital found on the cost reports. The ratio we developed is 0.137, which produces the first year capitalization based on the aggregate amount. (3) A divisor of Medicare admissions to derive the capital per discharge amount. Since we must project capital amounts for each hospital, we continued to use a Monte Carlo simulation to develop these amounts. The Monte Carlo simulation is now used only to project capital costs per discharge amounts for each hospital. We analyzed the distributions of capital increases, and noted a slightly negative correlation between the dollar level of capital per admission, and the rate of increase in capital. To determine the rate of increase in capital cost per admission, we multiplied the lesser of $3,000 or the capital cost per admission by .00006 and subtracted this result from 1.2. (Increases for capital levels over $3,000 were not influenced by the level of capital, so this part of the calculation was capped at $3,000.) We selected a random number from the normal distribution, multiplied it by 0.17 (the standard deviation) and added it to ^0.04 (the mean) and then added 1 to create a multiplier. This random result was multiplied by the previous result to assign a rate of increase factor which was multiplied by the prior year's capital per discharge amount to develop a capital per discharge amount for the projected year. To model a projected year, we used the old and new capital for the prior year multiplied by 0.96 (aging factor). The 0.96 aging factor is the average of changes in capital over its life. The aged new and old capital is subtracted from the projected capital described in the previous paragraph. The difference represents newly acquired capital. We assume that the hospital would accrue only a half year of costs for newly acquired capital in the year in which the capital comes on line. This is because, on average, new capital will come on line in the middle of the year. We make the same assumption for obligated capital. If the hospital has obligated capital, the lesser of one half of the adjusted costs (as described in the succeeding paragraph) for newly acquired capital or one half of the costs for obligated capital are deemed to apply to the current year. The full year's costs for new or obligated capital are assumed to apply for the following year. For FY 1994, one half of the costs for any outstanding obligated capital were deemed to apply to FY 1994; a full year's costs were deemed to apply to FY 1995. With the exception of certain hospitals about whom we have information to the contrary, we assume that hospitals would meet the expiration dates provided under the obligated capital provision. The on-line obligated amounts are added to old capital and subtracted from the newly acquired capital to yield residual newly acquired capital, which is then added to new capital. The residual newly acquired capital is never permitted to be less than zero. Next, we computed the average total capital cost per discharge from the capital costs that were generated by the model and compared the results to total capital costs per discharge that we had projected independently of the model. We adjusted the newly acquired capital amounts proportionately, so that the total capital costs per discharge generated by the model match the independently projected capital costs per discharge. Once each hospital's capital-related costs are generated, the model projects capital payments. We use the actual payment parameters (for example, the case-mix index and the geographic adjustment factor), that are applicable to the specific hospital. To project capital payments, the model first assigns the applicable payment methodology (fully prospective or hold-harmless) to the hospital. If available, the model uses the payment methodology indicated in the PPS&hyph;9 cost reports or the provider-specific file. Otherwise, the model determines the methodology by comparing the hospital's FY 1992 hospital-specific rate to the adjusted Federal rate applicable to the hospital. The model simulates Federal rate payments using the assigned payment parameters and hospital-specific estimated outlier payments. The case-mix index for a hospital is derived from the 1993 MedPAR file using the proposed FY 1995 DRG relative weights published in this rule. The case-mix index is increased each year after FY 1993 consistent with the continuing trend in case-mix increase.
