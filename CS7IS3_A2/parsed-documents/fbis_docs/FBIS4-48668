Only yesterday, 500 people crossed the border from Burundi to Rwanda. The returnees have complained that the Red Cross officials in Burundi are preventing the people from returning home. It has been reported that the Red Cross has even tried to shift the refugee camps and take them further into the interior of Burundi so as to make it more difficult for the refugees to return home. The Red Cross in Burundi is not succeeding because the refugees are returning home in large numbers. [passage omitted]
