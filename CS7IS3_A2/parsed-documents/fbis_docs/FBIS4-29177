Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister; and Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, former chairman of the Policy Research Council of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], who are all proponents of a "conservative-conservative coalition," are pushing for a realignment of established political parties on the basis of a policy consensus. They are citing the North Korean nuclear issue as one important policy that needs a consensus. With the current Diet session set to close on 29 June, the North Korean nuclear issue may become not only an important diplomatic task for Japan, but one factor in unsettling the political situation. As far as the North Korean nuclear issue is concerned, the government's position is: "There is no option for Japan but to sincerely carry out what the United Nations decides" (said a senior Foreign Ministry official). Some government officials are voicing concern over Japan's overreaction to North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA, saying: "What is important is that our nation must refrain from making a big fuss. North Korea would be pleased to find its simple announcements or comments trigging a big fuss in Japan" (said a government source). The North Korean nuclear crisis was a hot issue in the Hosokawa government, the handling of which the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] bitterly disputed with Shinseito and Komeito. The SDPJ may become a hurdle for proponents of the "conservative- conservative coalition" who intend to seek a coalition by "putting aside past grudges." While the United Nations is certain to begin a full-fledged debate on sanctions against North Korea, China is still taking a wary position. The prevailing view is that serious domestic debates will be held in "the far future" on how Japan should actually deal with sanctions (said a Foreign Ministry source). In the closing days of the current Diet session, the political situation is expected to be strained over a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet, and the handling of a bill on the demarcation for a new single-seat constituency system and a new proportional representation system; no drastic developments are expected to occur before the current Diet session closes. North Korea has made it clear it wants to negotiate only with the United States. Japanese Government officials are concerned that the "North Korean nuclear issue could become a factor in destabilizing the political situation in Japan" because the issue is bound to strain things (said a senior Foreign Ministry official).
