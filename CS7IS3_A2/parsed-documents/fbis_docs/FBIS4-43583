In other words, this is a confirmation of the tendency to entrust the heritage of the First Republic to forces which are at the same time new in appearance and but the same in social and political substance. Within the context of this tendency there was to be expected, and there has been, a gain on the part of the leading group -- Forza Italia -- which not only promoted the new alignment but granted it substance, visibility, and propaganda (promoted with disproportionate means on a scale never before seen in an election campaign). This advance occurred to the detriment of its government allies -- of the National Alliance, the far-right wing, despite its efforts to impart to the Berlusconi initiative the impetus and the spirit of an electorate that considers itself the breakthrough vanguard. And the League, too, has lost ground -- that is, the coalition's most autonomous and critical movement which, as such, seemed out of tune with the consolidation of the newly established government framework. Overall, Berlusconi has received the confirmation he wanted -- achieved under the best psychological conditions and thanks to a deployment of resources that scandalized impartial observers but that must have attracted many vacillating voters. Accepting the fact that no thinking person could have expected a reversal of the tendencies expressed in March, and that such a radical reversal of the political balances could only, and can only, entail lengthy time periods and experiments, it must be noted that the progressive alignment basically withstood the test, with different kinds of variations within it that bear witness to the reality of a variety of forces that must be exploited. The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] suffered a setback, but quite clearly remains the most substantial group in the democratic opposition; and this position requires that it emerge more clearly and more quickly from the internal reflections that the voters may have interpreted as uncertainty and invisibility. As for the center opposition, which also lost some ground, it should be noted that it was not overwhelmed, as some predicted, by the irresistible siren's call of Berlusconi: It is still a force to be reckoned with, though it must quickly answer the question of which side it stands on. The Italian vote (whose result will have to be combined with that in the local elections) lies within the context of an overall European tendency in which there are conflicting results from country to country. Against the background of a moderate and right-wing offensive, we see various kinds of response (from the Labor victory to Kohl's recovery) that nevertheless grant the socialist forces a leading role that will influence the prospects for European integration. Italy is sending to the European Parliament a delegation that will curb, if it is actually not hostile to, the cause of political union, and it is on this front too that the future political and social struggle in our country will take place.
