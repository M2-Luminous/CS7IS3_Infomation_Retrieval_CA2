FR941013-2-00154 FR941013-2-00104 Determination Under Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act On July 31, 1994, the United States identified Japan under Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 2515, as amended) as a country that maintains, in government procurement of telecommunications and medical technology goods and services, a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against U.S. products or services that results in identifiable harm to U.S. businesses. Since that time, we have held intensive discussions with the Government of Japan to resolve the identified discriminatory practices. Sanctions were scheduled to go into effect on September 30, 1994. On October 1, 1994, the United States reached an agreement with the Government of Japan relating to procurement of telecommunications and medical technology goods and services, which will address the discrimination identified by the United States. The procurement measures to be implemented by the Government of Japan and an accompanying exchange of letters between the United States and Japan represent a significant change in Japanese Government practices in the procurement of telecommunications and medical technology goods and services and address all the major U.S. concerns in these sectors. Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the President of the United States by Presidential Determination No. 94&hyph;52 of September 29, 1994, I have determined that implementation of the agreement with Japan will eliminate the discrimination identified under Title VII and therefore terminated sanctions effective September 30, 1994. Dated: October 4, 1994. Michael Kantor, United States Trade Representative. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25352 Filed 10&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3190&hyph;01&hyph;M
