The Black Sea Fleet press office told INTERFAX that the two sides discussed the future locations of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy, proportions for the fleet's division and social guarantees for the two countries' navy servicemen. The two sides agreed that the issue should be solved in a civilized political way taking into account good-neighborly relations between Russia and Ukraine and the existing realities. The two delegations recognized the fact that the Black Sea Fleet should not be a cause of discord between friendly states. At the same time, the press office said that Ukraine's stance at the talks did not correspond to the constructive spirit which was characteristic of the Russian delegation's approach. "An impression is being created that the representatives of the Ukrainian navy are trying to denounce the Moscow agreement of 15 April," the press office pointed out. "The Ukrainian side is allowing itself dual interpretation of the Moscow agreement on separate locations for the two fleets and the proportions of its division. Ukraine still insists on placing the main bases of both fleets in Sevastopol, which runs counter not only to logic but also to the will of the two presidents and the latest decisions by the Sevastopol city council," said the press office. "Nevertheless, the Russian delegation hopes for a triumph of common sense over political ambitions and is ready for further negotiations. Russia does not take responsibility for a possible disruption in the constructive dialog," the press office said.
