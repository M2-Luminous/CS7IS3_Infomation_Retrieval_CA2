He will be in Tokyo from Thursday to Saturday, meeting Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for private and expanded summits. He stops in Shanghai on Saturday and arrives in Beijing on Sunday. His schedule there includes talks with President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng. Building economic links was to top the agenda until last week, when North Korea's nuclear program created an unanticipated crisis. The U.N. Security Council is poised to adopt a resolution on Pyongyang early next week, and securing Beijing's tacit approval is a must before the international community can take unified action. Kim and his wife will call on Japanese Emperor Akihito on the afternoon of his arrival and then have a private summit with Hosokawa. The two leaders will look at ways to build forward-looking relations after agreeing last summer to close the book on a past stained by Japanese colonial rule over Korea from 1910-45. The South Korean president addresses the Japanese Diet on Friday and is to receive an honorary doctorate from Waseda University. He meets Hosokawa again on Saturday before leaving for Shanghai, this time accompanied by his cabinet ministers. In Shanghai, Kim will tour the complex that used to house the Korean Government-in-exile during the Japanese colonial years. He starts his Beijing itinerary Monday morning in a summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, where he will likely ask Beijing to intervene in the North Korean nuclear standoff. Kim will also address bilateral trade issues at the summit. He plans to speak at Beijing University on new Seoul-Beijing relations and tour South Korea's exclusive industrial complex in Tianjin before returning home on March 30.
