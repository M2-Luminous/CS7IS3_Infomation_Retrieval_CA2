Currently, these negative trends are progressing. This caused the Defense Ministry to release a statement. The statement says that lately some political structures have made attempts to speak on behalf of the Armed Forces trying to impose their own presidential candidate. Worries are also triggered by antiarmy sentiments present in the programs and speeches of some presidential candidates. In connection with this, the Defense Ministry states that the Armed Forces decisively dissociates itself from all attempts made by political parties and organizations to involve it in battles for power. Another segment from the statement released by the Collegium of the Defense Ministry states: Servicemen are full-fledged citizens of the Republic. During the elections, they have the right to exercise their constitutional right, to express their own will, and to vote for any candidate who actually has the interests of the state in mind.
