FR941212-0-00129 FR941212-0-00019 (2) When a claimant fails to provide timely notice to perfect a claim against his or her private insurer, the amount allowed, absent good cause, the claim will be denied. In determining whether a claimant has good cause for failing to provide timely notice to a private insurer, the JA will, in addition to the considerations in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, determine whether the claimant (or agent) had knowledge of the requirement and willfully neglected to provide notice. See §536.170(f) for cases where a claimant refuses to provide information concerning private insurance. (3) Good cause is determined as follows: (i) When a claimant fails to provide timely notice to a carrier, warehouse firm, or private insurer, settlement and approval authorities may waive reduction action for good cause only when one of the following circumstances directly contributed to the claimant's failure to give timely notice: (A) Officially recognized absence (for example TDY and off post training exercises) resulting in claimant's absence from official duty station for a significant portion of the notice period; (B) Hospitalization of claimant for a significant portion of the notice period; or (C) Substantiated misinformation concerning notice requirements given to the claimant by government personnel. (ii) Requests for good cause waivers under circumstances other than those in paragraph (a) of this section may be granted only be the Commander, USARCS, or designee. (4) Prior to taking reduction action, the JA will ensure the claimant is provided an opportunity to explain the circumstances of his or her failure to take appropriate action, and that the claim file is documented to show the claimant was afforded this opportunity and the result provided. The chronology sheet in the file will contain an explanation of the JA's decision regarding reduction or the lack thereof. (b) Information and assistance to claimants. Claims personnel will_ (1) Furnish the necessary claims forms (DD Form 1842 and DD Form 1844) to any individual who indicates, in person or by letter, that he or she desires to be compensated for loss or damage to personal property incident to service. (2) Furnish instructions and advice as to the evidence required to substantiate the claim, assist in the completion of claim forms, and help with the procurement of evidence in support of the loss and the amount claimed. (3) Assure that the description of the items and the damage shown on DD Form 1844 are sufficiently detailed to permit verification of the purchase price and replacement price or repair cost of the item claimed. (4) Inform a claimant of the time limits within which a claim must be filed in order to considered. (5) Inform all claimants that they must file and settle with their private insurance companies before the JA/claims attorney will approve a claim for payment under this subpart. Claimants who state they have no insurance will be asked to certify that fact and the written statement will be included in the claim file. The claimant will be required to submit proof of final action by the insurer. Claims personnel will examine each claim after an insurance settlement and determine if prior settlement by the insurer (including excess valuation coverage) is more advantageous to the claimant. A claims JA/attorney may decide to approve a claim for payment under this subpart without a claimant first settling with his or her insurance in exceptional cases where an insurance company improperly refuses to pay a claim or the JA determines the claimant has good cause (see §536.181(a) (2) and (3). (6) Advise a claimant to notify the JA of any offer of settlement or denial of liability by any third party, and to secure the JA's written consent before executing a release or acceptance of any such offer. (7) Take an active and continuing role in publicizing claims information to soldiers and their families. (c) Other actions. The JA will ensure that_ (1) DD Form 1840R is dispatched to the appropriate third party within 75 days of delivery of goods, that a copy of the DD Form 1840 and 1840R is dispatched to the destination transportation office, in appropriate cases, and that a signed and dated copy is maintained and incorporated into any claim filed. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;55.) (2) The servicing transportation office is directed to inspect damaged property in appropriate cases. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;41). (3) The DD Form 1844 is completed (amount allowed column, remarks column, and where appropriate, either or both columns for exceptions) prior to settling the claim. (4) All documents written in a foreign language are translated into English, either verbatim or in summarized form. (5) Unearned freight charges are deducted for property which carriers lose or irreparably damage. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;27.) (6) A claims office representative will periodically attend local transportation office outbound briefings to ensure that appropriate information is being disseminated to soldiers. (7) Inspection by claims office personnel are conducted in appropriate cases (large claim, reconsideration, fraudulent claim) and incorporated into the file. (d) Financial. The JA will properly manage claims funds. This includes_ (1) On a monthly basis, reconcile recovery accounts with the servicing finance and accounting office (FAO) to insure moneys are being properly deposited into the correct account; (2) On a monthly basis, reconcile expenditure accounts with the servicing FAO to ensure that FAO expenditures match claims office expenditures; and (3) Ensuring expenditures are from current fiscal year accounts. §536.182 Finality of settlement. Except as provided in §536.180(b), the settlement of a claim is final and conclusive for all purposes (31 U.S.C. 3721(k)). Recovery From Third Party §536.183 Scope.
