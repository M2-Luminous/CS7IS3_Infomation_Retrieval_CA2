C. Huang and Sofia Wu] [Text] San Salvador [words indistinct] Armando Calderon Sol assumes office, ROC [Republic of China] Ambassador Andrew J. P. Shen said Tuesday [31 May]. "The ROC and El Salvador have enjoyed long-term friendly ties and this relationship is not expected to change under Calderon's leadership," Shen told the CNA in an interview. During his visit to Taipei last October, Shen said, Calderon assured senior ROC officials that he will strengthen cooperation with the ROC and support Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations if he wins the presidential election. "Calderon was pleased when I told him recently that Premier Lien Chan would attend his inauguration," Shen noted. Lien, who served as ROC ambassador to El Salvador in the 1970s, is an old friend of Calderon. Lien, heading a 21-member entourage, will arrive in San Salvador Tuesday night to attend the inaugural ceremony scheduled for Wednesday. After a 12-year civil war, Shen said, the Central American country badly needs international assistance to rebuild its battered economy. El Salvador provides many incentives, including a 10-year tax holiday, to attract foreign investors, Shen noted. "I hope more Taiwan businessmen can invest here to help boost this country's economic development." Shen said Taiwan companies can use El Salvador as a gateway to the North American market because the United States imposes no quota restrictions on Salvadoran products. El Salvador has also joined with Guatemala and Honduras to sign a "free trade agreement" with Mexico to allow freer flow of commodities in the region. There are some 10 Taiwan-owned companies in El Salvador, mainly producing garments for export. Shen said there is still ample room for Taiwan-Salvadoran trade to grow. Taiwan exported US$20.7 million worth of goods to El Salvador in 1992, while importing US$50 million worth of Salvadoran products.
