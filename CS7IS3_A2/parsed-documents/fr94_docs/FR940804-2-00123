Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 15 plaintiffs are entitled to recover threefold the damages sustained plus prejudgment interest plus attorneys fees. Wherefore, Plaintiffs request judgment against Defendant for $300,000.00 plus interest from October 21, 1991, at the federal judgment rate plus reasonable attorneys fees. Count III 45. By dealing directly with the University of Pittsburgh Athletic Department before the expiration of the exclusive negotiating period under the Department's contract with Gianotti, KBL tortiously interfered with his advantageous contractual and business relationship with the Department. 46. By dealing directly with Gianotti's advertisers such as Carriage Limousine and Coors Beer, KBL tortiously interfered with his advantageous business relationships with them. 47. Because of the conduct of KBL, Dennis F. Gianotti was forced out of the business he built up which in 1990 generated gross receipts of $325,102.65 and a net profit to him of $12,273.80. 48. Had KBL not so conducted itself, Gianotti's business would have grown and he would have been able to earn far more than $50,000.00. 49. The fair market value of the Gianotti's business prior to the said course of conduct of defendants was in excess of $100,000.00. Wherefore, Plaintiffs demand compensatory damages of at least $100,000.00 and such punitive damages as the court deems just. K.
