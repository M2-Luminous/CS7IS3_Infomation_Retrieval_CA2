The Danish company N.R. Konsult A/C worked for 15 months on the composition of a project for the development of business in the region. The republic itself was the project client. The situation with Western investors prompted it to take this step. Their interest in the northern riches is enormous, but specific cooperation is arranged with great difficulty. And although one-tenth of all foreign investments in Russia is already in Komi today, this is not the limit, by far. But in order to interest Western investors, a guarantee of the firms to which they are committed is necessary and, in addition, projects are needed that are drawn up taking into account the world practice in preparing documents of this kind. The Danish company has undertaken to perform this work. Its interests coincided with the readiness of the Danish Government for cooperation with Russia; therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark allocated the resources to cover the hard currency part of the costs. A project office, which received the name "Master Plan," was opened a year ago in Syktyvkar. From the Danish side, representatives of an aggregate of 10 companies participated in the work on Komi territory. Komi enterprises assumed the ruble part of the costs. Scientists and leading specialists of branches of the economy of the republic took part in the collection, processing, and analysis of materials. The results of the work were formulated in the reports "Concerning the Problems and Capabilities of the Komi Republic" and "Concerning Strategic Recommendations," and "A Catalog of Projects." Incidentally, implementation of part of these projects has already been started. The presentation of the Master Plan was held recently in Syktyvkar. Danish specialists and managers turned out to be a step ahead of other foreign companies: As a result of the work that has been done, they now possess not only the most accurate and detailed information, but they have also concluded very specific business contacts with entrepreneurs of the Komi Republic.
