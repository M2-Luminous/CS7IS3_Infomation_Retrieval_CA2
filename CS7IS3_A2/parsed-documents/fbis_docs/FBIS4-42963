Our correspondent, Filippo Landi, asked the President of Slovenia Milan Kucan, if today Slovenia considered Italy to be a hostile country. Let us hear what he had to say: [Kucan] It is difficult to think of hostility between one state and another. Perhaps there are political orientations and parties, or even single individuals who are hostile. At this time it is difficult to evaluate official Italian policy with regard to Slovenia. We must wait and see what Italy's position will be and then we will decide. [Landi] President, would you shake hands with a representative of the Italian Government who was also a member of the National Alliance? [Kucan] For me shaking hands is a confirmation of the respect, of the willingness to talk to a person. The sole fact that an individual belongs to a different party, even if that party is a fascist one, is not sufficient reason not to shake hands. [Landi] Slovenia wants to join the European Union, but in that case why is not possible to put an end -- as Italy is asking -- to the contentious dispute between the two countries, which is a consequence of World War II. [Kucan] I do not understand Italy's position. Here we are talking about Slovenia joining the European Union. We must satisfy all the criteria, even the economic ones, in order to join Europe. We must also adhere to a general European policy. What you are talking about refers to a question that concerns only bilateral relations.
