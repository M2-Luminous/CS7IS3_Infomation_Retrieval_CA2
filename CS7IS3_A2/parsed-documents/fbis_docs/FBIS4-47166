Rubets, deputy chairman of the Ukrahrokhim Association, chief of the administration of the state plant protection service, and M. Lisovyy, director of the Ukrainian Institute of Plant Protection of the Ukrainian Academy of Agricultural Sciences [UAAN], academician: "We Will Protect Our Grain"] [Text] Severe frosts and autumn sowing shortfalls significantly narrowed the winter grain crops wedge [on the pie chart]. Now another problem has been added: the crops are being threatened by pests, disease, and weeds. Grain crops are in danger of being harmed by the gout fly, oat leaf beetle, cereal flea beetle, and other pests. But the greatest threat in the southern, forest-steppe, and steppe regions comes from the sunn pest. Despite severe winter frosts, its numbers remain very high, especially in Zaporizhzhya, Kherson, and Mykolayiv oblasts, and a number of rayons of Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, and Kirovohrad oblasts. The diseases posing a danger include septoria, powdery mildew, and root rot, which have appeared on winter wheat in a number of rayons in Zhytomyr, Donetsk, Chernivtsi, and other oblasts. As to weeds -- it goes without saying that with no herbicides and fuel to speak of, they have moved in widely in recent years. What should be done? If there is dense weed growth in the tillering phase, sown areas are sprayed with 40-percent amino salt 2,4-D (1.5-2.5 liters per hectare), 70-percent sodium salt 2m-4X (1.5-2 liters per hectare), and 40-percent dialen (1.9-2.3 liters per hectare). To control the sunn pest (when numbering two, three, or more per square meter) and other pests during the mass infestation of winter wheat (in the booting phase), spring wheat and barley (tillering phase), it is necessary to spray the sown areas or around them in a 100-meter-wide strip with 40-percent metaphoson (0.5-0.7 liter per hectare), or 40-percent phosphamidon (1-1.5 liters per hectare), or 2.5-percent decis (0.25 liter per hectare). On spring crops, if the tilling dates coincide, mixtures of these insecticides and herbicides may be used in the recommended doses. If more than one percent of the plants are affected by powdery mildew, or more than five percent by septoria in conditions of high humidity, high temperatures, and frequent rains, the plants should be sprayed with 25-percent [bayleton] (0.5 liters per hectare), 25-percent [tylt] (0.5 liters per hectare), and 40-percent [alto] (0.15-0.2 liters per hectare). Controlling pests and diseases should be combined by using mixtures of insecticides and fungicides in the recommended doses.
