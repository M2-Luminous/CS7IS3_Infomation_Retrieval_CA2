A moral Rubicon was crossed. A responsibility was accepted, finally. The Atlantic Council involves not just Europe. The Alliance's three non-European members played a key role in the tormented Brussels discussions: the United States and Turkey for, Canada against. And undoubtedly because the principal product of the decision was a new European firmness. By France in particular. But also by Italy, the first to demand a "concrete reaction" to the [Sarajevo] market massacre. The others followed. The Russian threats, offered in Moscow, not only by nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and by a Duma at the mercy of every whim, but also by Boris Yeltsin in person, were ignored. The vicious circle of reasoning, which always imagined that military action would be followed by a worse reaction and which ended up taking no action at all, has been broken. Something has shifted: too late, perhaps, but for once, not too little. Of course, a 12-hour meeting is not enough to change Europe. The idiosyncrasies, the tactics, and the hidden agendas remain. National interests are guiding governments. Greece is no less against any anti-Serb policy than before. Britain does not hope less than before that nothing will be done. Nonetheless, the NATO Council decided unanimously. And yesterday, whether out of conviction or out of opportunism, everyone voted yes. What will happen now? The Brussels communique is not the last word. The final decision, the final go-ahead to order an attack by the Alliance's fighter bombers, lies with Butrus-Ghali. The "Bosnian operation" is in fact being carried out under the UN blue banner, not under the 12-starred one of the European Union, or under NATO's pink one. Yesterday's will only be a typed piece of paper placed in full view on the secretary general's desk on the 38th floor of UN Headquarters, alongside the reports of the blue helmets' field commanders and of "special envoy" Yasushi Akashi. After 10 days, they will report whether the Serbs have effectively withdrawn their heavy artillery surrounding Sarajevo, and whether the UN contingent will or will not be overly exposed to any reprisals. The inscrutable Butrus will get up from his desk, look out of his window over the East River running at his feet, will weigh up the pros and cons -- possibly more concerned with his own political fortune than the fate of peace and war -- and will pronounce his decision. For this reason it is possible that yesterday's decision will remain a dead letter. Maybe, at the moment of decision in the Atlantic Council's meeting chamber, more than one representative calculated this way. To know how things will end up, one can only wait and see. But whatever happens, yesterday's date marks a point of no return. It will now be difficult for Sarajevo's martyrdom to be relegated to the darkness of indifference, cynicism, and abject inaction. One does not lose one's credibility twice. The 16 ambassadors who laboriously concluded the Atlantic Council's communique, while acting under instructions from their governments, had good reason to rejoice yesterday evening. Many hours before the conclusion of the session, Serbian and Bosnian military chiefs in Sarajevo had granted UN General Michael Rose and the Bosnian army a cease-fire and intimated their readiness to withdraw their heavy artillery. It is not the first time such a pledge has been made, and there is no reason to believe it will be kept this time any more than other times. But it is a sign that firmness pays, and that the West's determination is worrying Sarajevo's besiegers. In the words of French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe: "If the Serbs withdraw, I would like to twist their arm a little more."
