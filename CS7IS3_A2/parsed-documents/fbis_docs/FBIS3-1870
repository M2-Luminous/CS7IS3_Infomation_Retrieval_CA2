Military officials from the two countries met for the first time to exchange views on defense policies of the two countries as well as the military situation in the Asia-Pacific region, said Ken Sato, a defense councilor of Japan's Defense Agency. Zhan Maohai, deputy director of China's Ministry of National Defense Foreign Affairs Bureau, represented the Chinese side. The Japanese side indirectly expressed concern over China's military buildup and urged that China make military information public in such forms as a defense white paper, noting that China's neighbors have an increased interest in Chinese defense matters, according to Sato. The Chinese side reportedly said that the increase of its defense budget was partly due to inflation and that China's military is for defensive purposes only.
