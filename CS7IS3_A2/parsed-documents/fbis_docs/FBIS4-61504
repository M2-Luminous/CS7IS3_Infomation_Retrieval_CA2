The most important question in the negotiations was the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic countries. [Begin Bildt recording] I think there is a Russian will to withdraw. We have had a dialogue around these questions and other questions concerning the Baltic countries, and I believe that this has been of importance, both for Russian policies and for developments generally. [end recording] Last week, the presidents of Russia and Latvia signed an agreement on Russian troops withdrawing from Latvia on 31 August at the latest. The Russian Army has already been withdrawn from Lithuania, so the only remaining country now is Estonia. Prime Minister Bildt has involved himself deeply in this matter, and Estonia was also the main theme at the negotiations between Bildt and Foreign Minister Kozyrev. A vital question is, what sort of status the thousands of retired Russian military personnel will have, people who often are not older than 40-50 years; Russia managed to sign a special agreement with Latvia which will regulate their position in the society: They have the right to stay in Latvia but they will not receive Latvian citizenship. Estonia has refused point-blank to sign any special agreement, and said that Russian military personnel will be subject to the laws on citizenship and laws on aliens which already exist. It looks, at least on paper, that it is Estonia which right now is most actively stopping an agreement on getting the troops to leave. So the question is, should Prime Minister Bildt not be putting pressure on Estonia, instead of Russia? [Begin Bildt recording] No, I think such pressure should lie mainly on the Russians, because it is Russia which has troops in Estonia; it is not Estonia which has troops in Russia. It is a fundamental principle in international law that one is not allowed to have troops on the territory of other states without the agreement of these states. There are a number of questions which have been raised in connection with this from the Russian side; those questions we will also try to solve, but they are not allowed to be decisive; the withdrawal of the troops must be completed by 31 August.
