In a communique, Secretary Ebrane Cadet has expressed the Senate's astonishment upon reading the letter sent by a group of legislators who went, informally, to Washington. Cadet said that he was surprised to see that the legislators referred to Senator Firmin Jean-Louis as president of the Senate. The letter was also signed by Senator Yvon Gislain, calling himself Senate secretary. The office headed by Sansaricq expressed a number of reservations regarding this matter, recalling that under a 4 February resolution the former office, headed by Firmin Jean-Louis, was duly dismissed and replaced by the current office, headed by Bernard Sansaricq.
