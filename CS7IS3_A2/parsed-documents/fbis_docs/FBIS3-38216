The so-called European Agreements give the two East European countries greater access to the EC for their products, and provide for an enhanced political dialogue. The EC commissioners for foreign relations and foreign trade, Hans van den Broek and Leon Brittan, said the accords, signed in December 1991 but not fully ratified until last December, constituted "a landmark." They said in a statement: "It enables the parties to fully develop their political and economic cooperation in the context of their future membership of the European Union (also known as the EC)." The agreements give no firm date for membership of the EC, although they state this as an ultimate objective. The trade terms of the accords have been in effect since March 1, 1992. They commit the EC to a gradual lifting of tariff barriers against industrial products to create a free trade zone. But some barriers against some products considered sensitive in the EC will remain for several years to protect European industries. Thus tariffs on steel and coal will remain intact until January 1996, and various textile tariffs for another one or two years. Tariffs and quotas on agricultural goods will be gradually lowered until July 1995. Poland and Hungary will be given a little longer, until end-1998 and end-2001 respectively, to open their markets to products from the EC, and adopt the Community's competition laws. The EC has also negotiated European agreements with the Czech and Slovak republics, Romania and Bulgaria. But these have not yet been finalised. In 1992 the EC chalked up a combined trade surplus of ECU2.5 billion ($2.8 billion) with the six countries.
