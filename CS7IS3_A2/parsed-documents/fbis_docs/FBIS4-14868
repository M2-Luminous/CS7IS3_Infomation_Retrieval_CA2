"We do not need your Council of Europe. We do not ask for it. On the contrary, it is you who need us", leader of a powerful faction in the russian parliament told reporters on arrival in Helsinki. A delegation of Russian lawmakers is due to take part in a parliamentary seminar here on prospects of the Russian membership of the Council of Europe. Zhirinovskiy stressed that his party (ultra-nationalist party misleadingly called Liberal-Democratic) "has nothing against Finland". He complained that Finnish journalists lack true information, apparently referring to local media reports repeatedly calling him an advocate of Finland's re-joining Russia.
