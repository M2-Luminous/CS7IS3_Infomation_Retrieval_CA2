Li made the remarks while meeting a group of Hong Kong media representatives at the presidential office. He said the government has been very concerned about the lives and well-being of Chinese in Hong Kong, and said regulations are now being drafted governing relations with Hong Kong, as well as Macao, to safeguard the rights and interests of the two colonies' residents after they revert to mainland rule in 1997 and 1999, respectively. Turning to cross-strait relations, Li said Hong Kong has and will continue to have an important role to play. He said that instead of seeking detente with the mainland, as it has done in the past, Taipei in the future wilt try to push ahead with peaceful and positive exchanges with the mainland. He said people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should increase their mutual trust to build a foundation for national unification, but that the world should also understand that China is now divided and under separate rule. He rejected Beijing's claim to sovereignty over Taiwan, saying that from a historical point of view, Tokyo returned Taiwan and Penghu to the ROC in the peace treaty it signed with Taipei in 1952. "The Chinese Communists have never taken a step on Taiwan, nor have they collected a penny of tax from people on the island, so how can they justify their sovereignty claim over Taiwan?" Li asked. He said the reason he called mainland officials "a bunch of bandits" after the March 31 Lake Qiandao disaster, in which 24 Taiwan tourists and eight mainland guides and crew were robbed and murdered, was because they had in the beginning tried to avoid taking responsibility for the incident.
