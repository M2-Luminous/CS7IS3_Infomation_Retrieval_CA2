Their assessments strongly diverge. Some believe that the Russian Armed Forces pose a threat to the security of some neighboring states, while others conclude that the Russian military is today incapable of performing its mission of protecting the Fatherland. There are many opinions, but only one truth. What is it then? Before that, a word about one assessment, that of the President. He believes that the Russian Armed Forces are presently combat-ready and as a whole are accomplishing their assigned missions. That is what it says in the presidential Message to the Federal Assembly. But now, let us distance ourselves for a time from the official assessment and conclusions of various independent and dependent experts and analysts, and let us try to see, through the prism of factual material, what baggage the Russian Army has carried with it to its two-year anniversary. Here then are the facts. In the Russian Army, basic reliance is placed on the Strategic Nuclear Forces (SYaS), which deter an aggressor from unleashing large-scale wars against Russia, and no less importantly, allow us to reorganize the General-Purpose Forces. Undoubtedly one can speak of existing difficulties encountered in the Russian SYaS. In the Strategic Rocket Forces (RVSN), for example, today they are doing the difficult job of withdrawing missile units from the territories of Belarus and Kazakhstan. But there is no reason to doubt the combat capacity of the Russian SYaS and their readiness to perform the mission assigned to them. Incidentally, dozens of journalists who were invited to the ceremony assigning three missile regiments, armed with the mobile RS-12M (Topol) missile systems, to the RVSN were convinced of this just recently. The General-Purpose Forces have also been transformed in these two years. Today, in the military lexicon it is increasingly rare to hear regrets being voiced about the fact that the best troops, the troops of the border districts of yesterday's still-united power have been left in the near abroad. And this is primarily because the Russian western districts, the Northern Caucasus, Moscow and Leningrad districts, are being qualitatively transformed. And one other thing about the new quality of the General-Purpose Forces: The principle of mobile defense, which was made the basis for creation of the troop groupings (it presupposes the availability of small but adequately strong forces ready for operational use wherever there is a real threat to Russian security) has acquired tangible outlines. The active creation of Mobile Forces, as a new inter-service operational-strategic formation of the Russian Army, has begun. Reform year 1994. In order to create qualitatively new Armed Forces which meet the demands of the present military-political situation in the world and their tendencies of development, and [correspond to] the real degree of military danger to Russia, in 1994 the main tasks will be: - continuation of the development of troop (force) groupings and infrastructure on the territory of the Russian Federation - conclusion of the withdrawal of troops (forces) to the territory of Russia - creation of Mobile Forces - conduct of research to justify the structure, composition and numerical strength of the Armed Forces for the period after 1995 - development of a concept of development of the RF Armed Forces from 1996 to the year 2000 and in the future up to the year 2005. Another fact. Despite the costs incurred by the start of the development of the Armed Forces and the grave economic situation of the country, questions of combat readiness and operational and mobilization training were resolved with rare persistence and consistency. In 1993, according to official statements, the Russian Army moved to a new system of combat readiness. After this came a chain of major exercises and training sessions at the strategic level. These were conducted by the Minister of Defense and his deputies. To name just a few: the command-staff exercises "Zapad," "Tsenter," and "Vostok," the strategic training sessions to repel an aerospace attack, and in command and control of the SYaS and the Armed Forces as a whole. Around 100 operational exercises and training sessions were conducted under the leadership of the CINCs of the Armed Services and the commanders of military districts and fleets. Operational and mobilization training were directed toward assimilation of the new system of combat readiness and the newly developed operational plans of the troops and naval forces. Reform Year 1994. The most important task is maintaining units and tactical formations in combat readiness and combat capability at a level ensuring the protection of the state under any conditions, and accomplishment of the tasks defined by the Basic Provisions of Military Doctrine. In the four months of 1994, the plans for training of troops and naval forces were basically accomplished. Two command-staff training sessions were held at the strategic level, more than ten command-staff training sessions at the operational-strategic level, and the regional command-staff exercises "Baykal" and "Severo-Zapad" were held. Before the end of the training year, plans are to conduct one training session in command and control of the Strategic Nuclear Forces, and a number of front command-staff exercises and the operational-rear exercise "Zapad." These exercises help prevent a reduction in the level of combat readiness, promote proficiency of the troops and naval forces and coordination of the command and control elements and troops withdrawn to Russian territory to new garrison points. The Russian Army is demonstrating its combat capacity not only in exercises. Its units and tactical formations are successfully accomplishing peacekeeping functions in accordance with the international obligations of our country. Two separate Russian battalions are helping to keep the peace in Yugoslavia. Units of the 201st Motorized Rifle Division, garrisoned in Tajikistan, are participating with the Collective Peacekeeping Forces in guarding and defending the Tajik-Afghan border and the most important economic installations; in patrolling, escorting columns with humanitarian cargoes, and acting as a guarantor of peace and security in the region. There are peacekeeping efforts of Russian subunits in Pridnestrovye, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia. A total of more than 16 thousand service members have been put into action in the "hot spots." These examples are just a fraction of the components that go into the combat capacity of the Russian Army and the degree of work that has been done in two years to reform the units and tactical formations inherited from the USSR Armed Forces. Let me focus the attention of the reader on this point. Today there is a lot of talk about the great manpower shortage of subunits and units, which affects their combat capability. Today this is problem number one. But paradoxical as it may seem, it is being resolved. The manning of the subunits has increased in two years, and is currently at around the 65% level. And this while the existing legislation allows the drafting of scarcely more than 20% of conscripts. This breakthrough became possible because reliance was put in time on a mixed manning system, by contract and conscription. At present there are more than 160 thousand professionals in uniform. Reform Year 1994: The draft remains the basis of manning. However, around 80% of young men have legal grounds for exemption or deferment from conscription (in other states they are no more than 20-30% of conscripts). For this reason, there are high hopes in the program for manning the army and navy with contract service members. In 1994, 150 thousand professionals will be selected, of them 14 thousand women. In speaking of the Russian Army today, one must say that its development and the course of military reform as a whole are associated with many difficulties which are objective in nature. Thus, the creation of troop groupings is directly linked to the laborious task of withdrawing units and tactical formations to the territory of Russia. (In 1993, for example, more than 100 thousand service members were withdrawn, more than 5 thousand pieces of armored equipment and artillery systems, and around 700 combat planes and helicopters). The withdrawal of units and formations requires their accommodation and creation of new elements of the infrastructure. What is the result? Despite the fact that the withdrawal of troops is being implemented according to plan, in accordance with the schedules that were devised, it is significantly outstripping the rate of [troop] accommodation. While in 1992 there were 98 thousand service families lacking apartments, today there are more than 120 thousand. These figures cannot be heard without pain. Not only are apartments in short supply, but also the corresponding elements of the infrastructure, academic, material and technical facilities, and much else. The leadership of the Armed Forces aims to prevent a critical military-technical and technological lag behind the developed states of the world in the main areas of development of military equipment. Despite this fact, because of the cut in the military budget, the purchases of the latest weapon models have been reduced. Here, it is not irrelevant to point out that, as was noted at a press conference by the Defense Minister, General of the Army Pavel Grachev, today the Russian Army allows itself only those expenses without which it cannot get along, and which are associated with supporting the activity of the troops and personnel. There have been substantial changes in the structure of the military budget, and its tendency toward reorientation in the direction of the social sphere is clearly evident. Reorientation of the military budget is not a tribute to fashion, but is a forced measure associated with tight financing--especially since it is necessary to accomplish a truly state-level task, safeguarding the prestige of serving in the Armed Forces. As you know, our Army has always drawn its strength from its people. Approaches toward accomplishing this task today are defined, and consist in an able combination of legislative means, financial and material incentives, and propaganda and educational measures. While the approaches have been determined, the main work lies ahead. Problems, difficulties, problems. There are many of them. But for all that, it seems to me that the Russian Army has arrived at its second anniversary as an army which is gathering combat might, an army capable of accomplishing its mission of defending the Russian state.
