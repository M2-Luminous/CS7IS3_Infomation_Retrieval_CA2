FBIS4-50152 "drchi094_v_94014" FBIS-CHI-94-094 Daily Report 16 May 1994 TAIWAN Official Objects To Change in International Dialing Code Official Objects To Change in International Dialing Code OW1605112494 Taipei CNA in English 0814 GMT 16 May 94 OW1605112494 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Sofia Wu] [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- Taiwan will never agree to a proposed change in its country code for international direct dialing (IDD) service, a telecommunications official said Monday [15 May]. "We hope to retain the current IDD country code, 886, as we have used it for more than 20 years," said Steven Y. Chen, director-general of the Directorate General of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications. IDD country codes are usually located by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), an affiliate of the United Nations. As Taiwan is not a UN member, its country code has not been formally registered with the Switzerland-based international telecommunications organization. Taiwan was first allowed to use the 886 country code in the early 1970s through informal talks with ITU and several major western countries, Chen noted. Beijing urged ITU to force Taiwan to change its IDD country code to 866 five years ago in an attempt to signify its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan, Chen reported. Mainland China's IDD country code is 86. Chen said ITU has so far not formally informed Taiwan that it plans to change Taiwan's current IDD country code. "Even if we are forced to change our IDD country code in the future, we would never accept the Beijing-proposed politically significant code," Chen stressed. Taiwan has resisted the use of the 866 code because it might create the misleading impression that Taiwan is under Beijing's jurisdiction. As the world's 15th largest IDD user, Chen said, Taiwan should not be forced to change its country code for any political reasons. "We'll ask friendly ITU member nations to help us uphold our present IDD country code," he said. Taiwan was forced to abandon its 785 and 789 country codes for international telex services in March after the ITU formally allocated the codes to Kazakstan and Turkmenistan respectively. Taiwan now uses 769 as its country code for international telex services. Local companies said they have received many complaints from their foreign customers during the past month saying their telex messages had been mistakenly transmitted to the two former Soviet States.
