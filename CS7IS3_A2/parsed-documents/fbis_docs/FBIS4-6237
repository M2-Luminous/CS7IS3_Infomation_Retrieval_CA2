Branding the deployment of Patriot by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets as a total breach of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and the North-South joint declaration on denuclearization and an undisguised military provocation aimed at unleashing another war, a thermonuclear war in Korea at any cost, the statement says: The introduction of the Patriot rejected in other regions is an inevitable product of the despicable flunkeyist and treacherous policy pursued by the Kim Yong-sam group, which has turned South Korea into an exhibition ground for new and old U.S. weapons and into an arms market. The Kim Yong-sam group unilaterally broke up the working contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South which had been arranged with so much efforts and, later, openly incited a war fever, spreading a rumor about "the North's scheme to provoke a war against the South," and made public even a war plan against the North dubbed "New Operation Plan No. 5027" which had been kept in secrecy. All this was motivated by its despicable purpose of finding a pretext for a massive shipment of U.S.-made destruction weapons into South Korea and legalizing it, thus furthering the interests of the United States, its master. It has become clear to everybody that with such a traitor as Kim Yong-sam left in power in South Korea, the interests of the nation cannot be defended and our fellow countrymen cannot avoid a nuclear disaster. The South Korean students and people must invigorate the anti-America, anti-war, anti-nuke and anti-"government" struggle to oust the Kim Yong-sam group from power and establish an independent and democratic government and to check the introduction of the Patriot into South Korea. If the United States and the South Korean puppets finally started a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula, ignoring the aspiration of the times and the demand of the nation and steadily reinforcing the aggression forces, the provokers would never get off scotfree.
