FBIS3-43143 "cr00000002994001" 15 January 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-005--EURASIA EURASIA: AIDS COVERAGE IN NIS PRESS Recent Russian-language press articlesreporting the present state of AIDS prevent ion and control in former Soviet republics are gisted. The independent multinational physicians' newspaper MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA has devoted an entire issue to World AIDS Control Day (1 December 93). KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (1 December 93) ran six articles on AIDS on its second page the same day. KOMMERSANT-DAILY, LESNAYA GAZETA and other newspapers have also recently published articles on AIDS developments. Key information from these articles is summarized below by republic. RUSSIAN FEDERATION Draft Legislation to be Reviewed New draft legislation on AIDS, which was previously considered by the Russian Supreme Soviet, has been included in a package of priority items for the Duma. In a second-page article, Professor V. V. Pokrovskiy speculates that adoption of the bill may result in abandonment of mass compulsory AIDS testing in favor of voluntary testing and public education on safe sex practices. Pokrovskiy feels that the territorial centers' role in AIDS control is growing as a result of the increasing economic and political role of the krays, oblasts, and republics which fund them. By contrast, the only part of the extensive 1993 federal AIDS program that was actually funded was the federal purchase of test systems for territories. Pokrovskiy thinks that the federal government may not fund the program at all in 1994-95. Other problems affecting the Russian AIDS control program, according to Pokrovskiy, are the failure of the AIDS centers to focus on prevention of sexual transmission of AIDS and the failure to allocate manpower and organize AIDS control institutions where the incidence is greatest (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). HIV Incidence The number of Russian HIV carriers began to increase rapidly in 1993. Eighty new HIV carriers were identified, and 32 HIV-positive patients developed AIDS. Of the 692 HIV carriers detected in Russia, 124 are AIDS patients, 96 have died, and 435 are foreigners and have been deported (Moscow IZVESTIYA 3 Dec 93). The average age of the AIDS patients was 28, and the ratio of men to women was 8 to 1. Two of the HIV-infected were donors (Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY 17 Nov 93). According to Vadim Pokrovskiy, director of the Russian Center for AIDS Prevention and Control, the pattern of HIV transmission in Russia has changed. Starting in 1990 HIV has spread predominantly among Russian homosexuals and to some extent among intravenous drug users. Initially, the virus was spread primarily by foreigners or through medical negligence. Pokrovskiy predicts a sharp rise in incidence among drug users within the next two years (Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY 17 Nov 93). A front-page column in MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA lists the incidence of HIV carriers by city and oblast. Moscow leads with 125, 70 percent of whom are male homosexuals. Following it are three localities where the infected are primarily victims of medical negligence in 1988-89: Rostov Oblast with 109 carriers, Kalmykia with 98 and Volgograd Oblast with 72. HIV was sexually transmitted to most of the 59 St. Petersburg and 33 Moscow Oblast patients. Twenty territories have no identified AIDS carriers and the rest have a few each (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). Testing Twenty-five million people were tested for AIDS in Russia during 1992, 21 million in 1993 (Moscow KOMMERSANT-DAILY 17 Nov 93, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 1 Dec 93). For initial screening, laboratories use domestically produced test systems, which are less reliable than foreign systems. Specimens that test positive are sent to the Russian Scientific Methodological Center for AIDS Control, where foreign test systems and computer analysis are used to confirm the diagnosis. Positive results at this stage are retested and then confirmed by immune blotting (Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 8 Jun 93). Russian Azidothymidine Domestically produced azidothymidine has been tested and evaluated as equal in quality to the English version of the drug (Moscow KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 1 DEC 93). AIDS Database The Volgograd AIDS Prevention and Control Center, in collaboration with the Volgograd Medical Institute, has created a screening program for analyzing test results. The system, which includes a database on patients screened for AIDS starting in 1990, makes it possible to determine the extent to which a risk group has been screened. A supplementary program analyzes the effect of therapies on individual patients. The programs have been placed under the control of the municipal public health committee (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). AIDS Education The periodical OGONEK, television company VID, and the OGONEK- ViD-AntiSPID [Anti-AIDS] charitable fund are jointly sponsoring the first international competition for films on AIDS. During the year- long contest, documentary, educational and dramatic films on AIDS will be broadcast weekly on the Ostankino channel (Moscow LESNAYA GAZETA 4 Dec 93). On 1 December in Moscow, the charitable All- Russian AIDS Control Association and Russian Ministry of Health jointly produced a benefit program including meetings with physicians and distribution of literature (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). KAZAKHSTAN Galiya Sheriyazdanova, director of the Kazakhstan Aids Prevention and Control Dispensary in Almaty, believes that AIDS screening of Kazakhstan residents may be unreliable. As the result of environmentally caused depression of their immune systems, they produce few antibodies when exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus, causing false negative test results (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). Press figures on HIV incidence in Kazakhstan are inconsistent. MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA (1 Dec 93) reported that only one HIV carrier had been detected, but the Almaty newspaper KARAVAN reported a total of 9 registered HIV cases and one AIDS death (Moscow SELSKAYA ZHIZN 21 Jul 93). Few Kazakhstan residents seek AIDS testing. Only 411 patients requested screening in 10 months of 1993, despite a public education effort that establishes a monthly quota of lectures, seminars and published writings for AIDS center physicians (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). UZBEKISTAN Based on the results of an international symposium held in Tashkent, the World Health Organization is developing a program of assistance to Uzbekistan. WHO's representative at the symposium believes that Uzbekistan is capable of containing the spread of HIV (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). Uzbekistan maintains a network of AIDS control institutions despite a low HIV infection rate. Testing of 11 million individuals detected 31 HIV carriers, including 24 foreigners, who were deported, and 7 citizens. There has been one AIDS death. The AIDS service consists of centers in Karakalpakistan, Tashkent, and all 12 oblasts; 90 diagnostic laboratories; and over 100 offices for anonymous treatment. Funding is received from a state interbranch program, although at least one oblast center has a commercial sponsor that funds building repair and medical supplies (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). According to Olim Yakubov, head of the republic's AIDS prevention and control center, the priorities of the Uzbekistan AIDS program are equipping AIDS centers and educating physicans and medical workers. Mass AIDS testing has been abandoned in favor of screening high-risk groups such as patients with venereal diseases, homosexuals, and drug addicts. In addition, all pregnant women and donors are tested. A key need is AIDS diagnostic systems and medical equipment, which are available in Uzbekistan on a barter basis only. Banking system problems and the introduction of a national currency have reduced the delivery of AIDS test systems to Uzbek AIDS Centers by 40 percent. Needed supplies and equipment are not being sent from Russia or Ukraine because the payments are not being transmitted (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93.) UKRAINE AIDS is on the rise in Ukraine. From March to December 1993, 29 new AIDS cases were detected, more than during the entire previous year. HIV incidence has increased from 4.4 per million in 1992 to 5.4 per million. One hundred forty one people are infected, and 8 adults and 4 children have died. The largest numbers of HIV carriers are found in Odessa Oblast, Kiev, Donetsk, and Dnepropetrovsk Oblasts and in the Crimean Republic. The virus was sexually transmitted -- heterosexually in 76 cases and homosexually in 16 (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). These statistics may not include infected foreigners, since Ukrainian AIDS Committee chairman Matsuk reported a total of 303 HIV carriers detected as of 1 January 1993, including 112 Ukrainians and 191 foreigners (Kiev DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA 5 Jun 93). Ternopol epidemiologist Tamara Burtnyak considers weakening of immune systems by the Chernobyl nuclear accident to have increased Ukrainians' susceptibility to AIDS (Ternopol VILNE ZHYTTYA 26 Oct 93). Ukraine is pursuing a mass screening program, with 1.9 million examined every quarter (Moscow MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA 1 Dec 93). Ukraine's AIDS detection abilities have been enhanced by new developments. The Ukraine AIDS Committee has created a national reference laboratory for HIV infection and has developed a reference panel of positive sera to be used in evaluating the quality of imported test systems. The US firm Abbott is selling third- generation test systems and modern equipment to the Kiev Scientific Research Institute for Hematology and Blood Transfusion. Only two Ukrainian firms manufacture test systems, using raw materials imported from other former Soviet republics. Most medicines for HIV carriers and AIDS patients are obtained from abroad (Moscow MEDITSINSKAY GAZETA 1 Dec 93). A KHRESHCHATYK article blames an outbreak of "'exotic' contagious diseases,'' including AIDS, on "the uncontrolled stay of foreigners in Kiev." Sixty-five of the 92 new AIDS cases in Kiev were aliens (Kiev KHRESHCHATYK 15 Dec 93). Convicts incarcerated at the Interoblast Hospital of the Administration of Internal Affairs in Donetsk Oblast wrote an open letter to KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (1 Dec 93), complaining of unsanitary conditions and poor treatment. They allege that they have not received necessary medications and have been refused treatment by the Ukrainian AIDS Center in Kiev. BALTICS AND BELARUS Latvia reported 14 AIDS patients and 16 HIV-positive individuals (Riga Radio Riga Network 1 Dec 93). Belarus has recorded 98 cases of HIV infection, 69 of them in Minsk. One-fourth of the Belarusian HIV carriers have developed AIDS and 6 have died. There are an estimated 900-1200 HIV carriers in Minsk. Sexual transmission of the virus predominates (Minsk VECHERNIY MINSK 30 Nov 93). Lithuania has detected 19 HIV carriers ranging in age from 19 to 40 and including 14 homosexual males and 1 woman. During the past year, Abbott test systems have been used in Lithuania to screen donor blood for HIV (Vilnius TIESA 3 Dec 93). GEORGIA According to Tengiz Tsertsvadze, senior doctor at Republican AIDS and Immunodeficiency Center, Georgia has recorded 16 HIV carriers, 11 of them citizens of the republic. Drug addiction and the shortage of disposable syringes, medical equipment, and sterilizers are key factors promoting the spread of AIDS. Tsertsvadze predicts 20,000 cases by the year 2000 and several hundred thousand cases by 2010, unless radical action is taken. AIDS screening, which is voluntary, is down to one-quarter of the 1990 level because of the lack of money to purchase test kits. Consequently, AIDS statistics are probably understated, in Tsertsvadze's opinion (Tblisi NOVAYA GAZETA Nov 93). (AUTHOR: DOBBINS.
