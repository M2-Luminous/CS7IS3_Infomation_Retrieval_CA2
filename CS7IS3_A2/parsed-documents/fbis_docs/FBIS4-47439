Voytenko and Ye.M. Libmanova (Based on Materials of the Ecodefencinform Agency): ``Mortality and Life Expectancy in Ukraine''] [Text] A conference entitled ``Ecology, Health, and Old Age'' was held quite recently at the Gerontology Institute of the Ukrainian Academy of Medical Sciences in Kiev. Taking part in this conference's work were staffers of the scientific organs under the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and Academy of Medical Sciences, as well as those from the Ukrainian Ministry of Education. Twelve reports by prominent specialists in the fields of ecology, medicine, and gerontology were discussed here. The conference's goal was to thoroughly analyze the consequences of the ecological situation which has evolved in Ukraine and which has evoked deep concern. This conference also had the goal of discussing possible ways to extricate ourselves from this crisis-type situation. The initiator for holding this conference--the Gerontology Institute--hopes and anticipates that the most adequate ways will be found for overcoming the symptoms which menace our nation's health. This hope likewise unites the efforts of scientists in various fields and practicing specialists. Press Center of the Ukrainian Health Center According to data published by the World Health Organization in 1990, Ukraine ranks 45th out of 65 countries in average life expectancy for women, and it ranks 54th for men. The principal cause of death in Ukraine consists of diseases of the circulatory system. Our fellow-countrymen are dying from these diseases not only more freqently, but also earlier: The greatest losses of life--as compared with our foreign counterparts--occur between the ages of 45 and 65. Of particular significance are deaths from cardiovascular diseases in Zarkarpat, Ivano-Frankovsk, Chernovtsy, Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, and Zaporozhye oblasts, as well as throughout the entire territory of Southern Ukraine. Ranking second in importance as a cause of death (contributed to by pollution of the environment and by tobacco smoking) are malignant new growths--tumors and cancers. Kiev, as well as the industrial oblasts of the western and southern regions, have become particularly hazardous with regard to such oncological diseases. Ranking third are accidents, poisonings, and injuries. The number of injury-caused deaths--which was reduced by the short-term success of the anti-alcohol campaign--has begun to increase again since 1988. Increasing the life expectancy in Ukraine is possible provided that there are changes in the mortality structure. In the first place, what we are talking about here is a reduction in the role played by deaths from infectious diseases and injuries. In the second place, it is a matter of reducing the average number of deaths from cardiovascular and oncological diseases. Successfully performing both of these tasks is connected--in one way or another--with solving our economic problems. An increase in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and personal consumption (PC) by 1,000 ``international dollars'' would allow an increase in life expectancy of 0.5 years for men and 1 year for women. But this ratio is not absolute. The greatest life expectancy is not in the United States (which ranks first in personal consumption), but rather in Japan (which ranks 22nd in personal consumption). That is to say, extra-ecological factors are also of essential importance, in particular, life style and the nature (not merely the quantity) of the personal consumption involved. This furnished optimism for those who are poor. Most urgent for Ukraine is investing in the preservation and safeguarding of nature, even though restoring the environment to good health will not have an effect on mortality very soon. Prognosis The Central Region (the city of Kiev, as well as Poltava, Chernigov, Zhitomir, Sumy, Cherkassy, Vinnitsa, and Kiev oblasts) is characterized by a relatively favorable mortality structure-one closely approximating international standards. Serving as a foreign analogue to the mortality pattern here could be Belgium during the early 1960's (for men) and during the late 1970's (for women). The Western Region (Lvov, Khmelnitskiy, Chernigov, Ivano-Frankovsk, Ternopol, Volyn, Rovno, and Zakarpat oblasts) slightly exceeds the average level for Ukraine with regard to life expectancy; however, it is progressing quite slowly. The unfavorable mortality trends in Zakarpat Oblast provide grounds for doubting the reliability of the health statistics in this oblast, as well as in Ivano-Frankovsk and Volyn oblasts. Among the European countries an analogue may be seen with France during the early 1960's (for men) and during the late 1960's (for women). The Eastern Region (Donetsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkov, and Lugansk oblasts) is characterized not only by a high present-day level of mortality, but also by a stagnation of its basic indicators during the last 10 years. It is analogous to Finland during the early 1970's. The Southern Region (Crimea, as well as Kherson, Kirovograd, Nikolayev, and Odessa oblasts) is the most unfavorable zone. In fact, it is a zone of increased risk for health and life (especially the maritime rayons of Kherson and Odessa oblasts). The closest analogue is Spain during the late 1950's (for men) and the late 1960's (for women).
