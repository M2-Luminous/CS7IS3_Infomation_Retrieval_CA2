Most of them continue to use narcotics after the treatment period--although the most important objective of the expensive care is to break the destructive addiction. The mortality among those who have recently been released from an institution is instead ``remarkably'' high. More in 1993 This is the gist of a study, so far unpublished, of the effects of drug treatment recently carried out by social medical officer Gunnar Agren, research head of the research and development bureau of the Social Service. But in spite of this, considerably more drug addicts have been placed in Stockholm's so-called LVM [Addict Treatment Law] center during 1993, compared to last year, according to information from the Social Service's treatment bureau. Harsh Criticism Compulsory treatment--which in part is supposed to break a serious addiction and in part motivate the addict to treatment under voluntary forms--is subjected to harsh point-by-point criticism in the R&D bureau's report. Gunnar Agren even proposes a reevaluation of existing legislation, which would either lead to abolishing the law or to more restricted application of it. ``Forced treatment is simply catastrophic. I believe it is very doubtful whether it has the effect it is supposed to have according to the intentions of the law. The data quite clearly show that the lifesaving effect does not exist but rather the opposite. The question is then whether one should spend so many resources on the absolutely most expensive form of treatment,'' says Gunnar Agren. In his judgement the result of the Stockholm study can also be applied to the country as a whole. The number of drug-free persons six months and one year, respectively, after their institutional stay is below 10 percent, according to the three different studies of five LVM centers which Gunnar Agren uses as his basis. Mortality is high; at one of the treatment centers studied as many as 12 percent died within a year after being released. For injection addicts of heroin, in particular, forced treatment has bad effects. The institutional stay, which costs up to 3,000 kronor a day, has not contributed to a single heroin addict losing his addiction to drugs. ``There has been an increase in the number of heroin addicts who are subjected to forced treatment, although it is completely obvious that it is a meaningless form of care.'' ``Nerve-Racking'' Bitte Davidsson, chief of the Social Service's treatment bureau, says that these results are not fun to hear. ``It is sad that we have not succeeded in demonstrating less destructive ways. It is terribly nerve-racking to see that forced treatment does not lead to anything. But it is the final safety net, and the alternative to people dying immediately.'' There are several explanations for the fact that the number of LVM placements has increased during 1993, at the same time as the number of placements in treatment centers has decreased, according to the treatment bureau's Bitte Davidsson. A stay at a treatment center can, for example, be a way to avoid future mandatory treatment, in her opinion. ``These kinds of things must lead to reevaluation. Is this the way we want to use our money? It would be considerably cheaper if we employed effective measures much earlier.'' At present the city of Stockholm operates eight LVM centers with a total of 257 places. Last year, the city's total costs for addict treatment decreased and that trend has persisted in 1993 as well, according to the situation and action reports of the Social Service. The explanation is, among others, that treatment periods have become shorter and that the social districts to an increasing extent are investing in open care, which is considerably cheaper.
