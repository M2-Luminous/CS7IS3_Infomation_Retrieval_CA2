To the best of this commentator's knowledge, ultimatums have never brought any lasting solutions to ethnic conflicts. If NATO leaders and the United States have decided to take a major hand in the Bosnian conflict, they should, in a totally disinterested manner, at least place their emphasis on a just, negotiated solution, without favorites. We stress this point because there are some very dark areas in NATO's decision. It has been explained that what brought about the organization's meeting in the first place was the explosion of a shell in the middle of Sarajevo that killed 68 people and injured another 200. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has denied Serbian responsibility in the matter, and has called the report [not further identified] a mise-en-scene. In his opinion, the event was manipulated. In that connection, he has asked U.S. President William Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin to use every means to uncover the truth. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher himself admitted that his country has no proof. No one has proven that the Serbs were responsible for the attack on the Sarajevo marketplace. So, where does the truth lie? What dark interests might be at play behind the Bosnian conflict? Is there a sincere desire on the part of all parties for peace to prevail there? Many questions remain unanswered. For the time being, amid the tensions, the agreement between Serbs and Muslims for an immediate ceasefire in Sarajevo, and the holding of peace talks today in Geneva between the warring factions, have been received with relief. We reiterate: It is there that the emphasis should be placed, not on bombs.
