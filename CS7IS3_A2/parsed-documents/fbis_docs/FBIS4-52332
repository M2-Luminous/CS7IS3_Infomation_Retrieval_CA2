FBIS4-52332 "dreas090__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-090-A Daily Report 1 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Hata Cabinet Reviews Stabilization of Yen Hata Cabinet Reviews Stabilization of Yen Little Immediate Effect Expected 942A0169B Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 May 94 p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0169B Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] The government held an emergency conference of cabinet members concerned with economic affairs on the afternoon of 30 April to discuss its response to the strong yen and reconfirmed its efforts to promote deregulation and strive for tax reform. However, policies of this nature have been reiterated by Prime Minister Hata in the past and the view is that only minimal restraining effect can be realized thereby in the future if yen-buying pressure increases in foreign exchange markets because of the nature of the intervention posture assumed by U.S. currency authorities. For the time being, the government will probably seek to stabilize the foreign exchange markets through market intervention, while emphasizing the early implementation of interim economic reform such as working for deregulation and negotiating with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] on the implementation of tax reform. After the conference, Economic Planning Agency Director General Terasawa stressed, "We affirmed the fact that we are serious about deregulation, because some quarters have taken the passive attitude that the idea is not feasible." Reportedly, a conference of administrative vice ministers of the ministries and agencies will be held on 9 May to confirm work to be done on deregulation. After the conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai stated, "Positive efforts will be made to negotiate with the SDPJ, Sakigake [Harbinger] and New Pary Mirai [Future] (which are not represented in the Hata cabinet) relative to tax reform. Needless to say, we must also seek the understanding of the LDP." The cabinet officials stress a positive attitude about both deregulation and tax reform, but, looking behind the scenes, you might say that the cabinet's statements are being made with the knowledge it will be difficult to realize those goals. Implementation of deregulation was part of the International Economic Reform Outline prepared in March, but indications are that the bureaucrats have lost some enthusiasm on the matter partly because of the unstable political situation. Difficulties are also seen in making progress on tax reform because the SDPJ which is negative about raising the consumption tax has removed itself from the coalition. The markets have already reflected these developments and the yen is in the process of rising, but 30 April did not see deployment of any form of countermeasure capable of providing immediate relief. The government and the Bank of Japan have already solidified plans to further reinforce market intervention through yen-selling and dollar-buying to prevent a higher yen. As far as monetary policy is concerned, no action will be taken in the way of monetary adjustment such as lowering short-term market rates. It appears that there is no choice but for efforts by Japan, Europe, and the United States to collaborate in market intervention in response to the sharp rise in the yen.
