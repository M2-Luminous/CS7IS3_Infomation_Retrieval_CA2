FR941125-0-00028 FR941125-0-00015 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Railroad Administration 49 CFR Part 219 [Docket No. RSOR&hyph;6; Notice No. 40] RIN 2130&hyph;AA81 Alcohol Testing; Amended Implementation Dates for Pre-Employment Alcohol Testing and Mandatory Reasonable Suspicion Testing AGENCY: Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: FRA amends the implementation dates for pre-employment alcohol testing and mandatory reasonable suspicion testing to allow Class II and Class III railroads to implement these types of testing simultaneously with random alcohol testing (on July 1, 1995, and January 1, 1996, respectively). This new implementation schedule provides more time for smaller railroads to phase-in alcohol testing. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective on January 1, 1995. ADDRESSES: Any petition for reconsideration should be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Docket No. RSOR&hyph;6, Office of the Chief Counsel, Federal Railroad Administration, 400 7th Street, S.W., Room 8201, Washington, D.C., 20590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: D. Lamar Allen, Alcohol and Drug Program Manager (RRS&hyph;11), Office of Safety, FRA, Washington, D.C. 20590 (Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;0127) or Patricia V. Sun, Trial Attorney (RCC&hyph;30), Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, Washington, D.C. 20590 (Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;4002). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On February 15, 1994, FRA issued a final rule [59 FR 7448] establishing a railroad industry alcohol misuse prevention program. For random alcohol testing only, FRA adopted a three-tier implementation schedule, similar to the one used to phase-in random drug testing. All other types of alcohol testing (pre-employment, return to service, follow-up, and mandatory reasonable suspicion testing for both alcohol and drugs) were to begin on January 1, 1995, for all classes of railroads. In response to a Petition for Reconsideration filed by the American Short Line Railroad Association (ASLRA) on April 15, 1994, FRA has decided to allow Class II and Class III railroads to phase-in pre-employment alcohol testing and mandatory reasonable suspicion testing according to the implementation schedule previously established for random alcohol testing. Thus, Class II railroads must now implement pre-employment alcohol testing and mandatory reasonable suspicion testing together with random alcohol testing beginning on July 1, 1995, and Class III railroads must now implement pre-employment alcohol testing, mandatory reasonable suspicion testing, and random alcohol testing beginning on January 1, 1996. FRA anticipates that there will be few, if any, return to service or follow-up alcohol tests until implementation of mandatory reasonable suspicion and random alcohol testing is completed, and that any tests that occur before implementation will presumably be under railroad authority. The implementation date for return to service or follow-up alcohol testing therefore remains January 1, 1995. The amended implementation dates in this rule allow smaller railroads more time to purchase evidential breath testing devices, make contractual arrangements and train supervisors on the new testing requirements. This amendment also conforms FRA's implementation dates to those adopted by other operating administrations. This rule does not change the implementation schedule for Class I railroads. As before, Class I railroads must implement all types of alcohol testing, including mandatory reasonable suspicion testing according to the new procedures now contained in ยง219.303(b) (see discussion below), beginning on January 1, 1995. A railroad may not implement pre-employment alcohol testing or mandatory reasonable suspicion testing before its specified implementation date, and may not, of course, implement random alcohol testing until its plan has been approved by FRA. The schedule for submission of random alcohol testing plans remains the same: Class I railroads must submit their plans by August 15, 1994; Class II railroads must submit by February 15, 1995; and Class III railroads must submit by August 15, 1994. Although Class II and Class III railroads may not conduct mandatory reasonable suspicion testing before their respective implementation dates, they continue to be responsible for enforcing FRA's existing prohibitions against alcohol misuse and must enforce the new prohibitions contained in FRA's alcohol rule beginning on January 1, 1995. To enable smaller railroads to fulfill this responsibility, FRA will allow Class IIs and IIIs to continue to use existing for cause alcohol test procedures and safeguards currently in ยง219.303 until their respective deadlines for implementation of mandatory reasonable suspicion testing. These procedures were to be deleted effective January 1, 1995; FRA will instead continue them in force as paragraphs (c) through (e) of ยง219.303 until January 1, 1996, the deadline for Class IIIs to implement mandatory reasonable suspicion testing and switch to the new procedures, now in paragraph (b). Class IIs and IIIs also, of course, remain free to conduct reasonable suspicion tests under their own authority until they are required to implement mandatory reasonable suspicion testing.
