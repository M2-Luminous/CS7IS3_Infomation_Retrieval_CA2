Foratom, the European federation of nuclear trade associations, has written to Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's [EU] external economic affairs commissioner, warning that unless Western nuclear companies are protected against legal action they will withdraw from nuclear repair work in the region. The companies are concerned that they would be liable if there were an accident during work to repair or replace ailing Soviet-designed nuclear reactors. The move will delay the flow of European Commission nuclear safety funds to the region under its technical assistance programmes. It will also prevent companies from signing large repair contracts under the Nuclear Safety Account, the multilateral aid fund set up by the Group of Seven industrialised countries after the July 1992 Munich summit. International experts have identified a number of Soviet-designed reactors that are in urgent need of repair, in particular the first generation pressurised water reactors, the VVER 230s and the RBMK Chernobyl design. In December 1993 the EU's economic and finance commissioner Henning Christophersen described the nuclear safety situation as a "time bomb ticking away in East Europe". While Western nuclear companies have been prepared to participate in studies and training at the plants, they will not replace equipment until they have legal protection against the consequences of accidents. Most of the countries with VVER 230s and RBMK reactors in operation have not signed the 1963 Vienna Convention, which ensures that full responsibility for damages caused by accidents falls exclusively on plant operators. The Commission has said it cannot guarantee to pay damages. Instead, it has asked countries receiving aid to sign bilateral agreements with nuclear companies protecting them against legal action. The nuclear industry argues that such deals do not give it sufficient legal or economic protection. Foratom met Commission officials yesterday in the first of a series of meetings to find an interim solution which would allow vital safety work to go ahead. One option could be for recipient countries, West European governments and possibly the industry itself to set up a fund which could be tapped if an accident occurs.
