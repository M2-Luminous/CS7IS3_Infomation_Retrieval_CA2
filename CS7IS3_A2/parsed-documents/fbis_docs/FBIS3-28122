FBIS3-28122 "dreas023_a_94030" FBIS-EAS-94-023 Document Type:Daily Report 3 February 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Watanabe, Murayama Discuss Political Reform OW0302080094 OW0302080094 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in Japanese at 2311 GMT on 29 January, in its regularly scheduled "News 2001" program, carries a 41-minute interview with former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The interview is held at an Asahi Television studio in Tokyo and moderated by newscasters Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama. Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), joins the interview through remote hookup. The interview is also joined by regular guest commentators columnist Kenichi Takemura and Keio University Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi. At 2311 GMT, Kuroiwa asks what Watanabe, who was against approval of the political reform bills, thinks of the compromise between Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Kono on the political reform package. Watanabe says: "They (coalition parties) made a compromise and accepted the LDP's proposals with minor changes. I think the LDP deserves 90 points out of 100 if the single-seat constituency system is eventually approved." He admits that he is satisfied with the outcome. On the LDP executives' performances in dealing with the political reform bills, Watanabe says LDP President Kono and Secretary General Mori have done well. He flatly denies that the LDP became weak- kneed at a crucial moment and made a compromise with the coalition because of the rumor that the public prosecutors office might search offices of some LDP lawmakers on 30 January for their possible involvement in a series of recent construction scandals. Asked if LDP factions will cease to exist after introduction of the single-seat electoral system, Watanabe says: "Theoretically, factions will disappear if the single-seat electoral system is introduced because there will be no need for the LDP members to compete against each other in elections." Regarding a rumor that Watanabe may secede from the LDP and form a new party, he says that he was just joking when he commented on that matter. Pointing out that LDP President Kono have moved closer to Prime Minister Hosokawa over the political reform bills, Kuroiwa asks what Watanabe thinks of apparent new movement to settle various issues through policy cooperation between the LDP and the Hosokawa administration. Watanabe explains: "I think this is a very good sign. We are not saying no to everything. We have been saying that the LDP is a responsible opposition party. Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) is playing the central role in the coalition government. Komeito and the SDPJ joined the coalition of Shinseito, Japan New Party, and Sakigake (Harbinger Party). They said that they would maintain the fundamental policies that the LDP had kept for 38 years. It is quite fine and we can cooperate with them." Saying that the Hosokawa administration's next major task is to tackle the issue of raising the consumption tax rate, Kuroiwa asks Watanabe if the LDP can cooperate with the Hosokawa administration on this matter. Watanabe says: "It is impossible to implement policies by ignoring the opposition party, which is a major party and has seats close to a majority in the Diet. When the LDP had 300 seats, we gave due considerations to the intentions of the SDPJ, which had only 130-140 seats then. Needless to say, considerations should be given to the intentions of the LDP, which has seats close to a majority. There is no need to fight because they are saying that their fundamental policies are the same as ours." At 2330 GMT, Matsuyama asks SDPJ Chairman Murayama, who just joined the interview, why his party gave way to the LDP on the issue of corporate donations. Murayama says: "The greatest goal of the recent political reform was to eliminate corporate donations, which are a cause of political corruption. Everybody knows that. Therefore, we intensely devoted ourselves to the pursuit of getting rid of the root of corruption. It would have been nice if our demands were accepted 100 percent. However, cooperation and conciliation are needed in politics. Therefore, we decided to accept it on condition that we will continue to make further efforts to improve it in the future." Saying that the SDPJ -- which was against the introduction of the electoral system combining single-seat constituencies with proportional representation and liberalization of Japan's rice market -- gave up many things and made compromises one after another after it joined the coalition, Kobayashi asks Murayama if the SDPJ will give up its resistance to a consumption tax hike as well. Murayama says: "I think it is necessary for us to remain in the coalition to exert efforts to make improvements, even a step or two, while reflecting our opinions in policy matters." Kuroiwa asks: "What is the SDPJ's intention regarding remaining in the coalition government even at the risk of giving up a fundamental part, which the SDPJ thinks is the most important? Murayama explains: "As I said earlier, it is our task to exert our efforts while remaining in the coalition to respond to the people's expectations by realizing our demands." Kuroiwa asks Murayama to comment on the fact that the coalition ultimately had to accept the LDP proposal on corporate donations due to the SDPJ rebels, who voted against the political reform bills in the upper house. Murayama answers: "Originally, those who voted against the political reform bills were opposing an introduction of the electoral system combining single- seat constituencies with proportional representation. They were not talking about the corporate donations alone, but saying that it was their fundamental stance not to approve the bills. They had their own individual beliefs. I think the problem was that they continued to stick to their beliefs. As you all know, the SDPJ was originally against the single-seat electoral system. After the general election in July, however, the SDPJ finally took action and joined the coalition to answer to the expectations of the people, who wanted us to change the politics. Although we had a heated debate at the party convention, we had no other choice but to accept the combination of single-seat constituencies with proportional representation. Therefore, I was hoping that they would abide by the party decision." Asked if the SDPJ executive department will bear the responsibility for the recent series of events, Murayama responds: "The party will have many chances, such as an emergency party convention and central committee meetings, to talk about the executive department's responsibility." Matsuyama asks if Murayama will resign from the post of SDPJ chairman to take responsibility, Murayama says: "No, I am not thinking of that." At 2341 GMT, Kurosawa asks Watanabe what he thinks of increasing the consumption tax rate. Watanabe explains that the government should increase the consumption tax to cover a financial shortfall that is inevitable should the income tax be reduced. He continues to explain short-term economic merits of a decision to increase the consumption tax. As for a positive impact of approving the political reform bills, Watanabe says: "It is true that it gave the people a sense of relief."
