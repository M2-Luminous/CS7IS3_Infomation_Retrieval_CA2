"It is not excluded that Belgium may provide logistic support, such as equipment, but the Belgian Government still has to decide on that on Friday," he stated. Minister Delcroix believes that such an operation need not necessarily be carried out by the Blue Helmets, but it must nevertheless obtain UN backing.
