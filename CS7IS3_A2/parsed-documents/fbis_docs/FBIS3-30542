Today, I will sign on behalf of Poland a framework document pertaining to "Partnership for Peace." To say that we are shaping the future prospects of our continent's secure development is not an overstatement. A few weeks ago we witnessed a NATO summit which took place here, in Brussels. We awaited that event with no less interest than the member countries themselves. We have spoken out on many occasions to present our problems and our concerns, to share with others our vision of European security and our expectations with regard to the NATO partners. We have faith that the decisions reached at the NATO summit create a chance and a hope for a better future and security in Europe. Security must be thought of as a process of eliminating divisions and tensions, and developing cooperation and partnership. We recognize NATO's special role in contemporary Europe. At the same time we understand that European security cannot be regarded as the exclusive responsibility of NATO. Decisions made by NATO countries will be successful only if they are appropriately responded to throughout Europe. I want to assure you that Poland is ready for comprehensive and serious cooperation. We were happy to take note of the fact that NATO has confirmed a relationship which exists between the security of its member states and the security of Central and East Europe. In my view, that confirmation not only contributes to a strengthening of the external security of the countries of the region, but it also has a role to play in terms of success of the radical internal reforms being implemented by those very countries. Our intentions with regard to NATO are clear and widely known. Even though the most recent NATO summit in Brussels did not fulfill all of our expectations, we were happy to take note of NATO's declaration of openness to development of cooperation with the partner countries. We were also happy to take note of the prospect created at the summit of a future widening of NATO to include new members. Poland accepted "Partnership for Peace" and intends to actively participate in the program. We perceive "Partnership for Peace" to be a new and promising element of the process of building European security. We also regard the initiative as Poland's chance for strengthening its links to NATO, for better cooperation with the Alliance. We also perceive the initiative as a chance for the future implementation of our strategic goal of Poland's integration with Western security structures. We see the implementation of "Partnership for Peace" not only as a way of getting closer to NATO. We also want to avail ourselves of the opportunities that the program creates for maintaining good, partnershiplike cooperation also with our eastern neighbors. Maintaining such a mutually beneficial cooperation with the countries of our region, a cooperation which would be based on equal rights, remains a crucial issue for Poland. "Partnership for Peace" has a chance of becoming a wide area of concrete, day-to-day cooperation among European countries for the sake of common security. Taking into account a certain skepticism which has emerged in the public opinion on this issue, it is important to go beyond mere political declarations and to provide the program with a clear content and complete credibility. "Partnership for Peace" is a factor which has the potential to positively shape security relations. But while thinking about the future, one should reach beyond mere security. Security, broadly speaking, also means successful economic, cultural, and social development. Those same goals were also the guiding ideas for the authors of the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949. It is worth recalling that under Article 2 of the Treaty, the parties to the Treaty took upon themselves an obligation to "contribute to the further development of peaceful and friendly relations" among others "through supporting the conditions of stability and prosperity." The parties also obliged themselves not only to eliminate conflicts occurring in their economic relations, but also to "support economic cooperation between every one of them and among all of them." So, while implementing "Partnership for Peace" in the area of political and military cooperation, we should also strive to create a "Partnership for Development," which would be a multiaspect, broad kind of cooperation among America, West, Central, and East Europe. It would be a cooperation among different structures and governmental and extragovernmental institutions, taking into account both regional and local cooperation. That cooperation should in particular cover those countries which are on their way to a market economy. The cooperation should contribute to increasing the countries' growth rate, to an increased sense of stability, to promoting economic transformations, and to a widening and a strengthening of the market economy in the entire area covered by the partnership concept. These forms of a broad, open cooperation may significantly contribute to the final elimination of the existing divisions, to Europe's integration, and, as a consequence, to securing stability and prosperity, and to eliminating many sources of current and potential conflicts. I have faith that together, we will achieve these goals.
