FR941012-0-00156 FR941012-0-00011 F. Economic Feasibility Determination The projected economic impact of the final standard on the logging industry is small. The cost of full compliance with the standard represents only 0.1 percent of the value of shipments for this industry as a whole. Although these annual costs of compliance represent a relatively insignificant amount of total shipments, some firms will bear more costs than others depending on their existing compliance with the various provisions of the standard. The annual cost of compliance per logging establishment ranges from about $38 in California where firms are at a high level of compliance with their own State logging standard, to an average of $1,300 per establishment in the South where no comprehensive logging standards exists. These annual costs per establishment are insignificant when viewed in terms of other costs incurred by logging employers. It is expected that the costs of compliance with the final rule are too small to have a significant effect on price, employment, production, or profit rates. The impact of compliance with the final rule is expected to fall primarily on small businesses, because the vast majority of logging establishments employ fewer than 20 workers. The record shows that most large logging establishments are already in compliance with many of the provisions of the final rule. However, many small firms are also located in States that have comprehensive logging standards. These firms are currently in compliance with these standards and are able to operate while incurring these costs. Even if it is assumed that small firms will bear all the costs of compliance with the final rule, the economic impact is still small. OSHA estimates that the average cost per small firm is substantially less than 0.5 percent of the average annual value of shipments per firm and will be more than offset by the probable decrease in workers' compensation costs resulting from fewer injuries. Even small establishments that operate on less than a full-time basis could incur the costs of compliance without experiencing an economic disruption that would threaten the competitive structure of the industry or cause any dislocation. Based on these estimates developed from data and evidence in the record, OSHA has concluded that the economic impact of the standard would not threaten the stability or profitability of the logging industry. In addition, neither the Gross National Product (GNP), the level of international trade, the price of consumer goods, nor the level of employment would be significantly affected. G. Regulatory Flexibility Certification In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Assistant Secretary has made a preliminary assessment of the impact of the rule on small entities. As discussed above, the estimated compliance costs for small firms (i.e, those employing fewer than 20 workers) are estimated to be less than 0.5 percent of the average annual value of shipments per firm and will be more than offset by the probable decrease in workers' compensation costs resulting from reduction in logging accidents. As is the case for compliance costs for all firms covered under the standard, the costs of compliance for small firms would be very small compared with net income. Therefore, OSHA does not anticipate the final rule will have a significant impact on small firms. H. Environmental Impact Assessment The revisions to the standard have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq .), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR 1500), and the Department of Labor (DOL) NEPA Procedures (29 CFR 11). As a result of this review, OSHA has determined that the rule will have no significant environmental impact. The provisions focus on training, work practices, personal protective equipment, and protective devices on equipment in order to reduce worker fatalities and injuries. In general, these provisions do not impact on air, water, or soil quality, plant or animal life, the use of land, or other aspects of the environment. The revisions are considered excluded actions under Subpart B, Section 11.10 of the DOL NEPA regulations.
