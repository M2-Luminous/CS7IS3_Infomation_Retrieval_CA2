This team carried out its mission during the period 7-17 March 1994. The review team was composed of eight safety specialists from Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States along with two safety experts from the IAEA and one from the Group of 24 Nuclear Safety Coordination Secretariat in Brussels. The review was agreed to by the Ukrainian authorities after the Ukraine Government's October 1993 decision to postpone closure of the Chernobyl station which had been scheduled for the end of 1993. Unit 1 which was placed into operation last week after a three week maintenance outage is currently operating at 80 percent of its design power level of 1000 MW and Unit 3 at its design level of 1000 MW. The team examined the plant safety design and a number of specific operational aspects. The review found numerous safety deficiencies in the two units of the plant which remain operational. Of particular concern are specific problems in the design of the first generation Unit 1, which have not been dealt with sufficiently. In addition the experts identified a number of factors which together affect overall safe plant operation. Difficult working conditions and a serious continuing loss of highly skilled personnel are major problems. Limited procurement of up-to-date equipment also has a negative effect on safety. A major problem is the technically confirmed accelerated deterioration of the shelter enclosing the destroyed unit 4 reactor which, if it collapses, would have serious consequences. These findings were discussed at the end of the review in Kiev by the IAEA's Assistant Director General for nuclear safety, M. Rosen, with the President of the nuclear power operating organization (GCA), M.P. Umanetz. The IAEA Director General, Dr. Hans Blix, has communicated on 21 March to the President of Ukraine the conclusion that international levels of safety are not being met at Chernobyl at present. Considering the seriousness of the situation he has suggested that the Ukraine convene a meeting of interested countries parties to consider what actions could be taken to alleviate the situation; the IAEA would be ready to assist the Ukraine in arranging such a meeting in Vienna if so requested. The President of Ukraine, Mr. Leonid Kravchuk, responded favourably to these suggestions in a reply dated 30 March 1994. Expressing thanks to the expert group for their work, he emphasized that the results of this work were considered by the Ukrainian Government to be a significant input to the objective evaluation of the safety level of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. It is anticipated that a meeting will accordingly be convened in Vienna in the second half of April.
