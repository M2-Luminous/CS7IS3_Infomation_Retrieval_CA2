FR941103-0-00059 FR941103-0-00009 On November 1, 1993, May 26, 1994, and July 21, 1994, the State of Maine submitted various elements which, taken together, constitute an I/M SIP revision for seven ozone nonattainment counties classified as moderate or above. A public hearing for the November 1, 1993 submittal was held on October 26, 1992. As stated in the May 26, 1994 letter from the DEP, a public hearing also was held on May 25, 1994. The amended rules submitted on July 21, 1994, were effective on June 28, 1994. EPA submitted comments during both of those hearings. In addition, EPA has worked closely with the DEP to ensure that the I/M program meets EPA requirements identified in the I/M rule. The I/M SIP submittal provides for the implementation of enhanced I/M in the Maine counties of Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, and York beginning on July 1, 1994. Maine will be implementing a biennial, test-only I/M program. With the changes the State made in its July 21, 1994 submittal, the program will meet the requirements of EPA's performance standard and other requirements contained in the federal␣␣ I/M rule, in the above-listed counties. Testing will be overseen by the DEP and implemented by an I/M contractor. Other aspects of the Maine I/M program include: transient testing of 1968 and later light duty vehicles and trucks and heavy duty trucks (although only the testing of 1981 and newer vehicles is considered in evaluating whether the enhanced performance standard is met), evaporative emission testing for specified model year vehicles, a test fee to ensure adequate resources to implement the program, enforcement by registration suspension, a repair effectiveness program, requirements for testing convenience, quality assurance, data collection, minimum expenditures prior to time extensions and hardship waivers, reporting, test equipment and test procedure specifications, public information and consumer protection, inspector training and certification, penalties based on inspector incompetence, an on-road testing program, and emission recall enforcement. A section-by-section analysis of the federal I/M rule, Maine's demonstration of how the I/M program meets the federal SIP requirements, as well as the changes to the Maine I/M program as submitted on July 21, 1994, is provided below. A. Applicability The SIP describes in detail the areas subject to the enhanced I/M SIP revision and, consistent with 40 CFR 51.372, includes the legal authority necessary to establish program boundaries. The Maine I/M regulations and authorizing legislation specify that the enhanced I/M program be implemented in the counties described above. The Maine I/M program is being implemented in areas beyond those required by the Clean Air Act and EPA's rule. Maine is implementing the enhanced I/M program throughout its moderate ozone nonattainment areas, in part, to meet requirements of Section 182(b)(1)(A) of the CAA that requires reasonable further progress (RFP). EPA intended to take separate rulemaking action on the portion of the Maine submittal expanding the geographical scope of the I/M program to counties not otherwise required to adopt I/M. Those counties include Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, and Sagadahoc. Although these areas are not required to implement enhanced or basic I/M, the State of Maine had requested expedited approval for those areas in order to make the resultant emission reductions federally enforceable. Therefore, EPA moved forward to approve I/M in these areas as strengthening the SIP in Knox, Kennebec, Lincoln, and Sagadahoc Counties. EPA proposed separate action on that optional I/M program in the event that EPA took final action disapproving this SIP. However, by this action, Maine's I/M program is conditionally approved and the revised SIP requirements will apply to all I/M areas including the optional areas. Once Maine has fulfilled its commitments regarding the ``low mileage'' waiver and the owner-performed repair issues, EPA will withdraw the separate rulemaking action approving the optional I/M program since that action would be superseded by such final (unconditional) approval in the context of this rulemaking. B. Enhanced I/M Performance Standard Today's proposal discusses the I/M program designed, in part, to meet the enhanced I/M performance standard for ozone precursors causing air quality problems in Maine. Maine's program was designed to meet the performance standard for volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO X ). EPA's performance standard establishes an emission reduction target that must be met by a program in order for the SIP to be approvable. The program, as documented in the SIP, must meet the performance standard in actual operation, with provisions for appropriate adjustments if the standard is not met.
