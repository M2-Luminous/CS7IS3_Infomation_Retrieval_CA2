In this afternoon's meeting with the team of reporters who accompanied him to the Mandela ceremonies, the Cuban president described the South African president's election as an enormous victory for the people of South Africa and for the world's progressive forces. It is a rebirth and proof that great victories can be achieved in the wake of international disasters which have occurred in the unipolar world in which we now live, Fidel Castro said. Asked by PRENSA LATINA about possibilities for cooperation with the new South African Government, Cuba's top leader said: "There are few countries that have the fraternal links that we share with South Africa." The country has, on the one hand, great development and standards of living, and, on the other hand, it has enormous social needs in the areas of public health, employment, education, housing, and transportation, which we were able to appreciate in our talks with members of the South African cabinet, Castro said. Castro added: Probably with no other country is there the possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties between both peoples. Regarding his first visit to this country, which a few years ago was Cuba's battlefield enemy, Castro said: "We were treated very respectfully by all sectors of society, not only from the ANC [African National Congress], but also from the Indian, white, and mestizo sectors, taking into account that this is a multiracial country in which millions of people feel the need to cooperate with one another." There are two South Africas, the Cuban president said. At various occasions in South African history, there were times of violent clashes, but now there is a new South Africa in which there is peace, respect, and affection toward Cuba. Castro believes the ANC government has a very difficult task ahead of it, because "even though it is a relatively developed country, there is a huge population that has lived for a long time under apartheid, and it has the needs and yearnings of a majority which has been discriminated against." When referring to his first visit to this southern African nation, Fidel Castro said, "with few countries do we have such heart-felt and fraternal ties as those we have cultivated over so many years with South Africa and the ANC. [no closing quotation marks as received] Every time one speaks to a South African, one first notices the great spiritual possibilities that exist, Castro said. In discussing diplomatic relations, Castro said, "We should consider them when it is right for them, at an opportune moment." Cuba will be very honored to develop its relations with South Africa, he said. I see evolving events in this country as something marvelous, and my greatest wish is that this country achieves peace and harmony, something we all must contribute to enable the efforts and sacrifices made by this a country to serve as a model for the entire world, the Cuban leader underscored. Regarding today's swearing-in ceremony, which was witnessed by more than 5,000 South Africans at the Union Building amphitheater, Castro said: "The coming together of all South Africans and all ethnic groups was beautiful. We hope that the process continues to progress in this direction." Today in South Africa, we helped bury apartheid and assisted in the birth of liberty, Fidel Castro said. This is the first time that a high-ranking official Cuban delegation has stepped onto South African soil. Both countries faced each other on the battlefield between 1976-91, when Cuban troops went to assist Angola at their request, to safeguard its independence and territory, which had been threatened by military forces backed by the racist Pretoria regime.
