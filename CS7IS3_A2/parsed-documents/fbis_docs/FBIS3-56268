The main leitmotif of the extended talks between the Russian and American delegations that took place in the Kremlin on Thursday can be phrased like this, Mamedov said -- "Russian-American relations have passed the period when bilateral relations focused on humanitarian and other assistance to Russia at the initial stage of reform." "Now they have moved on to macroeconomic partnership, support for structural reform in Russia, transformation of relations between Russia, its neighbours and large countries of the world, and changes in the attitude of international economic agencies towards reform in Russia with special attention to be paid to its social aspects,+ Mamedov said. In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, Mamedov stressed that U.S. President Bill Clinton has proposed a whole package of concrete measures to facilitate, in cooperation with other countries and international economic organisations, radical changes in approaches towards Russia to let it into the world markets and promote relations between Russia and former Soviet republics. To exemplify his point, Mamedov said that the U.S. has persuaded international economic organisations to provide financial assistance to the CIS states to buy fuel and energy in Russia at higher prices. "There is also a program of support for conversion of the defence industry aimed at preventing further increase of unemployment. The means released will be used to finance social programs, including job placement," he said. During the discussion of the economic situation in Russia Clinton said that in his opinion based on analyses provided by American institutions Russia will be able to make a breakthrough in two years. This may enable it to qualify as the eighth member of the G-7 group. "But this is a very complicated problem. The American side said it would welcome such changes from the political point of view, adding that structural reform in Russia should lead to the reorganisation of the G-7 group into a G-8 one from the economic perspective as well," Mamedov said. During the talks earlier today, Clinton voiced support for the idea of Russia's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He also said the U.S. would abolish customs duties for almost 4,400 types of Russian goods, deputy minister said.
