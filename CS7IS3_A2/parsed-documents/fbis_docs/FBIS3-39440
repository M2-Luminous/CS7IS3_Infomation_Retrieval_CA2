The MOU will provide the framework for discussions on equipment collaboration and co-operation. Industry will play a key role in fulfilling the opportunities offered by the MOU and the Ministry of Defence will explore the scope of co-operation by investigating defence procurement requirements. The MOU will build upon previous contact between British and Swedish Industry and discussions continue between British Aerospace and SAAB concerning further development and export of JAS 39 light combat aircraft. There may also be opportunities for joint development of a new generation medium range air to air missile for the Eurofighter 2000 and JAS 39 Grippen as well as for subsequent export. Mr Rifkind said: "This is a very positive step and a number of defence requirements which contain areas of similarity are currently being considered. There may be more and what this initiative will require is innovative action by our respective industries to pursue and fully exploit the opportunities offered."
