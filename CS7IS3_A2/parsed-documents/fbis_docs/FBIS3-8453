Primakov, director of Russia's Foreign Secret Service, reveal that our intelligence service has `its man in the Russian service and, vice versa, the Russians have their man in SIS [Slovak Information Service].' Thus, four years after the day on which the CSFR Interior Minister, Jan Langos, legally suspended KGB activities on CSFR territory by canceling an agreement with the KGB, we are again witnessing the legalization of activity by members of the present Russian secret service on Slovak territory. ``The Russian secret service is a direct successor to the First KGB Directorate and, from the personnel standpoint, is practically identical with it. Even if one takes into account the need for exchanging certain kinds of information between the Slovak information service and foreign information services--the Russian one included--we still consider that the presence of a representative of the Russian service in SIS amounts to a breach of the stated goals of the Slovak Republic's foreign policy. In view of the philosophy and practices of the Russian intelligence service, we feel that collaboration of the proposed sort disqualifies us from participation in wider cooperation with the special services of other democratic countries and, in conjunction with other factors, practically predetermines Slovakia's orientation toward the East. Neither can the proclaimed reason for this kind of close cooperation--fight against Russian and Chechen mafias--pass muster because these targets are not included in the Russian Federation law on foreign intelligence.''
