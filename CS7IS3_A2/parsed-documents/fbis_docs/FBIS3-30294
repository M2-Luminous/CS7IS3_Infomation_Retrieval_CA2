Export permission has been granted for goods worth 10,000 million U.S. dollars and 2,000 million German marks. "This is the first case of its kind in the history of the UN," Slavi Pashovski, Bulgarian ambassador to the UN, told BTA. "It takes the Sanctions Committee three to four weeks to consider the applications. The delay is due to the lack of a special body dealing with them alone. In the summer Bulgarian applications were blocked by Islamic member states of the Security Council," he said. "Firms should file their applications with the Ministry of Trade which sends them to the Bulgarian mission in New York. We have had as many as 200 applications on some days lately." "Currently the prevailing opinion at the UN is that no special fund can be set up to compensate losses, like the one set up after the Iraqi aggression, as no one can see any source of proceeds to Yugoslavia." Ambassador Pashovski believes UN resources of indirect compensation for Bulgaria's losses caused by the Yugo-embargo have been tapped effectively. The Sanctions Committee recognized Bulgaria's special economic problems arising from sanctions enforcement and recommended to UN specialized organisations, international financial institutions and regional banks to adjust their programmes to Bulgaria's needs. Their response so far shows their first step will be to make independent studies and estimate Bulgaria's losses., Bulgaria's estimates of the damage caused by the embargo add up to 3,500 million U.S. dollars. "Everything now depends on the government's efforts and activity," Mr. Pashovski said. "There is an idea that losses could at least be deducted from Bulgaria's debt. This is one of the key issues at the foreign-debt negotiations." Mr. Pashovski said the delay in transit road haulage through serbia on the part of Bulgaria was justified, provided it was prompted by a desire for greater accuracy. He highly commended the sanctions committee's decision to grant Bulgaria a transit transport corridor, which was refused in the summer. "The listing of Bulgarian companies in the registers of UN suppliers is a new priority of the Bulgarian mission to the UN. This is a multi-million-dollar business targeted mainly on peacekeeping operations of the world organisation and many companies will be informed about tenders for various supplies so that they could participate. To become suppliers, however, the companies will have to prove the advantages of their products over other tenderers," Ambassador Pashovksi stressed.
