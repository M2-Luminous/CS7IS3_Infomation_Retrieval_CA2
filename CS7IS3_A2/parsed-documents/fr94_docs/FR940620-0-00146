FR940620-0-00146 FR940620-0-00029 Response. The interim final provision has been changed to require that all public telephones have volume controls and be hearing aid compatible. The requirement for signage in ADAAG 4.30.7 (Symbols of Accessibility) applies only to telephones required to be accessible by ADAAG 4.1.3(17)(b) (Accessible Buildings and Facilities: New Construction) and therefore does not apply to this section. Hearing aid compatibility is already required of these telephones by the Hearing Aid Compatibility Act of 1988. (See 47 CFR part 68). Advances in TTY technology that make exterior installations feasible are being tested in several States. Requirements for exterior installations will be considered in future rulemaking. 14.2.3(3)␣Single User Toilet Facilities Paragraph (3) requires that a single user toilet facility installed on or along a public sidewalk at a single location be accessible according to ADAAG 4.22.2 through 4.22.7. Comment. The NPRM proposed that 50 percent of single user toilet facilities installed on or along a public sidewalk as part of a public improvement project comply with ADAAG 4.22 (Toilet Rooms) and sought comment on whether such scoping was appropriate in light of concerns for public safety, cost, and limited access procedures. The proposed provision would have required that half of all such items installed in a project be accessible and be dispersed throughout a project area. One manufacturer of single user toilet facilities proposed that only a percentage of units (e.g., one in four) in a ``cluster'' be accessible and that a definition of cluster be provided that would establish a maximum distance between units in a cluster, such as at the same intersection, within several blocks, or ``within sight'' of each other. However, almost all comments from persons with disabilities and organizations representing persons with disabilities supported full accessibility to all toilet units placed on public sidewalks, citing the ADAAG requirement that all new public and common use toilet rooms on sites and in buildings be accessible. Other commenters, including many municipalities and one manufacturer of public toilet units, supported a 50 percent or lesser requirement. These commenters stated that the accessible units, which are larger than inaccessible units, would be quickly vandalized and rendered unusable. Many commenters agreed that the larger accessible units could be used for shelter or illicit activities, but felt that this was not a reason to limit accessibility. Other commenters noted that both accessible and inaccessible units would be subject to vandalism and abuse. The City of San Francisco required that firms responding to its recent Request for Proposals for public toilet facilities provide only accessible units. Information provided by the City of New York indicates that they will give preference to proposals that provide 100 percent accessible public toilet facilities. Many commenters were opposed to special access requirements, such as cards and tokens, if they were required only of persons with disabilities. Several suggested that the logistics of a card distribution program would be complex and discriminatory. A number of commenters noted that providing separate adjacent facilities for persons with disabilities and persons without disabilities was wasteful of resources and space and could not ensure maintenance of either unit. Response. Single-user public toilet facilities are fixed common use elements. ADAAG 4.1.2 (6) requires all fixed public and common use toilet facilities located on a site to be accessible. Therefore, the scoping provision in this section has been changed to require the same degree of accessibility at each location in the public right-of-way where a single user toilet facility is provided on a public sidewalk. The concept of clustering (e.g., units spaced a block or street width apart) suggested by some commenters is not consistent with the current ADAAG concept, which assumes that accessible and inaccessible units are immediately adjacent. As discussed above, the term ``public improvement project'' has been deleted in the interim final rule. 14.2.3(4)␣Fixed Seating, Tables, and Benches Paragraph (4) requires that at least five percent, but not less than one, of fixed seating and tables provided at a single location be accessible. It further requires at least 50 percent of any installation or grouping of sidewalk benches fixed at a single location have a back and armrest and that space for a wheelchair be provided at the end of at least one bench. Comment. The NPRM proposed that five percent of fixed seating, tables, and benches provided in a public improvement project be accessible and be dispersed throughout a project area. Commenters supported a requirement for both backs and armrests on at least some benches, although a few noted that armrests could interfere with transfer from wheelchairs. Several wheelchair users indicated that they would be unlikely to transfer from their wheelchairs to benches along a public sidewalk, although they might do so in a park or plaza setting. Scoping percentages for benches with arms and backrests between 20 and 50 percent were recommended. The NPRM also sought comment on ADAAG specifications for benches. Many commenters noted that backs and armrests are needed so that ambulatory persons with mobility or stamina impairments can use them. Although there was no consensus about back, seat, or armrest height, most commenters recommended that the reference to ADAAG 4.35.4 (Dressing and Fitting Rooms: Bench) be removed because it is not applicable to benches of the type generally placed along public rights-of-way. A few commenters recommended that a space be required at the end of a bench for the positioning of a wheelchair to allow shoulder-to-shoulder seating. One commenter recommended that benches be located only within a strip reserved for street furnishings along a curb and clear of the pedestrian circulation path. Response. As discussed above, the term ``public improvement project'' has been deleted. This provision has been changed to require that 50 percent of benches installed at a single location have both a back and armrests. The reference to ADAAG 4.35.4 has been removed. The requirements for fixed seating and tables are unchanged. Where a group of adjacent benches is provided, 50 percent of the benches must have a back and armrests. A requirement for a wheelchair space has been added. An appendix note recommends that street furnishing zones be established on public sidewalks to improve the predictability of pedestrian environments. 14.2.3(5)␣Bus Shelters and Stops Paragraph (5) requires that bus stop pads comply ADAAG 10.2.1(1) and bus stop shelters comply with ADAAG 10.2.1(2). This provision has been relocated from proposed 14.2.1 (Sidewalks) in the NPRM. Few comments were received regarding this provision and only editorial changes were made.
