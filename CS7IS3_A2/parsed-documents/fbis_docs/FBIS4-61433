The aim of the operation Putina-94 which was started on April 20 is to combat illegal fishery in the Far East. As Sergeyev said, the frontier guards have inspected 22 ships, 12 of them were Russians, eight crafts belonged to Japan, two to North Korea. "The frontier guards exposed seven violating ships which were sailing under the Russian flag," noted Sergeyev. Penalties were imposed on five ships for violations in filling in their fishery journals and three of them for polluting of the sea. As many as two ships, the Sakhalin floating base Konstitutsiya SSSR and the Primorsk transport ship Subaru, violated the customs rules. An investigation is to be continued on land. In addition, the frontier guards were forced to chase one ship, the Nakhodka trawler Stal which disobeyed the order to stop. When the inspection group came aboard the trawler, it failed to find any violations. "It was just instinct on the part of the Stal's captain -- if you are chased, then run away. He received a warning from the frontier guards," said Sergeyev. In general as many as 20 Russian and four foreign ships were caught in the course of the Putina-94 operation, Commander of the Pacific Frontier District Major General Vitaliy Sedykh declared at a press conference devoted to the conclusion of the first stage of the operation and staged on Friday in Vladivostok. According to Sedykh, as many as 700 ships were found in Russia's economic zone, including more than 200 foreign ships. The frontier guards have inspected more than 100 Russian and 20 foreign ships which appeared to be Japanese fishing boats. The captains of three fishing boats made violations in compiling permission cards for the fishery of sea products in the Russian economic zone and were deprived of them. On April 22 a Japanese fishing boat Elyu-Maru-86 violated the rules near the Southern Kurils by not passing one of the checking points. A penalty of 15,385 dollars was imposed on the crew. Ships assigned to the Pacific Fleet, fish protection bodies Primorrybvoda and Sakhrybvoda, employees of the Federal Counterintelligence Service and of the Far Eastern Customs Department participated in the operation along with the frontier guards of the Pacific frontier district. Tracking devices to monitor the situation in this region were used in this operation.
