The delegation, comprised of 16 members of seven nationalist organizations in Japan, was invited by a private association that promotes exchanges with the Chinese. Organizers in Osaka said it is the first time that representatives from more than one nationalist organization have been allowed into Communist China at the same time. The members are scheduled to visit Beijing, Dalian and Shanghai. They will meet with members of government and research bodies to debate China's military growth, the export of military weapons and technology, and China's territorial claims to the Senkaku Islands located about 160 kilometers north of Yaeyama Islands, southwest of Okinawa. The group also will distribute documents outlining arguments against the commonly accepted version of the 1937 Nanjing massacre, in which more than 142,000 Chinese were killed according to estimates made at the Tokyo war crimes trials. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to visit China this weekend, but the group's organizers said their visit will be different. "We take China seriously. Unlike the present administration's apologetic diplomacy, we want to change the historical awareness of the last 100 years from the Sino-Japanese war, which has been only a discussion in diplomacy of assailants and victims," the members said.
