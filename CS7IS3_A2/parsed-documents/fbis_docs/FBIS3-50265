I have an appeal to make to you, our viewers -- we would like to also receive your questions which we will then pass on to the minister. Some of them we will try to answer during the program, and so our phone lines are already open; the number is 625-66-77. We are waiting for your questions and, while we are waiting for them, there will be questions from us, journalists. Mr. Minister, let us begin with what may seem like a routine issue but which caused quite a bit of confusion last Friday [21 January] when the press, radio, and television circulated reports of your planned dismissal. We have here a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to verify that. What is going on? Are these just rumors? What is this all about? [Kolodziejczyk] This happened because of ZYCIE WARSZAWY. Of course, the information has absolutely nothing to do with the truth. I am amazed since, up to now, ZYCIE WARSZAWY has been regarded as a daily which provides truthful information. [Moderator] So that means you are denying the reports. [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, absolutely. [Moderator] So the reports are truly false. [Reporter] But Mr. Minister, what about the reasons which were listed in ZYCIE WARSZAWY -- do you think they are not credible, I mean for instance the coalition's pressure to assume deputy- ministerial posts in your ministry? And what about the budget draft, which I take it you are unhappy with and which is currently being worked on in the Sejm, and also the probable failure of the concept of a National Security Council? Do all these reasons not cause you to consider the possibility of resigning? [Kolodziejczyk] No, they do not. I assumed the post to solve problems and not to try to avoid solving them or to desert. That is why everything is still ahead of us. The budget has not acquired its final shape yet, whereas issues of personnel appointments have not been on the agenda, and, frankly speaking, there have not been any serious talks on that topic yet.... [Moderator, interrupting] Mr. Minister, I think we will be dealing with these issues later on. [Reporter] But Mr. Minister, if we were to look at what I will call a conclusion of everything that we are talking about here: This is linked with this alleged dismissal of yours. You are subordinated both to the prime minister and the president. The president is commander of the Armed Forces whereas the prime minister is the government's chief and also your direct superior. Whose order would you execute if it were to turn out that the two officials' orders contradict one another? [Kolodziejczyk] The president is the constitutional superior over the Armed Forces and he has appropriate powers for that. But what you asked is quite a theoretical proposition because up to now.... [Reporter, interrupting] But it may turn out a [word indistinct] problem. [Kolodziejczyk] Up to now, both these gentlemen charged with responsibility over the country's security have been cooperating with one another in a way which I think.... [Reporter, interrupting] And what if there was to be a disagreement anyway [word indistinct]? [Kolodziejczyk, hesitating] I hope that will not happen. After all, the responsibility linked to these people's high posts must prevail. There can be no private views of any kind involved. The interests of the state are what must prevail, and there are no signs so far that it should be otherwise. [Moderator] Mr. Minister, excuse me. So let us finish the issue of your alleged dismissal. You denied the rumors. The next issue which I think will be a major theme of our conversation today is the situation which has emerged after the Prague and Brussels summits, and everything going along with that. There were a lot of debates but mainly on the diplomatic side, concerning the sense of safety, grand issues on a high level, but I would like to ask you a blunt question: What about the cost? The cost will probably have to be borne by you. I read in one of your statements that you do not even have the money to open up a bureau in Brussels. So what is the situation practically speaking? What about our participation in joint maneuvers? Who will pay for that? [Kolodziejczyk] Well, strictly speaking, there is no such item listed in the budget. I have postulated to have the budget supplemented because naturally, these issues will have to be accompanied by expenditures. In any case, the documents of the Brussels summit clearly say that the partners shall bear the cost of their participation. It is a huge problem since we are aware that the NATO countries will come up with some monies and they will be available to those who themselves have contributed in a major way. So far -- if the budget is approved in its proposed form -- there is really no money for participation in the Partnership for Peace initiative. [Reporter] On the topic of Partnership for Peace: Leszek Moczulski, chairman of the Confederation for an Independent Poland, said it was a defeat for Polish diplomats whereas other political parties were more restrained in their assessments. What is your evaluation of the proposal, from a military standpoint? [Kolodziejczyk] I regard Mr. Moczulski's evaluation as a good sign for the initiative's future, since his predictions have to date proved untrue. [Reporter] My question is very specific. Last Thursday, you held a conference with Foreign Minister Olechowski. You were both working on a kind of letter of intent containing our proposals, I mean a list of goals which we want to achieve within Partnership for Peace. Could you tell us what are our main goals which we want to achieve through the Partnership? And another question, which is linked to that: Do you think that this is a kind of camouflaged path into NATO? I mean camouflaged in the sense that we have to do something so as not to irritate Russia? [Kolodziejczyk] No, no. First of all, I must make a correction here. The meeting with Minister Olechowski took place face-to-face, so whatever is said as to its topic is just allegations, but I can reveal that information. The Partnership for Peace initiative has been developing [hesitating] quite fast. We must be prepared to undertake the appropriate measures, but the immediate topic of my meeting [with Olechowski] was my two-day visit to Prague, which begins tomorrow, and another visit to Berlin where I will meet German Defense Minister Ruehe. During the meeting with Minister Olechowski, we had to agree on some details and on some topics to be discussed there, and also to agree on some issues which may be the subject of debates both in Prague and Berlin. [Reporter] Let us continue with the Washington theme. Namely, last Thursday German NTV Television showed pictures during a report from Washington of Minister Olechowski talking to the press and to some experts, and the television reported that while substituting for you [Kolodziejczyk] he informed the Americans about what type of airborne equipment we need, and also what kind of modernization of armored forces and what kind of airborne defense system we need. Can you confirm or deny this information? [Kolodziejczyk] I think it is a good sign if the foreign minister is a spokesman for the defense minister and if he can competently discuss some issues in my place. Minister Olechowski and I are cooperating quite closely and I think that cooperation will bring about good results. [Reporter] Mr. Minister, what kind of an amount are we talking about? I mean, by how much would the ministry's budget have to be increased to enable talking about Partnership in reasonable terms? There is talk in the Sejm about a sum of 500 billion zlotys. Is that true? [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, it is, but let us be more precise here. NATO has about 200 various working groups and if we were to send there just 100 officers this year without special equipment, that in itself would cost about 60-80 billion zlotys. If we want to participate in maneuvers, that will mean additional costs, whereas it is the intensity of our participation precisely in those maneuvers and also in work by the General Headquarters and by other working groups, that determine the rate of Poland's getting close to NATO. We want to see that process of getting close happen. [Reporter] But where will we get the money, Mr. Minister? [Kolodziejczyk] That is exactly the question. [Reporter] [words indistinct] of a social kind of collection, such as in the case of the chief officer of a group of villages, I think from Koscierzyna, who came up with the idea of a fund which would support our Armed Forces [words indistinct]? [Kolodziejczyk] I regard Mr. Tkaczyk's initiative as a very noble one, and in any event, it has been accompanied by quite a good response, since both people associated with the old National Army [Armia Krajowa] as well as the Podhalanie group and other professional groups -- we also saw some street poll results at the program's beginning. Right now, work is going on regarding how to organize a foundation from a legal standpoint -- a foundation which could financially support the Army, especially regarding the Army's technical modernization. [Reporter] [words indistinct] Mr. Minister, how many Polish military officers speak English? [Kolodziejczyk] About 1,000 -- this is how many of them are active in various peace missions, so they have some experience in that regard. We keep training them intensively, and not just in Poland. It is of course a problem, but it is not insurmountable. Still, money remains the fundamental problem since it is also needed for language training. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] Mr. Minister, what are in actual fact your priorities as defense minister in relation to the West? Should not these priorities be, for instance, primarily about gaining access to sophisticated technology, and if so -- in what areas? [Kolodziejczyk] Exactly, that is precisely so. That is the most serious problem since if we want to approach NATO standards, then we must have knowledge concerning those standards -- that is guaranteed by the Partnership for Peace initiative, that is the first thing. Secondly, we must establish technological cooperation. Our intellectual potential is significant and we are very close to finalizing many, very interesting research and scientific projects. But there is no money for that, including within the Scientific Research Committee since the Army does not have a lot of money, either. Technological cooperation could solve a great deal of our problems based on our research institutes and our industry. [Reporter] [words indistinct] technological cooperation between Poland and NATO, and that we should be approaching NATO technically speaking. Meanwhile, Hungary intends to purchase -- or perhaps they already purchased -- a Russian early-warning system which is reported to be the most modern available. Is what you said really the only direction for Poland? [Kolodziejczyk] [words indistinct] not quite correct information. Hungary has purchased -- or rather obtained in lieu of their debt -- 24 MiG-29 aircraft which are regarded by the NATO countries as contemporary technology, and Hungary also intends to purchase an S-300 antiaircraft defense system. Indeed, when one compares the technical parameters, that system is more efficient and more productive than the Patriot system. We ourselves are considering -- unless there are other offers -- purchasing the S-300 system. [Reporter] From Russia? [Kolodziejczyk] [words indistinct] but that is a kind of topic where I would like to add a few more things: Cooperation with NATO does not mean identical techniques and technologies immediately. The most important aspects are command systems, fire-direction systems, communications systems which would most probably have to be changed as priority, and reconnaissance systems. These will be able to be made uniform quite soon. On the other hand, introducing modern technology within the armored or airborne troops -- that has to be extended into a process. Anyway, just take a look if you please, at the state of technology in the Portuguese Armed Forces, for instance -- the country is a full NATO member -- and a comparison with Portugal is not so bad for us at all.... [Reporter, interrupting] [words indistinct] excuse me. German Defense Minister Ruehe will probably suggest to you in a few days that joint maneuvers should be conducted, and these will take place very soon, that is in September 1994. Can we afford to take part in such maneuvers? Is it your prediction that apart from the joint trilateral naval maneuvers -- I mean among Denmark, Germany, and Poland -- there will also be land maneuvers? Can we afford that financially? [Kolodziejczyk] Let us talk about that once I am back from Berlin -- right now it would be tantamount to counting our chickens before they are hatched. [Reporter] Partnership for Peace is also about securing a gradual, civilian, and democratic control over the Army. Meantime, some reforms being conducted in the Defense Ministry -- for instance the transfer of the Personnel Department to the General Staff -- is kind of a contradiction of that democratic principle. [Kolodziejczyk] What you are saying was fabricated by the press and has absolutely nothing to do with the truth. As for today, the relationship between civilian-military structures and those purely military ones, is a 50-50 relationship, or close to it. Nobody has any intention of giving up any department for the sake of the General Staff, and as regards the educational functions and the practical work along with the soldier -- that must be conducted in the command system, that is to say close to the General Staff. I want to emphasize very strongly that we are aware that one of the most fundamental and cardinal preconditions for our approaching European security structures is a democratic supervision over the Army, that is over the Armed Forces, and we will not give it up. [Reporter] But Mr. Minister, we are talking here about the Army, which also includes the Military Information Services, so do you think that these services should be subject to parliamentary supervision? [Kolodziejczyk] Of course they should. Regarding the type of supervision or its extent -- that is something to be debated. But the supervision as such must exist and I personally think -- this is my personal view -- that the Sejm should appoint a group consisting of people enjoying public confidence, for a longer term -- something akin to the Constitutional Tribunal or the State Tribunal -- and these people would then exercise a very detailed supervision over the military special services. For the time being, a completely different kind of measure is being prepared it seems, the inception of which, by the way, dates back to the 10th Term Sejm but was never implemented in practice. [Reporter] Mr. Minister, I would like to return for a moment to the Defense Ministry's budget. You are complaining about lack of funds whereas in the meantime, about 4 percent of the budget goes to the Defense Ministry's central agencies. The central agencies represent military bureaucracy. The funds spent on that purpose have not decreased during recent years -- that means that military bureaucracy is also getting stronger. [Kolodziejczyk] Listen, it is 4 percent but it is not spent on the bureaucracy -- that is what the whole misunderstanding is about. The 4 percent is also spent on investments, including computerization, introducing information systems -- everything that is linked with technical progress and that is why we should not ignore the fact that included in the 4 percent are all the other sections without which we will never approach the level of any contemporary army in today's world. [Reporter] Mr. Minister, you said you are very aware of the importance of civilianization of the military services -- that is the Army -- as one of the important preconditions for joining NATO. But your first step after assuming the post of minister was to suspend the internal regulations issued by the former minister, who had acted in the direction of a firm civilianization of the Defense Ministry. How would you explain that? [Kolodziejczyk] Very simply. First of all, the internal regulations had indeed been approved but they were never implemented in practice. There were some controversial provisions included there which failed to delineate clear lines of division of powers -- that is the primary thing. But there is also the aspect that the law on the Armed Forces' functioning is tangled up and in disarray, and we began the process of remedying that from the top down: The prerogatives of the Republic of Poland's Security Council, the Council of Ministers' Defense Affairs Committee, amendments made to the Law on the Popular Defense Obligation which will make a very precise kind of distinction [hesitating] between [word indistinct] and obligations or powers of a civilian defense minister and the chief of the General Staff, followed by corrections made to the internal rules you mentioned. To do it in reverse order would lead to an even greater discrepancy than the one we have right now. [Reporter] Mr. Minister, there are approximately as many people working in our arms industry as there are in the Armed Forces. What is your evaluation of the role of the Polish arms industry in the efforts to increase the country's security? Is there not any neglect here in terms of doctrine, in terms of what we really want, or is it just an issue of money? [Kolodziejczyk] No, there is no neglect of this kind, but we are struggling with what is the legacy of the past period. Our [arms] industry until recently -- that is as recently as four years ago -- produced 50 percent of its production for the purposes of the Armed Forces and the other 50 percent was exported out of the country. Currently the exports have died out completely, the Armed Forces' demand decreased to what are outright symbolic figures, and so the huge industry and its potential is not being used. Military orders alone are not enough to keep the industry afloat, it needs to be restructured soon, it needs a definition of those areas which have good future prospects, as well as those that are not profitable in which case.... [Reporter, interrupting] So could you define them? [Kolodziejczyk] Listen, we have already been through that. I could well define them once I learn in what areas of technology we will be able to cooperate with the West. That is the fundamental issue without which we will fail to decide what to sustain. But it is an obvious truth that a sovereign state must base its Army's supplies on domestic industry to a large extent. [Reporter] But on the other hand, the Defense Ministry refuses to purchase quite modern IRYD aircraft and at the same time the ministry maintains completely obsolete and costly MiG-21 aircraft. One hour of operation by such an aircraft costs about 50 million zlotys. Can you not see that these aircraft devour the money that could be spent on IRYD aircraft that could be manufactured? [Kolodziejczyk] Listen, one just cannot confuse the functions of an education-training aircraft with those of a combat aircraft. Unfortunately, the MiG-21's are being withdrawn, they will not be subjected to overhauls or supplemented with [word indistinct] electronic equipment, which is the case for instance with MiG-29's. Still, we need them for the time being since we are below the level of [word indistinct]. The IRYD on the other hand -- under the assumptions guiding it -- was to be an education-combat aircraft, but the industry failed to implement that assumption.... [Reporter, interrupting] But it can still be such an aircraft [words indistinct]. [Kolodziejczyk] If it becomes such an aircraft, then we will start purchasing it. But it is not the case for the time being and the industry is doing very little -- or practically nothing -- to fulfill those preconditions which had been set at the initial phase of the process of designing the aircraft. [Reporter] [words indistinct] will you devote to Polish industry this year? [Kolodziejczyk] Out of the Defense Ministry's budget? It will be about 15 percent. As far as I... I am sorry. Let me put it another way: 75 percent of what there is, goes for arms purchases and the remaining 15 percent will be for indispensable purchases of spare parts as well as for overhauls of post-Soviet equipment since our industry does not have the capability to produce the parts. [Reporter] On the issue of post-Soviet: Mr. Minister, do you not think that the Soviet Union could use Partnership for Peace to make a faster and more effective approach to the West than Poland, which would then create a kind of political gap? That is my first question, and I have another one related to the first question: Namely, the current governing coalition regards improvement of relations with the East as one of its priorities, parallel to the strategic goal of getting closer to NATO. What is your perspective on this? Do you see any chance at all for such cooperation with the East regarding security policy in a situation where the East is not making it easy for you, for instance -- ignoring for a moment the issue of military doctrine -- by refusing to decrease the levels of heavy armaments? [Kolodziejczyk] You know, these are extremely complicated issues. You asked whether Russia will not get ahead of us in its efforts to be a NATO member. The political situation is a precondition to even begin talking about Partnership for Peace -- by political situation I mean a democratic regime, clarity of military budgets, democratic supervision over the Army, and so on and so forth. I hope that kind of process has been initiated in Moscow, although recent news from there does not indicate that the process could be fast. Well, from a technological standpoint I am sure Russia would be a more interesting partner than us -- I mean aircraft, rockets, not to mention cluster weapons, to name just a few. Now, regarding creation of security for our country, I think there are four parallel paths involved here: The first one is precisely about good cooperation and relationships with all our neighbors and, at least as far as we in the Defense Ministry are concerned, we are trying to build such good relationships. A second issue -- or a second path if you like -- is regional cooperation to which we will be condemned for many years to come, for instance by using the same kind of technology -- I will not discuss this in detail, we will talk about this in Prague, as well. A third direction is about getting closer to the European security structures, while a fourth one is about activation of disarmament, I mean the Vienna disarmament process. The fewer weapons there are -- and there are still whole arsenals of nuclear weapons in Europe to the east of our borders -- the less security, naturally. [sentence as heard] [Reporter] Do you believe that Ukraine will get rid of its nuclear weapons like it declared during the Clinton-Yeltsin-Kravchuk meeting? [Kolodziejczyk] I hope it will. [Reporter] Mr. Minister, you said a moment ago that we must establish technological cooperation with NATO countries. Does Poland have access to the latest technologies right now? [Kolodziejczyk] Unfortunately, we do not; but we are looking for alternative solutions. We have cooperation with the Swedes which looks promising, with a company as famous as Thompson, which is already in cooperation with us with regard to production of reconnaissance, identification, and navigation systems which will make it possible to release some additional frequency channels for television. [Moderator] [Words indistinct] I have a few questions here precisely on that issue: What is you perspective on the issue of granting frequencies to television stations? [Former Defense] Minister Onyszkiewicz kept saying it was apparently possible. [Kolodziejczyk] Whatever was possible, was done -- I am saying that with full responsibility for my words. In any case, this is an issue for the Communications Ministry, with which we have signed appropriate agreements.... [Reporter, interrupting] [Words indistinct] done in that case because you said whatever possible.... [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] Those channels which the Army is now using -- we cannot release them because of the security of flights and because of state security. [Reporter] So that means that the National Radio and Television Council holds sessions and interviews candidates [to receive frequency channels] almost for their own sake, but the Army does not intend to release any additional frequencies anyway? [Kolodziejczyk] First of all, one must sit down at a table and begin talking. So far this has not happened. We have been debating through the mass media and [passage indistinct] and the three channels is the absolutely minimum amount indispensable to the Army and as we keep introducing new technologies -- especially radiolocating and electronic ones -- we will be surrendering these channels, but there is resistance.... [Reporter, interrupting] On the issue of talking to one another through the Sejm. The Sejm National Defense Commission has criticized in the past the concentration of different functions performed by Minister Milewski. Do you think that there cannot be more than two deputy ministers in the ministry? I think that would resolve a great many political problems.... [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] I am sure we could use another deputy minister just to act as sentry on the government's benches during Sejm sessions, since it requires enormous amounts of time. [Reporter] I have a very specific question: How do you intend to go about solving the following issue.... [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] But I did not answer completely a moment ago. The controversial case of Minister Milewski is completely different than what the press presents to their readers or viewers. The press is telling only part of the truth. The other part is that his appointment is linked to the intention to reform the entire management scheme of the state's security apparatus, where the National Security Bureau -- or practically the National Council's Secretariat -- will be performing technical functions. The point is to avoid repeating some functions within the Army's and the National Security Bureau's structures, and that is why the post will be absolutely of a technical nature; it is acceptable and there are no legal impediments to that. On the contrary, I will say it could facilitate transferring tasks from the National Council's decisionmaking area to the executive area, that is the Defense Ministry or the Council of Ministers and the Council of Ministers' Defense Affairs Committee I mentioned before, which I hope will be established soon. [Reporter] [words indistinct] directs two ministries? [Kolodziejczyk] That is a matter of convention. Social and defense policies are reconcilable, and there is also the issue of the number of director-generals and so forth who are a step below, and we have to keep in mind we are trying to fight bureaucracy. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Mr. Minister, the rate of increase of religious chaplains in the Army has been the same as the increase in the popularity of the weekly NIE among the cadre. So my question is: What are the guiding principles behind the education process in the Army currently, and also: Are not the educators' minds in a whirl? [Kolodziejczyk] Listen, the Army is indeed the last institution which has been trying to continue -- I repeat: continue -- the education process. It is not possible during a year and a half to make up for neglect which began back in kindergarten, high school, or even in the family. We must be very clear on that. But as regards reading NIE, I think that the popularity rate is not very different from what happens generally in society. Above all, if we talk about democracy -- including in the Army, which has to be somewhat limited there -- then let us not try to force soldiers to read this and not read that. It is an issue of their will and that will must be respected. [passage omitted]
