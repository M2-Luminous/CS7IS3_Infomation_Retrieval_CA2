FBIS4-10448 "drlat071_b_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Dominican Republic Haiti CONACOM Disagrees With Resolution CONACOM Disagrees With Resolution FL1304002994 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 12 Apr 94 FL1304002994 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Excerpts] Within the scope of reactions to the implementation of Article 149 of the Constitution, the National Congress of Democratic Movements [CONACOM], one of the two rival branches of Haitian socialism, called on Haitians on 11 April to mobilize in order to prevent the implementation of Article 149 of the Constitution. [passage omitted] Let us listen to the explanations of Dunois Eric Cantave, the person in charge of political affairs in CONACOM. [Begin Cantave recording, in Creole] Personally, I will say that I understand them, but I do not agree with them. I understand them because everybody in the country is tired of the crisis. Everybody is tired of the status quo and the wait-and-see policy that prevails. The country's economy has gone to ruin. The middle classes are exhausted. Regarding the people, the most serious thing that can happen to them is repression, starvation, death through a lack of care. Everybody is fatigued. It is normal and it is [word indistinct] that citizens are proposing initiatives, but I do not agree with the methods they are using, methods using threats, and through which they violate a pact that was signed and which provided that those who were elected in the 18 January [1993] elections should step aside until the arbitration committee offers a verdict on their case. I disagree especially because, as we in CONACOM always say, the solution must take into account first President Aristide and all those who were regularly elected in the country. Second, it must take into account the military institution that is the keeper of public order and which is also one of the protagonists in the crisis. Third, it must take into account what we call the international community, an unavoidable economic partner. [end recording] The only consequence of such a strategy would be the exaggerated extension of the embargo that has had hard effects on the majority of the social body, while making a minority rich; and the prolongation of the logic of coup d'etat with all that that involves, such as threats against the national institutions, social frustrations, and repressions throughout the country, CONACOM says.
