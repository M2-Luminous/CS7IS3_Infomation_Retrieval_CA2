Gimelli was one of the foreign executives invited to the Eighth International Aerospace Fair (FIDAE) in Santiago, which closed on 27 March. Delegations from 33 countries attended the fair. In today's issue EL MERCURIO published Gimelli's comments that the Italian presence at FIDAE was considerable, because Italy wanted to show its interest in participating in the modernization process of the Chilean Armed Forces. Gimelli was optimistic about future cooperation with the Chilean Armed Forces. Regarding the military fields in which Alenia works, he said his company could cooperate in systems for strengthening naval units, in changing radar systems, and in air defense. He added that the best way to invest in Chile is to manufacture in cooperation with Chilean companies, in the way his company has done in Spain, the United States, and in other countries for a long time. He indicated that the level of economic growth and the responsibility of Chilean businessmen convey trust. He added: "The idea is to exchange our products again. Coming to FIDAE was the first step." Alenia is carrying out several technological projects in South America, such as construction of the Argentine satellite "Nahuel," which will control all communications in that country. Alenia is also working on the "Global Star" system, which will interconnect all the world's cellular telephones, while in the military sector it produces anti-air systems; radar for ships, aircraft, and airplanes; satellites; and helicopters, among other military products.
