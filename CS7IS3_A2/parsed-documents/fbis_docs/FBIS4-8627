Yesterday afternoon the justice minister dedicated the renovated building of the Dombovar Municipal Court, which has been functioning for 80 years. Istvan Balsai rated as spectacular the achievements of the government's four years in office, the judiciary's elevation to a position worthy of a rule-of-law state, the increase in judges' salaries, and the improvement of their working conditions. "I am confident that we will be able to continue this trend in the future. After all, there is much left to be done in the coming period as well," the minister said. Incidentally, the development of the security system absorbed nearly half of the Dombovar Municipal Court building's renovation cost. In the evening Istvan Balsai, member of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] executive committee, and attorney Dr. Marianna Monostori, MDF candidate for Parliament in Tolna County's fourth electoral district, attended a local political rally. According to Istvan Balsai, the statements made by prominent politicians of more than one political party following the start of the election campaign were without foundation. They claimed that the handing in of nomination forms and the elections themselves were shrouded in an atmosphere of fear. He categorically denied the accusations made by the president of the Hungarian Socialist Party that the vicinity of his party's headquarters was under surveillance and the party's telephones were being tapped. The purpose of this completely unfounded accusation might be to confuse the citizens and to question the country's democratic functioning. Istvan Balsai rejected also the political statements that questioned freedom of the press, citing the situation of Hungarian Radio's public employees.
