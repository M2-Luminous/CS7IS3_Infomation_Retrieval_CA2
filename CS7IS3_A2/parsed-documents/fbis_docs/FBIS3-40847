In this short period of one month, signs indicate that Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is sitting in the chief minister's chair for the second time, appears to be politically more intelligent this time. He appears to be more capable of reading the sensitivity of the political climate now. It appears that he learned from his past mistakes and is standing on firmer ground. He has learned facts now after his hard work. Mulayam Singh is known for his own personal political style. This is his asset and strength. This asset is still intact with him. One positive indication is that the bragging that had previously made him a victim of criticism, or the political equations that made him unsure of himself, is decreasing now. This is Mulayam Singh's changed image, who is cementing his friendship with Kanshi Ram. Mulayam Singh, who was educated in the political school of Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, has some special qualities which make him important in the state politics despite all the criticism and accusations levied against him. The new atmosphere that came into Indian politics with Rajiv Gandhi somewhat escaped Mulayam Singh. The fact that he had a Rajiv-supported government in the state for some time is a separate issue. Mulayam Singh never joined the political "suit and safari" culture. From the beginning until now, he is still a swadeshi Mulayam Singh. He never reduced his interests and relations with villagers, village meetings, and farms. These very swadeshi connections that Mulayam Singh has have given him the self-confidence to take the great risk of jumping into the Vidhan Sabha elections in association with Kanshi Ram's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). He ignored all the threats issued by the imams and propaganda issued by the Janata family, and insisted on his own friendly left-wing leaders. He took the risk of walking alone, and was successful because his feet were on the ground in this state, and his fingers were on the pulse of the people. Therefore, Mulayam Singh turned a deaf ear toward them all and continued to walk. The political pundits wrote his political future before the election and made some forecasts. He was not affected by them, though. He says unofficially now, "Who believed that I would be able to form a government on my own? The people have given their decree now, though, and all their assumptions have failed." Kanshi Ram has his own style. We cannot believe that Mulayam Singh is unaware of this style. Nor is it possible that he is not aware of Kanshi Ram's political activities. Still, the skill he showed in keeping their coalition in order to establish government in this state is the result of his changed attitude and his political savvy. If we had the Mulayam Singh of the past, then there would be a large number of people who believed that this coalition would not be successful in forming a government. Kanshi Ram did not support the inclusion of his BSP in the state government. All he wanted was to support Mulayam Singh and to let him form the government. However, Mulayam Singh finally convinced him, and the BSP joined the government. This happened because he felt that it would be difficult to run a government with the BSP outside of it and not being responsible for the consequences. His attitude toward Ayodhya and Dunkel is not extremist now. Until yesterday, he carried the flag of a one-sided opinion on both these issues. He is more in control now, though, and is neither fighting the central government on Dunkel, nor is he a spokesman for the mosque politics of Ayodhya. The political balance that Mulayam Singh demonstrated on both these burning questions at least shows that his past experience has made him mulayam' [mellow] and serious. This change in Mulayam Singh Yadav has occurred in several phases. He comments very carefully on any political question that affects the Uttar Pradesh political equation. He is becoming an expert on ignoring specific questions in a specific style. Questions related to his coalition party, the Bahujan Samaj Party, show his new style. He is fully aware of the situation that helped him get the chief minister's position in the state. He is always aware of the importance of his friendship with Kanshi Ram. He tries his best to ensure that he does not comment on the statement made by Kanshi Ram, the BSP chief. Kanshi Ram's comment, "I want an unstable government everywhere," only made Mr. Yadav smile. He later said, "You had better ask Kanshi Ram about it." On further questioning, he says that he said this about other places, not about Uttar Pradesh. We are fully stable in this state, he said. Mulayam Singh shows a lot of this type of political skill now. He avoids making political comments because, as he said himself, people get confused. "When people spread confusion in the past, I stopped going to Delhi. If I come here, anyone I talk to gets confused." Who are the people who confuse the issue? He does not give any names. But he repeats many times that he is fully with Kanshi Ram now. He calls what happened in the UP Vidhan Sabha on the first day of the session deplorable and inappropriate. Later, he tells the whole story off the record. He hints that there should be no cheating on examinations, and that his government will take some important steps. In unofficial talks, he says, "You see, no one will be able to copy at all." He gives some reasoning, off the record, in implementation of the Gunda Act. While mentioning the arrest of Chowdhery Manmohan, Mayavati, and his own brother, Ram Pal, under this act, he says, "Was using the Gunda Act to arrest Ram Pal legal?" He admits that this act was abused. The political styles of Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna and Bir Bahadur Singh are discussed often in the state. Both these leaders had the political asset of being able to recognize even a minor political worker and meet him directly. Mulayam Singh is also driving his political vehicle on this path. That is why his party is behind him and he is leading it. What he has learned from Lohia and Charan Singh has helped him get the chief minister's chair now. His political history shows that whenever and wherever he had to stay behind his party, he could not stop himself for long.
