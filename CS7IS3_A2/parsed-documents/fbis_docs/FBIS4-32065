Near the frontline hamlet of Hasici, Abdic's men were hastily digging a new network of trenches Sunday following the news that the village of Todorov, three kilometres (two miles) down the valley, had just fallen to the Bosnian Army 5th Corps. The battle for the Bihac pocket in northwestern Bosnia, where the millionaire businessman has declared autonomy from Sarajevo, has stepped up as his Serb-backed forces fight desperately to contain the Bosnian Army advance. The guns in Bosnia, which elsewhere have fallen generally quiet since the temporary ceasefire of June 10, are still clearly audible in this "autonomous province" proclaimed by Abdic last September. With the ceasefire taking effect along the front line between separatist Serb and Bosnian Army forces, the Army's 5th Corps, entrenched in the southern part of the enclave, launched a new offensive which Abdic's raggle-taggle troops appear unable to contain. UN military observers said that unless they received men and equipment from separatist Serbs in the neighbouring Krajina region of Croatia, Abdic's forces would be unable to contain the advance of the 5th Army Corps for much longer. Rebel troops in Hasici wore an air of unease as they manned their posts. "The last civilian fled this sector two days ago," the commanding officer explained nervously. Some of his men had no uniforms. The nearby woods and surrounding fields echoed with automatic weapons' fire. "The balance of forces is very unfavourable for Abdic, 500 men against 15,000, a group of men little better than a militia up against a war-hardened army," a UN observer said on condition of anonymity. UN reports say that Krajina Serbs have been shooting at the Bosnian 5th Corps for several days, despite denials by Abdic's spokesmen. "I'm not sure the support of Serb guns is enough to redress the situation," the UN observer commented. In Velika Kladusa, Abdic's stronghold near the Croatian border, the dull thud of gunfire was clearly audible. These were 122mm or 132mm guns, according to a UN European officer. The 5th Corps has lost about 70 men in the battle for Bihac, diverse sources agree, and although the toll among Abdic's men is not known, it is likely to be much higher. Almost 400 of his troops have been taken prisoner. Several civilians fleeing the fighting were seen near Velika Kladusa on Saturday, the first sign of a collapse in morale in territory that he controls. "There is no massive exodus nor any housing problems for the time being," said Monique Fufelli, head of the local mission of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "Houses are very dispersed in the rural region and people have been put up by relatives," she said.
