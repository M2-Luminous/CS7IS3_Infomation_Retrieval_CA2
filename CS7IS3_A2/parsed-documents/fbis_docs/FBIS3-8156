New elements appeared in the relations of the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] with those parties, including a new context of negotiations for a new political climate and the possibility of establishing a broader framework of parliamentary cooperation, which does not mean inclusion in government. Ion Iliescu noted that these negotiations were assessed as interesting, constructive, and capable of opening up a new stage in the development of political life which would grant more substance to the joint efforts of all political parties. Asked by one of the journalists to reveal whether in the near future the establishment of a government team with the parliamentary opposition is possible, President Ion Iliescu said that in a democratic system, regardless of participation or nonparticipation in the government, all political forces are in one way or another drawn and absorbed into the joint effort to achieve the country's reconstruction. In a democratic practice, Iliescu said, the opposition has a constructive role, even when it is very virulent and aggressive toward the ruling party, and it makes a useful act of active political and social criticism. Romania's president further said: I believe that we can enter a stage of normality, of civilized and constructive dialogue, which will serve everybody. A government with the opposition is another question that presumes other steps to achieve a possible platform for unity in a broader government team. It would not be wrong to achieve such a thing, said Ion Iliescu, who added that he has always been open to such a formula. This presupposes a better platform and he will follow the current talks between the PDSR and the other parties. Ion Iliescu also said that he believes that before talking about a government coalition, it is necessary to achieve a platform through agreement.
