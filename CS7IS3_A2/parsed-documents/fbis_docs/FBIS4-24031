What specifically can you do if some governments are not representing the interests of all their ethnic groups? [Salim] The African states are largely the product of the arbitrary drawing of borders by the colonial powers. Nevertheless, we have decided to retain the territorial integrity of our states. Regarding the representative nature of the governments, there are a few peculiarities. There has been democratization, which is certainly worth being recognized -- in Benin, Zambia, the Congo, to name just a few. In Africa, democratization means two things: first, that power emanates from the people, and second, that we have good, reliable governments. I do not know which system is most suitable for that. Regarding the problem of tribalism, it has turned out that Europe is not free from it either -- the term "ethnic cleansing" was invented in Europe. I say this without polemics. It is little consolidation if one looks at poverty, misery, and violence as they are now in Rwanda -- conditions that shock and sicken me -- and then says: You in Europe are not perfect either. But no one in the world can claim a monopoly on everything good and pleasant. As an international community, we must learn to learn from each other -- from the tragedies in Bosnia just as from the tragedies in Africa. In particular, we must also solve the ethnic and religious conflicts, because otherwise they develop such an explosive power that they become nightmares for our society. [Bloch] You have repeatedly stressed how important economic cooperation among the African states is -- the creation of a united economic area. How is this supposed to work among countries that are all struggling for survival, since even the attempt at cooperation among highly developed industrial states in Europe is difficult? [Salim] Quite right, but I would look at it precisely the other way round: If the need for cooperation among the prosperous former colonial powers is undisputed, how much more urgent is this need than for Africa! Precisely because of the brittleness of our society and the widespread power, we must cooperate all the more closely and effectively. In April, the 35th member country ratified the agreement on an African economic community. It is part of our postcolonial syndrome of dependence that we talk much about economic cooperation but have done little for it. We have always looked toward the north. We need experts -- we look toward the north; we want to buy things -- we look toward the north. Even today it is sometimes easier to fly from one African country to another via Europe. Or one makes telephone calls via Europe -- all these are things that must change. [Bloch] How? [Salim] The African countries must finally be able to improve their foreign trade balance. We have always been told: You must simply work harder and produce more. But today everyone knows that this does not work. The Africans -- in particular in the rural areas -- can work two, three, or four times harder and would still get less for it than 10 years ago. The unjust imbalance of the international market must make the West think. No one denies that Africa has enormous resources -- minerals, raw materials, the gigantic hydroelectric volume of our waters. People always talk about Africa as the continent of the future. I am more interested in Africa as the continent of the present. The point is to use our resources in a sensible way. [Bloch] In the German media, Africa is never portrayed as the continent of the future, not even as the continent of the present.... [Salim, interrupting] ...Because there is an English proverb: "You give a dog a bad name and you hang it." As long as Africa is portrayed only as a confused, miserable, vegetating continent, whose rulers are entangled in bloody wars with each other and cut each other's throats after military coups, naturally no one will care for our concerns. However, if one explained the efforts of the normal Africans for economic improvements and political reforms to the Germans, they would be more understanding. [Bloch] What are you relations like with those ruling in Europe? Do you not often appear as a suppliant? [Salim] When I go to Europe or the United States or to the Gulf states, I never turn up holding out my hand in supplication. Rather, I am making propaganda for actively understanding our problems. The best support develops if the people understand what is going on on our continent beyond all cliches. [Bloch] And does such understanding exist? [Salim] There is a lot of double standard and hypocrisy. Today some people talk about "Afro-pessimism" and reproach Africa for precisely those things for which they are partly to blame themselves and which they have partly brought about. Some people speak of corrupt, dictatorial regimes -- governments with which they have cooperated for decades and with whose help they are acquiring advantages. In addition, the Europeans must understand that Africa can never be understood as a homogeneous mass. This would be as if one were to declare Bosnia a typically European phenomenon.
