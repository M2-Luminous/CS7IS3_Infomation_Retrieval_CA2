But a lack of salary controls in state-owned enterprises is cause for concern for Rodlauer. According to him, this creates a danger of a price rise. An IMF mission is coming to Poland tonight on a two-week visit. It will be headed by Michael Deppler, a deputy director at IMF's European Department. The IMF representatives will be conducting talks at the individual ministries. The goal of the talks is to become familiar with the current economic situation in Poland and also with the government's economic principles for the future. This is to lead to the signing of another agreement between Poland and the IMF. There is a chance that this might take place as early as August. Such a view is expressed among others by Marcus Rodlauer, IMF's representative to Poland. One of the items on the agenda for the IMF mission will be to become familiar in detail with the economic program that was recently presented by Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and finance minister. According to Marcus Rodlauer, the assumptions made in the program -- that is a rise in the GDP by 22 percent by 1997, and also a single-digit inflation figure in the same year -- look quite realistic. While assessing Poland's current economic situation, Rodlauer told ZYCIE WARSZAWY that Poland is one of the few European countries with this kind of economic growth rate. "That is why one must assess the government's economic policies positively," Rodlauer added. But there are still a number of problems that the government will have to overcome, like the high inflation rate, agricultural issues, or state-owned enterprises. Salary policies are one of the most important issues to be discussed by the IMF mission. Over the recent months, salaries in state-owned enterprises were rising fast. Therefore, the IMF experts will try to find out how the government intends to control salaries over the next few months and over the long term. According to Rodlauer, ignoring the problem may cause danger to the economy. A high, uncontrolled rise in salaries, may bring about a lower rate of economic growth, and may also become the reason for a price jump. Rodlauer has high praise of NBP's monetary policies. In his view, the policies were consistent and cautious over the last few months while the reduction in the denomination of the zloty [elimination of the four last zeros] which is being planned for the beginning of next year, should contribute to an increased trust put in the currency.
