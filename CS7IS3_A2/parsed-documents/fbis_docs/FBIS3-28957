The schedule lays down concrete ways to open Korean markets in such areas as farm products, industrial goods and services. The final schedule will be sent to the Secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) soon after being passed by the cabinet, rendering useless Korean farmers organizations' demand to re-open the Uruguay Round negotiations. Member countries will submit their schedules to GATT by the end of March, with the final agreement on the UR talks to be signed in Morocco on April 12-15. The legislatures of GATT member countries must then ratify the agreement, which is to take effect on Jan. 1 or on July 1 of next year. The schedule calls for industrial products' and fishery goods' range of tariff concessions to be expanded to 90 percent in number of items and to 87.5 percent in import amounts. The average tariff concession rate will be reduced to 8.1 percent from 17.9 percent in 1996. As for the service sector, 78 items will fall under tariff concessions: In the previous schedule, which was submitted in October last year, such items numbered 80. Also in the schedule, the Computerized Reservation System (CRS) and a future financial liberalization plan are offered as items subject to exemption of most favored nation (MFN) status.
