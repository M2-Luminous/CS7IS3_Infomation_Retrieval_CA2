Will this be enough? [Lafontaine] No. The government's monetary policy is careless and unjust. Public debts are exploding and the costs are just passed on to the little people. [Kleine] What do you suggest? [Lafontaine] The worrying increase in public debts has to be stopped. This is a precondition for overcoming mass unemployment. [Kleine] More specific? [Lafontaine] For the Social Democratic Party of Germany, investment and jobs are a priority. The budget cannot be restored without taking unpopular decisions. It is necessary to cut superfluous tax subsidies, as well as personnel costs and defense expenditures. It is also necessary to fight industrial crime, subsidy fraud, and illegal work and take firm measures against the misuse of social benefits. [Kleine] No further tax increases? [Lafontaine] For people earning average incomes, the breaking point has long been reached. This is why we want to lower taxes on wages and salaries so that the tax burden on low and medium incomes gets back to tolerable proportions. In order to strengthen companies' investment capacity and to lower the unjust gap, higher taxes on high private incomes and property are, however, an absolute must. Yet, the tax burden on industry must not get any higher. This is a concept that is also accepted by industry.
