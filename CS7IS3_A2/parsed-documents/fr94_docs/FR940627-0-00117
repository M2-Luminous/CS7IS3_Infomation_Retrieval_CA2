FR940627-0-00117 FR940627-0-00019 As discussed in the NPRM and in the Reopening Notice, EPA interprets CAA section 211(b) in conjunction with CAA section 211(c), which gives EPA authority to control or prohibit the manufacture, introduction into commerce, offering for sale, or sale of any fuel or fuel additive if the Administrator finds that the emission products of such fuel or fuel additive ``cause[s], or contribute[s], to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare.'' In light of this responsibility, EPA believes that it should exercise particular caution in registering new F/FA products and that it should have the necessary information to evaluate fully the potential public health consequences of such new F/FAs prior to allowing their introduction into the market. Thus, before granting registration to manufacturers of new F/FAs, under the authority of CAA section 211(b), this final rule requires that they comply with all testing requirements. Figure 2 summarizes the decision process for determining whether an unregistered F/FA product (i.e., a F/FA product not registered as of the effective date of this rule) is ``registrable'' and thus handled much like a currently registered F/FA product, or whether an unregistered F/FA product is ``new'' and must complete all testing requirements before registration is granted.
