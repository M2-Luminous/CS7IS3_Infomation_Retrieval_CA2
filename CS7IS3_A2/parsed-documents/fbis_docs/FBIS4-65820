It did confirm that Spain was supporting the training of the Angolan Government police. Vasco Lourinho reports from Madrid. [Lourinho] New scandals are being uncovered as investigations proceed into the Luis Roldan affair. The former head of the Civil Guard was a discreet intermediate in the sale of Spanish weapons to Angola worth 40 billion escudos. The operation was carried out with the knowledge of Foreign Minister Xavier Solana, who less than a year ago was still trying to deny what was a reality. [Begin recording] [Solana in Spanish with superimposed Portuguese translation] As you know, we have a commitment to Angola. We are contributing to the UN initiatives -- that is our role and no more. [Unidentified correspondent] And the weapons? [Solana] We did not sell weapons. We have a commitment with the police that we are fulfilling. [end recording] [Lourinho] The deal was made by the Spanish public company (DEFEX), which with the help of Luis Roldan, disguised the weapons as antiriot equipment.
