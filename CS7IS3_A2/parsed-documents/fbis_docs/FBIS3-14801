On Saturday in his interview with Interfax he expressed opinion that people "who are in Matrosskaya Tishina and Lefortovo will start an active political struggle against the president, government, and existing regime immediately after their liberation." Lysenko qualified the resolution on amnesty, which, as he said, was initiated by the leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord Sergey Shakhray, as "a destabilizing factor." At the same time he pointed out that if "an extremist wave is not very high after the liberation of the October events participants then Shakhray will bypass his major political rivals of democratic orientation, Yegor Gaydar and Grigory Yavlinskiy." "If the situation sharpens then the consequences will be very serious both for Shakhray and for the Party of Russian Unity and Concord headed by him. In this case the president will dismiss the initiator of this document," he said. Lysenko did not rule out possibility of "preliminary contacts" between the State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin and Boris Yeltsin on the issue on amnesty. At the same time he declared that "Shakhray was the first in this issue." "I am almost sure that first of all Shakhray has coordinated this issue with Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin," said Lysenko.
