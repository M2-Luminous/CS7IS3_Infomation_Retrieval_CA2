He became notorious recently with his "discovery" of Wallachian and Pomak ethnic minorities in our country and his claims of 7,000 Macedonians allegedly living in Bulgaria. Mr. Ivanov is a nuclear physicist by profession. [Vaseva] Mr. Ivanov, ethnic tensions have been recently fanned in our country, while our public is sensitively reacting to alien interferences in our domestic affairs. Do you believe that the state institutions are defending our national interests with the ncesssary firm resolve? [Ivanov] I share de Gaulle's concept that the egocentrism of the nation should be the prevailing characteristic feature of a country's behavior. In this respect we should pursue our egocentric, Bulgarian interests. However, I would like to point out, in this connection, that I ardently support the concept of a "nation" in the political sense, namely as it was introduced by the French philosophers in the 18th century. According to this concept, a nation is a community of people rallied by the idea of a common state. Once the state as such has been established, the idea is to preserve and develop it as an entity. In this respect, Bulgaria is a single-national state, where ethnic, religious, and linguistic varieties exist. Hence, the Bulgarian national idea should be to join all efforts for the sake of Bulgaria's prosperity, while preserving the aforementioned variety. You are asking whether we are sufficiently defending our interests? We should never be satisfied with our achievements, but I am convinced that decisive steps forward have been accomplished in connection with the protection of Bulgarian interests. Reasons for justified criticism exist, but many things have improved. [Vaseva] Do cases of human rights' violations against Turks or Bulgarian Muslims exist, according to you? [Ivanov] Certain conditions are required for implementing a right. Let us take the question of the mother tongue, for example. The Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS] insists on introducing the Turkish language as obligatory and claims that human rights have been violated in this connection. I do not agree. I think that one cannot force the children of people who have declared themselves as Turks to learn the Turkish language. The international convention against discrimination in the educational sphere stipulates that such studies should be voluntary. However, in this respect, we should ask the question -- have the necessary conditions for an effective language training been provided for? No, they have not been provided for. The number of teachers is insufficient and their level of qualification is not adequate.... Perhaps, the training programs should be revised and more organically integrated with the educational process as a whole. This is the stand of the National Education Ministry, which I subscribe to. [Vaseva] Are you convinced that the Bulgarian state is capable of effectively opposing the Turkification process in the Rhodope area? [Ivanov] Only two of your young colleagues have noticed that I am discerning between forced Turkification and Turkish self-identity, but no one really understood it. I have never questioned the Bulgarian origins of the Muslims in the Western Rhodope area and have never denied that their mother tongue is Bulgarian. I am simply defending the right of ethnic self-identification. It is true that some of those compatriots have identified themselves as Turks. However, this is the result of very complicated causes, which should be carefully analyzed. [Vaseva] Nevertheless, you do not deny that the Bulgarian Muslims are subject to forced Turkification? [Ivanov] We are touching upon an ambiguity in this case, namely, we must distinguish between coercion and influence, and establish whose influence we are talking about? The Muslims of the Western Rhodope area did not identify themselves as Turks either on 18 November or on 10 December 1989, and they did not do so during their protest vigil on the eve of 29 December 1989. On that occasion they demanded the restoration of their names, by administrative, rather than by law court procedure. The law court procedure was adopted as a result of a deal with the participation of Petur Mladenov, Andrey Lukanov, and Stanko Todorov, on one side, and Dimitur Arnaudov, Branko Davidov, and Ahmed Dogan, on the other side. It happened on the eve of passing the Names Act, on 5 March 1990, and it greatly contributed to the ethnic mobilization of the Muslims in the Western Rhodope area in the direction of their ethnic Turkish self-identification. The anti-Turkish demonstration organized by the All-National Committee for the Defense of National Interests [OKZNI] in January 1990 also exerted a highly negative effect. I remember that numerous women from the Rhodope area called on me to complain, at that time, and I remember their tears. The subsequent, violent opposition to the introduction of the Turkish language as the mother tongue also played a decisive role. The DPS organized a school boycott in which the Muslims from the Western Rhodope area were also involved, while the DPS leaders assumed the political responsibility for the boycott. If you add the fact that the economic situation in the area has become disastrous, under the circumstances, and if you realize that the souls of those people have been troubled for so many decades, you should understand that they are looking for some spiritual values to rely upon. Considering the habit of frequently referring to "them, the Pomaks" as being different from "us, the Bulgarians," it is easy to perceive the tragedy of people in that region. [Vaseva] Why should we not declare at the highest level that the "Rhodope area is Bulgarian," which would put an end to all attempts and speculations? [Ivanov] Actually, President Zhelev said so in his address to the nation following the 13 October 1991 elections. [Vaseva] Nevertheless, Mr. Dogan dared to declare that even the president cannot prevent him from conquering the Rhodope area and proclaimed this region as a zone of influence belonging to the DPS! [Ivanov] I am actually highly disturbed by the last DPS conference. The manner in which it was conducted, Ahmed Dogan's address, and the statute that was adopted could be cited in a text book as typical examples of authoritarian behavior. I think that when formal conditions are created for a political party to entirely identify itself with its leader and when this party identifies itself as speaking on behalf of a large, compact group, this is not in the interests of Bulgarian democracy. [Vaseva] Why did Professor Nikolay Genchev call you "an evil personality" and a "traitor of national interests"? [Ivanov] You should better ask Prof. Genchev himself. I would not like to start a polemic with him on such level. We have serious differences of principle and I am ready to discuss them with him in a public debate. I will tell you, to begin with, that I recently attended a seminar, near Burgas, where Prof. Genchev was also present and at which he expressed his views on the solution of ethnic relations in our country. According to him, the Bulgarian Turks should be encouraged to immigrate to Turkey, or be dispersed throughout the country, while Bessarabian Bulgarians should be resettled in the abandoned areas. I am convinced that, in talking about Bulgarian national interests, ideas such as those expressed by Prof. Genchev do not make any sense. [Vaseva] You are a nuclear physicist by profession. Do you regard yourself as sufficiently competent to advise the president on ethnic problems? [Ivanov] I am a specialist in the field of theoretical and mathematical physics. My original profession has taught me to think, above all. The rest is a question of knowledge that can be acquired by reading. The problems we are talking about require an interdisciplinary approach. Let the historians not be jealous. They are not the only ones entitled to determine how to solve ethnic problems. I highly appreciate the contribution of economists, sociologists, lawyers, political scientists, ethnologists, and so forth. I am trying to coordinate the efforts of all specialists and to learn from them. Nevertheless, I have the feeling of being sufficiently competent for my job.
