FR940902-0-00071 FR940902-0-00010 A commenter raised a concern regarding the time limit for negotiation between the Governor and the State education agency when negotiating the joint agreement in accordance with the provisions found at §628.315(b) of the interim final regulations. While there is no specific time limit, the Department expects that the agreement would be in place in time to allow for the expenditure of funds allotted for the designated program period. No change is made to the final rule. A few commenters questioned whether the State JTPA entity or the State education agency was responsible for the development of the plan for the use of funds. The Department believes that the State education agency has the primary role in development of the plan, but that the plan is to be developed jointly or in consultation. In practice, most arrangements for development of the plan which are satisfactory to the parties will be accepted by the Department, so long as there is joint agreement. Several commenters raised concerns about the provision of the interim final rule that stipulates that when the Governor and the State education agency fail to agree to develop a joint plan for use of the Education Coordination and Grants funds ``the Governor shall not allocate funds under section 123(a)(1) to such education agency, nor shall such funds be available for expenditure by the Governor''. The purpose of the rule is to indicate that neither party should benefit from a failure to agree on the use of education coordination funds. The Department believes that this position is consistent with the provisions of the Act that call for joint agreement between the Governor and the State education agency and, therefore, no change is made to this section of the regulations. The Department wishes to clarify that this agreement between the Governor and the State education agency is not the same as specified in section 123(e) between the State education agency and the SDA. A commenter requested that the barriers discussed in §628.315(d) be defined. The barriers discussed in this section are the same barriers that are specified under title II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C of the Act or any additional barriers the Governor may specify. No changes are made to this section. A commenter pointed out that §628.315(d)(1)(i) of the interim final rule did not contain a citation to the provision of title II&hyph;C authorizing funds for section 123 programs. The Department agrees and the final rule contains that citation. Some commenters inquired whether youth who are in compensatory education programs under chapter I of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, who are found to meet the eligibility requirements for free lunch under the National School Lunch Act, or who are in school-wide projects would fall within the meaning of economically disadvantaged to satisfy the requirement to serve the disadvantaged. The Department believes that they do, and has drafted the regulations to reflect the applicability of the eligibility criteria from one section or part of the Act to other parts wherever practicable. So, for example, the final rule is revised, in §628.315(d)(1)(ii), to indicate that the criteria discussed above apply to the education coordination grant program. A few commenters questioned whether §628.315(d)(1)(iii) should refer directly to the non-economically disadvantaged. Additionally, the commenters expressed concern that priority for these funds should be given to in-school projects as opposed to Title III eligible participants. The interim final rule referenced non-economically disadvantaged. The final rule is revised to reflect the statutory language, although the meaning is not changed. No change is made to the regulations regarding the priority for Title III eligible participants since that priority is statutory. Several commenters thought that the regulations should allow for direct allocation of State education coordination and grants funds to the SDA. No change is made in the regulations since the Act is specific as it relates to the Governor allocating funds to the State education agency and the State education agency being the entity that determines how and where the funds will be distributed. Several commenters were concerned with the State matching requirements which changed the requirement from an 80 percent to a 100 percent match for Federal funds received for the State education coordination grants. These comments do not appear to have recognized the change in statutory language wrought by the amendments. Prior to the amendments, section 123(c) of the Act required only that matching funds be provided for three of the four kinds of projects specified in section 123(a). The amended law, in section 123(a)(3), requires matching funds for all the kinds of projects specified. Thus, while the matching requirement originally applied only to the kinds of projects to which 80 percent of the funds available under section 123 were allotted, the law has been changed so that all funds are required to be matched. Similarly, the language in section 123 describing the ``20%'' projects has been changed. The original language was that Federal funds could be used to pay the cost of ``20%'' projects based on JTPA section 123(c)(2)(A). The new language is that Federal funds may be used to pay the Federal share of ``20%'' projects based on JTPA section 123(d)(2)(A). The final rule is revised to clarify that the matching requirement for the State is for an amount equal to the total of section 123 funds. Further, the rule clarifies that if there is no agreement between the State education agency and the administrative entity in the SDA, the matching requirement does not apply.
