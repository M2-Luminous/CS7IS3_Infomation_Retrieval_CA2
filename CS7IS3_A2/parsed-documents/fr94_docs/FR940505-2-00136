Compliance tests performed for NHTSA indicate that Frenchy's model ``B&hyph;13'' helmets do not meet the impact attenuation, penetration, and retention system requirements of FMVSS No. 218 and therefore would not provide adequate protection to users in the event of a crash. In addition, the ``B&hyph;13'' helmets fail to comply with the labelling requirements of the Standard. A public proceeding will be held at 10 a.m., on June 1, 1994 in room 2230, Department of Transportation Building, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, at which time the manufacturer will be afforded an opportunity to present data, views, and arguments to establish that the helmets covered by this initial determination comply with FMVSS No. 218. Interested persons are invited to participate through written or oral presentations. Persons wishing to make oral presentations are requested to notify Ms. Elaine Beale, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, room 6111, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, 202&hyph;366&hyph;2832, before the close of business on May 25, 1994. Written comments must be submitted to the same address on or before May 27, 1994. The agency's investigative file in this matter is available for public inspection during working hours (9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.) in its Technical Reference Library, room 5108, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.
