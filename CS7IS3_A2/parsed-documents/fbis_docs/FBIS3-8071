What is especially confusing is the Russian initiative that actually boils down to protecting the Serbs in the Balkans, thus securing an indispensable role for Moscow in solving Balkan conflicts. It seems that fate would have it that the Russians on one side, and the United States and Great Britain on the other meet exactly 49 years after the Yalta Conference, where former Yugoslavia was divided into two interest spheres precisely on the slopes of Trebevic above Sarajevo. Yalta was betrayed only in that the demarcation line was moved from the Drina River to the Miljacka River, hoping that this is only temporary. The appearance and role of Russian soldiers around Sarajevo could confuse and shock only those who are not well acquainted with Russia and its inner regularities and do not know what is now happening in this country. Every realistic and proper analysis would, however, show that events around Sarajevo, as the key military and political point of Serbian aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the presence of Russia in these parts are evolving according to all rules of logic. The Russian initiative could have come as a surprise, first of all, to those who think that the Russian factor became extremely weak and negligible in December, 1991, when Boris Yeltsin disbanded the omnipotent Communist Party of the Soviet Union with two presidential decrees, eliminated communists from power, and then disbanded the great "socialist empire" -- the Soviet Union. The former Soviet Federation had 15 federal republics, spread over 22.4 million square kilometers, had 290 million inhabitants, a mighty army, and ruled over a good part of Europe. According to all formal indicators, it was a superpower that both the United States and China feared. However, it is fortunate for such a superpower that its strength in the past 50 years was tested in peace, and it was lucky not to have engaged in military conflicts against the West. If it had been put on the battlefield against the West, it would have become obvious that it was a colossus with feet of clay; with a great potential, it is true, but with an enormous question mark as to its use. This evaluation is first of all based on the character of former authorities in the Soviet Union, which most of the inhabitants were not satisfied with, as well as on the very structure of the Soviet Federation. The fact that, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, not a single former federal republic wanted to stay in the same country with Russia, best portrays the strength of the entire Soviet Federation. And that could be explained: None of the former Soviet federal republics joined the federation in a democratic manner, of its own will. They all became its members mostly in times of war and under presence from Russian tanks. If such a Soviet Union had fought a war with a more serious opponent, most of its republics would have turned their backs on Russia. How accessible was the tissue of the former Soviet military, regardless of all the stomic might, a German sports pilot Mathias Rust showed in the most convincing manner when, on 28 May, 1987, he landed at Moscow's Red Square without any problems whatsoever. During World War II, the Germans made daily advances of up to 45 kilometers on Soviet territory. Perhaps they would advance even faster in 1991. Regardless of the fact that Russia left the Soviet Union waving the white flag -- almost ravaged materially, ideologically, politically, and morally speaking -- it is still more powerful than the former Soviet Union, and definitely more dangerous. It is indeed a very complex and heterogeneous state structure, according to the national composition of its inhabitants, but it is far more homogenous and "coordinated" than the former Soviet Union, and that is its true strength. It is more dangerous because empty spaces on its political scene, vacated when the communist were overthrown, are now mostly filled by social national demagogues, who promise people they will return both Vodka and the glory and homogenize them around that idea. Such a Russia not only does not want to give up any strategic point of its interests and influence, but wants to strengthen them. And Trebevic and the "orthodox brothers in the Balkans" are primary Russian interests, and their presence in these parts and their role should be viewed in this light. In former Russian views regarding the conflict in Bosnia- Herzegovina and ways to solve it, there were significant differences. There are no more such differences: The Russian parliament, with all its factions, without exceptions, the Russian public, President Yeltsin, its government, they all point out that there is no solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina without Russia and that they are against using force against Serb positions. The world is, therefore, facing Russia again; last time it was faced with communism as an ideology and now with Zhirinovskiy.
