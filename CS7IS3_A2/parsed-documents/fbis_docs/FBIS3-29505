The central bank's monthly economic review adds the words "on the whole" to its assessment of weak personal consumption, indicating a few areas with "nuances" of improvement, while it deletes mention of strong public investment, a BOJ official said. The bank stuck to its judgment that "Japan's economic growth remains weak and no clear indication of imminent recovery has been identified." With overall consumption weak, final demand still lackluster and corporate capital investment still falling, "there has been virtually no growth in industrial production and shipments, and inventory adjustments have stalled," the report said. Labor conditions also continue to worsen gradually, it said. Private housing investment remains strong, but growth has slowed in public investment, another recent bright spot, especially compared to robust year-earlier growth, it said. Some public works projects have been delayed as local governments change bidding practices in the wake of construction scandals. But the official declined to tie the slower public investment growth to the scandals. Among personal consumption categories, "sales of washing machines and personal computers are picking up, and revenues at major travel agencies in December increased above last year's level," the report said. The partial improvements may have been affected by stock adjustments of household durable goods, higher housing investment and new products matching consumers' downscale desires, it said. But overall, "personal consumption remains weak against the backdrop of slower employment growth and limited income growth," with such factors as cuts in bonus and overtime pay, the report said. Personal consumption cannot be judged to be recovering without stronger income growth, the BOJ official said. Manufacturing capital investment continued to decline, despite rises to boost capacity in such areas as semiconductors and liquid crystals, the report said, citing excess capital stock, lower use of capacity, low profits and increased shifts of production overseas. The report noted that Japan's trade and current-account surpluses have declined, with exports falling in real terms, partly reflecting last year's soaring yen, which moved in a 111-113 yen range in January. Its recent surge to six-month peaks came "as the market reacted to comments attributed to U.S. officials." The yen closed Friday in Tokyo at 104.57 yen.
