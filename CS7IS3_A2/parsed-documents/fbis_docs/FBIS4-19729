France wishes to maintain its autonomy of intervention wherever its interests are at stake. At the same time, it wishes to be the driving force in the building of a European defense. Edouard Balladur and [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard are determined to carry through this programming law without waiting for [the presidential election in] 1995. Some people in the RPR [Rally for the Republic] and UDF [French Democratic Union] had suggested postponing the exercise until after the presidential election. The prime minister did not follow this expedient advice. Precisely because of the importance which he personally attaches to defense and security questions, it is he who decided on an increase of 0.5 percent, contrary to the aims of the law on controlling public spending. The method adopted consisted of giving preference to what is reasonable over what is spectacular and adopting an attitude of great caution. It is in 1997 that we will see whether it is financially possible to launch several new programs like the future large transport plane, the second nuclear aircraft carrier, the NH-90 helicopter, the future sea-to-sea missile. Between now and then, efforts will be made to successfully complete the major programs already started: the new generation of missile-launching nuclear submarines (Triomphant and Temeraire, due to come into service in 1996 and 1998); the Leclerc tank (310 will be supplied in the year 2000); the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle; and the Navy's Rafale plane (operational in 1999); the Tigre helicopter (first deliveries in the year 2001); the Air Force Rafale from the year 2001-2002 (with a delay of one year mainly due to technological problems). The only major program which will be launched as soon as the law comes into force is the development of the ATPGD (Precision Weapon Fired over a Long Distance) missile. What is it? Although the concept has virtually been defined, the program has not yet been finally decided. It will be a cruise missile of the Tomahawk type, in other words subsonic like the Apache, or supersonic like the medium-range air-to-surface missile, capable of covering between 500 and 1,000 km and reaching its target with an accuracy of approximately 1 meter. Its warhead would be exclusively conventional. The austerity requirement called for a further reduction in the nuclear deterrence effort. Nuclear funds, which, less than 10 years ago, formed almost one-third of the Armed Forces' equipment budget, have already fallen below 25 percent and will fall further until they only account for one-fifth of Section V. In six years, 134 billion francs [Fr] will nonetheless be devoted to it, of which Fr10 billion will be just for the Palen simulation program intended to reduce the number of nuclear tests. These tests are not mentioned much in the bill. Everybody knows that the subject is taboo until the presidential election in May 1995, although all the necessary steps have been taken to resume them without delay. With regard to manning levels, the draft programming law continues the reduction started over recent years, but with much less brutality. Leotard is not Joxe. The general staffs have been consulted, and fairly broadly heeded. In all, 42,100 jobs will be eliminated in six years, of which 25,700 will be conscripts, 12,800 civilians, and 3,600 regular soldiers. However, 11,700 new jobs will be created which results in a figure of 30,400 job losses. The Army will lose 16,872 jobs; although it is to gain 5,801 in regular soldiers, it is to lose 19,185 conscripts and 3,500 civilians. In the year 2000, it will have 227,000 men (the Joxe plan made provision for 225,000 in 1997). It will keep eight out of the nine divisions it has now and the 13 it still had in 1990. The Navy will lose 2,461 jobs: 2,161 conscripts and 500 civilians. It will gain 200 regular posts. In the year 2000, it will have 68,441 men (compared with 70,902 today). The Air Force will lose 6,098 jobs: 1,628 will be regular Air Force personnel; 4,100 conscripts; and 370 civilians. In the year 2000, it will have fallen from 94,869 to 88,771 men. The gendarmerie is the only branch of the Armed Forces to see its manning levels increase. It is to gain 750 men in its regular force, 1,000 conscripts, and 226 civilians. And it will thus become the second largest branch of the Armed Forces with 95,000 men (as against 93,024 in 1994). The 11,700 jobs created will relate to intelligence (500 civilians), professionalization (8,200 of which 7,000 will be engaged by the Army), the gendarmerie (almost 2,000 posts created), officers (382 naval officers, 123 petty officers, and 500 armaments engineers). This bill must now be submitted to parliament. The deputies will debate it on 24 May and the senators in June. It is not customary for it to generate amendments. However, Edouard Balladur and Francois Leotard are prepared for a broad debate, even outside parliament. They are fairly calm. They think it likely that criticisms will be expressed in the ranks of the majority. Some will think that too much is being spent on defense. Others will say that they would have liked a more generous law making it possible to launch new programs (for instance in the antimissile sphere) and at the same time to satisfy all the industrial sectors of defense and to maintain their 330,000 jobs. But, when it comes to the vote, there should be broad agreement.
