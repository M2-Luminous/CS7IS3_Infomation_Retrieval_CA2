Armed bandits of the puppet army Friday deployed recoilless guns in the DMZ in the central sector of the front and took a firing posture toward a post of the North on the opposite side, seriously threatening the safety of people's army soldiers. Some 300 puppet army soldiers entered the DMZ and created a terrible war atmosphere Friday and Saturday. In the period from June 11 to 18, the South Korean puppets illegally brought a total of 4,700 armed bandits and 1,300 vehicles intothe DMZ for war exercises, search and building of military setups including positions. The reckless military provocations of the South Korean puppets in the DMZ are a deliberate and premeditated move to artificially aggravate the situation in this region and ncite North-South confrontation. The South Korean puppets must refrain from rash acts, clearly mindful of the grave consequences of the aggravation of the situation on the Korean peninsula.
