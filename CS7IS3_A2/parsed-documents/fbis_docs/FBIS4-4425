Regarding a court decision on a lawsuit against Kadena Air Base [KAB] noise pollution, Prefectural Governor's Office Chief Choko Takayama said: "There should be no difference in treatment between Okinawa and mainland Japan when dealing with base issues." Then, he indicated that after conducting a comparative study on noise pollution at Yokota Air Base (in Tokyo) and KAB, "requests will be made to the Japan-U.S. joint committee, the central government, and the United States" to restrict night flights. At this meeting, Yoshihide Isa (of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]) pointed out that an agreement was reached by a Japan-U.S. joint committee to restrict night flights at the Yokota and the Atugi bases (in Kanagawa prefecture). He asked how the prefectural government will deal with the issue, saying: "It is not acceptable that only Okinawan people have to suffer from discriminatory treatment." In response, Takayama mentioned the fact that the court did not acknowledge certain damages caused by noise pollution and said: "We plan to fully examine the court's decision and compare results with the decision on the Yokota suit." Moreover, Hironori Teruya (of the Social Democratic Party of Japan) said: "The problem is the fact that regarding the noise pollution created by the U.S. military bases on Okinawa, we are at the mercy of the U.S. military's self-imposed regulations. The prefectural government should take a firm stance and demand a ban on night flights." Takayama replied: "After the comparative study, we will ask the Japan-U.S. joint committee, the central government, and the United States [to impose a ban on night flights]." In this way, he hinted at the possibility of taking further steps to deal with the issue. Regarding the emergency landing of a Cessna airplane which belongs to the KAB aeroclub, at Blue Beach in Kin-cho on 26 March, Takayama expressed his regret and said: "It is a violation of the Japan-U.S. Status-of-Forces Agreement (SOFA) to allow civilians aboard their planes. We will deal with the issue after thorough investigations."
