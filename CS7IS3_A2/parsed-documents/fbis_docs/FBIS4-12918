[Nazzal] The 'Afula operation, carried out by the al-Qassam Battalions--the military wing of the Hamas Movement--was the first reply to the Hebron massacre. It will be followed by three more operations similar to the 'Afula operation in influence and power. [Talab] Some Palestinian voices criticized the operation. They said the 'Afula operation, which targeted civilians, depicted matters as a racist conflict between Arabs and Israelis although the conflict is one of liberation and all forms of armed struggle should target the occupation army only. What is your comment? [Nazzal] Forty days after the Hebron massacre, the Palestinian people realized that the international community will not take revenge for them. All that the Security Council did was to issue a inconsequential statement. Consequently, the Palestinian people in all their factions and classes were happy for this operation and considered it a restoration of honor and dignity. As for the Palestinians you mentioned, they are limited in number and isolated. They considered the operation an embarrassment and a pulling of the rug from under their feet. [Talab] Will the next operations be similar to the 'Afula operation? [Nazzal] The next operations are supposed to be highly qualitative to match the magnitude and ugliness of the Hebron massacre. [Talab] You have a significant political presence in Jordan and Syria and these two countries are parties to the peace process. The 'Afula operation must have moved the United States, the sponsor of the peace process, to restrain you as a Hamas Movement. Have you been exposed to any pressure from Amman or Damascus, or to any questioning after this operation? [Nazzal] The operation was received with great joy by the Arab and Islamic circles. It came within a context that is understood by the Arab and Islamic parties. It is regrettable that the PLO condemned the operation although no Arab party did so. [Talab] Does this mean you did not come under any pressure or questioning because of the operation? [Nazzal] No criticism whatsoever was leveled at us by the official Arab parties nor were there any pressures because of the 'Afula operation. [Talab] Information says the PLO complained to Jordan about Hamas' strong political role in Jordan. Was this brought to your attention in order to reconsider your role? [Nazzal] We have learned about this complaint from unofficial Jordanian sources, but nobody spoke to us about it. This, however, is indicative of the depth of the PLO leadership's impasse. Matters have gone so far in the PLO as to file complaints with the U.S. Administration to bring pressure to bear on Jordan. I believe there is a Jordanian understanding of the Hamas Movement's attitude toward the political settlement and the continuation of resistance against occupation. [Talab] After the 'Afula operation, Israel went back to say that your movement is receiving financial support from Iran and that those who planned and implemented the operation received their training under Hizballah in southern Lebanon when they were in Marj al-Zuhur. Is this true? [Nazzal] I think the Hamas Movement is able to develop its military and security capabilities without having to seek outside help. The Movement has an efficient military body that gains experience day by day. Hence, talk about Iranian or outside financial aid is not true. [Talab] Where do you get your financing from then? [Nazzal] I can say that Hamas finances itself and also receives financing from the people. So far we did not receive a single penny from any government. [Talab] There are reports that the Hamas Movement is involved in plans to get rid of Yasir 'Arafat in order to abort the peace process. How true is this? [Nazzal] Hamas does not believe in political assassination. It believes that its efforts should focus on resisting the occupation and its tools. What is being said about an inclination or plan to assassinate 'Arafat or other Palestinian figures is baseless. [Talab] But how will you deal, after a short while, with the presence of 'Arafat and the Palestinian leadership in Gaza and Jericho and later on in the rest of the West Bank? [Nazzal] Hamas' policy is not to clash with the Palestinian authority and its tools. This, in any case, does not mean stopping the resistance. Therefore, Hamas will continue its policy of resisting the occupation until it is removed. [Talab] Do you have any information that 'Arafat agreed with the Israelis to get rid of the Hamas Movement? [Nazzal] We have information about intelligence meetings between Palestinian and Israeli security bodies to coordinate on confronting Hamas and to exchange information on Hamas' leadership, cadres, and activities. [Talab] How afraid are you of these meetings, especially during the next stage when 'Arafat returns and is in control of the West Bank and Gaza? [Nazzal] There is no doubt that we view with caution cooperation between the Palestinian and occupation authorities aimed at confronting the Palestinian opposition. However, we, at the same time, believe that the Palestinian masses will side with whoever expresses their hopes and ambitions and represents their conscience. The masses will reject all those who are cooperating with the occupation and are standing in one trench with it. Hence, we are in line with the Palestinian masses in terms of continuing the resistance against the occupation. [Talab] There is information that cadres from Fatah Hawks inside the occupied territories have turned to the Hamas Movement because the Fatah leadership in Tunis stopped financing these cadres, hence limiting their military moves against Israel. How true is this? [Nazzal] There is no doubt that there is broad opposition within Fatah toward a political settlement. This opposition is increasing and includes various sectors. Hamas has links and channels of communication with those honorable and sincere sectors from Fatah, some of whom have been absorbed into Hamas ranks, especially from the military elements and cadres. Perhaps this could enrich Hamas' experience, especially since experienced Fatah cadres have joined the movement. [Talab] It seems that the expertise of the Fatah cadres who joined Hamas made itself felt in the 'Afula operation? [Nazzal] No doubt any cadres with past experience who join Hamas will provide a qualitative addition to the movement's experience and we believe that any cooperation between Hamas and the Fatah cadres will constitute a real threat to the occupation and its tools. [Talab] Do you have channels of communication with the Fatah leadership abroad as you have with Fatah at home? Have these connections created coordination between you and them? [Nazzal] Official contacts with the Fatah leadership abroad has been frozen since the Oslo agreement. We have individual contacts with certain Fatah opposition figures but these are personal contacts. [Talab] Are you considering promoting these contacts with Fatah opposition figures to have a practical effect in foiling the peace process? [Nazzal] We welcome any contacts and coordination with the Fatah opposition figures and cadres provided this coordination and cooperation is intended to confront the occupation. [Talab] But are they also prepared? [Nazzal] There are certain Fatah cadres who coordinate and cooperate with the Hamas Movement. [Talab] Is there any practical coordination on the leadership level? [Nazzal] There is none. [Talab] You opposed Mustafa al-Natshah's appointment as mayor of Hebron and demanded municipal elections. How do you support a municipal election that is not rejected by the occupation while at the same time you oppose participation in electing a Palestinian authority if these elections are not rejected by the occupation? [Nazzal] We have always supported and still support municipal elections that are not connected with any political plan because municipal elections are the means by which services can be extended to the Palestinian public, alleviating their suffering and improving their health and social conditions. Therefore, we call for municipal elections in every Palestinian town. This happened in 1976 and those elections were not connected with any political plans at a time when all the Palestinian forces were opposed to recognizing the Israeli enemy and had a stand that was similar to the current Hamas position. Therefore, we do not find it embarrassing to accept elections provided they are not linked with a political plan. [Talab] In a statement to the press, Israeli military intelligence chief Uri Sagi [name as published] said that Hamas will participate in electing a Palestinian authority under a non-Hamas platform because he believed that the pragmatic trend within Hamas in the occupied territory will exercise pressure in this direction. How do you comment on this? [Nazzal] Hamas' initial decision was not to participate in the autonomy elections. This decision was based on Hamas rejection of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and its consequences in terms of measures and results. Therefore, the talk on Hamas' participation is by way of exploration, feeling the pulse, and drawing conclusions. It is not based on genuine information. [Talab] Is this your final stand on elections? [Nazzal] I am speaking about this situation at this stage. Nobody is able to talk of the future. Everything is subject to study and reconsideration. [Talab] I understand, then, that you are not closing the door completely to the question of dealing with the elections? [Nazzal] The door is open to all possibilities. [In a box on page 14, SHIHAN publishes the following "stop press" item: "Muhammad Nazzal has told SHIHAN that the bus operation was the work of the 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam battalions in retaliation against the Hebron massacre, and that Hamas will carry out three more operations in retaliation for the grotesque massacre at Hebron's al-Ibrahimi Mosque. "Nazzal emphasized that the option of armed action against the occupation will continue until the occupation has ended. "It may be mentioned that the above interview with Muhammad Nazzal was held some days ago."]
