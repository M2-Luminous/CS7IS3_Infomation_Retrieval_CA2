The purpose of the circular is to implement the relevant instructions of the Guangzhou Military Region and the Guangdong Provincial Military District. The circular demands that all military institutions stationed in Shenzhen should check their military vehicles before the end of April; those holding certificates at or above the division level should obtain a "military vehicle registration form" from the garrison and submit the filled-out form for verification. After verification that the military vehicle's license plate number conforms with the driving license number, the garrison will issue a "military vehicle registration certificate." On discovery, individuals using military vehicles in Shenzhen without registration certificates will be given severe punishments according to the relevant regulations. Unqualified localities, units, or individuals illegally obtaining military vehicle certificates must stop using these certificates immediately, return them to the original users, or submit them to the garrison. Those who continue to use these certificates will be held responsible and will receive severe punishments according to the relevant regulations. The circular points out that counterfeiting military vehicle certificates, and selling or using false certificates are illegal. Individuals involved in these activities must confess their offenses to the Shenzhen Garrison before 30 April to receive lenient treatment. Otherwise, public security departments will hold them responsible for the criminal offenses they have committed. The circular stipulates: Military vehicles are not allowed to be used for production purposes, and buses with military license plate numbers are not allowed to be used for business purposes. Vehicles for construction and transportation use must observe the local government's relevant regulations, and are not allowed to operate in excess of their capacity or to pollute the city's environment. Military vehicles without rear mudguards, dirty vehicles, or vehicles in bad technical condition will not be issued "military registration certificates"; these vehicles are not allowed to operate. The circular demands that military vehicle drivers strictly observe traffic rules, foster good professional ethics and driving habits, follow the instructions of traffic policemen, and consciously safeguard the Army's reputation.
