Hosokawa told reporters that he is "not at all considering" a cabinet reshuffle. The premier also said the government plans to retain the post of a state minister in charge of political reform after the expected passage of the political reform bills. Sadao Yamahana, former chairman of the Social Democratic Party, currently holds the post. The YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported Thursday that Hosokawa discussed the plan to reshuffle the cabinet with Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) co-leader Ichiro Ozawa at the end of last year and is studying the timing and scale of the change. The YOMIURI said the reshuffle would be on a limited scale, though it was intended to replace Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and a few other ministers. Takemura, who advocated concessions to the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on the bills, is likely to be retained in the cabinet with a new post, the YOMIURI said. Ozawa, former LDP secretary general, takes an uncompromising stance to the LDP. Shinseito is offering cabinet posts to [Social Democratic Party of Japan] SDP [SDPJ] executives calling for tightening control on party members, sources said. Several SDP[J] House of Councillors members have expressed opposition to the bills and could vote against them or abstain. The government-proposed package that Hosokawa has vowed to push through the Diet during its current session is pending before the upper house.
