Hong Kong-based human rights lobbyist John Kamm, speaking in Beijing yesterday, said mainland officials had confirmed their intention of freeing at least three prominent dissidents before Lunar New Year. "I have received confirmation from the Public Security Bureau and another ministry that three prominent dissidents will be released in approximately 10 days," Mr Kamm said. The authorities had declined to name the detainees involved, saying only that the legal process was underway and that the families would be informed in due course. "It's possible that the Chinese are holding back on the names so that they can be announced in Paris," he said, referring to tomorrw's talks in the French capital between Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. There has been widespread speculation that Wang, a leading figure in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, might be released. However, his relatives said yesterday they had received no notification from the authorities. Wang, regarded by Beijing as a key organiser or "black hand" behind the demonstration in 1989, was sentenced to 13 years in jail in 1992. Other leading candidates to go free could include 41-year-old "black hand" Chen Ziming, also sentenced to 13 years imprisonment in 1992, and Bao Tong, the 59-year-old former right-hand man of disgraced Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. Bao was jailed for seven years in 1992 for "inciting counter- revolutionary activities" and "divulging state secrets" in the run- up to the Tiananment crackdown. According to Mr Kamm, the authorities said they had also completed a preliminary response to a list of 235 political prisoners submitted by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights John Shattuck. Of the 235 names, the authorities said they had been unable to locate 100, while confirming that 40 others had been sentenced and were currently in jail, Mr Kamm said. About 30 more had been released, while another 30 were under investigation. While Beijing has in the past chosen to release prisoners around Lunar New Year, which falls on February 10 this year, any announcement over the next week could have important repercussions for U.S. renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status. Washington has made renewal of MFN status conditional on significant progress in human rights issues, and the issue will be the focus of the Qian-Christopher talks in Paris.
