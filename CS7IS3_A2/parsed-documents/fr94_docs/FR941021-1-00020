FR941021-1-00020 FR941021-1-00005 40 CFR Part 52 [CA&hyph;71&hyph;3&hyph;6350; FRL&hyph;5094&hyph;8] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision; Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) which concern the control of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from storage of organic liquids, gasoline transfer operations, and steam drive wells. The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to: Daniel A. Meer, Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended Act), that included the Monterey Bay Area. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. 40 CFR 52.238. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that the above district's portions of the California SIP were inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance. 1 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Monterey Bay Area is classified as moderate 2 ; therefore, this area was subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. 1 Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed post&hyph;1987 ozone and carbon monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988); and the existing control technique guidelines (CTGs). 2 The Monterey Bay Area retained its designation of nonattainment and was classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). This document addresses EPA's proposed action for the following rules from the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District (MBUAPCD): Rule 417, Storage of Organic Liquids; Rule 418, Transfer of Gasoline into Stationary Storage Containers; and Rule 427, Steam Drive Crude Oil Production Wells. On June 8, 1993, the State of California was issued a finding of nonsubmittal for the above rules, thus starting an 18 month sanctions clock under section 179(a) of the CAA. In addition, section 110(c) of the Act provides that EPA promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) no later than two years after a finding under section 179(a). The rules being acted upon in this document were adopted by the MBUAPCD on August 25, 1993 and were submitted by the State of California to EPA on November 18, 1993. The mandatory sanctions clock was stopped on December 23, 1993 when EPA determined that the State had made a complete submittal pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. 3 By this document, EPA is proposing to approve these rules into the SIP. Final approval of these rule revisions will incorporate the regulations into the federally approved SIP and stop the FIP clock. 3 EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216). Rule 417 controls VOCs associated with organic liquid storage, and Rule 418 controls VOCs during the transfer of gasoline from delivery vessels into storage containers. Rule 427 controls emissions from oil wells where production has been enhanced by steam injection. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of the District's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules. EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 1. Among those provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents, as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The CTG documents applicable to Rule 417 are entitled, ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Petroleum Liquid Storage in External Floating Roof Tanks,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;047 and ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Petroleum Liquid Storage in Fixed Roof Tanks,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;036. The CTG documents applicable to Rule 418 are ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Leaks from Gasoline Tank Trucks and Vapor Collection Systems,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;051 and ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Bulk Gasoline Plants,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;035. For some source categories, such as steam-enhanced oil production wells, EPA did not publish a CTG. In such cases, the District makes a determination of what controls are required to satisfy the RACT requirement by reviewing the operations of facilities within the affected source category. In that review, the technological and economic feasibility of the proposed controls are considered. Additionally, for both CTG and non-CTG rules, the District may rely on EPA policy documents, such as the Blue Book, to ensure that the adopted rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. MBUAPCD Rule 417, Storage of Organic Liquids, includes the following significant changes from the current SIP: 1. Gap requirements for vapor-mounted primary seals have been added. 2. Recordkeeping, definitions, and test methods have been added. MBUAPCD Rule 418, Transfer of Gasoline into Stationary Storage Containers, includes the following major changes from the SIP: 1. An exemption for agricultural tanks has been revised to be consistent with EPA policy. 2. Recordkeeping, definitions, and test methods have been added. 3. Executive Officer discretion in determining equivalence of emission controls has been deleted. MBUAPCD Rule 427, Steam Drive Crude Oil Production Wells, includes the following significant changes from the SIP: 1. Operational and repair requirements have been added. 2. Definitions, reporting, recordkeeping, and test methods have been added. 3. Executive Officer discretion in determining compliance equivalency has been deleted. EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy. Therefore, MBUAPCD Rule 417, Rule 418, and Rule 427 are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Process Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
