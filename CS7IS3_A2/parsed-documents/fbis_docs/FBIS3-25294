Mr de Klerk said the government would officially respond to the Zulu monarch's claims on Thursday [17 February]. In a joint statement by Mr de Klerk and the king after three hours of talks in Durban on Monday, the state president said "the new position" of the king and the kwaZulu government could be fully accommodated within the interim constitution, and possible amendments to it. He was referring to a strongly worded memorandum by King Zwelithini on Monday in which he declared Natal/kwaZulu an independent sovereign kingdom. The joint statement after Monday's talks said the king and his traditional prime minister, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, disagreed that the interim constitution accommodated the Zulu nation. They insisted on a distinct dispensation for the Zulu kingdom, the statement said. Mr de Klerk undertook to examine the king's demands and respond fully on Thursday. Clear differences between the respective delegations over the Zulu monarch's demands were visible at their post meeting media conference in the Durban City Hall. King Zwelithini also dismissed a question that he was seceding, saying he was claiming what rightfully belonged to the Zulu nation. "I am asking for something that belongs to me and my people -- no one else," the king said. Asked whether he should not be discussing the future of the Zulu kingdom with the African National Congress, the king said tersely: "I am speaking to the head of state". Mr de Klerk said he did not regard the king's claims as secession, saying room could be created for "specific needs". He added that under a federal system of government the needs of South Africa's diverse population could be accommodated. Mr Buthelezi said later he disagreed with Mr de Klerk, adding that there was nothing "federalistic about this constitution". Expanding on his king's demands, Mr Buthelezi said a Zulu nation was an historical reality and "we have an identifiable territory with the [word indistinct]". Mr de Klerk maintained that negotiations were the only way to achieve an acceptable solution, saying there was a commitment from both sides "otherwise we wouldn't be here".
