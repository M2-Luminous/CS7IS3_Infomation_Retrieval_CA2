In addition, they agreed that the Afghanistan, Palestine, and Bosnian issues should also be resolved according to the wishes of the people there. The history of Pakistan and Iran's friendship is very old. In addition to Iran and Pakistan's social and religious relationship, they are good neighbors. Iran helped Pakistan in every difficult time. The people of Pakistan have not only praised their Iranian brothers, but have increased mutual relations with them. Especially after the Islamic revolution, led by religious leader Ayatollah Rohella Khomeini, Iran supported Pakistan on every critical occasion. Iran later had to fight a cold war after its revolution. The imperialist agents tried to throw obstructions in the path of Iran's revolution, and hurt Iran both politically and economically. Still, the Iranian government never hesitated to provide moral and material support to their Muslim brothers in Pakistan. Mr. Hoshemi Rafsanjani, the president of Iran, and spiritual leader Ayotallah Khamina have great love and respect for Pakistani Muslims, and have expressed it on several occasions. Madam Benazir Bhutto said on arrival in Iran that it was her second home, and that she did not consider herself a foreigner there. That is why Madam Bhutto, in both her administrations, made visits to Iran her first priority. During Madam Bhutto's recent visit to Iran, several agreements were signed between the Pakistani and Iranian governments. They also agreed to accelerate action on the agreements signed in the past. Iran has strongly condemned the Indian government over Kashmir, and has emphasized resolving this issue by providing self-government to the Muslims there. Iran expressed great concern over the atrocities being committed Muslims in India and other countries. The reaction that Iran's government expressed at the destruction of the Babri Masjid in India last year serves as a lesson to other Muslims. During the meeting between Benazir Bhutto and Ayatollah Khamina, the prayers delivered by the spiritual leader made the Pakistani people respect him and pray that the roots of the relationship between Pakistan and Iran become immortal in history.
