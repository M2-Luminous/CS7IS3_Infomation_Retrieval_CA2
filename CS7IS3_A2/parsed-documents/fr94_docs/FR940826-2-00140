FR940826-2-00140 FR940826-2-00071 In terms of their qualifications, participant Governors must have securities clearance and/or settlement expertise, background or responsibilities. To ensure that floor members are not over-represented on the Board, the Exchange has stated that management will use its best efforts to ensure that the newly created participant Governor positions will not initially or thereafter be filled by floor members. 13 13 In the event that a floor member is elected to fill a participant Governor position, the Exchange has stated that it will promptly notify the Commission. In addition, if the Exchange's best efforts do not succeed in ensuring that floor members do not fill participant Governor positions, the Exchange is committed to revisit this issue. See letter from David T. Rusoff, Attorney, Foley & Lardner, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated July 8, 1994 (``July 8 Letter''). Finally, the Exchange proposes to allow a participant Governor to be re-categorized as a member Governor, or a member Governor to be re-categorized as a participant Governor, so long as both positions are within the same class. 14 The proposed rule change will provide this increased flexibility only if the Governor being recategorized otherwise meets the qualifications for his or her new position. 14 See supra, notes 6 and 14. According to the Exchange, the President will recommend and the Board (or Executive Committee) must approve the recategorization of a Governor. The CHX has stated that, after initial implementation of the proposed rule change, the recategorization provision mainly will be used to help fill vacancies on the Board. Telephone conversation between David T. Rusoff, Attorney, Foley & Lardner, and Beth A. Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on August 17, 1994. A recategorization will not affect the qualifications for serving in a given Board position or the length of the Governor's term. According to the CHX, the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). 15 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Sections 6(b)(1), 6(b)(3) and 6(b)(5) of the Act. Section 6(b)(1) of the Act requires that an exchange be organized and have the capacity to carry out the purposes of the Act and to comply, and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members, with the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange. Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires that the rules of an exchange assure the fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and provide that one or more directors represent issuers and investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or a broker-dealer. Finally, Section 6(b)(5) of the Act requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 15 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). In the Commission's opinion, changes in the composition of the board of governors of a national securities exchange typically raise difficult regulatory issues, due to the board's special role and responsibilities in managing the business of an exchange and in ensuring that the exchange fulfills its obligations under the Act. 16 Accordingly, before the Commission can approve a proposed board reorganization, the Commission must be satisfied that all exchange constituencies, including the public, are fairly represented in its governance. 17 16 For discussion of the powers of the CHX Board, see supra, notes 4&hyph;5 and accompanying text. 17 The Commission previously has indicated that allowing a single constituency to dominate exchange governance may be inconsistent with the requirements of the Act. See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22058 (May 21, 1985), 50 FR 23090 (May 30, 1985) (File Nos. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;84&hyph;15 and SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;84&hyph;16) (disapproving proposed rule change to increase the minimum number of floor directors on the Board of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'') and approving proposed rule change to provide for election of a floor member to be the CBOE's Executive Committee Chairman) (``CBOE Order''). See also Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 31633 (December 22, 1992), 57 FR 62402 (December 30, 1992) (File Nos. SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;92&hyph;12 and SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;92&hyph;13) (approving proposed rule change to increase diversity of representation on the Exchange's Nominating Committee, Executive Committee and Audit Committee, to limit the position of Vice Chairman to floor members and to revise the duties of the Exchange's other senior officers) (``1992 Exchange Order''); and 33901 (April 12, 1994), 59 FR 18586 (April 19, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;93&hyph;28) (approving proposed rule change to provide, among other things, more flexibility in the appointment of Governors to the Executive and Finance Committees).
