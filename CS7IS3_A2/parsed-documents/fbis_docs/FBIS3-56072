In the note, the ministry apologizes for the incident of 10 January, and explains that preliminary investigation has been made into the case and the person guilty of it was dismissed from office. As the above-mentioned incident happened on the very eve of the interstate talks, Latvia considers it as an attempt by certain circles in Latvia to hamper the progress of the talks and complicate interstate relations. The note says that the Latvian Government will do everything possible to ward off such provocations in future, and stresses that in future all the issues related to the withdrawal of the Russian Army will also be tackled by way of talks.
