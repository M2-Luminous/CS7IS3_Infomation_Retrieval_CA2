[Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS 7 Nov] The nation's need for more adequate housing was documented in the 1992 National Population and Housing Census which revealed that 50 percent of heads of households did not own their own homes and that the number of homeowners has only increased 3 percent in the past 16 years. During this period, the number of houses doubled in urban areas but rose only 18 percent in rural areas, suggesting increased migration to the cities. The country's main urban centers- -La Paz, Santa Cruz, Cochabamba, Potosi, and Oruro--contain 89 percent of urban housing. According to official data there are 1,692,567 single family dwellings in the country and 8,575 collective dwelling units (hospitals, jails, barracks, hotels, convents, etc.). Other figures reveal that 41 percent of Bolivian single family dwellings are overcrowded with rooms shared by three or more people. The situation is exacerbated in urban areas especially in the eastern departments of Beni, Santa Cruz, and Pando. Besides overcrowding, 46 percent of Bolivian households lack access to potable water, 57 percent do not have basic sanitary services, and 45 percent do not have electricity. Most of the households that lack access to potable water are in Pando, Beni, Potosi, and Chuquisaca Departments. [La Paz PRESENCIA 13, 14 Nov] EDUCATION REFORM, STATISTICS--Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas announced that the educational reform plan will be launched in 1994 with initial financing of $150 million from the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. Dr. Enrique Ipina, undersecretary for education and culture in the Ministry of Human Development, highlighted the main points of the plan which is being elaborated by the Technical Support Team for Educational Reform (ETARE). ETARE compiled the following literacy and educational statistics to justify the need for this comprehensive reform "unique to Latin America." - 20 percent of Bolivians have never attended school and are totally illiterate. - 30 percent of adults are functionally illiterate. - 68 percent of illiterate Bolivians are women. - 70 percent of illiterate Bolivians live in the countryside. - 60 percent of rural children enroll in school. Of this figure, 70 percent never make it past the first year, with only 1.4 percent of male children and 0.7 percent of female children finishing secondary school. - 87 percent of urban children attend school. Of this number, 31 percent finish primary school. - 26 percent of urban female children who entered primary school finish secondary school. There are 67,555 teachers in Bolivia. Of these, 40,786 (60 percent) are in the cities, and 26,769 (40 percent) are in the countryside. - 59 percent of teachers (40,409) teach primary school. - 15.4 percent (10,426) teach secondary school. - 20.3 percent (13,781) are intermediate school teachers. - 4.3 percent (2,939) teach preschool or kindergarten. The teacher-student ratio is 1:18. However, since most teachers are in the cities, there are rural and indigenous communities without a single teacher. Furthermore, a little over half of the rural schools offer only the first three years of primary school. Rural children, therefore, have difficulty finishing even primary school. [Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS FACETAS Supplement] According to ETARE, in the last 10 years university enrollment has increased at 7.2 percent per year but only 4.5 percent of those enrolled in a university manage to graduate, and the dropout rate is 15 percent. Other figures reveal that approximately 40,000 secondary school graduates intend to enroll in the country's 23 public and private universities (this year). [La Paz EL DIARIO 10 Nov; PRESENCIA 22 Nov] Under Secretary Ipina outlined some of the goals of the first four years of the educational reform plan (1994-97) which aims at "transforming the educational system by 100 percent:" - 7,200 new schools and school councils. - 1,200 nuclear schools and councils. - 100 new school districts and nine departmental directorates. - 50,000 primary school teachers, 500 supervisors, and 720 specialists. - 1 million children in school: 600,000 in urban areas and 400,000 in rural areas. [La Paz PRESENCIA DEL PAIS 4 Dec] CHUOUISACA: RURAL POVERTY, LAND OWNERSHIP--Walter Valda Rivera, director of a Jesuit organization active among the farmers of Tarija, Chuquisaca, and Potosi, and president of the association of nongovernmental organizations in the area, concluded that rural poverty in Chuquisaca Department has been increasing for the past eight years to the point that most rural families in the area "live on the edge of total misery" and that the "quality of life" index is the lowest in the country. In a seminar held by various nongovernmental organizations, he presented a paper analyzing land ownership and production: - While 300,000 hectares are arable, small farmers cultivate only 149,000 hectares, producing 285,000 metric tons. - Large landholdings or "latifundios" cover 80 percent of the land, with 355 families owning 666,000 hectares, but most of this land lies fallow. - Small landholdings or "minifundios" are on the increase, with 60,000 families barely getting by with five hectares or less. - Internal migration has increased from 5,276 in 1980 to 30,000 farmers leaving the department for La Paz, Sucre, or the interior. - Illiteracy in many of Chuquisaca's provinces is 80 percent. Valda blamed the "neoliberal" model for the increasing poverty because it is "incompatible with" the farmers' "communal lifestyle" and "fosters competitiveness, individualism, and selfishness."
