Khazins; UDC 533.6.011] [Abstract] This paper presents a numerical analysis of a new effect of shock wave focusing which is caused by a thin extended gas layer of lower density at the side wall of a cylindrical tube when a wave is reflected from the flat end of the tube. The gas layer is in front of the shock wave and normal to the wave. It is shown in a model (using Euler equations and an antidiffusion scheme) that the gas dynamic parameters in the vicinity of the center of the end face increase by a factor of 5-10 (for strong shock waves) compared to the parameters trailing a reflected stationary flat shock wave. The diffuse gas layer may form naturally due to heating by heat fluxes from the front of a strong shock wave, or may be formed artificially by heating the surface. An isobar figure illustrates shock wave configuation and currents behind the shock wave just after it is reflected from the end of the tube. The increased pressure is a local and short-lived effect, but it is strong. Large-scale eddies are formed after the shock wave is reflected. The effect must be experimentally verified.
