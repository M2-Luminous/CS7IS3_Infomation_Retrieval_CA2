The Army, much dissatisfied with Kim's system, even exchanged fire with each other in front of his official hall in the spring of last year. After that, at Kim's insistence, the Army's ammunition around Pyongyang was confiscated. Temporarily returned to South Korea after taking part in the "Rally for Democratization and Recovery of Human Rights of North Korea," held under the auspices of "National Salvation Front for Democratic Unification of Korea" (National Salvation Front for short) in Washington D.C. last October 22, Mr. Pak Kap-tong (74), the standing chairman of National Salvation Front, said that he had heard that "the army of North Korea was very agitated." He thought that an internal coup could possibly dismantle Kim's system within two years. Pak said that he had heard the following from Front members participating in the Washington rally as well as those living in exile in Russia and China, etc. If a coup occurs in North Korea, the new military authorities, officers above colonel rank who had studied in the old Soviet Union, will become the main power in place of the Kim Il-song faction. The Front is an anti-Kim Il-song organization formed in Moscow in January, 1992 by North Korean defectors. Its leaders are Yi Sang-jo, ex-North Korean ambassador to the USSR (a lieutenant general of the People's Army); Mr. Suh Hui, ex-chairman of the Pyongyang Special City Party Chapter of Korean Workers Party; and Pak. The 15-member Central Standing Committee has all served as ranking executive members in the Korean Workers Party and People's Army. It includes Kang Sang-ho (ex-Vice Minister of Home Affairs), Chung Sang-jin (ex-Vice Minister of Culture and Art), Pak Byong-yul (ex-Director of Kang Dong Political School), Yu Song-chul (ex-Chief of the Operations Bureau of Supreme Headquarters of the People's Army), Chang Hak-bong (ex-chief of the Military Academy), Shim Su-chol (ex-deputy chef de cabinet of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces), Yu Song-gol (ex-Head of the Air Force Academy), etc. The Front has a membership of about 300. Its branches are set up in the United States, China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Russia, among others. The National Salvation Front, through "National Salvation" published in three languages, Korean, English, and Japanese, is pushing for recovery of human rights for North Korea's 23 million people who are dying of hunger, cold, and physical beatings. Its supreme task is "to drive out Kim Il-song and his son." The Front made eight demands at the Washington rally: 1) Eviction of "Human slaughterer Kim Il-song and his son from office at once!" 2) release of political prisoners, 3) freedom of the press, 4) freedom of assembly and association, 5) freedom of residence, 6) right to choose occupation, 7) guaranteed reunification of separated families, 8) guarantee of free hometown visits. [passage omitted] This writer asked Pak Kab-tong, who temporarily returned to South Korea, about the activities of the Front and the North Korean army unrest as well as that of the population of which the Front knows. To what extent is North Korea's army agitated? "According to the information we obtained, North Korea, after the Gulf War, had officers above regimental commander rank watch the videotape of the war to let them know American tactics. But it had a contrary effect. The commanders who watched realized that the outcome of modern war depends on up-to-date weapons. They were therefore infected with defeatism, saying that if North Korea started a war with conventional weapons, it would be defeated. The enlisted men are in a very poor health due to long periods underground and are extremely demoralized due to long-term service." How do you obtain information from the closed society of North Korea? "We get it from Russia, China, Japan, etc. The details of the channels should not be disclosed for their personal safety." (According to the first issue of "National Salvation," the Front is working in cooperation with an anti-Kim Il-song organization in North Korea.) You said that there was a gun battle in Pyongyang, didn't you? "To construct apartment buildings for 50,000 families in Pyongyang in the spring of last year, North Korea forced the construction, mobilizing the military in a district. The soldiers from the country, seeing that those serving in the Capitol were treated much better than themselves, forced their way to Kim Il-song's official hall to protest. As the Presidential Security Guards fired upon the soldiers to hold back, a gun battle broke out. After that, Kim ordered the troops around Pyongyang to surrender their ammunition." If a gun battle had broken out, it must have been a big problem. "Responsible persons were rebuked. But the corps commander of the troops from the country, Lieutenant General Kim Song-il, received immunity because he was the son of Kim Il-song and Mun Song-ja." I haven't heard that there was a son called Kim Song-il among Kim Il-song's sons. "That is because Kim's relations with women were not exposed. It is widely known that he is Kim's son. According to the information we obtained, there is a fierce power struggle between Kim Chong-il's group and the other group of Kim Song-ae who is Kim Il-song's wife. Kim Song-il is neutral. Kim Yong-sun, Kim Tal-hyon and Chang Song-taek (husband of Kim Kyong-hi, Kim Il-song's daughter) belong to Kim Chong-il's group. Kim Yong-ju, Kim Il-song's brother, and Kim Pyong-il, Kim Il-song's son, belong to Kim Song-ae's group." It is said that a military coup was carried out and that the persons connected with it were executed in North Korea. "Although we also heard of this, we were not able to confirm it. According to the information we obtained, a coup was carried out last July and some rebel army people fleeing North Korea were besieged by North Korean troops at a mountain near the border. At that time the Chinese Army moved in, which once took a stand against North Korea's army. At about that time, North Korea limited entry of pro-regime residents in Japan into the country. Such a measure has been very rare. The rumor of a coup circulated around this time." Is there the possibility of a military coup in North Korea? "Yes, as I said before, North Korea's military authorities are very discontented and infecteded with defeatism. If they were provided with ammunition, they will point their guns at Pyongyang. They are the biggest threaten to and the only substitute power for Kim Il-song's system. Split into the old and new generations, the military authorities will unite to seize power. Thereafter, the new generation will gain supremacy over the old generation, I expect." Exactly what do you mean by "the new generation of the military authorities"? "Officers above colonel, most of whom studied in the USSR, are the new military authorities. Because they served under the members of the Front in the past, they and the Front will, I think, understand each other. To restrain the new military authorities, Kim Il-song replaced company officers with those who did not study abroad, I heard." When do you expect the coup by the new military authorities? "If the North Korea's nuclear program is sanctioned immediately by the U.N., a coup will occur within the year. If North Korea enters into diplomatic relations with the U.S. or Japan, it will endure another two years before collapsing. Even if the new military authorities seize power, the unification of North and South Koreas will be possible only after five to six years from that point," I suppose. Will it be possible for North Korea to start a war? "War rumors are nothing but Kim Il-song threats. How can he start a war with such out-of-date weapons and demoralized soldiers? Because South Korea's government does not react strongly to North Korean threats, North Korea is spreading these rumors." How much information about North Korea's nuclear program do you have? "We once obtained information that North Korea had requested a nuclear bomb test range from the USSR under Brezhnev. Judging from this information, the nuclear weapons development of North Korea seems to have been ripe for testing. I also, during my stay in North Korea in 1956, heard a member of the South Korean Workers Party speak about the construction of nuclear weapons underground works. But nuclear weapons are merely a threat to South Korea and Japan, and can never be used." Is any power collaborating with the Front in North Korea? "Two hundred thousand political prisoners detained in the prison camps and 3 million nonsupporters, who are permanently detained in the collective farms in the mountains near the Yalu and Tumen Rivers, are opponents of Kim Il-song. They have the same opinion as we. Twenty thousand North Koreans who defected to China, now known to have been collectively housed in Inner Mongolian regions, may also be collaborators with us." To contact those people, what measures is the Front taking? "Although the Front is planning a variety of measures such as running broadcasting stations, etc. to let the population of North Korea know the truth about the outside world, it is in trouble for lack of funds. At present it concentrates its efforts on publicizing of what the Front really is." How do you raise funds? "Those who defected to Japan while being active members of the South Korean Workers Party in the past total about 30,000. Many of them are rich. The Front manages to keep going with their help."
