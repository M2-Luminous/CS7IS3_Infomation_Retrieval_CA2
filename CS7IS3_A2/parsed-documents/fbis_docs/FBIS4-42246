On the other hand the wise men are confident of a stable recovery that will also last throughout 1996. Their forecasts do not stretch any further into the future. But in the past the government has calculated that the recovery will last until the end of the century. This is apparent from the resume that the Economic Council has published on the eve of the public discussion of their report itself on 1 June. The government's Economic Overview, which Economy Minister Marianne Jelved (Radical Liberal) made public on 18 May, concludes that economic growth will rise by a total of 4 percent in 1994. Here the wise men expect growth of 2.8 percent. The wise men are also restrained about 1995 when they expect GNP growth of 2.9 percent, while the government predicts growth of 3.4 percent. For 1996 the wise men are alone in predicting a figure: GNP growth of 3 percent. The difference in the two reports' views of the next two years can be seen clearly from the unemployment figures. The government expects unemployment to fall to 330,000 this year and 305,000 in 1995. Here the wise men predict unemployment of 335,000 this year, 317,000 next year, and 305,000 will only be achieved in 1996. One of the most important explanations of why there is a difference between the two reports is that they make different assessments of export possibilities. The wise men are only expecting a 2.5-percent increase in exports this year, while the government is expecting a 4.7-percent increase. This pattern is repeated in 1995, when the wise men expect a 3 percent and the government a 5.3-percent increase. On the other hand they are agreed that there will be a major increase in imports. The wise men say 8.7 percent this year compared with the government's 9.4 percent. The wise men expect the high level of imports to continue into 1995 with an increase of 8.4 percent, compared with the government's 7.5 percent. According to the wise men, it is the German market that will have a dampening effect on exports. Germany takes around 28 percent of Danish exports, and the wise men are expecting growth this year in Germany of only 0.5 percent -- while the government expects double this -- 1 whole percent. There are also differences in the views taken of the Danish consumer. The wise men expect an increase in private consumption this year of 5.1 percent, growing to 5.7 percent in 1995, where the government keeps to 4.8 and 4.5 percent. This has major repercussions for the balance of payments. The trend of a growing balance of payments surplus that has prevailed since 1986 begins to turn now. The wise men expect a fall in the balance of payments surplus from 35 billion kroner in 1993 to 25 billion this year, 17 billion next year, all the way down to a mere 12 billion kroner in 1996 -- a total fall of 65 percent. "This is not an indication that we are squandering the balance of payments surplus. But when a recovery is domestic driven, as is the case in Denmark, this has to have an effect on the balance of payments. We simply have to hope that we do not repeat the mistakes from the first half of the eighties when we forgot about export markets and concentrated on the home market," said Jorgen Damgaard, the Jyske Bank's chief analyst. The wise men expect the budget deficit to increase by 10 billion kroner in the course of 1994 -- from 40 billion to 50 billion kroner. Thereafter the wise men expect this deficit to fall in 1995 and 1996 to 36 billion and 22 billion kroner respectively. This is due partly to the fact that the wise men are expecting that the government will be able to limit growth in public consumption to 0.7 percent in 1994, and 1.4 percent in both 1995 and 1996. "Here the wise men have indeed been optimistic. I simply do not believe that the government will be able to keep growth down so low," said Jorgen Damgaard, the Jyske Bank's chief analyst. However, the wise men are more or less in line with the government's own estimates. The government's Economic Overview expects growth in public consumption this year of 1.2 percent and 0.8 percent next year.
