The UN Security Council is scheduled to hold another session at 1900 today, Baghdad time. Sources that participated in the council's deliberations yesterday told journalists that a clear rift in the positions of UN Security Council members has resulted in two groups. The first adopts the formula of previous council statements that automatically renew the embargo every two months. This group comprises the United States, the United Kingdom, and Argentina. The second group adopts a new formula for the president's statement reflecting the progress achieved in the implementation of resolution 687 and Iraq's acceptance of resolution 715. This group is led by France, China, and Russia, and is supported by other member countries. It has been noticed that this time the Russian envoy has spoken forcefully in favor of the new formula, in accordance with instructions the Russian ambassador received from Moscow. Other sources said the Spanish and Czech ambassadors have asked to consult their governments before defining their position on the new statement. Another report from New York says diplomats from various delegations today emphasized that UN Security Council members are divided about the position to take toward Iraq because both the United States and the United Kingdom strongly oppose any recognition that Iraq has made some progress in implementing the UN Security Council resolutions. It has been decided to hold new consultations in this respect this evening, 18 March. However, Vorontsov, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, ruled out the possibility of reaching an agreement on any formula. Vorontsov said the UN Security Council members are divided on this topic for the first time in four and one-half years. Other diplomats in the United Nations said France, China, Russia, and Brazil and other countries want the UN Security Council to recognize that Iraq has made some progress in implementing the council's resolutions. However, the United States and the United Kingdom reject this idea. They voiced their displeasure with the recent Iraqi letter to the UN Security Council in which Iraq asked the council to respect the provisions of its resolutions on lifting the oil embargo from Iraq. A diplomat from Latin America who was present at the UN Security Council session yesterday said U.S. Ambassasor Madeleine Albright appeared to be very disturbed and agitated by the Iraqi letter, describing it as humiliating. She said UN Security Council resolutions are adopted by council members, not by Iraq. UK envoy Sir David Hannay was also disturbed by the Iraqi letter. He said: The letter is the cause of the problem that the council is experiencing. When the journalists asked him why the embargo against Iraq continues after it has demonstrated obvious cooperation in implementing UN Security Council resolutions, he admitted Iraq has shown cooperation. However, he claimed his country and the United States need some time to test the seriousness of Iraq's cooperation. This is a diplomatic expression to cover up a position that is hostile to Iraq. In a related development, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz last night met with special commission Chairman Ambassador Rolf Ekeus. The meeting, which went on for one and one-half hours, was attended by members of the Iraqi delegation, the special commission vice chairman and some of its members. Before entering the meeting, Ekeus told journalists outside the house of the Iraqi UN envoy that the technical meetings were good. He said: These meetings helped us clarify certain issues. We hope we will be able to complete them quickly. Asked about what he will discuss with Tariq 'Aziz, Ekeus said: I will clarify certain basic points. We are interested in listening to his remarks. Ekeus expressed dissatisfaction with Iraq's letter that Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz presented the day before yesterday. Ekeus did not say why is he is dissatisfied. The letter reminds the Security Council of its obligations to lift the embargo because Iraq had fulfilled its obligations according to Resolutions 687 and 715. Following his meeting with Tariq 'Aziz, Ekeus told journalists outside the Iraqi ambassador's house: We have exchanged views as part of the ongoing dialogue between us. I must not say anything further. He then said: Every day, we in the commission are progressing further toward the future monitoring. We will continue the technical talks. We hope to complete them today, Friday. Asked by journalists about issues that are still pending, Ekeus said: After Iraq's acceptance of Resolution 715, last January we received statements from Iraq that were needed to start the monitoring. In the commission, we are trying to mass all of our resources to start the monitoring and resolve the remaining problems, or so he alleges.
