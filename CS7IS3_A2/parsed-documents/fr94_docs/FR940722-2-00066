SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a guideline entitled ``Guideline for Establishing a Safe Concentration.'' This guideline includes information and guidance to regulated industry and the public on food factors. This guideline is being made available as a revision to a document entitled ~``General Principles for Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing Animals'' which is a compilation of eight guidelines (hereinafter referred to as ``the compilation''). The new guideline replaces guideline IV entitled ``Guideline for Establishing a Tolerance,'' which is no longer in effect. DATES: Written comments may be submitted at any time. ADDRESSES: Submit written requests for single copies of the guideline to the Communications and Education Branch (HFV&hyph;12), Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855. Send two self-addressed adhesive labels to assist that office in processing your requests. Submit written comments on the guideline to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. Requests and comments should be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. A copy of the compilation which includes the new guideline entitled ``Guideline for Establishing a Safe Concentration'' and received comments are available for public examination in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Margaret A. Miller, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;156), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1692. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of December 31, 1987 (52 FR 49589) FDA announced the availability of a compilation of seven guidelines entitled ``General Principles for Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing Animals.'' The compilation was issued in accordance with FDA's requirement under the general safety provisions of sections 409, 512, and 706 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) to determine whether each food additive, new animal drug, or color additive proposed for use in food-producing animals is safe for those animals and whether the edible products derived from treated animals are safe. The pertinent regulations implementing the statutory provisions are in 21 CFR part 70, 21 CFR 514.1, and 21 CFR part 570. Under the act, the sponsor of a compound is required to furnish FDA with the scientific data necessary for demonstrating that residues of the sponsored compound in the edible products of treated animals are safe. The compilation was developed to inform sponsors of the scientific data that FDA believes will provide an acceptable basis for determining the safety of the compound. Guidelines state procedures or practices that may be useful to the persons to whom they are directed, but are not legal requirements. Guidelines represent the agency's position on a procedure or a practice at the time of their issuance. A person may follow a guideline or choose to follow alternate procedures or practices. If a person chooses to use alternate procedures or practices, then that person may wish to discuss the matter further with the agency to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable to FDA. A guideline does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person. When a guideline states a requirement imposed by statute or regulation, however, the requirement is law and its force and effect are not changed in any way by virtue of its inclusion in the guideline. FDA is announcing the availability of a new guideline entitled ``Guideline for Establishing a Safe Concentration'' that includes information and guidance to regulated industry and the public on food factors. This guideline is being made available as a revision to the compilation and replaces guideline IV entitled ``Guideline for Establishing a Tolerance,'' which is no longer in effect. The new guideline sets out new consumption values that FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) will use in partitioning the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for drug residues among the edible products of food producing animals. The new daily consumption values for total red meats and poultry, across all species, are 300 grams (g) of meat (as muscle tissue), 100 g of liver, 50 g of kidney, 50 g of fat, 100 g of eggs, and 1.5 liters (l) of milk. These values are a more realistic estimate of actual food consumption than the values currently used by CVM. CVM will continue to regulate eggs and milk as independent commodities, which means that these products are not considered components of the 500 g of edible muscle and organ tissues. The intake estimate of milk will remain 1.5 l. CVM will now assume, however, that an individual consumes an entire portion of meat and edible tissues and an entire portion of milk on a daily basis. Therefore, a part of the ADI will be reserved for milk when evaluating products approved in lactating dairy cows and products seeking approval in both lactating dairy cows and another animals species. The other part of the ADI will be partitioned among the animal tissues as described above. For products approved in both laying hens and other animals, a part of the ADI will be reserved for eggs. In addition to incorporating the new food factors, the concept of negligible tolerance has been omitted from the new guideline because CVM usually can establish a finite or zero tolerance when assessing the safety of a drug. Interested persons may, at any time, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments on the guideline. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Received comments will be considered in determining whether further revision of the guideline is necessary. A copy of the compilation which includes the new guideline entitled ``Guideline for Establishing a Safe Concentration,'' is available for public examination in the office above, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: July 15, 1994. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17813 Filed 7&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
