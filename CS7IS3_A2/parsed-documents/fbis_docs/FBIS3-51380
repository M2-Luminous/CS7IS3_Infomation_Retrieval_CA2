The mission will include government officials and a group of entrepreneurs. It will be headed by Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas. An official source told us that there is an important trade link based on compensation agreements between Iran and Uruguay. The source said that the products to be negotiated are those that traditionally have been exchanged between the two countries.
