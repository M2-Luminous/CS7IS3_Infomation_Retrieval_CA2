FR940816-1-00082 FR940816-1-00011 (1) Wounded livestock or some remains of a livestock carcass must be present with clear evidence (Roy and Dorrance 1976, Fritts 1982) that wolves were responsible for the damage, and there must be reason to believe that additional losses would occur if the problem wolf or wolves were not controlled. Such evidence is essential since wolves may feed on carrion they have found while not being responsible for the kill. (2) Artificial or intentional feeding of wolves must not have occurred. Livestock carcasses not properly disposed of in an area where depredations have occurred will be considered attractants. On Federal lands, removal or resolution of such attractants must accompany any control action. Livestock carrion or carcasses on Federal land, not being used as bait in an authorized control action (by agencies authorized by the Service), must be removed, buried, burned, or otherwise disposed of so that the carcass(es) will not attract wolves. (3) On Federal lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed. Final Federal responsibility for protection of gray wolves in the experimental population under provisions of the Act would cease after: (1) a minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented for three consecutive years in each of the three recovery areas presented by the revised wolf recovery plan (Service 1987), and evaluated by the environmental impact statement (Service 1994), providing that legal mechanisms are in place to conserve this population, and (2) gray wolves in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming are delisted according to provisions of the Act. The Act specifies that the status of a species must be monitored for a 5-period after delisting. If, after delisting, the wolf population fell below the minimum criteria of 10 breeding pairs in any recovery area for two of three consecutive years, wolves in that area would be considered for relisting under the Act. Public Comments Solicited The Service intends that any final rule resulting from this proposal be as accurate and effective as possible. Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, States, Tribes, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments must be received within 60 days of publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register . Any final decision on this proposal will take into consideration the comments and any additional information received by the Service. Such communications may lead to a final rule that differs from this proposal. The Service will also hold public hearings to obtain additional verbal and written information. Hearings are proposed to be held in Cheyenne, Wyoming; Boise, Idaho; Helena, Montana; Salt Lake City, Utah; Seattle, Washington; and Washington, D.C. The location, dates, and times of these six hearings will be announced in a forthcoming issue of the Federal Register and in newspapers. National Environmental Policy Act An Environmental Impact Statement under the National Environmental Policy Act has been prepared and is available to the public (see ADDRESSES ). This proposed rule is an implementation of the proposed action and does not require revision of the environmental impact statement on the reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. Required Determinations This proposed rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. The rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within the experimental population area, significant economic impacts will not result from this action. Also, no direct costs, enforcement costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this action and the rule contains no record-keeping requirements, as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). This rule does not require federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612 because it would not have any significant federalism effects as described in the order.
