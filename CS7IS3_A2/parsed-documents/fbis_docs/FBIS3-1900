It has established friendly relations with China's Jiangsu Province. In addition, four cities in the prefecture have established friendship ties with Chinese cities. The Fukuoka people are ready to take further steps to help develop friendship and cooperation between Japan and China. In his speech, Zhu Rongji praised Fukuoka Prefecture for its relentless efforts to develop Sino-Japanese friendship not only in the past but also at the present.

I hope the two sides will work hard to continue to expand cooperation between Fukuoka and China. Before concluding their visit to Osaka, Zhu Rongji and his party also visited Okayama Prefecture, where they visited the Seto Ohashi Bridge. Zhu Rongji praised the ocean bridge for its magnificent construction and attractive layout. He also inquired about the economic benefits obtained from the bridge's construction.
