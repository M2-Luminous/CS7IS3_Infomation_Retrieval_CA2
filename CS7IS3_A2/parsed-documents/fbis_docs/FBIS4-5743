Advantages have never been so good as they are today. This is a result of our dynamic economy, stable politics, and correct diplomatic policy. A person or a family with few friends and lots of enemies would have many worries and incalculable misfortune. A country, if faced with the same situation, would be much worse. Therefore, door-opening is a great success arising from our party's renovative thinking. Our party's great thinking is to build a dynamically-developed society along the socialist path with a prosperous population, strong nation, and an equitable and civilized society. But that path is being targeted for sabotage by hostile forces. We must realize clearly the motto of being open-minded toward everybody and honest with friends, and never belittling the political wisdom and shrewdness of a nation and its people. That is a lesson for everybody in the current trend of integration and development and is needed for the world to coexist peacefully amid never-ending conflict. We do not exaggerate the dangers while great opportunities have arisen. Our people, with their incomparable and sincere desire for peace, are easily moved by the offer of any cooperative hands. They gratefully view this as an act of sharing our suffering. As our people are grateful, they will never forget the kindness given to them by the peoples of friendly countries during their fight against the French and the United States. Despite countless difficulties, these friendly peoples encouraged, supported, and assisted us. That sincere act came from the depth of their hearts. It will not be our fault should history ever leave any unsavory mark on anybody. "Why should we be vigilant? If I come to you with suspicions, can I cooperate with you enthusiastically?" The answer is: "We do not suspect anybody when we think of cooperation for mutual benefit. We open our door widely to welcome anyone, irrespective of political affiliation, who arrives to cooperate with the Vietnamese people for economic development and cultural exchange. But we will not allow anyone to interfere in our internal affairs to divert us from the Uncle Ho-directed path already chosen by our party and people." We cherish peace. We absolutely do not want war, including the bloody anti-aggression war and the silent war against the peaceful evolution strategy. As Trotsky put it: "You may not be concerned about strategies, but strategies do concern you." Real information and activities, most of them clandestine and illegal, show that the "peaceful evolution" strategy is a prop for the enemy's riotous and subversive activities and is being undertaken to a great extent. External reactionary forces working hand in glove with internal reactionary and dissident elements have publicly declared their intention to eliminate our socialist regime. Door-opening, which is considered by us as one of the advantages of the new situation, is also a dream for those hostile forces which are conspiring to eliminate our regime. The enemy has drawn on their successful lessons of experience, obtained from East Europe and the Soviet Union in using their "peaceful evolution" strategy with its sweet and gentle tricks, to attack Vietnam. Being a well-experienced party, "it" [the enemy] will not directly attack our strategic command. The enemy will take advantage of our shortcomings and negligence. They will find a way into our intermediate-level management echelons and into every nook and cranny of villages and hamlets. They will seek to buy support, sow division among the people, and incite bad elements to oppose us as the opportunities arise before they start riotous and subversive activities. [Text] We are vigilant, but not childish to the point of seeing everyone as our enemy, gradually closing our door, or being panic-stricken. We are alert and confident. We are vigilant to protect the survival of our regime and especially our pattern of defense and development as a nation. Remaining vigilant is the consciousness of the entire people. But great responsibility rests with the Armed Forces. Even in some countries where no gunfire has been heard for hundreds of years, priority efforts continue to strengthen their defense forces and their armies. Their soldiers are sweating and even bleeding in their combat drills. The history of our country is one stained with the blood of aggressors. We can still recall the story of Ms. Vo Thi Thang who, after walking out free from the Con Dao prison with her "victorious smile," went to Cuba for a visit where an elderly lady struggled with the crowd to reach her. Embracing her, she said to her in tears: "How beautiful and gentle you are. Vietnam is so loyal and appreciative. Why is it that the enemy continues to target your country for their invasion, killing, and sabotaging?" The Armed Forces must first be strengthened in line with our national strategy. We do not like to see a country with very poor revenue bearing a very high defense budget. But in order to have a peaceful country for construction, a strong people's Army is of paramount importance. Safeguarding independence and sovereignty and achieving socio-political stability are important conditions for economic development and national construction. The incident in East Europe and the Soviet Union woke up all revolutionary nations over the social class nature of the Armed Forces. At present, to heighten a sense of vigilance for the Army, we must first of all train it to become politically stable and absolutely loyal to the socialist regime, the party, and the people. In an attempt to overthrow our regime, the enemy is eager to see nothing other than a Vietnamese Army having vague political knowledge, waning willpower and determination, and a falling organizational structure. Therefore, in heightening a sense of vigilance, not only will the Army have to equip itself with high combat skills so it can be ready to smash all external acts of aggression but it will also have to serve as solid prop to maintain internal political stability. Hostile forces are trying by all means to exploit our negligence, weaknesses, and internal difficulties to create troubles here and there. We should maintain a high sense of vigilance to prevent bad phenomena from occurring. As they are undergoing their combat-readiness training, Army units must contribute their utmost effort to make the public thoroughly aware of the party's revolutionary lines and the enemy's sabotage schemes. The units must try to build a strong political structure from among the people. In their new strategy, hostile forces are "paying particular attention to us." Their attacking weapons are not guns and ammunition, but rather sweet words to the ears and freshly fragrant handkerchiefs. They want us to stray off our course, eliminate the party, depoliticize the Army, negate all our socialist achievements, and eventually, direct their artillery attack at our history and smear our banner which has been reddened with the blood of our predecessors. At the recent All-Army National Congress, delegates discussed and fully understood the meaning of a party Central Committee resolution on achievements scored, and on new opportunities and challenges. This is vivid evidence that the Army has upheld the lesson of remaining vigilant to stabilize politics, develop the nation, and protect the regime and the fatherland.
