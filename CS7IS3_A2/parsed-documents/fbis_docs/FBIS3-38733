Only a few days ago, I appealed to the world from heroic Sarajevo to end the tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today's massacre has once more confirmed how right we were in our appeal. The world should no longer remain indifferent to this human tragedy. The aggressor should definitely be punished. The international community should allow the heroic Bosnian people to defend themselves. The embargo should be lifted and the aggressor should definitely be deterred through the use of force. I express my support for and extend my condolences to the government and people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
