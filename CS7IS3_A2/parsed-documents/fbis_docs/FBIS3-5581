Russia is now behind the Serbs and is trying to do its best to defend its traditional ally. In fact, this trend was already visible after NATO threatened to bomb the Serbs. Russia strongly opposed the threat and insisted that the settlement of the Bosnian conflict be referred to the UN Security Council. If the proposal is approved, Russia would certainly use its veto power to defend the Serbs. [passage omitted] There are several reasons why Russia, which earlier supported the West, is now defending the Serbs. First, the Serbs are a traditional ally of Russia. Although Russia is no longer the godfather [preceding word in English] of its former satellite nations, it is still obligated to defend the Serbs, who used to be part of its hegemony. Second, Russia appears to have been angry that it has totally been ignored by the West in the Bosnian conflict. The NATO ultimatum, for example, was obviously issued without taking Russia into account. Russian generals feel that Russia, a former superpower and former leader of the defunct Warsaw Pact, has been ignored by NATO. Accordingly, they have tried from the very beginning to obstruct NATO actions. Third, in the context of international politics, Russia wants to "reemerge" as a superpower by showing its opposition to the Western scenario in the Balkans. The fact that its economy has collapsed and domestic politics is in disarray is one thing, while involvement in an international conflict is another. In any case, Russia still has military strength that needs to be reckoned with. The Serbs are, of course, exploiting such a situation. They believe that the West--half-heartedly and irreversibly dragged into the conflict--will think twice before crushing them if Russia is involved on their side. Of course, Russia will not intervene hastily because it has to be cautious toward the United States and Europe, whose assistance is by all means needed to support the reforms in Russia. Regardless of this, the Serbian policy of using Russia as a "shield," may, however, complicate the situation in the Balkans. Even NATO, the United Nations, and the United States continue to have different views about the best way to settle the conflict. NATO's "unanimous" decision to give the Serbs the ultimatum was in fact not made easily because each NATO member feels that it has a better way to settle the conflict. Thus, imagine what will happen if the Russian factor is actually played in the delicate Bosnian conflict! Obviously, such a situation will benefit the Serbs the most.
