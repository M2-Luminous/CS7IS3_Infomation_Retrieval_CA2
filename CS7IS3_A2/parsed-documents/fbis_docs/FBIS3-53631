In utter disregard for the 11 years' services rendered to the US in Afghanistan, the Clinton administration turned down all offers made by the Pakistan Government to get or even buy the ammunition worth millions of dollars. US experts are now strictly monitoring the destruction of ammunition which includes mortars, rockets and artillery gun fire. It is better to destroy them here than to give it to the country which has no strategic value for us now, seems to be the US message. The US, on the face of it, has refused Pakistan's offers in the name of the Pressler Amendment which bars all kinds of military aid to Pakistan. The Afghans, on the other hand, have refused to return what they think is rightfully theirs now. This ammunition dumped in various areas of Afghanistan has been confiscated by local commanders in Afghanistan. Sources in the Foreign Office were farious that the 11 years in which Pakistan watched US interests in the region, even at the cost of risking its security, has not won the ammunition which should be peanuts for a superpower like America. This ammunition was the last of what remained in the pipeline after the stoppage of US supply somewhere in 1990. The supply was stopped when the US felt that the mission had been accomplished after the withdrawal of the Soviet troops. The agencies involved in the exercise were asked to freeze the supply immediately. The ammunition in the pipeline was dumped in various areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Americans, realising that the cost of its transportation back to the US would be too much decided to destroy the material here. But when the time came the local commanders in Afghanistan refused to oblige despite various pressures exerted by the Americans. Pakistan being an ever obliging country has allowed it without any resistance. Interestingly, the US is not very keen about getting back ammunition from Afghanistan because it fits in the US scheme of things in this region. The US knows that this ammunition will be used in Afghan infighting which serves a better purpose for the Americans, says the source. But what worries it the most are the lost Stingers which, the Americans fear, might land into loan and other Muslim countries. A massive witch-hunt is on to trace these Stingers in Afghanistan. Price ranging from Rs [Rupees] 4 million to Rs 12 million is being offered through various agencies to get back these missiles. But this missile retrieval exercise is not so easy a job. An American was severely injured recently when one of Bara-made missiles exploded. In the presence of these fakes, in which ordinary explosives are packed in original body, the Americans are now more careful when they buy them.
