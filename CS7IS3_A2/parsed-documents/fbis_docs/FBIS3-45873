It included visits to six African countries and to France and a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. In an interview at the airport here this morning on arrival from Paris, Qian told reporters that his three missions had gone well. Diplomats here believe that Qian's effectiveness is impressive, since he has finished such important and intensive diplomatic missions with significant achievements within only half a month. The first leg of Qian's foreign trip at the beginning of this year was his visit to Ethiopia, Eritrea, The Sudan, Kenya, Madagascar and Mauritius. This was also his fourth visit to Africa since he became foreign minister in 1988. Since his first Africa visit in 1990, Qian has shuttled back and forth in the African continent and has by now visited 21 African countries, about two fifths of all of them. Qian's frequent visits to Africa are seen as visible proof that China pays great attention to the African countries' role in the international arena. To further strengthen and develop friendly relations and cooperation with the developing countries has always been vital for China's diplomatic policies. While Qian was visiting East Africa, China and Lesotho resumed diplomatic relations, bringing to 159 the number of countries which have forged diplomatic ties with China. While Qian was still in Africa, General Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, paid an official goodwill visit to Thailand and Indonesia. There were also important foreign visitors to Beijing. The Zimbabwean Parliament Speaker Nolan Chipo Makombe, Cambodian First Prime Minister Samdech Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, Japanese deputy prime minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, speaker of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea Lee Man Sup -- all visited China, one after another, during the first month of 1994. This series of "comings and goings" shows the strong momentum of China's diplomatic activities. The visits also reflect that promotion and deepening of cooperative relations of mutual benefit with its neighbor nations and the developing countries is the key point of China's diplomacy. Qian's France visit was an important high-level contact between China and France after the two sides issued a joint communique in mid-January, marking the normalization of bilateral relations. Qian was "satisfied" with his meetings and talks with French President Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, saying that the two sides achieved understanding on many issues, which "is of great importance to the relations between China and France and the other European countries as well." Qian pointed out that many Western countries are intrigued by China's huge market, and that they are willing to take part in China's economic development. To strengthen ties with China has become a trend in the world, he added. France has announced that Prime Minister Balladur is to visit China, and Foreign Minister Juppe also indicated that he would go to China in the near future. Their visits, if happening, will be major events in Sino-French relations and make the relations resume at a high level. The 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations falls on January 27, 1994. Over the past 30 years, bilateral relations have experienced both progress and difficulties. The issuing of a Sino-French joint communique and Qian's France visit unfolded a new page in the annals of bilateral relations. Around Qian's visit to France, Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, has been in Europe on an official visit to Germany, Austria and Switzerland. There is no doubt that both Qian's and Qiao's visit to West Europe will have extensive and positive impact on the development of the relations between China and West European countries. The Paris meeting between Qian and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and a visit to China by Lloyd Bentsen, U.S. secretary of treasury, are two important events between China and the United States. During the three-hour-long talks, the Chinese foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state exchanged views and achieved consensus on some bilateral and international issues. Qian told XINHUA in the interview today that he and Christopher both held that through constant contacts, China and the United States should further increase their understanding of each other, narrow or even eliminate differences on some matters, including the most favored nation trade status issue, so that they would not hinder the development of bilateral ties. Qian said the Sino-U.S. foreign ministerial meeting will be followed by more contacts between high-ranking officials from the two sides, and that bilateral exchanges will maintain their active momentum, which started last November when the Sino-U.S. summit meeting was held in Seattle.
