Section 1. Developments in tax reform after the "Interim Report" Section 2. Guidelines on concrete measures to implement tax reform: 1. Building a balanced taxation system: (2) Under a comprehensive program to promote tax reform, it is possible to implement the reduction of individual income tax in advance of incrementing consumption tax. 2. Ensuring fairness in the tax burden 3. Promoting administrative and fiscal reforms: This commission strongly urges that such reforms be implemented promptly and resolutely by both the national and local governments under a specific guideline, simultaneously with the implementation of concrete tax reform measures. Members of the commission expressed the opinion that the following specific steps be taken: Reorganization of the central government ministries and agencies, retrenchment and rationalization of semigovernmental corporations, rationalization of personnel size in both national and local governments, drastic review of all aspects of fiscal requirements, and active measures to ease government regulation and to narrow the gap between domestic and overseas prices. While administrative reforms will not create substantial revenue resources immediately, commission members expressed the opinion that mid-term numerical targets or programs, such as a "five-year plan for administrative reform" should be formulated and implemented systematically by adopting concrete measures. 4. Feasible measures to cope with an aging society (2) Increase in the people's share in the cost of dealing with an aging society -- while it is believed that the concept of a (welfare) vision needs more rigorous consideration, and more efforts need to be made to achieve greater rationality and efficiency in welfare systems and policies, a considerable increase in the people's financial burden is still inevitable. (3) Improvement of the fiscal system (4) Necessity of increasing the tax burden 2) After considerable deliberation on the (mechanical) calculations [of the increase in tax burden], this commission reached the following conclusions: a. The people need to be informed straightforwardly about the increase in tax burden brought about by the increase in public services inherent in an aging society. b. Revenue sources for the redemption of stopgap bonds should be dealt with in a proper way in the process of tax reform. c. It is best to avoid having excessive expectations of a natural increase in tax collected. d. Persistent efforts should undoubtedly be exerted to implement administrative and fiscal reforms, and to ensure fairness in the tax burden, along with implementation of concrete tax reform measures. The scale of tax increase should be held down to the minimum through such efforts. Section 3. Reduction of individual income tax: 1. Basic thinking: Tax brackets in the progressive tax rate structure should be reclassified to lessen, as much as possible, the feeling among the working population of a heavy tax burden, particularly the middle- income group, the most productive segment of the labor force. 2. Tax rate structure: The application of each tax bracket should be expanded as much as possible, particularly the 20-percent income tax bracket, and the 10-percent individual residence tax bracket. The highest tax rate should be reduced to about 50 percent. 3. Lowest taxable income: In consideration of the additional burden on low-income tax payers brought about by the increase in consumption tax, the income threshold on which tax is paid will inevitably be raised. Section 4. Increasing the consumption tax 1. Basic thinking: It is necessary to raise the consumption tax rate, and increase the share of consumption tax in the tax structure as a whole. 2. Taxable consumption and tax rate structure: No further exemptions from consumption tax should be allowed. The structure of a single applicable tax rate should be maintained. 3. Preferential systems for small businesses: (1) Tax exemption system for businesses -- Measures to eventually include relatively large establishments in taxable businesses should be considered. (2) Simplified taxation system -- Scope of application should be narrowed down, while also giving consideration to the clerical workload of small businesses. (3) Deductible limit system -- Appropriate revision of the system, including possible abolition, is necessary. 4. Tax deduction for purchasing costs: Keeping proof-of-purchase documents (invoices) -- vouchers, delivery slips, or receipts -- should be included as one of the requirements. Section 5. Augmenting local revenue sources 1. Local revenue sources: (1) The commission agreed on the significance of paying taxes in the localities and checking how such tax revenues are spent. 2. Possibility of a local consumption tax: (2) Due to the need to increase local revenue sources, the commission deliberated extensively the issue of a "local consumption tax." The issue was considered in relation to the problem of reducing the tax burden for individual residence tax, but the commission was not in a position to decide whether it is appropriate to introduce this tax at present. It would like to reach a conclusion on the issue as soon as possible.
