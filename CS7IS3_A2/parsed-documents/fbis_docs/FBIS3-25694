But the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] has maintained a noticeable subdued election profile. It is the only one of the four major parties contesting the elections for both the national and provincial assemblies that has not yet begun campaigning in earnest. In the past week, it tried to dispel speculation that its low profile is due to financial difficulties. Unlike other parties, the PAC went along to the Independent Electoral Commission with R[rand]70,000 in crisp notes to pay its deposit for registration as a political party. But it has delayed the unveiling of a detailed manifesto three times. This is now expected to be made public next week. However, the PAC itself is attaching little weight to such a programme. Its emphasis is on intense campaigning at grassroots level. This partly explains why the organisation has done little in the way of election rallies and mass meetings to project a public profile. This is except for its December national congress in Umtata which ratified participation in the election. But its low election profile may well be due to the controversy surrounding the decision to contest the April polls. Not all in the PAC, for example, agree that the armed struggle should be suspended in preparation for participation in the elections. But PAC officials disagree that the launch of the campaign has been delayed and do not seem unduly perturbed by dissension in the eastern Cape, arguing that it is limited to a few individuals. The organisation, they say, has concentrated its efforts at the grassroots level rather than the media. In any case, the PAC's December conference satisfied itself that tactical and strategic considerations debated by delegates provide a sound basis for participation in the polls, the officials say. PAC foreign affairs chief Gora Ebrahim argues: "The principle that the PAC has been pursuing all along is that the election must be for a constituent assembly, whose primary task must be draw up the new non-racial democratic constitution. The PAC's national conference on December 16 1993 was satisfied that the April elections would be for a constituent assembly to draw up a new, non-racial, democratic constitution. It therefore meets the PAC's primary demand and, on that basis, we will participate in the coming election." While the PAC is content with the primary objective of the April elections, its decision to participate was not an unqualified one. Ebrahim says his organisation will be sitting in the constituent assembly but will not consider itself bound by any of the constitional principles agreed upon by other participants at the multi-party talks last year. "The PAC congress has taken a decision that we are going into an election for an unfettered constitutional assembly [CA]. We believe that the elected people cannot be bound by an unelected group's decisions." Ebrahim adds that the PAC only considers itself bound by those principles that are enumerated and enshrined in the 1989 Consensus Declaration of the United Nations. Included in this declaration are basic principles binding parties to a multi-party democracy, a universally accepted Bill of Rights, an independent judiciary, regular elections etc. It does not consider itself bound by principles providing limited powers for regional government or those allowing for a Government of National Unity (GNU). "There are also other deals, struck between the ANC [African National Congress] and the NP [National Party], that the PAC is not bound by," says Ebrahim. Among these is the deal which effectively resulted in the decision at multi-party talks for a single ballot in the April elections, he says. Ebrahim added that, as things stand, the PAC would not participate in the Transitional Executive Council (TEC). But this is not an open and shut case -- "We are still involved in talks with the government and hope that obstacles in the way of the PAC joining the TEC will be removed." One of these obstacles revolves around the control over the security forces in the period up to the elections. The PAC believes the government remains in control of the army and police while the TEC only has jurisdiction over liberation armies and homeland security forces. It is of the view that all armed forces, including the SA [South African] Defence Force and the South African Police, should come under TEC command. Just how successful the PAC will be in getting its way is, however, in question. It has, for example, already sacrificed an important bargaining chip -- the armed struggle. And some dissension in its ranks relates to the PAC's suspension of the armed campaign without having secured the necessary changes to the TEC Act. There is also no certainty that the organisation will participate in the GNU, which it remains opposed to in terms of its own principles and understanding of what constitutes a democracy. But there remains a possibility that the PAC will join the GNU if it believes this will serve its strategic interests. Participation in the GNU will depend on the same process of debate and assessment that went into determining the strategic value of participating in the multi-party negotiating council, says Ebrahim. "If we find that we can meaningfully make a contribution, we will participate in the GNU." But a final decision will only be taken when the GNU is established, says Ebrahim, cautioning that the pros and cons of participation have not yet come up for discussion. This decision will be informed by the PAC's capacity to influence the final constitution. And this in turn depends on the support the organisation enjoys among South African voters, Ebrahim explains. But, if recent opinion polls are anything to go by, the PAC is unlikely to muster the support of more than two percent of the country's estimated 22.5-million voters. While Ebrahim agrees that its clout at the CA will depend on the support it can mobilise in the runup to the elections, he disputes the accuracy of the opinion polls. "These polls do not affect us in the least when we examine them against reports, from delegates throughout the country, of our strength at the grassroots level. We took a very firm decision to participate in the elections despite these strange polls -- in our view, the only thing that these polls will prove is how wrong they were." Ebrahim says a PAC study has shown, that of an estimated 21- million voters in the country, only four to five million were committed or card-carrying members of political parties. "You have between 15- and 16-million voters out there who make up the floating vote. Our study shows that this floating vote will vote on the basis of two considerations," says Ebrahim. At one level, these voters' choice will be based on their perception of different political organisations: "is it principled, has it compromised, has it compromised too much, is it involved in violence?" "These are some of the questions the floating majority will ask before they cast their votes," says Ebrahim. "But the builk of this majority will cast its votes on straightforward bread and butter issues such as security, housing, employment, land, education and health. We have found that the bulk of the people are literally doing shopping and that is why people want to know what parties are offering. We also found that there has been a fundamental change in the thinking of our people in the post-February 1990 period. Prior to this period, we found that people would support you for simply opposing the regime. Today, they want to know what's in it for them." Ebrahim is confident that his party will capture a sizable part of the floating vote because it has a strong message and programme that addresses every one of the bread and butter concerns. "We are not perceived in the townships as being involved in violence and that is a major asset in those areas where violence is endemic. We also know that no political organisation in the world wins an election on the basis of its membership -- more important is what's on offer. For all these reasons, we think we stand an excellent chance of winning a substantial majority," Ebrahim says without a hint of doubt. He adds that it was against the background of these considerations that the Umtata conference decided to contest the elections, confident that the PAC has the ingredients to capture the floating vote. Its success will, however, depend on its election manifesto, which is expected to be unveiled next week. Ebrahim would not speculate on the manifesto's contents. Asked whether it would focus exclusively on constitutional issues, given that the PAC sees the elections as nothing more than an exercise in electing a constituent assembly, Ebrahim said no. He says that, while the PAC will be asking voters for a mandate to write a new constitution, its manifesto will also focus on programmes to deliver on bread and butter issues. It will therefore reflect issues such as the PAC's economic policy. While the manifesto will contain more than just constitutional matters relevant to a mandate for a constituent assembly, Ebrahim maintains that the PAC's goal is not government office but seats in a constituent assembly. He is cagey about PAC participation in a GNU if it wins a substantial majority. He argues that this will partly be determined by how long it takes to draw up the constitution, which in turn will depend on the outcome of the election. "It is possible that the constitution could be drawn up in six weeks if the elections deliver a decisive majority to any one party. But, even if there are many parties with a more or less equal distribution of the vote, the election will ensure that no party will be in a position to make exaggerated demands. If, for example, a party wins 10 percent of the vote, it cannot demand 90 percent of the vote in determining the form of the constitution -- so it brings reality to the negotiations process in terms of what is attainable." Ebrahim argues that if parties emerge from the elections without any one group enjoying a significant majority, the constitution- making process could take a long time. "But, assuming the PAC wins a significant majority and we are able to draw up a constitution within six weeks, then we must decide whether we will still be governed by an interim constitution for another five years thereafter. "It is possible," Ebrahim argues, "that the new constitution will demand that we have an election after six months. Then there will be need to continue with the GNU." The other option for the PAC, if it does not obtain an absolute majority, is to remain outside of the GNU as an opposition. Ebrahim would not say whether it would then function as a parliamentary resistance opposition. That would depend on how the party is treated by the GNU, he says. "It is not prudent for the PAC to say how it will function in the post-April election period before the outcome of the election," says Ebrahim. What is certain is that, if the PAC wins a majority and is able to, together with minority parties, write up a new constitution, it will ignore what it says is a deal between the NP and the ANC to run the country through a government of national unity.
