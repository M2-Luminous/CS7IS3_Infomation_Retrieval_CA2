[Turadzhonzoda] We are grateful to Russian diplomats for their efforts in preparing talks. I think that Russia has realized its responsibility and its place in regional policy. We have always been and remain advocates of close and friendly relations with Russia. We are together with democrats of Russia, together with those who campaign for the observance of human rights and the rights of nations to self-determination. We are especially pleased at the visit of Anatoliy Adamishin, with whom we have struck understanding on many questions. Distressing is the position of the Russian military, which does not want a peaceful resolution of the conflict; this is attested to by the threats of punitive operations against residents of the Garm group of rayons and against refugees in Afghanistan. [Panfilov] What conditions do you set for holding talks in Moscow? [Turadzhonzoda] First and foremost are guarantees of security for participants in the talks, as well as for their relations who are on the territory of Tajikistan and in CIS countries. The ruling out of all pressure on the negotiating process from whichever side. Especially, the cutting short of attempts to scuttle the talks on the part of the joint command of the military contingent stationed in Tajikistan, as well as holding no exercises in the "Tigrovaya Balka" nature preserve, and actions against residents of the Garm group of rayons and refugees in Afghanistan. [interview ends] In line with the agreement, taking part in the talks will be six persons on each side -- the opposition and the present authorities in Tajikistan. It is so far unknown whether Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzoda and, from the opposition, Mukhammadsharif Khimmatozoda, chairman of the Islamic Party of Revival, will come along. The others will be from the so-called moderate opposition. The government group's composition is still unknown. [passage omitted]
