Gerasimov, A.D. Kachan, Belarus Republic Power Industry Ministry and Belarussian State Polytechnic Academy; UDC 621.438.313] [Abstract] An acute shortage of installed capacity coupled with the obsolescence and wear of thermal power plant equipment as well as a sharp rise in energy prices and increasing reliance on Russian natural gas prompted the Belarussian power industry to search for ways of increasing the utilization efficiency of gas by using waste heat recovery gas turbine plants (UGTU) and binary steam gas plants. The factors which affect possible fuel savings and the criteria for correct selection of the type of power plants are outlined. A formula for calculating the equivalent fuel economy is derived. An analysis shows that the greatest fuel economy can be achieved by using extraction (heat supply) gas turbine plants (GTU) and steam gas plants and that fuel savings can be increased further by using binary extraction gas turbine plants with backpressure turbines. The urgency of implementing low-power extraction turbine-based gas turbine and steam gas plants is stressed, and it is noted that such low-power plants can be brought on stream much faster than powerful plants.
