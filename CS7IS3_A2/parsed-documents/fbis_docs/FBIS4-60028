FBIS4-60028 "drnes098_a_94002" FBIS-NES-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 ARAB AFRICA Algeria Zeroual Reportedly Giving Up Contacts With FIS Zeroual Reportedly Giving Up Contacts With FIS LD1905135994 Rabat MAP in English 1334 GMT 19 May 94 LD1905135994 Rabat MAP English BFN [Excerpts] Algiers, May 19 (MAP) -- The National Transition Council to act as a legislative body during the transition period in Algeria was officially instituted Wednesday. [passage omitted] The Algerian dailies of this Thursday [19 May] have all commented on the president's speech noting that he had deliberately avoided to speak of dialog with all parties `with none of them debarred'. For the dailies, President Zeroual has thus definitely given up the carrying on of contacts with the leaders of the banned `Islamic Salvation Front' (FIS) to find a political solution to the Algerian crisis. The National Transition Council is made up of 178 members including 12 women. The members are representing about 30 small political parties in addition to the moderate Islamist party `HAMAS' [Islamic Society Movement] (63 seats), state institutions (30 seats) and economic and social organisations (85 seats). 27 seats are still vacant in the prospect that they will be occupied by the major political parties such as the National Liberation Front (FLN/former single party), the Front of Socialist Forces (FFS of Hocine Ait Ahmed) and the Islamic Renaissance Movement (Ennahda) that decided to boycott the council.
