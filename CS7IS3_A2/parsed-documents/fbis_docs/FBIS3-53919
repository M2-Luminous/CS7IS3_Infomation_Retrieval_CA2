In their resignation letters, the officers said they rejected a new escalation of war in the south and a government plan to send a military expedition to the south comprising nationalist officers who are not affiliated with the National Islamic Front. The plan is seen as a government attempt to liquidate these officers in war. The "Brothers" learned that the commander in chief has not yet replied to the resignations, both because the Army needs the officers' expertise and because there is no cash to pay the allowance to which they would be entitled.
