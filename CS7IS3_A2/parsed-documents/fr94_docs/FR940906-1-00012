FR940906-1-00012 FR940906-1-00006 New §103.22, headed ``Procedure in the event of a demand for Customs information in any federal, state, or local civil proceeding,'' is in eight paragraphs ((a) through (h)). Paragraph (a) generally prohibits the production or disclosure of Customs documents or testimony by employees in Federal proceedings or State or local civil proceedings, absent the prior approval of the Chief Counsel's Office. Paragraph (b) requires Customs employees to report a demand for information under these regulations to the Regional or District Counsel, or to the Office of the Chief Counsel, depending on the employee's location, and then await instructions. Paragraph (c) requires that parties seeking Customs documents or testimony provide an affidavit (or, if an affidavit is not feasible, a statement) to Customs summarizing the information sought and its relevance to the proceeding in question. Paragraph (c) also restricts disclosure of Customs information to the scope of the demand and authorizes Chief Counsel to waive the foregoing requirements for cause shown. Paragraph (d) requires service of the affidavit (or statement) at least five working days prior to the scheduled date of the requested disclosure. Paragraph (e) provides that Chief Counsel shall immediately upon receipt of the affidavit (or statement) advise the official in charge of the Office or Division of the employee on whom process was served. Paragraph (f) sets forth the conditions for authorizing the disclosure of Customs information. Paragraph (g) provides that Chief Counsel will authorize the disclosure of Customs information, after any necessary consultation with the originating component and such efforts to limit disclosure as are in accordance with the factors specified in §103.23. New §103.23, headed ``Factors in determining whether to disclose information pursuant to a demand'', is in two paragraphs. Paragraph (a) requires Chief Counsel to consider the applicable rules of procedure and substantive law of privilege in deciding whether to make disclosures. The regulation adopts a general approach instead of detailing a list of specific considerations because the application of rules of procedure and the substantive law concerning privilege may vary according to the nature of the demand. Paragraph (b), however, specifically identifies certain circumstances in which disclosure of Customs information will not be authorized. These circumstances, in essence, identify several areas of privilege or legally prohibited, restricted, or discretionary disclosure that are most relevant to Customs operations. They are intended to be compatible with the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b), the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and other treaties, statutes, and applicable rules of procedure. These standards are generally consistent and parallel with those issued under analogous Department of Justice regulations. New §103.24, headed ``Procedure in the event a decision concerning a demand is not made prior to the time a response to the demand is required'', provides that when a response is required before appropriate subpoena instructions have been received from Chief Counsel, the U.S. Attorney, his/her assistant, or other appropriate legal representative, shall be requested to appear with the employee upon whom demand has been made. Such legal representative shall then furnish the court with a copy of the regulations and request a stay of the demand, pending receipt of the instructions. This section parallels the Department of Justice regulations. New §103.25, headed ``Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling'', provides that when a court does not grant a stay as requested under the preceding section, the employee shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand. This section again parallels the Department of Justice regulations. New §103.26, headed ``Procedure in the event of a demand for Customs information in a state or local criminal proceeding'', provides that Customs Regional Commissioners, special agents in charge, and chiefs of field laboratories may authorize employees under their supervision to attend trials and administrative hearings in state or local criminal cases to produce records and testify as to facts in their knowledge in their official capacities on behalf of the government. However, in the event that a defendant requests or demands testimony, document production, or information, Chief Counsel authorization is required as under this subpart. This section thus clarifies circumstances relating to requests in state and local proceedings in which Chief Counsel authorization is necessary. New §103.27, headed ``Procedure in the event of a demand for Customs information in a foreign proceeding where Customs is not a party'', is in five paragraphs ((a) through (e)). Paragraph (a) requires Chief Counsel authorization, as described in paragraph (b), prior to disclosure of documents or information, or the giving of testimony in response to a demand or request in a foreign proceeding in which Customs is not a party. Paragraph (b) requires Customs employees receiving such demands concerning pre-clearance activities, if in the field, to notify immediately the Regional or District Counsel for the region or district having jurisdiction over the pre-clearance location. In connection with all other demands, they are to notify immediately the Office of the Chief Counsel. The employee shall then await appropriate subpoena instructions from the office so notified. This paragraph provides procedural clarification not provided in the current regulations. Paragraph (c) requires Chief Counsel to immediately acknowledge receipt of a demand to the Customs official in charge of the office or division of Customs_collectively referred to as the ``originating component''_that employs or employed the person concerned, as a measure to enhance government efficiency in processing such demands. Paragraph (d) provides for the authorization of disclosure where the originating component has no objection and where disclosure is otherwise appropriate within the terms of §103.23. These procedures protect Customs interests while facilitating international cooperation in judicial proceedings. Paragraph (e) additionally provides that, in cases where the information requested is related to Customs litigation or investigation, Chief Counsel will seek to limit the demands through negotiation.
