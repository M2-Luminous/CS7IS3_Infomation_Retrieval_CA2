The Constitution itself and the packages of presidential economic edicts that were signed last week provide the legislative preconditions for this. "The crisis has peaked," V. Chernomyrdin pointed out. The government's task in 1995-1997 should be to definitively improve the economic situation; that is, bring reform into the sphere of production. However, a base for this has already been prepared. This is illustrated by the figures for the growth in production and the emergent stabilization of the ruble (in particular, the gradual reduction in inflation rates and the reduction in Central Bank refinancing rates, the prime minister said. According to V. Chernomyrdin, Russia's regions have always acted as the motive force of reform. That is why the conference with their leaders is devoted to examining such issues as measures to complete check privatization and also to discussing the Program for the Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises After 1 July 1994 and the new Russian Federation Land Code. The voucher as a means of payment will disappear into oblivion after 30 June this year -- the end of the first phase of check privatization -- Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed. Despite some complacency at local level, the prime minister noted in his speech, privatization checks' period of validity will not be extended. Today it is necessary to structure work in the localities so as to ensure that there are as few checks left as possible -- as souvenirs. During the new post-check phase, the head of the Russian Government noted, investment will resolve everything. Viktor Chernomyrdin described as unviable some regions' requests for special rules of privatization for themselves. The transfer of Russian state property into private hands will proceed within a single, indivisible legislative area. What is more, in order to prevent possible abuse, state bodies' supervision of privatization for money will be stepped up, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed in particular. It was noted at the conference that the check phase of privatization has by and large been successful. There have generally been no problems in those areas where the local authorities have taken a serious approach to the work. However, there are regions where the population still has a considerable number of unredeemed privatization checks on its hands. In some areas there are objective difficulties, for instance, in the North Caucasus. In Moscow privatization has effectively been suspended by decision of the local government. Leaders in Kemerovo, Ulyanovsk, and a number of other oblasts and Khabarovsk and Maritime Krays hoped that the government would ultimately find a way of "soaking up" citizens' privatization checks that have not been redeemed through the fault of the local administrations. These leaders will have to resolve the possible ensuing social conflicts themselves. At the same time those regions where privatization has been protracted for objective reasons will be offered assistance in the final stage, primarily by broadening opportunities for vouchers to be exchanged for investment fund shares. The conference also discussed the program for the next phase of privatization. It has been formulated with consideration for proposals from the regions and has absorbed all the best of what has been tested at local level. In this respect Moscow, Nizhniy Novgorod, Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk, and Yaroslavl Oblasts are working creatively. People there are not waiting for instructions from the center on everything but are seeking their own solutions on questions pertaining to the management of property, the allocation of funds from privatization, and the acceleration of privatization processes. The new program takes into consideration the regions' main complaints. They related primarily to understated property valuations, low revenue from privatization, overly large concessions for labor collectives. During the second phase privatization will be implemented solely in return for money. The estimated cost of facilities undergoing privatization will rise tens of times. In terms of the amount of property to be privatized the second phase of privatization is comparable to the first. The fate of both major industrial enterprises and facilities in municipal ownership will be decided during this phase.
