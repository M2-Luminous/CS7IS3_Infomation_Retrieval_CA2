After a thorough debate, the cabinet ratified this investment bill which has eight chapters and 26 articles. The cabinet commended the experts for skillfully drafting the bill which has contents suitable for the urgent requirements of the nation and domestic and foreign investment. The cabinet paid attention to discussing and improving the draft to attract investments to the KOC, thus creating and increasing jobs for the people and enhancing the production in the following domains: I. Concerning Chapter II dealing with the Cambodian Development Council [CDC], the cabinet unanimously regarded the CDC as the general staff of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] in investment work and the competent body which has sole access to the issuance of investment permits. At the same time, the cabinet agreed on the protection of investors' rights and freedoms. The arrangement, function, and composition of the CDC will be set by a sub-decree. II. Concerning Chapter III dealing with the investment guarantees, the RGC recognizes all investors equally, that is, there will be no discrimination based on their nationality and race. The RGC guarantees that it will not nationalize the assets of the investors and ensures that it will not control prices of products and services, except for public services and provisions in the books of charge, and will permit the right to purchase and transfer foreign currencies. III. Concerning Chapter IV dealing with the incentives for investment, the priority domains to be encouraged are as follows: 1. Modern or high-technology industries. 2. Investment projects that are labor intensive, including those in tourism, the industries, and agriculture. 3. Projects to enhance the export or production of import- substitutes, agro-industrial projects, and projects in the processing industry. 4. Projects for the development of the provinces and countryside, the physical infrastructure, and the sustainable energy production located in special development zones. Tax and duty incentives are as follows: A corporate tax rate of nine percent; a corporate tax holiday of up to eight years depending on the characteristics of each investment project, whose order of priority will be determined by the RGC in a sub-decree; tax exemption on all reinvested profits; 100-percent tax exemption on goods for export; 100-percent tax exemption on the import of goods to serve investments, to serve projects whose 80 percent of their production is exported, to serve projects in the tourist industry, labor-intensive industry, processing industry, agro-industry, or projects located in the special industrial zones; and permission to bring into the kingdom foreign supervisors, specialists, technicians, specialized workers, and their dependents in line with the KOC's immigration law. IV. Concerning Chapter V dealing with ownership and use of land, in keeping with the Constitution there is no problem of land ownership for investors who are either physical or juristic persons with Cambodian nationality (meaning, those with more than 50 percent of their gross capitals belonging to Cambodians). As for foreign physical and juristic persons, they are allowed to use land through a long-term lease of up to 70 years. This land use, including all the rights of land ownership, must be implemented in accordance with the law. V. Also on that occasion, the cabinet agreed that individual disputes will be settled first by the CDC before being forwarded to court. Also, any disputes with the authorities concerned will be sent to ICSID [International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes]. The implementation of this investment law will be based on the publication of several subsequent royal decrees, sub-decrees, and regulations. However, this law will not affect investors who have been operating before it takes effect. The cabinet ended its session at 2000 in an atmosphere of unity and with high sense of responsibility.
