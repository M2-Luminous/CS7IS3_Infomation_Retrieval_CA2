Rolf-Dietrich Schwartz, Bonn correspondent of the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU, asked SPD economic expert Uwe Jens how the plans of the party's top people can be fulfilled "without making any promises that cannot be kept." [Schwartz] Mr. Jens, you have difficulties in your own ranks with an initiative of the parliamentary group for more growth and employment. Why are there suddenly doubts about these classic demands of your party? [Jens] I am certainly in agreement with the basic position of the party leaders that we should promise only what we can pay for. My motion, which is also supported by the financial, social, and economic politicians of my parliamentary group, is now held up in the SPD presidium and hopefully it can soon be debated once again in the parliamentary group. I am very much in favor of cooperation between the parliamentary group and the party, but naturally we must not let things get too bogged down. There is a need for discussion, because the fight against unemployment costs something. But we have also made some proposals on financing, among other things, the elimination of tax subsidies and the reduction of administrative hierarchies. [Schwartz] Put simply: Would your party leaders have preferred to see the experts of your parliamentary group also suspend their work until the elections? [Jens] Naturally I hope not. My economic motion was intended to force the Bundestag into a comprehensive debate. It is, after all, a specific formulation of our resolutions at the party congress. It aims at a national employment pact involving consolidation of state finances and lowering of the short-term Bundesbank interest rates, in which the parties in wage agreements would have to be satisfied with securing their real wages over a long time. It also includes an innovation offensive with favorable loans or subsidies for an ecological renewal of our national economy. Key words: development of remote heating and linkage with power plants. Support must be given to mid-level enterprises and to the provision of more risk capital. So there is enough for us to do when we form the government with our superior alternatives. [Schwartz] Can that work without a specific financial framework for your extensive demands at the party congress? [Jens] I am certainly in favor of us giving careful thought to how we can finance everything. Naturally an opposition cannot do that to the penny but it can do it in broad outlines as in my motion. Seen in macroeconomic terms, much pays for itself, as in the ecological renewal of our national economy, in which the stresses on the environment are to be made more costly through taxation and hence labor less expensive through the reduction of the supplemental wage costs. [Schwartz] What do you say about the latest ideas in your party about using special-purpose loans to finance specific projects? [Jens] I think that debt pots--and they also include loans of the most diverse kinds--to finance our tasks are virtually out of the question. Even now, if we include all secondary public budgets, we have a national debt amounting to about 66 percent of the gross national product. But only 60 percent would be permitted under the Maastricht stability criteria for entering the third stage of the European Monetary Union. In addition, rising state debt would only drive interest rates higher. [Schwartz] So what remains for a serious opposition party with respect to latitude to finance its demands? [Jens] There are only four possibilities: cuts in public and above all consumptive expenditures; tax increases; more debt; and more economic growth, the source of higher tax receipts. Thus, we must do everything we can to increase the size of the cake that can be divided up. That is the objective of all of our measures, which would therefore partially finance themselves. But naturally we must also give thought to a clear restriction of increases in public expenditures. There is also the introduction of the solidarity contribution that has already been decided by the Federal Government, from which small and medium incomes must be excluded, however. Not to be forgotten are the many tax loopholes, which must finally be plugged through more effective control. After all, it must not happen that individual federal laender are already using the argument of somewhat laxer taxation to attract enterprises. I say that the control of the revenue offices must be just as strict in southern Germany as in the north or the central part of our country.
