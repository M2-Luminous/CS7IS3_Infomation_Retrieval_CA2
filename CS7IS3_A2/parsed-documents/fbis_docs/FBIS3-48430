The January issue of the Peruvian paper VIDA EMPRESARIAL in an article headlined "DPRK Calls For General and Complete Nuclear Disarmament" pointed out that the alleged nuclear development and nuclear issue of North Korea were invented by the United States and the South Korean authorities in a bid to isolate and stifle the socialist system of Korea, leaving the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons in South Korea intact. Pressure or international sanctions have no effect, the paper said, stressing "Nuclear Issue of the Korean Peninsula Should Be Solved Through the DPRK-U.S. Talks." Count-down, a mouthpiece of the Japanese society of the participants in the international solidarity march movement for supporting Korea's reunification, said the only way of resolving the nuclear issue involving the possibility to plunge the Korean peninsula into the horrors of war is to make the DPRK-U.S. talks successful. The key to it is the solution in a package deal proposed by the DPRK, said the paper. The Vietnamese paper PEOPLE'S ARMY January 12 said the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is a delicate problem affecting the peace and stability of Asia and the rest of the world. It called for an impartial solution to the issue.
