Speaking in Yerevan on Monday Kazimirov said that the talks "are routine consultations which have no sensations or special turns". The envoy rejected the idea that contacts with Turkey and Iran "create a new format for talks in the regional aspect". He said his recent trip to Tehran and the upcoming visit to Ankara are made in return to the talks of diplomats of the two countries recently held in Moscow. Kazimirov recalled that combat activities had been held right on the Iranian border with Azerbaijan going along the Arax river. He said this was a "very aggravating circumstance" which can make the conflict spread to other countries. "that is why the position of iran is an important factor and we take it into consideration", the envoy stressed.
