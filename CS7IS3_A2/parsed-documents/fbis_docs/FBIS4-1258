With regard to the legislative elections, the party receiving the second highest vote total should have ministerial representation in government. The Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] has said that it does not plan any type of interparty government, but it stresses that the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] had rejected such a political solution as far back as 1984, after the Nkomati Accord was signed. "I have not yet presented this proposal to my brother, President Chissano, but that is my dream, and I have already talked about it with diplomats. Many people ask: What does the president dream, and I say that is the dream I have, not because the country is completely ravaged, but rather because in Africa it is very difficult to find victors and vanquished working together in the first years after elections," Afonso Dhlakama said. According to the Renamo leader, "the party (candidate) that comes second ought to be appointed vice president of the Republic and, in terms of government itself, the party that comes second should also have some ministers in it. That is the government I dream of." These and other details concerning a proposed government of national unity, GNU, were not discussed when Chissano and Dhlakama met last week, but the Renamo leader says that "some diplomats with whom I have met have talked a great deal about it." In his meeting with the president of the Republic, "we discussed the GNU issue, but there was no agreement. I simply told him that all wars in Mozambique have had their own histories: The war against Portuguese colonialism had its history, Renamo's war for democracy had its history, and democracy itself will have its history." As the Renamo leader explained, this means that "the party which wins the first multiparty elections in this country must not seek to govern alone, so as to avoid attacks, acts of revenge, and so forth." Renamo leader Dhlakama added: "I have said before that we must make use of experiences of others, because any democracy has its own history. We do not believe that Frelimo, Renamo, the Mozambique Democratic Party (Pademo), or the Mozambican National Union (Unamo) can govern the country alone. With those conditions in mind, if we look at the history of the United States, or of Portugal, we will see that in Portugal 16 governments fell in the wake of the 25 April 1974 revolution, after which the Portuguese learned their lesson. So we cannot just proceed to copy what the Americans or the Italians are doing today." An African diplomat who noted that it was strange that democracy should be demanded for Africa said: "It is immediately clear that it is not Dhlakama's idea. When the moment of truth comes, people turn around and say that Africa is not ready for democracy, so they start coming up with any number of formulas to alter the people's wishes, the outcome of the vote. Elections should be held for useful purposes. They should not be held for nothing, as though no elections had taken place. If elections are held simply for there to be no difference between victors and vanquished, then you might as well save millions upon millions of dollars and spend them more wisely on rebuilding our nations." Afonso Dhlakama also said that he will compete in the presidential elections, should the Renamo special congress endorse his candidacy. He added that, if he were to win, "I shall indeed be president of the Republic, no matter what my previous experience. The decision will be the people's, and I am going to present my government program to the country." (In Maringue a few days later, the Renamo special congress confirmed him as Renamo's candidate in the upcoming presidential elections). The Renamo leader believes that 12 or 20 parties can govern the country together during the first five years after elections, "learning, being courageous, agreeing to being self-critical, and all the rest. In the next election, five years hence -- that is when there should be victors, and the vanquished will join the opposition and will not touch the government." Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana reacted on behalf of the government: "That there should be neither victors nor vanquished was a phrase we used, from a military viewpoint, to say that war produces neither. That was said in terms of the General Peace Accord about the end of the war. In terms of political governance, though, we said there should be a multiparty system and elections. Thus, elections must produce a winner." Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana disclosed that, in the wake of the Nkomati Peace Accord between Mozambique and South Africa in 1984, the Mozambican Government had held Pretoria-mediated talks with Renamo. There was the admission at those talks that the war might be settled with political accommodation for Renamo. The South African Government even proposed the opening of schools to train Renamo members in the border areas of Namaacha and Milange. "It was in that spirit that the famous Pretoria Declaration was made in October 1984, with great protocol and pomp, but then Renamo pulled out and reneged on what it had signed. There was the famous phone call to [late Renamo member] Mr. Evo Fernandes, who pulled out of that plan. Political accommodation for Renamo was the plan, meaning a cessation to the war and reintegration, which would naturally have led to a Frelimo-Renamo government, but Renamo rejected it in full," Minister Teodato Hunguana said. He also revealed that later, well before the Rome peace talks had begun, the government took up once again the proposal to reintegrate Renamo. That proposal, meanwhile, had been rejected by Renamo, which demanded a multiparty system and elections as the only way to settle the problem. The government's position continues to be that the party that wins elections has the responsibility to find solutions that will guarantee peace, stability, and a balanced government in the country, but, in Teodato Hunguana's words, the winning party must not be told what or what not to do. He added that "we can defend our ideas. We are free to do so, but no one should ever defend his ideas by resorting to the blackmail of warfare, armed violence, or the threat of armed violence to try to get others to agree." Hunguana described the Renamo leader's demands as predating the Rome talks and added that he was not clear about the GNU concept. He said, however: "Let there be no confusion. Neither Frelimo nor the government are saying that they are brushing aside any type of interparty government. Such a government could very well result from the search for correct solutions. It is perfectly imaginable that as a result of the elections a government will be formed that will reflect such tendencies, but that will not be an automatic development." The labor minister described as strange Afonso Dhlakama's idea that the vice president should come from the party receiving the second highest vote total, because that is not written into the Constitution. He affirmed, however, that a political argument -- rather than a legal one -- could be used, as long as it also recognized the problem of proportion: A party can come second with 40 percent of the vote and a party can come second with 5 percent.
