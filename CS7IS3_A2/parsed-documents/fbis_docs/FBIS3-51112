As announced, we have on our Open Agenda program today Comrade Pedro Ross, a member of the Politburo and secretary general of the CTC [Cuban Workers Federation]. I should say that we contacted Comrade Ross by phone at noon yesterday, Monday, 10 January, while he was in Pinar del Rio on a work visit. That is how we came to invite him to appear on this program today, so we could have a talk in front of the cameras with a view to informing the public. Before beginning this conversation, I would like to recall a number of figures and reflections on the nation's financial situation: At the last ordinary session of our national assembly, our parliament, the sector minister, Comrade Jose Luis Rodriguez [minister president, State Committee for Finance], presented a list of indicators, illustrative of the tight situation our national economy is in. Of these indicators, I wish to mention only three, to serve as a reminder to our entire population. The excess currency circulating in the country at the present time is the equivalent of 14 months' salary: that is, slightly over 12 billion pesos. The state budget deficit comes to 4.6 billion. Subsidies to the sugar agroindustry in the past three years come to 7.2 billion pesos. To this I would like to add that only 30 percent of state enterprises are at the present time (?profitable). The country must obviously reverse this financial situation, the causes of which are well known to our entire population. I am talking about both national and international causes. At this same assembly session we are talking about, our commander in chief directed that our entire population be made aware of this financial situation and actively participate in the discussion and analysis, and make proposals with regard to the group -- or as he put it, the arsenal -- of measures aimed at restructuring [sanear] our economy. We think it is precisely the CTC that has taken the first step in this direction, by calling for, in the name of the parliament and at the work centers, an interesting process of analyzing our financial situation. Ross, precisely how will this process of analysis take place, throughout Cuba? [Ross] Well, Resillez, this way: Heeding the exhortation by our commander in chief to first reflect with the workers, with our entire people, before adopting the measures that were discussed in our parliament, we have called for a process of holding assemblies with all the nation's workers. This process begins with preparing the union cadres, from the professional cadres and the cadres at the national level, to the base-level cadres. We have over 400,000 union leaders in Cuba, and this process of preparing the union cadres [words indistinct] is going to serve to get the union leaders' opinions on these matters. It is not going to be a seminar in which the union leaders are going to passively receive our suggestions. Rather, it is going to be a dialogue, a discussion of all these matters with union leaders: provincial- and municipal-level leaders, leaders from work centers, (?from various sectors) -- however it is most feasible to organize it. We are going to discuss these subjects, placing at the center of the discussions the problems of the work centers -- that is, what goes on there, what can be done at the work center -- because the basic solutions to our problems lie in the efficiency we may be able to attain in the production process, or in any services we may provide, or export. Therefore, the center, the main aspect of this process, is going to be directed toward that, toward analyzing how the workers at their work centers can contribute to streamlining and revitalizing the nation's economy, by working more efficiently, making better use of material and human resources, increasing efficiency, and improving the quality of work. [Resillez] Pedro, but, at these assemblies, these meetings with the union leaders, obviously the group of additional measures -- which fall somewhere outside the framework of the work center -- will also be broached. [Ross] Indeed, but one must (?bear in mind the extent to which) the subject has already been broached at the work center -- which, I reiterate, is fundamental. So we are going to see what ideas the union leaders have in this case, in this first phase, about how to solve the problems we have with internal finances; what measures can be applied to effect this restructuring [saneamiento]. For example, subjects that appeared in yesterday's editorial of the newspaper TRABAJADORES are going to be discussed. The questions to which we want the workers to provide answers during these upcoming discussions are there. [Resillez] I see. Now Comrade Ross, parallel to this process with the union leaders -- some 400,000 nationwide, as you pointed out -- I know that direct assemblies are also being held at the work centers. We were saying specifically at the beginning of the program that you were at two work centers involved in this activity in Pinar del Rio. What happened there, at those work centers? [Ross] Well, at those work centers, we tried to set up the initial experiences because indeed as you say, in parallel, we are to try this out at selected work centers throughout Cuba, so that by the time we conclude the process with the union cadres, we will have already had experience in making direct contact with the workers. The experience we had in Pinar del Rio was a very interesting one. There was a very rich, very broad, very open discussion of problems specific to these two work centers. One was a food industry center that produces for export. That center was, precisely, a center that was profitable until 1992. In 1993, it became unprofitable: that is, the cost per peso [value of goods produced] rose to 1.24 pesos. We sought to learn the reason for this from the workers at this center, which is a magnificent work center. They had well identified the reasons the cost per peso had risen. Up to 1992, that cost had been 95 cents. What happened was that the center had been sent a piece of equipment that the workers had had to rebuild in order to get it operational. It was a piece of machinery that had been discontinued. This caused them to have to devote resources that had not been planned for to rebuilding the piece of machinery. Because of this, a segment of the production process was paralyzed, causing costs to rise despite great effort by the workers. Now I can tell you that already in the early days of January 1994, the cost per peso of production at this work center comes out to 1.07; and they think they can bring production costs down to below one peso during this current month of January. That was La Primavera work center. A set of ideas as to how to reduce costs, how to achieve this, emerged there. These ideas were well defined and I am certain that that work group is going to achieve it. A very interesting thing: La Primavera is a work group designed to consist of 111 people, but has been operating with 85 workers, 90 at most. They have reduced the indirect-labor personnel. They recommended a continuing reduction of indirect-labor personnel -- the CBP's [not further identified], for example. There are four CBP's and a head of security for a center with 90 workers. So it became clear, the centers' workers and administration both realized, that this has to be further reduced because it has a big effect. There were nine CBP slots in the original personnel roster for that center, which was originally for a total of 111. [Resillez] Pedro, at these assemblies that were, as you say, sort of pilot assemblies in Pinar del Rio, as well as at others that are going to take place [words indistinct] also talk [word or words indistinct] measures of another kind? [Ross] Yes, of course. After the matter of what to do at that work center to increase efficiency, because it is a center that has raw materials and everything guaranteed, the measures the workers think should be adopted to streamline finances and to move the economy forward were analyzed. The problem of prices, of the cost-free status of certain things, was discussed there. Proposals to see if the price of electricity could be raised were made for the country to analyze. Assessment was discussed -- charging for housing according to assets and earnings. Charging for certain entertainments that are currently cost-free, such as sports and cultural events, was discussed. Also discussed was the advisability of creating a "bond of the fatherland," of lending the fatherland money, of our population making a loan to the nation: bonds that could be bought without interest, to be cashed in five or ten years; bonds that could be bought at a certain below- market interest rate, to be cashed in five or ten years; and bonds that citizens could buy with no intention of cashing them in. That is, there would be... [rephrases] they proposed various ways in which this could be done. [Resillez] Yes. [Ross] There were various proposals. For example, light was cast there... [changes thought] because it seems there is the idea, some people have gotten the idea that to change the currency would be very costly and would not solve any problems. Nevertheless, it was made clear, there, that, technically, that there is the possibility of doing that without much cost. So, what did the workers ask, based on that clarification? And what will be... [rephrases] what kind of situation will those workers with lower incomes find themselves in, because they also believe that workers with lower incomes, who practically live from day to day, could be hurt [words indistinct]. It was explained that that is not the way it is, that no one [words indistinct] change, he who obtained his money in an honorable way will have no problem whatsoever (?as regards) his money. There the workers came out in favor of mechanisms that will permit recovery of the money that has been acquired dishonestly. That was a very strong opinion at both assemblies. The other assembly was at a fishing center, and this idea -- of how to block the path of wheeler-dealers [macetas] -- not just how to recover the money, but how to avoid their proliferation. [sentence as heard] We suggested that the way to prevent action by these people, who make money off the needs of our people, is to get out of this situation. [Resillez] Pedro, let me tell you about an idea that I have more or less been formulating as I listen to you. This massive process of consultation on the measures to clean up our internal financial situation reminds me to some extent of the process that took place some time ago, when the call to the Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba was issued. I remember that back then, thousands of people, thousands of comrades, thousands of Cubans, millions of us Cubans participated in numerous assemblies, where the opinions we all wanted to be taken before the Party Congress were collected. The CTC has today undertaken a process I would say is, though not identical, similar because of its scope and because of the way people want, in keeping with the commander in chief's guidance, for all of us to participate in understanding and to present our ideas in this regard. I think that 400,000 workers with different union responsibilities is a big number; moreover, I think the number of comrades who are going to participate in the second phase is far greater. Do we have any idea of how many comrades are going to participate, through this process at the work centers, which have come to be called "the parliament of the work centers," and how many assemblies are to be held nationwide? [Ross] Well, we calculate that over 80,000 assemblies will be held, and that over 3 million workers will participate in them. It is not a process by which people will gather together in one rushed meeting and raise their hands in support of a task. We would like the workers to first think about the measures that could be taken, about the significance of those measures; and we also want them to assume responsibility for those measures, because those measures also affect us all. All of us must make some sacrifice if we want any of these measures to be adopted... [changes thought] for example, at one of these centers, it was suggested that the prices of certain articles that are today subsidized should be increased. We explained that to do so meant a burden for the workers themselves. They assimilated this. They said there was no other way. This was much discussed. Certain people suggested -- for example, there at the fishing center -- that the prices of all goods except bread and milk should be raised. One worker said this. Another suggested... [rephrases] a female worker stated that medical services should be charged for. And we there seized the occasion to say that, well, there are medical services that the immense majority of the citizens cannot afford. Where is he who has a child who needs heart surgery, or who needs kidney surgery or who needs a transplant, going to get the U.S. $50,000 that any one of these operations costs? And, are we going to let him die? So then they said no. So. Also, we have to preserve this as one of the achievments our people have attained. But in order to preserve that attainment, we have to solve other problems that will permit us to preserve the achievement. And then the comrade said: No, it is better to increase the price of bread and milk, if need be, before charging for health care, or for education. Nevertheless, that was a reflection of the workers themselves. Made very agreeably. And it was a very profound reflection, too, because one can see that the workers are aware of what is being dealt with. Now they are beginning to become aware of the fact that what is being dealt with is they themselves, and therefore they take a stand. At these two work centers, the workers'sense of patriotism got to running very high. Very high. Because the proposals they made, aware of what it would mean to them, is what we hope happens at all the nation's work centers. [Resillez] Pedro, let me insist a bit on this thought that I expressed to you regarding how this process reminds me of the Fourth [Communist Party of Cuba] Congress, of the call to the Fourth Congress. Participation is, of course, important. It is requested. People are directed to participate, and the participation of many of us in these work meetings is desirable. But how are you planning to gather these opinions and have them circulate -- I mean, have them not just stay right there, at the assembly where they are expressed? [Ross] In the first place, there are many matters that are brought up during this process that have to be answered -- for the workers themselves, because they constitute questions, or doubts, or confusions that people sometimes have regarding a particular topic, or one thing or another. Erroneous interpretations in connection with a problem are also cleared up at these meetings. On the other hand, a document of what is put forth is being drawn up -- of what is proposed, of what each one of the workers brings up -- and all that is going to be summed up. Precisely, we are going to sum up this process with the union leaders on the 29th, at a plenum of the National Committee of the CTC, where they will be able to give their opinions. We are going to discuss the principal problems brought up during this first part of the process, so that we will already have an arsenal of ideas, an arsenal of how union leaders, all the way down to base-level, think, with which to tackle the bulk of the process, the remainder of the overall process. [Resillez] Which would begin when, Pedro? [Ross] It would begin right after the 29th, on the 30th. Although we are holding these pilot assemblies now. For example, tomorrow we are going to be at the La Corona Cigar Factory, here in Havana. It is going to be the first such assembly in the City of Havana and will serve as a model for the leaders who have to tackle this task here in the capital. The La Corona is a historic center, because it is there that Lazaro Pena worked and carried out his union work. That is where he learned. So, there will be answers for the workers. Whatever may be set forth in the most remote corner of the nation will be heard and taken into account. It will be taken into account. [Resillez] Let me tell you, Pedro, that many viewers have been calling in to ask questions. Some of these questions coincide with these that we have been talking about here; other questions from our television viewers stray, actually, from the center of the informational dialogue that we have proposed to hold with Comrade Ross. But I must say that this "Open Agenda" program, as well as the entire informational system of Cuban television, will discuss abundantly many of the aspects brought up by our television viewers. Moreover, if any comrade wishes to leave his name and address, as on other occasions, the CTC -- and Comrade Ross, personally -- are willing to provide the answers necessary to satisfy the comrade's questions. [Ross] Furthermore, we will be on [Radio] Progreso Saturday [15 January], at 0700, which... [Resillez, commenting while Ross is talking] The viewer can obtain information there too. [Ross] ...is on a topic broader than this one, not as specific as this one. [Resillez] Great! So then, Pedro, may I infer that the process of consultations that is, in fact, already underway at all work centers under the name "the parliament at the work centers" is an element fundamental to arriving at the next session of the assembly with a greater popular consensus -- a special session that is to be called in order to take up the matter of the nation's finances once again? [Ross] Exactly. By the time we come to this next session of the assembly, since the parliamentarians of the provinces...[corrects himself] the comrade deputies of the provinces where the process is going to be held are going to participate actively in [words indistinct] they are going to be able to participate, not just listen but also answer. They are going to be able to exchange ideas with the workers. This will be a way of giving continuity to the discussions that began in our legislature. [Resillez] At the end of December. [Ross] At the end of December. Exactly. [Resillez] On 28 January, the CTC celebrates its 55th anniversary. I must say that, in the last few weeks, like almost every Cuban who has had access to the newspaper TRABAJADORES, I have read and reread a group of editorials I consider very interesting, extremely interesting. These editorials set a standard, I would say; they outline tactics and strategy for the workers movement. I mean, for [words indistinct] in the present and immediate future. [Words indistinct] 55th anniversary of the CTC [words indistinct]. (?I ask you, as) secretary general of the CTC: What are the basic elements that should characterize the workers movement, at this historic moment in Cuba, on this 55th anniversary? [Ross] We have sought to have the union movement occupy, on this 55th anniversary, the place that befits it in this battle our population is waging -- because what it is a matter of; what is being defended, right now; what is at stake are the workers' vital interests. Therefore, we want the workers to be focused on defending those achievements that we have won throughout these past 35 years; on preserving [words indistinct] and of the power of the workers. It is a matter of giving continuity to the work of the Revolution. And in order to do that, we have to get out of this situation, save the Revolution, as has been stated. And it is the workers to whom the fundamental role falls, in that connection. Therefore, the 55th anniversary will be (?marked) [word indistinct] along that line. We are not going to celebrate any festivities. We have to concentrate on this. This is our fundamental task: to defend our present and to defend our future, the future of our children. That is what this is all about. And that is the discussion. The discussion also has to do with having the workers become aware of that. And I think that a very good ambience is being created at the work centers. The newspaper TRABAJADORES has contributed to this. [Resillez] I am convinced this is true, Comrade Ross; and I think that this process is also going to mark, like many another of our working class's initiatives, an important moment in the Revolution. [Ross] Yes, Resillez. Something we notice, among the workers, is that the workers are very sure that the Revolution is not going to abandon them, that the Revolution constitutes the guarantee of their interests. They are confident that no one is going to be left helpless in this country -- no one who needs help. [Resillez] Thank you very much, Comrade Ross, for your talk; for having responded positively to our invitation despite the short time between noon yesterday and today, and for this information that we have provided for the entire country regarding a topic that is truly hot. I must add that this topic will continue to be discussed in future editions of "Open Agenda," as well as in other spots in Cuban television's informational system. We would like to thank you, our viewers, for your attention, and we will see you again next Tuesday on "Open Agenda." Good night.
