Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo said the cooperation would focus mainly on research and studies of tropical forests such as rattan, bamboos, and rubber. Malaysia and Indonesia view the cooperation very important because they share common problems in dealing with anti- tropical wood campaigns by advanced countries, he said in Surabaya, East Java last night. Jamaludin and his Malaysian counterpart, Datuk Sri Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, attended a dinner hosted by East Java Governor Basofi Sudirman in conjunction with the annual meeting of 38 forest experts from the two countries which is due to last [to] tomorrow. Jamaludin said both sides would intensify information exchange on tropical forest development and management system in efforts to confront anti-tropical wood campaigns sponsored by industrialised countries. We share a common political will with Malaysia to counter those who accuse developing nations of uncontrolled exploitation of tropical woods, he said. Such accusations are unfounded, he said, adding that Indonesia has always maintained a strict policy on forest preservation. Jamaludin said Indonesia with a large area of tropical forests would be playing a key role among ASEAN countries to counter such campaigns. The four-day meeting in Surabaya is the sixth such annual gathering among experts of the two countries.
