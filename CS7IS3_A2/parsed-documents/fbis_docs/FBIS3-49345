It is Ladislav Pilz, whom we asked for an interview. [Zelenayova] In spite of the many objections to television being raised, the change at the post of the chief of news programs has come rather unexpectedly. How was your appointment to this post explained to you? [Pilz] Very simply. The previous chief, Mrs. Martina Kyselova, gave notice with effect from 31 December 1993. The Slovak Television management was looking for an adequate replacement. The fact that they chose me may have to do with the fact that I have been working in television for 21 years. First, for about two years, as a speaker, later as director of television news, and the past two years as deputy chief producer in the editorial office for sports. I know television inside out, and that was probably the main reason. [Zelenayova] How do you assess news programs, and what would you like to change? [Pilz] I assess them very critically. I think, first and foremost, that responsibility, decency, verification of information, the basic attributes of work in any genre--that is, not just when covering news--have disappeared from news programs. Although I do not like the term ethical self-regulation, the fact is that many people are lacking it. [Zelenayova] Do you think that you will be able to put things right? [Pilz] I have inherited a very young team of reporters. This team is very inexperienced but, on the other hand, also very adaptable. Slovak Television is short of the generation of middle-aged reporters. Even if they were tied to the former regime in any way, they were professionals who passed their experience on to the younger reporters, something we would need very badly now. Today's young reporters lack feedback and a certain control. Lack of concept is the prevailing feature. If you add to this indecent conduct, irresponsibility, and indifference, this cannot but find its reflection in television programs. [Zelenayova] The most frequently heard objections concern a lack of balance, particularly regarding the representation of political parties in broadcasts, but also the Slovak Television reporters' one-sided view of domestic political developments. What is your view of this problem? [Pilz] The shortcomings that I mentioned are, in fact, also the cause of the lack of balance to which you referred. There exist indications that some young reporters allow themselves to be carried away by some vision of a party or a movement, and that detachment or plurality are alien to them. I would like to create such an atmosphere that people will trust us. Today the situation is such that we are not trusted by politicians, fellow journalists, or viewers.... Not even teachers of Slovak trust us because 90 percent of the television staff speaks nonliterary Slovak. What will be the first step? If they want and are willing to raise their professionalism [as published]. But not tendentiously, opportunistically, and mendaciously. That is the only way to achieve that viewers will, perhaps, trust us. And that is work for several years.
