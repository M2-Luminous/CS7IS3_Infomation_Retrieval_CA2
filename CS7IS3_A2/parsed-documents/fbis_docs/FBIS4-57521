FBIS4-57521 "drlat098_a_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-098 Daily Report 21 May 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Journalists Discuss Mismanagement of UBPC's Journalists Discuss Mismanagement of UBPC's FL1905173094 FL1905173094 BFN [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 1600 GMT on 18 May carries the program Straight Talk featuring Osvaldo Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE and Eloy Concepcion of TRABAJADORES. The program focuses on the current degree of autonomy of the Basic Cooperative Production Units, or UBPC's. Rodriguez notes that autonomy is a much debated issue at the UBPC's, adding: "The enterprise often acts as if the UBPC were its subordinate, and the UBPC often acts as if it were indeed a subordinate of the enterprise." Concepcion says: "First, let us say that the word autonomy scares a lot of people in the enterprises, as well as comrades in the UBPC's." Concepcion adds that current Ministry of Agriculture structures have yet to match changes in policy regarding farming during the special period. Regarding the role of the state, Concepcion adds: "Right now, the state cannot let individuals produce whatever they want, whenever they choose, and distribute whatever they wish to whomever they wish." The speakers discuss the example of a UBPC that was ordered by the enterprise to plant yams, although it was not yam-planting season. This resulted in a lackluster crop, and the Cuban people ended up the losers. Concepcion says the enterprise should set a production plan for the UBPC in keeping with the government's interests, adding: "The enterprise should leave a large enough margin so that the UBPC can decide in what season and under what conditions crops are to be planted. The bureaucracy refuses to give up the power it possesses and that often, consciously or unconsciously, blocks the progress of the Revolution." Concepcion says there is conflict between the Ministry of Agriculture's enterprise system and the UBPC's on how to tackle food production problems. He stresses: "We have tried many formulas: cooperatives, large state enterprises. At the beginning of the Revolution, we had cooperatives, people's farms, etc., and the UBPC's are our last chance. Everyone must contribute to their success, since we are dealing with a most important issue: feeding the population." Rodriguez notes that frequently the bad is stressed, but, he asks, what about the good? Concepcion replies: "Not all the fault lies on the side of the enterprise system; there are comrades managing UBPC's who are also at fault." Concepcion says that highly positive results have been obtained by the UBPC's since their creation five and a half months ago and that he honestly believes that, within a year, the UBPC's will become self-sufficient in food. The speakers then discuss the fact that the work force is better distributed in the UBPC's. Nevertheless, more workers are needed throughout Cuba for agricultural activities. Concepcion says: "We are a country unable to produce yams and cassava. We have thousands of caballerias overgrown with weeds and we blame the problem on a lack of fuel and fertilizer. What we lack, to solve the food supply problem of the municipalities and the population, is self-respect. What we lack is self-respect and agricultural know-how. That is my opinion." Rodriguez reiterates that Cuban agriculture needs additional workers and notes that Cuba's alleged worker surplus could be assigned to agriculture. In this connection, Concepcion adds: "There is an accord, soon to be a year old, from the Politburo that states that the Ministry of Agriculture is to give small plots of fallow land to retirees. Why has the Ministry of Agriculture not given these people this land? Why the delay? This was a Politburo accord. It would have meant more food for the population." Rodriguez concludes: "Once more bureaucracy is acting against something as important as the UBPC's. Like you, however, I believe this process is continuing to make progress, and that the UBPC's will be a success."
