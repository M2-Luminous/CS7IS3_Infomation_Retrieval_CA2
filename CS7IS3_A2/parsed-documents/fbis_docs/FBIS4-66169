Article 4 of the Chinese Trademark Law states: "Enterprises, institutions, and self-employed workers and businessmen wishing to have rights to the exclusive use of trademarks for the commodities they are producing, manufacturing, processing, turning out by selection processes, or putting on the market for sale should apply to the Trademark Bureau for registration of the trademarks." As can be seen, the trademarks protected by the Chinese Trademark Law cannot be separated from commodities. That is, only trademarks for commodities are protected by the Trademark Law, while service marks are not. Of course, in actual practice, service-type enterprises that also produce and sell commodities sometimes may register their service marks as trademarks in the hope of getting legal protection. From the perspective of the Trademark Law, however, those service marks are protected simply because they are treated as trademarks. If someone uses a mark identical with or similar to the registered trademark as his or her own service mark, the act will not constitute an infringement, and the one who originally registered the trademark will have no right to ban such use or claim indemnity under the Trademark Law. In some countries, service marks are protected not only by the trademark law but also through the adoption of an anti-unethical competition law. The two kinds of protection differ from each other. Generally speaking, to be protected by the anti-unethical competition law, the service mark must be well-known to the public, and it is necessary to prove that use of the service mark by others would confuse the public and that such use has already occurred and constituted an act of unethical competition. The "Anti-Unethical Competition Law of the People's Republic of China" adopted on 2 September 1993 stresses the protection of trademarks but lacks explicit provisions on service mark protection. So we can say that now in our country service marks are neither protected by the Trademark Law nor safeguarded by the Anti-Unethical Competition Law as in some foreign countries. With the acceleration of China's market-oriented economic construction, the tertiary industry is playing an increasingly striking role in the whole national economy. Obviously, the pertinent laws and systems currently in effect in our country can no longer meet the needs of service mark protection. Now that more and more countries in the world are legally protecting service marks, we should lose no time in formulating our own laws and systems for this purpose. Based on the successful experience of most countries, we should, first of all, enlarge the scope of protection by our Trademark Law. Necessary provisions should be included in the Trademark Law so that it will protect service marks as well. By revising this law, we should establish a service mark registration system similar to the one for the registration of commodity marks. Since service mark registration has many unique problems that do not exist in the ordinary trademark protection system (such as the unit or individual with the right to use the service mark, the definition and scope of the service, the makeup of the service mark, and infringement on the service mark), an essential question to be studied in revising the Trademark Law is how to properly proceed with the legislation of service mark protection. Apart from this, we should consider adding a clear-cut provision on service mark protection to the Anti-Unethical Competition Law. This way we will not only be able to prevent unauthorized use of properly registered commercial marks, trade and service marks alike, but can also give them legal protection if the rightful interests are hurt through unethical competition, whether the marks have been registered or not. We will thus improve our legal system for service mark protection to meet the needs of our country's economic development and the program of reform and opening up.
