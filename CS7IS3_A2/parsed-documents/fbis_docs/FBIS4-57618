Radio Sandino's mobile unit had been setting up equipment to join the network at 1000, but the technicians received a last-minute order not to transmit. However, they were authorized to record the discussion held by Dr. Sergio Ramirez, FSLN directorate member Luis Carrion, and Commander Dora Maria Tellez. Before the panel discussion began, and as we monitored the FSLN radio station, we heard a Radio Sandino announcer tell the station's mobile unit to modulate the signal. Yesterday EL NUEVO DIARIO phoned Orlando Gomez, deputy director of Radio Sandino and one of the persons invited to the panel discussion, to ask him why the station had not broadcast the roundtable. A secretary said Gomez was not in his office. The time was a few minutes before noon. The mysterious order to leave out a Sandinist sector forced the rest of the radio stations to continue the network, which was then headed by Radio El Pensamiento. The station's broadcast was affected by a "strange" interference in the telephone line used for the transmission. Despite the mysterious order that silenced those who sponsor the renewal of Sandinism, the panel was broadcast by the following stations: Radio El Pensamiento, Radio Istmo, Radio Noticias, Radio Horizonte, Radio BB Stereo, Radio Fiesta, Radio America, Radio Stereo Sol, and Radio Universidad. Development of the Roundtable During the panel discussion, the first to be broadcast by a large number of radio stations and held only a few hours before the opening of the FSLN Special Congress, Commander Luis Carrion referred to the charges against Commander Henry Ruiz for accepting the nomination to the post of FSLN secretary general. "It seems there are some comrades who think this is a crime or a sin," Carrion noted, while saying that in the past "Modesto" [Ruiz] was accused of being a "leftist" by the same people who are now accusing him of being a right-winger. "I think that is the main reason why this candidacy has so much support in the FSLN ranks. People see this as an option for unity in the congress." Carrion indicated that a proposal began circulating this week and will be submitted to the congress to empower the Sandinist Assembly to appoint editorial boards for the Sandinist news media based on the one that emerged during an "ad hoc" assembly in Managua. He said that if this proposal is submitted, the congress must define which media are FSLN media. "At any rate, we will ask the congress to clearly establish which media are Sandinist media and which are not, because there is confusion about some of them. One example is Radio Ya, the status of which is not defined. Rather than serving as an open platform for all Sandinists who wish to express their views, it is used as a tool of currents that have excluded "everyone who doesn't think like them." FSLN's Behavior As Ramirez spoke about the FSLN's behavior, he discussed his party's previous ability to single-handedly control the armed institution, the government, and media organizations, but when the FSLN lost the 1990 elections, it continued to use the same methods it used as a clandestine party. The FSLN has had a hard time adjusting to being a civilian opposition party that lacks the basic components of power, so it must begin an intense campaign to recover power through the only means available; the elections. Sergio added: "I think the FSLN, as a political party with not only an outward intention of democracy but an internal democratic structure, must successfully face the challenge of the 1996 elections." He also added that his party must definitively end the hierarchical command structure. "I am not interested in discussing whether that method was necessary in the past," he added. Good-Bye to Vanguardism Sergio said the FSLN can no longer call itself the "Nicaraguan Vanguard" because it makes no sense. It made sense during the armed conflict when people had to be led to an uprising. Now we must see the FSLN as a revolutionary party that is outwardly and inwardly democratic. As for affiliation, Ramirez said "we cannot accept an FSLN with followers, members, associates, and supporters; that is, we cannot accept an FSLN that is like a train with first-, second-, third-, and fourth-class cars and even a caboose. "All Sandinists must belong to one category; they must have the same duties and obligations. There cannot be a group of illuminati atop an ivory tower revealing the ideological truth to those on the ground who must only obey. That is not a winning party but a monarchic sect." Regarding criticism by conservative and orthodox FSLN groups that those who favor party renewal are "bourgeois" or "bourgeoisie-friendly," Ramirez said those people have very peculiar concepts of what constitutes an offense. "I cannot say for certain that someone who calls me a bourgeois is indeed a proletarian; life is no longer that easy. It is very complex because many social classes are represented in the FSLN. There are even independently wealthy people who are engaged in private activities." The first phone interruption during the radio network took place when Sergio was answering questions from Allan Tefel Alba, one of the reporters officially invited to the discussion. The second interruption took place when Jose Esteban Quesada from the [Radio Sandino] "Events" newscast was speaking. Sabotage Reporter Teresa Rios called attention to the sabotage of the FSLN renewal supporters and said that reporters from the orthodox-controlled media failed to attend the conference, which led her to wonder if there are two FSLN parties. Our colleague's questions were answered by Deputy Dora Maria Tellez, who said she had no doubt that the outcome of the congress "would differ from what we are currently seeing. Now we see a group of companeros who resorted to certain methods of attack and epithets to defend their positions. I do not think congressmen will make the same decision. I think they will support unified positions." Surprises in the Congress "I think the Congress will make the right decision about which path the FSLN must take to become a true alternative for the people and for their daily struggle to reach power. I am convinced congressmen will reject the sectarianism, the offenses, and the epithets that the overwhelming majority of Sandinists are rejecting, because no one will agree that 'Modesto is a rightist,'" explained Tellez. The deputy emphatically said that Commander Daniel Ortega, who heads the so-called Democratic Left, resorted to political intolerance, sectarianism, and attacks on all dissenting positions, a strategy that "hasn't harmed us but has harmed the FSLN." "We have tried to avoid responding to the name-calling with more name-calling, but obviously there is an image we are projecting to the people. The important thing is that the FSLN congress come up with a winning electoral formula and a unified solution to face the government's neoliberal policies." Dora Maria added that the Congress could be the right place for all of those who are resorting to name-calling "to correct themselves instead of confusing the FSLN rank and file. "We want an open, broad, flexible, and tolerant FSLN, an FSLN that respects people's opinions. However, one group is proposing a closed and sectarian FSLN," concluded Deputy Tellez.
