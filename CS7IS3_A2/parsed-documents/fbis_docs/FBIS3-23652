Withdrawal of forces from Eastern Europe will be concluded in August of this year, and a large number of highly placed military officials will have to find positions for themselves in Russia. The huge Western grouping numbers 600,000 persons. The position of the commander-in-chief of the Western Group of Forces corresponded to the rank of a general of the army, and naturally Colonel-General Burlakov, who presently occupies it, and his deputies are not counting on a demotion when they transfer to Russia. There are many personal friends of Pavel Grachev among them. It would be sufficient to name that same General Burlakov, who gave the keys to a new Mercedes as a wedding present to Grachev's son and the daughter of General Kharchenko. Now Burlakov is on track for a job as chief of General Staff or, at the worst, commander of the Moscow Military District. Grachev himself has long been endeavoring to clean up the generals' Olympus. In the fall of last year he announced to a small government circle that he intended to dismiss six of his close associates -- generals Mironov, Kuznetsov, Deynekin, Semenov, and even the Afghanistan veteran Gromov. Then, however, no one really understood what Grachev was intending. Nonetheless, he is gradually freeing the prestigious fifth floor of the Defense Ministry building; the telephones of his deputies, generals Mironov and Toporov, are no longer being answered. Grachev unleashed a main military "inspection" upon the command of the Moscow Military District -- to seek shortcomings. When on 4 February, during an official visit to the Taman Division the vehicle carrying the Russian and French defense ministers collided with a truck, Grachev rather bluntly promised to deal with the present commander of the Moscow Military District, Leontiy Kuznetsov. A report that Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov submitted his retirement papers fits into that same operatic scenario. The Information and Press Directorate of the RF Ministry of Defense denied this, and General Kolesnikov himself directly declared: "Our door is open, we are always ready for frank, constructive discussion. We made no secrets of our plans or of the status of the armed forces, and are making no secrets of our work." The "Western" generals enjoy a great advantage. These are rich people by our yardsticks. The average wage of Russian generals in Germany is 1,200-1,500 marks, at the same time that a respectable automobile could be acquired there for a couple of hundred, or even for free, if the vehicle fails to meet ecological standards and is destined to be scrapped. Service in the Western Group of Forces was considered to be a privilege in the army. In former times, officers were sent there after serving in a hot spot on the basis of a direct order from Grachev. However, this order was not followed completely. General Burlakov had never been in any hot spots. The massive influx of generals from the West threatens to ruin the Russian Army's administration. New jobs are hastily being created. Pavel Grachev voiced the idea of resurrecting the operational sectors that used to stand over the districts and were abolished under Marshal Yazov. This idea would make sense if everything wasn't being done for the sake of creating jobs. Such a chair could also be fabricated out of mobile forces quickly slapped together to accommodate someone's rear end. As a result of restructuring the administration, the Moscow Military District risks being left without communications: The central signal brigade is being taken away from the district and placed into the composition of mobile forces. It will take time and money to set up a new brigade. Russia has found itself with too many generals. Awarding general ranks before referendums has become a real tradition. In April, 187 persons received the big stars. Around another dozen did so before the December elections. As a result, the annual production volume of generals quintupled in comparison with the Soviet period. The last reduction in general staff was carried out by Marshal Yazov in 1989. At that time, under public pressure, the central administration of the ministry shrank substantially (especially the Main Political Directorate), and in the words of deceased Marshal Akhromeyev, the Union was left with 1,700 generals. Now the ministry has recovered -- never before had the defense minister had so many deputies. Pavel Grachev is to set off for Germany on 13 March, after which he will probably turn in his suggestions to Yeltsin regarding appointments of generals of the Western Group of Forces. The generals are making ready to move. Many already have apartments here in Russia. The situation is complicated by the fact that withdrawal of the troops from the Baltics is also coming to its conclusion simultaneously. General unemployment may become a fatal blow to the country. These aren't miners accustomed to living in barracks. Even before the first light of day, black Volgas surround the fashionable multistory buildings on Rublevskiy Highway. Generals of different ranks -- one, two, three stars -- come out of their homes and board their transportation together with their wives and children. Personal use of official transportation has become the scourge of the Russian Army. Generals use it to drive to and from work and to vacation homes, and to drive their families here and there. Those who are not entitled to a Volga by their position (as an example, an automobile is provided in the Moscow Military District only to two persons -- the commander and the chief of staff) make use of transportation allocated to the needs of an entire directorate or department. Officers working for such a department naturally never see the vehicle, and as they carry out their operational assignments, they curse the whole world for having to ride the crowded metro. A list of motor vehicles our correspondents discovered at the homes of generals on Rublevskiy Highway is published below. We ask the General Procurator to verify that the vehicles are being used in compliance with Defense Ministry Order No 22, Order No 60 (a secret order listing the persons using transportation) and Government Decree No 1159. 87-93 MMZ, 59-22 MMG, 24-29 MMZh, 42-80 MMZh (a pickup), 04-44 MOK, 36-63 SP, 00-85 MMA, 04-64 MZ (a UAZ), 2257 MMZh, 35-52 MMKh, 00-07 DT, 38-22 MMYe, 97-09 MMZh, 15-88 MMA, 06-60 MOK, 28-87 MOL, 15-32 ZhSh, 03-00 MKS, 07-80 MMD, 38-55 MMYe, 04-61 MOT, 15-46 MMA, 00-63 MMZ, 17-75 MMV, 83-11 LYe, 26-00 MOL.
