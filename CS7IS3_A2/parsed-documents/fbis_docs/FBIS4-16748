In a message to the Ukrainian navy personnel on Monday, he calls for preparing within 10 days a new round of talks on naval problems. In his opinion, what happened in Odessa has been settled for good, and neither Ukraine nor Russia should refocus on it. He also called for displaying restraint, standing firm against provocations, and disturbing actions that might complicate relations between the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Navy. On the same day, Bezkorovaynyy sent a letter to the Mayor of Sevastopol in connection with the city council's plan to discuss what happened between the Black Sea Fleet and Ukrainian seamen in Odessa on 8-9 April at an emergency session. The message blames the incident "on the gross violation of the Ukrainian Constitution and laws by some Black Sea Fleet officials." In this connection, Bezkorovaynyy suggested that the council consider the expediency of holding an emergency session or of postponing it for a later date. In his opinion, by declaring its allegiance to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, the Black Sea Fleet has virtually gone out of the Ukrainian leadership's control and become subordinate to the Russian military alone. All this leads to arbitrariness and impunity, he said. According to the agreement signed in Zavidovo in 1992, the Black Sea Navy Commander is subordinate to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia alone.
