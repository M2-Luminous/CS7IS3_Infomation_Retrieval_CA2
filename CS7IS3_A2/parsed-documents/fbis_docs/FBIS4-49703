This was the statement made by Dong Shukui, a senior official with the State Administration of Taxation, at the 11th China-Australia Senior Executive Forum held here today. The leading official in charge of China's overseas-related taxation told reporters that since the carrying out of the new taxation system, the total tax burden of foreign-funded enterprises has decreased to some degrees, compared with the old taxation system. According to him, foreign-funded enterprises are no longer paying higher taxes than domestic enterprises on 94 items, due to the adoption of unified value-added taxes, consumption taxes and business taxes for both foreign and domestic enterprises. Dong told the Australian entrepreneurs that there are now 11 kinds of taxes that are applicable to foreign-funded enterprises and foreign nationals according to the new taxation system, among which, duplication under the old industrial and commercial consolidated tax has been removed by introducing value-added taxes. He explained that the value-added taxes will only be charged on added value derived from production processes. Higher or lower tax rates are related only to the added value, but not to the number of enterprises involved, which is believed to favor foreign-funded enterprises in developing coordinated and socialized production. The official added that all the preferential policies on foreign-funded enterprises' income taxes will be continued. According to the new system, productive foreign-funded enterprises established in special economic zones and economic and technical development zones, shall pay business income taxes at a reduced tax rate of 15 percent. Meanwhile, productive foreign-funded enterprises located in coastal economic open areas and open cities shall pay business taxes at a reduced tax rate of 24 percent. Productive foreign-funded enterprises shall be exempt from business income taxes in the first two profit-making years and pay half the business income taxes in the next three years. The official told reporters that the foreign-funded enterprises will also continue to enjoy preferential treatment on turnover taxes. Under the new taxation system, the foreign-funded enterprises shall be exempt from value-added taxes on imported machines, equipment and spare parts at import entry which are needed in production and do not exceed the total amount of investments. In addition, foreign-funded enterprises shall be exempt from value-added taxes and consumption taxes on manufacturing products for export, excluding the ones under separate regulation by the government. Dong Shukui noted that Sino-foreign joint-venture banks and foreign-funded banks registered in special economic zones and Shanghai's Pudong New Area can be exempt from business taxes in the first five years starting from opening day upon approval. The official stressed that the Chinese Government will consistently give foreign-funded enterprises favorable policies and preferential treatment to boost their investment in the country. According to Dong, 1993 was the best year in luring and utilizing foreign investment. The statistics by the end of last year showed that China had developed more than 170,000 projects with foreign investments and absorbed 220 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment under agreement, with 60 billion U.S. dollars actually used at present.
