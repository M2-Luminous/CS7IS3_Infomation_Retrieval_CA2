In October, production was down 35 percent! In November, it will be down only 10 percent. In spite of successful sales, Renault is hard hit by the automobile market crisis. But that is nothing compared with the drop in truck sales: minus 50 percent in France in four years! As a result, RVI (Renault Industrial Vehicles) must eliminate 1,423 jobs out of a total of 15,500. All plants will be affected, except Limoges.
