We have prepared, and training with weapons is taking place day and night for youths and old people and men and women. We are ready for confrontation in order to defend our right to live in peace, in freedom, and in pride on our land. O brothers, we have to get ready now with one hand carrying weapons and the other having to carry the instruments for construction and production. We have, O brothers, to move now toward doing without the goods of the enemy, the equipment of the enemy. We must close our markets to the goods of the enemies. We must punish them economically as they have done to us and defy them as they have defied us and declare to them our determination that we will resist regardless of the circumstances. [passage omitted] We must not underestimate the anger of the Libyan people and the people's revolt being carried out by the Libyan people these days, and we must not underestimate the factors that have led to the Libyan people's anger and revolt these days in all parts of the free Libyan land. There is an infringement of which the Libyan people are aware, and the Western alliance has gone beyond the limits, crossed the red lines, and has blatantly interfered in peoples' internal affairs in the name of the United Nations--after they have killed the United Nations and replaced it with themselves. [passage omitted] We have offered several olive branches and have told them: We befriend whoever shows friendship to us. We have tried through peaceful means and through all mediation and means and put forward all proposals to solve any dispute between us and the Western states because we do not want peace to be threatened in the Mediterranean Sea or North Africa. We do not want new collapses to take place in the Arab region. They know that the Libyan system, which is based on direct people's democracy, is the safety valve in North Africa and the Arab homeland. Consequently, they do not want a safety valve in the Arab homeland. They want to remove all safety valves so that the Arab homeland blows up and collapses. They are now working day and night to destroy Egypt on your eastern borders and Algeria on your western borders. They destroyed Iraq before that, and now the conspiracies are being hatched against Sudan, Syria, and Libya. [passage omitted] We will not forget this Western beast that is lying in wait across the sea. O brothers, we will not be betrayed once more. There is no friendship at all between us and those enemies. They wanted enmity, so let it be enmity between us and them until doomsday. We are separated from them by trenches and barricades. O brothers, they want to destroy peoples by depriving them of their resources, but we in Libya are not disturbed as others whose oil has become worth less than the price of water. We welcome the deterioration of oil prices because we want to get rid of oil, and we Libyans want to get used to living without oil. Every day when the price of oil tumbles, we clap and thank God. We want the price of oil to tumble until it reaches nothing because they have decided to subjugate the Libyan people using oil. They said the wound that would hurt Libya was oil. They said the will of the Libyan people depended on oil. They said the Libyan people would give up their sovereignty and independence for oil. They based all their calculations on oil. You have to pay attention to this fact. It is the enemies who are plotting so that Libya's revolutionary and stubborn position and its defense of its pride depended on oil. If the West deprived Libya of oil, the Libyan people would surrender. The Libyan people would be vanquished, would forget their pride and independence, enabling the West to step into their homes, to desecrate them, and to take them into bondage and put them on the list of those who have surrendered. O free Libyan people, we have to understand this fact. We have to make decisions now as if we are without oil. We have to decide to live in ease as if we have no oil since the enemy has based all his calculations and plots on depriving us of oil to subjugate us. What is required, brothers, is that even if oil production is not cut off, even if they do not besiege the oil, even if they cannot do without Libyan oil, we must make provisions and prepare ourselves. From now on, we must decide to live without oil. We must educate ourselves individually and at the family level to live without oil. But, brothers, we cannot live without independence. We would die for independence. We cannot live without dignity, honor, and pride on the land of our fathers and ancestors. [passage omitted] [passage omitted] We challenge them to talk about human rights to Germany or Japan. They only talk about human rights to you--the small, weak, and downtrodden peoples. Consequently, these peoples must expose this falsification--this false language and this international hypocrisy. This is a new international hypocrisy and a new international decline behind which are economic and military forces. Small peoples must only get ready for confrontation. There is nothing in front of them but relentless fighting for their independence, sovereignty, and resources. There is nothing in front of peoples but defense--with all their forces and by getting ready to wage a long battle in order to safeguard the resources, children, independence, sovereignty, and freedom on their land. The long battle is not in the interest of the enemies. They want a short battle and a terrorist one. They want to terrorize us with missiles or aircraft, their bombs or their empty threats. Brothers, they only want to terrorize us. They want a short battle where we will be intimidated by them, fear them, submit to them, surrender oil, ourselves, our land, our heritage, our future, and the future of our children and grandchildren to them. We must resolve to face up to them and prepare for a long battle, with perseverance and unparalleled patience and courage. [passage omitted] The peoples of the Arab nation are imprisoned and tied up. They cannot go out to the streets and squares. Brothers, repression and suppressing the breeze of freedom will not prevent peoples from engaging in revolution. On the contrary, the stronger the repression, oppression, and suppression of the breeze and the sun of freedom, the more revolutionary people become. The revolution is coming. The Arab nation is now called upon to engage in revolution to save itself and its future. The Arab nation is exposed to danger these days, brothers. Palestine has been sold in an auction sale, and so was Jerusalem. Egypt is being destroyed on orders from the western forces. What is happening in Egypt is a conspiracy to destroy the biggest Arab state, and what is happening in Algeria is a conspiracy by France and the western states in order to undermine the Algerian revolution and the second or third largest Arab state. Iraq was destroyed and divided while the Arab nation was watching and listening. Iraq's destruction was also a western conspiracy. The West had ordered Iraq to occupy Kuwait, promising to back this occupation. When Iraq occupied Kuwait, the West destroyed and divided Iraq. [passage omitted] They are bent on putting an end to the Arab nation, and they want a Jewish empire to be set up on your ruins. O Arabs, you must know this: A Zionist empire is coming from the Ocean to the Gulf, and not from the Euphrates to the Nile. [passage omitted] Brothers, the Middle East problem will be solved when the 7 million Palestinian people return their land of Palestine, when Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state, when we see on the map the democratic state of Palestine--not Israel, or Jacob, or Yitzhaq. The Middle East problem will be resolved when the Zionist entity is disarmed of its arms of mass destruction directed at every Arab state. Brothers, how can we recognize an alien state in the heart of the Arab homeland and armed with arms of mass destruction? [passage omitted] O brothers, I am giving you facts and exposing the enemies' plans. This is what had been missing in 1911. We did not know anything about the plans of the European countries. We did not know the plan of the Italians. [passage omitted] Today, I am here before you to expose the plans of these enemies, to expose the so-called international legitimacy, and to expose the so-called peace process in the Middle East. I am explaining the (?dangerous) conspiratorial plan against the Arab nation. This is not taking place against Libya only--but against Egypt, Algeria, Iraq, and Somalia. Egypt's turn will come after Iraq. They have destroyed Iraq quickly with military might. However, because of different conditions in Egypt and Iraq, they are now endeavoring to destroy Egypt through a long war of attrition aimed at finishing Egypt. The same plan that existed in the days of Jamal 'Abd al- Nasir is still being implemented on the Egyptian land. The same is taking place in Algeria. It is a war of attrition carried out by the black French hand to bring Algeria to its knees and destroy it. Then the turn of Libya and Syria will come. They believe that Libya's turn came before Egypt. This is a mistake. They started in Egypt before Libya. A war of attrition has been waged internally against Egypt. Orders to wage a war of attrition and to carry out operations near Egypt come from Germany, France, Britain, and America. We say to those who believe that Libya is in danger that Egypt and Algeria are in a more dangerous situation than Libya. Libya is not in a dangerous situation yet. It has awakened and started preparing itself for confrontation. Libya will not be taken by surprise. First, it should cease its dependency on oil and move toward production. The people should be united with purified ranks to remove any breaches that will enable the enemy to infiltrate our ranks, brothers. [passage omitted] These acts appear to be perpetrated internally by Islamic terrorist elements. This is wrong. This is the work of western intelligence inside Egypt. What is happening in Egypt appears to be an Islamic, terrorist action from inside. This is not true. This is the action of western intelligence inside Egypt. Egypt is in danger before Libya. What is happening in Algeria is not the work of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] as they believe. This is the plot of the French black hand, and behind it are the western states. [passage omitted] Libya is luckier and in good shape because, on the one hand, Libya has awakened. On the other hand, it is because Libya has a free people capable of taking to public squares and streets. They are a unified people consisting of one family because the Libyan people reject treason, eliminate treason in their ranks. They are trained to carry arms. [passage omitted] O brothers, I incite you to confrontation and to get ready for the confrontation. The battle has not yet happened, but I tell you that this confrontation and this battle must be long. We must prepare for it so that we can make it last. If it is long, we will triumph. If we show fear, shake, or become terrorized from day one, we will lose the battle forever. We will become slaves forever, and they will take all our wealth and your wives and houses as they did in the past. They will not take anything into consideration and will never have any mercy on you. I tell you brothers: Do not be afraid. Do not be frightened. Do not tremble. Do not be intimidated. Do not fear them. If the battle is long and led with patience and courage, we will triumph in the end, and we will defeat the enemies. The enemy is gambling. It is seeking a quick gain without a loss. Your enemy is a tradesman, a capitalist seeking a market, wealth, gold, silver, the resources of peoples. [passage omitted] Your enemy is a greedy capitalist seeking markets, who wants to use the power of a capitalist state, political power, and military power to subjugate you, so that markets are opened up for his products and consumer goods afterwards, and so that you may become a consumer market for the products of Western states. [passage omitted] Do you want to have the same fate as that of the Somali people? Do you want the same fate as the fate of the Algerian people? Do you want to have the same fate as the Iraqi people? Therefore, we must prepare ourselves beginning now. This enemy will not retreat if we say to it: Peace be upon you; we want peace, and we want friendship. [passage omitted] What mistake was made by the Libyan people? What threat to peace was made by the Libyan people? What crime was committed by the Libyan people? They do not have any evidence, any response. They have been exposed even over the Lockerbie issue. They have bowed their heads before the world, after organizations not belonging to a state and without a political entity have been accused. It might have been perpetrated by a thug, and what would the Security Council do if they discovered that a terrorist such as Carlos had blown up the airliner over Lockerbie? What would the Security Council do with Article 7 in the face of Carlos. What if it is proved that a secret, stateless organization had blown up the Pan Am plane? What a predicament the Security Council is finding itself in now that it has been exposed. Look at the farce. This shows that the United Nations is finished, that the UN Charter is finished, that the Security Council is finished. It has now become the Western Security Council. The United Nations has become the Western United Nations against the small people. This is clear. O brothers, I wish that good language, signs of friendship, and exchanges of interests between us and them would protect us from their evils. No, no, whatever you do, it is useless. It is enough that we told France that we wanted to solve its case. Even the Libyan suspects in the UTA case themselves announced that they were prepared to stand trial in a French court if investigations were carried out with them first and proved that they needed to stand trial. The Libyan suspects announced it to the world and said they were prepared to be interrogated, and if investigations proved that they had to stand trial in France, they--such-and-such a person--were prepared to go. Why has not France responded to that? France refused to solve its problem with Libya. That French position is against the Security Council, against the United Nations. How can the Security Council decide that Libya did not respond to the demands by the French investigating judge and that Libya must submit to the French requests? When Libya said: Let us respond to that investigation and even the suspects themselves said so, France refused to carry out the investigation so that it would not be humiliated. France refused to solve its problem with Libya. We announce to the world: France refuses to solve its problem with Libya in support of its allies and sisters, America and Britain. How can the Arab countries not stick together? I am not talking about the people. The Arab peoples are wholly with us, but why is the stance of Arab governments not like that of the French Government? [passage omitted] We want Arab governments to stand with their brothers, the Libyan people, as France did with its British and American brothers and governments. The Arab peoples are with us, are united with us, and are standing with us. I am not speaking of the people because they are poor, subjugated, tied up, or helpless. No Arab peoples can come out into a square like this. Governments are afraid of the masses, of the challenge by the masses, of the masses coming out to express support for the Libyan people. We challenge Arab governments to allow the masses of the Arab nation to go out to the squares and streets to express to the West that they are one Arab people, one Arab nation, one Arab cause, and have one enemy. I, O brothers, am exposing to you the enemies' plot, the new international order that we must be aware of and in which friendship is useless. If you surrender, they will say: Why did you surrender? You have surrendered, now give me your oil. [passage omitted] Even if you get an agent and tell him to come and rule Libya and get rid of the problem with the West, it will not work. Why? Because the West will tell him: Since you are an agent and you rule Libya, hand over the oil and the Libyan soil to set up bases, as well as the Libyan people to make them slaves, and political power and sovereignty. That is what would happen. Therefore, why should you use an agent. Would you accept an agent to hand you over to America to solve your problem with the West? It would not work. It would not work. It is useless, of course. No, a thousand no's. The enemy is not shy. The enemy is scared, scared only of a confrontation. [passage omitted]
