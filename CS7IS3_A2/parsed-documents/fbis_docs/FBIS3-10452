He stressed that there are very strong interests behind the clashes. Governor Ruffo said at a news conference in Mexicali, the state capital, that his administration will continue to investigations even though the PGR has declared the case closed. In Tijuana, Jorge Alvarez Barrieri, commander of the second sector of the State Judicial Police, said there are political motives behind the detentions and arrest warrants issued against members of the state judicial police as charges were fabricated against Deputy Prosecutor Sergio Ortiz Lara and PGR Agent Juan Carlos Guerrero Cermeno, both of whom have been accused of releasing three suspects. Victor Clark Alfaro, director of the Binational Human Rights Center, said the judicial agents who are under arrest and those whose arrests have been ordered are only scapegoats and the real culprits have not even been mentioned. Clark Alfaro has demanded an investigation of State Prosecutor Juan Franciso Franco Rios as nobody can lift a finger without Franco Rios' authorization. The 3 March shoot-out left four people dead, including two members of the Federal Judicial Police and one member of the State Judicial Police. Deputy Attorney General Alfonso Cabrera Morales held a news conference on 7 March and said State Judicial Police agents were responsible for the shoot-out as they were protecting Ismael Higuera Guerrero, an assistant of the Arellano Felix brothers.
