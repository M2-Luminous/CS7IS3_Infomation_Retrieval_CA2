The force raked the area of Qilya and Dallafah with heavy machine guns for one hour. No casualties have been reported. Meanwhile, our correspondent in Tyre cited arrivals from the border strip that the Israeli forces reinforced their positions in the western and central sectors with artillery batteries, tanks, and personnel carriers. This followed the recent resistance operations against a number of joint Israeli-South Lebanese Army posts. In a related development, Israeli warplanes flew over the western and central sectors today, breaking the sound barrier.
