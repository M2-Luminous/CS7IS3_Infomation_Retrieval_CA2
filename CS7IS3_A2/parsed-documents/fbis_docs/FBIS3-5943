In a letter to the South Korean authority demanding their repatriation, the association recalled that they had been subjected to brutal and inhuman tortures and maltreatment in prison and noted that their health has run down further under the present living condition and discrimination. The letter said that though Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan sent a petition requesting their repatriation to the North for their reunion with their families to the South Korean Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross, the South Korean Red Cross has not accepted it. The letter urged the South Korean authorities to immediately take a measure for their reunion with their families in the North.
