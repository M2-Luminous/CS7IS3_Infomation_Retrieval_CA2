Failure to implement this agreement would inevitably intensify domestic opposition both in Israel and in Palestinian society, while complicating the situation of those taking part in the negotiations on both sides. And the year 1996 is approaching--the year of parliamentary elections in Israel, and the presidential election in the United States. In consideration of this factor, it would be well for the Palestinians and the Israelis to "stick to the schedule" for working out their agreement. In this respect, parallel progress in talks between Israel and Syria is seen as the optimal variant as well. Although, evidently, Palestinian-Israeli negotiations could indeed proceed to the implementation phase, while bypassing the others. But in this instance it would inevitably experience the retarding influence of other trends. With such a "truncated" model of development of the peace process, the potential for regional cooperation laid down in multilateral negotiations would not be able to begin functioning seriously. And in the future there would inevitably be complications in the Palestinian-Israeli talks themselves, on the permanent status of their relations, which is to commence in the third year of the period of self-government. One must say that the peace process in the Near East has already become an important factor in regional stability, and the rounds of negotiations (bilateral and multilateral) and measures taken between sessions--along with their direct purpose--are a kind of contact mechanism for the regional parties and for extra-regional participants in the peace process, which operate practically on a permanent basis. At the same time this mechanism in and of itself cannot substitute for that system of regional security and stability which would result from settlement of the conflict between its participants themselves. RUSSIA AND THE NEAR EAST In the second half of the 1980's, the diplomatic lexicon of Russia continually addressed the thesis that for us, the Near East is not only near, but is contiguous, and that everything that occurs there concerns us directly. It would seem that, as distinguished from the USSR, Russia is situated much farther from the Near East. However, this is not entirely true even geographically. The fact of the matter is, that changes are taking place in the very concept of the "Near East," and today the boundaries of the Near East are much broader than before; and, they are just as close to Russia as they were to the USSR in its time. It would appear that the public has not yet formed a coherent attitude with respect to the fact that there is a Near East for Russia, and what kind of policy she should have toward it. A wide variety of opinions are expressed, some of which are polar opposites. On one extreme flank, there is the perception that the Near East is located beyond the "natural habitat" of interests of Russian national security; thus, Russia should not be drawn too closely into near-eastern affairs. The idea presented in late 1992 by G. Mirskiy at an international scientific conference at Tel-Aviv University can serve as an example of the opposite pole of opinion: "The Near East at present is the only place in the world where Russia still can play a peace role. Other regions are practically inaccessible."[.sup]6[/] One may also encounter an "in-between" approach, which one could arbitrarily call, "drifting with the events." Naturally, each of the aforementioned ideas has the right to exist, and each can and is being substantiated. I would merely like to note that in recent years the interest of the outside world to the Near East, and to taking part in its affairs, is growing sharply. The appearance of prospects for peace in the region has markedly stimulated this interest, and the diplomatic and business activities of many countries with respect to the Near East. The fact of the matter is that one of the main peculiarities of the Near East, with determines one's attitude to it from abroad, is the fact that it represents a voluminous and growing market. For us it is most common to associate this market with the arms market. In 1991 and 92, the states of the Persian Gulf alone expended 40 billion dollars for arms purchases.[.sup]7[/] Military expenditures of near-eastern countries is estimated at 45 billion dollars per year, and taking into consideration the modernization of weapons being undertaken by the key states in the region, military outlays will remain at a high level for the foreseeable future as well. It is precisely the vast market for weapons in the Near East that they cite "in defense" of the thesis of Russia's developing relations with this region. Although they are correct in saying that these markets are on the whole "saturated," and that Russia sold less than 3 billion dollars worth of weapons in 1992 and even less in 1993, by 2.1 billion dollars,[.sup]8[/] Russia in recent years has "crossed over" from the first-place position she held in the second half of the 1980's, to one that is barely on the margins. In addition, for weapons importers the nature of the political ties with the exporting states, stability, reliability and predictability of these ties, are very important. Indeed, Russia has something to offer the Near East. This, of course, is not the fruits and vegetables, of which this region annually imports more than 30 billion dollar's worth. Primarily this interest represents the technical achievements of Russia. For instance, an enterprise for production of magnesium, using Russian technology, recently opened in Israel. Interest in cooperation with Russia is being displayed in many other areas as well. And for Russia, establishing peace in the region opens the prospects for significant increase in the potential of its business cooperation as well. Previously the market expanse of the Near East was divided by a key border obstacle--non-recognition of Israel by the Arabs. The peace treaty of Israel and Egypt signed in 1979 opened a breach in these obstacles. The realization of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement is expanding this breach. Peaceful settlement between Israel and its other Arab neighbors would lead to a state in which the near-eastern market expanse would open up all around. World business is positioning itself for precisely such a prospect. As arguments "against" Russia's developing an active partnership with the Near East they cite the indebtedness to her of a number of near-eastern states. Our principal debtors are Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Libya. At the same time the share of the near-eastern states with overdue debts to the former USSR (according to data of mid-1992) amounted to a little over 6 billion dollars, or nearly 23 percent of the total sum (28.5 billion dollars). World economic practice has developed methods for settlement of foreign debts in such a manner that it is advantageous to the creditor and not overly burdening to the debtor; and there are firms who make this their profession. And, finally, at times they assert that in the current complex situation, especially the economic one, it is hard, they say, for Russia to keep in step in the Near East with those who are capable of stimulating their involvement in near-eastern affairs even by financial donorship, and gratuitous aid. However, one hears from certain competent persons in the Near East, that Russia does not have to be a donor in order to take part in the affairs of the region. The advice to "wait it out" until everything in Russia "straightens itself out" also seems fallacious, since it is well known that any pause in a certain foreign sector inevitably weakens the ties, and in some instances even leads to their loss. In the context of the present article one must also not avoid the question of whether the Near East is important to Russia from the point of view of the interests of her national security. If one understands their limitation only as the danger of direct armed aggression against Russia, then the answer is probably no--for the present no one is planning on attacking Russia from the Near East. However, there are also in the Near East possible variants of a developing situation in which damage may be done to broader Russian interests. Some of these variants are connected with the non-settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict; others with the continuing atmosphere of conflict in the Persian Gulf; still others with the conflict situations along the southern borders of Russia and the CIS, and the attitude toward them of the states of the Near East. This list could be continued. One way or another, clearly, it is not in the interests of Russia to remain aloof from near-eastern affairs, nor from regular political and diplomatic participation in them, nor from intercourse both with the states of this region, and with those who are involved in these affairs. Speaking at the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs A.V. Kozyrev, making a positive analysis of the completed political and psychological break-through for resolution of the key problem of a near-eastern settlement--the Palestinian problem--stated that Russia, as co-sponsor of the Conference on the Near East, will spare no efforts to move the peace process along in all sectors. Actually, in the present situation the mechanism for the peace process was found to lie principally in the sphere of diplomacy, in which both regional and non-regional participants were interacting, and realizing their own national interests connected with the Near East and with relations with near-eastern states. The line for such interaction with the USA was confirmed by the Russo-American statement on the Near East, adopted 14 January of this year in the course of the Moscow summit as well. It is evident that such active participation in the peace process is in favor of the national interests of Russia as well, and in the interests of her security--the settlement of the near-east conflict within the framework of this process, stabilization in the context of normalization of the situation in this region, and the establishment of a system of security in it.
