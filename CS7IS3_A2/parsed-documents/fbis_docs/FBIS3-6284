He anticipates that investors who were planning to move production bases to Vietnam and China will implement their moves quickly. The current daily wage in China is about 40 baht, about the same as in Vietnam. Sophon said the new wage may force small apparel factories to close. The medium-sized plants may have to replace their work force with machines. He said only factories catering to lower markets will be forced to consider moving their bases. Factories catering to higher markets use a skilled work force and will therefore remain in Thailand. Sophon said: "The new wage increase does not mean that the price of clothes will follow suit. The factories will have to bear the burden and try to cut costs to compete in foreign markets." Krungthep Thopha Factory manager Phongsak Atsakun says every industry will be affected by the new wage increase, particularly industries that are labor-intensive. They will be forced to move to countries with lower wages or replace their work force with machines. The textile industry now employs about 1 million workers. Kanyong Electric Company manager Praphat Phoworakun said the electric appliance industry is not likely to be affected by the new wage because its work force is not big. He feels that the new minimum wage suits the current economy, though, and notes that the new wage increase will impact differently on different industries.
