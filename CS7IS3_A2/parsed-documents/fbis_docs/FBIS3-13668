Around 150,000 personnel joined the Lebanese Forces departments between 1977 and 1991, the year the militias were disbanded. The Lebanese Forces have no proof that the two suspects joined any of its administrative departments. 2. The Lebanese Forces started to keep records of its personnel in 1981 but these two names have appeared in none of the Forces' records. So the Lebanese Forces categorically deny that the two suspects have been among its members at any time since 1981. The Forces strongly condemn the crimes committed by the two, including plunder, robbery, and assault against a clergyman, and calls on the Lebanese judiciary to hand down the maximum punishment on them and on others who commit similar acts, even Lebanese Forces members. The Lebanese Forces would like to draw the public's attention to some malicious campaigns that seek to serve political goals that are known to everybody.
