FR940104-0-00047 FR940104-0-00014 EPA is expected to propose, in December 1993, regulations that would set water quality standards for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay/Delta estuary. This is in response to EPA disapproving many elements of a water quality control plan for salinity adopted in May 1991 by the California State Water Resources Control Board. The plan was disapproved because it failed to adequately protect the estuarine habitat and its resources. NMFS is presently consulting with EPA concerning the effects of the standards to be proposed on winter-run chinook salmon and its critical habitat. 5. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting the Continued Existence of the Species Unscreened Diversions and Entrainment Juvenile winter-run chinook salmon are subject to entrainment by large numbers of unscreened or inadequately screened diversions during their outmigration to the Pacific Ocean. These diversions range from small siphons diverting 20 cfs to the large export facilities operated by the Bureau and Department of Water Resources in the southern Delta that have the combined capacity of pumping approximately 12,000 cfs of water daily. The magnitude of this impact is currently unknown. Because of the potential impact from unscreened diversions, NMFS published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on October 18, 1993, that stated NMFS is considering development of regulations that would establish screening requirements for water diversions from the Sacramento River and the Delta to protect juvenile winter-run chinook salmon. The ANPR also requested specific information and comments concerning the numbers, types, and sizes of diversions, the magnitude of juvenile salmon losses at unscreened diversions, the feasibility of installing positive-barrier fish screens to reduce losses, the estimated costs of screening and available funding mechanisms, and the availability of alternative management options for reducing fish losses due to entrainment. NMFS will evaluate all information and comments on the ANPR to determine whether to proceed with the development of screening regulations. In addition, the CDFG has begun an inventory of all existing water diversions on the Sacramento River and in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to determine the number and size of unscreened diversions and identify high priority facilities requiring screening. The Bureau, in conjunction with the State, has also established a demonstration screening program that is expected to be implemented in 1994. This program was included as a measure to reduce taking of winter-run chinook salmon in the incidental take statement that NMFS issued to the Bureau with the February 12, 1993, biological opinion covering long-term CVP operations. The program is intended to promote the advancement of state-of-the-art positive barrier screening technology at small (less than 40 cfs) unscreened diversions along the Sacramento River and within Delta waterways. Anderson Cottonwood Irrigation District The Anderson Cottonwood Irrigation District (ACID) operates a diversion dam and two diversion facilities on the upper Sacramento River near Redding, California. The larger of the two diversions is protected by a screen operated and maintained by the CDFG. Until July 1992, the smaller Bonneyview water diversion facility (65 cfs capacity) was unscreened. In May 1992 the ACID applied for a Corps of Engineers (Corps) permit to install a screening structure at the Bonneyview facility, and NMFS initiated section 7 consultation with the Corps to evaluate the effects of installing and operating the structure on winter-run chinook salmon. The ACID obtained a Corps permit and installed an impervious barrier with screens that was operational by early July 1992. Monitoring by CDFG in the irrigation canal behind the screening structure in July and August 1992 demonstrated that the structure effectively eliminated the entrainment of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon and other species. Subsequent dive inspections of the screening facility by the NMFS found that the cleaning mechanism was working improperly. As a result, ACID personnel are now cleaning the screens manually and are expected to work with NMFS and the screen manufacturer to develop an alternative cleaning mechanism. Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District The GCID diversion facility located near Hamilton City, California, is the single largest diverter of water on the Sacramento River with the capacity to take up to 3,000 cfs daily. Inadequate fish screens at the facility result in the entrainment and impingement of juvenile salmon, including winter-run chinook salmon, that are dispersing in the river system during the peak of the irrigation season. Since 1990, NMFS has used the section 7 and section 10 provisions of ESA, together with direct legal action, in an effort to remedy the adverse effects of GCID water diversion operations on winter-run chinook salmon. On August 16, 1991, the U.S. District Court in Sacramento, California issued a temporary restraining order that required GCID not to exceed a pumping rate of 1,100 cfs from August 19 to August 29, 1991. On January 9, 1992, the Court issued a permanent injunction that completely enjoined GCID from diverting any water at the facility from July 15 through November 30. The Court modified the permanent injunction in April 1992 to allow GCID to operate under the terms and conditions of a joint stipulation that was agreed to by GCID, the Department of Justice, and the State of California. Under the terms and conditions of the modified injunction, GCID was allowed to pump water on a restricted basis in 1992 in exchange for its commitment to implement a long-term solution to correct existing fish passage problems at the facility. Following completion of an ESA section 7 consultation and the issuance of a biological opinion from NMFS on June 5, 1992, the Corps issued a 1-year permit to GCID that authorized dredging and other construction activities that were identified as terms and conditions in the modified the permanent injunction. GCID completed construction of a training wall, reconfiguration of the lower oxbow leading back into the Sacramento River, and additional maintenance dredging near the screens by mid-July 1992.
