FR941110-0-00306 FR941110-0-00018 Critical Habitat Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time the species are determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for these species. Such a determination would result in no known benefit to the species. The species have low total populations and/or numbers of individuals and face anthropogenic threats. The publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the Federal Register , as required for the designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to these plants from take or vandalism and could contribute to their decline. The listing of these species under the Act publicizes the rarity of the plants and, thus, can make these plants attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare plants. All involved parties and the major landowners have been notified. Protection of the habitat of the species will be addressed through the recovery process and through the section 7 consultation process. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for these species is not prudent at this time, because such designation would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and because it is unlikely to aid in the conservation of these species. Available Conservation Measures Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Listing can encourage and result in conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, and private organizations and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery plans be developed for listed species. The requirements for Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into consultation with the Service.
