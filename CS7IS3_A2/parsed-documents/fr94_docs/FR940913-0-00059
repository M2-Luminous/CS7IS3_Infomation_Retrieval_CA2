FR940913-0-00059 FR940913-0-00026 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 685 [Docket No. 920538&hyph;4252; I.D. 082594A] Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule; technical amendment. SUMMARY: This document corrects a table in regulations related to closure of certain portions of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Hawaii and Guam to longline fishing to reflect the correct coordinates. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Svein Fougner, (310) 980&hyph;4034. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Portions of the EEZ around Hawaii and Guam are closed to longline fishing in order to prevent conflicts with users of other types of fishing gear. In §685.23, the listing of coordinates for the waters around Guam that are closed to longline fishing contains an error that was made in a final rule document published October 6, 1992 (57 FR 45989). This technical amendment corrects that error in order to provide the public and enforcement entities the proper coordinates. Classification Because this technical amendment makes only a minor correction to an existing rule, notice and public comment thereon and a delay in effective date would serve no purpose. Accordingly, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d), notice and public comment thereon and a delay in the effective date are unnecessary. This rule is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 685 American Samoa, Fisheries, Fishing, Guam, Hawaiian natives, Northern Mariana Islands. For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR part 685 is amended as follows: PART 685_WESTERN PACIFIC PELAGIC FISHERIES 1. The authority citation for part 685 continues to read as follows: Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. 2. In §685.23(d), the table in paragraph (d) is amended by revising the entry for point C to read as follows: §685.23 Longline fishing prohibited area management. * * * * * (d)␣*␣*␣* ␣ 1Point 1Latitude 1Longitude ␣ *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* C 13 ○41 ’ N 143 ○33 ’33 ’ ’ E ␣ *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* Dated: September 7, 1994.
