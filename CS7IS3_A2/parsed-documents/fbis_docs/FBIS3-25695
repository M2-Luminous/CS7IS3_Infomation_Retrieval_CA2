Elias] [Text] Johannesburg Feb 24 SAPA -- Voting procedure for the April election was announced on Thursday [24 February] by the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]. Voters will have their identification checked at the doors of polling stations where party voting agents will also conduct ID checks. The voter will have both hands studied under ultra-violet lights. The voter's knuckles will then be dipped in an invisible but UV sensitive marking fluid which will wear off in about a week. The voter will hand in his identity document or temporary voter card to an official who will mark it and then a ballot paper will be given to the voter with the ID document. The voter will then go to one of the voting compartments and vote in secret before placing the ballot paper into a ballot box for the National Assembly election. The voter then moves to another table where his ID is checked again before a second ballot paper, this time for the provincial legislature, is folded and handed to the voter. The voter then votes again in secret and casts the ballot in a box marked for the provincial legislature election, the IEC announced at a press conference at the World Trade Centre.
