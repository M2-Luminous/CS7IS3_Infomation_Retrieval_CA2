This year is crucial to China's reform and development process. Many deputies explained from both theoretical and practical perspectives, the great significance of handling relations among reform, develop, and stability well. Deputies who are leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and State Council took part in the discussions and deliberations of their respective delegations. Speaking at a meeting of the Sichuan delegation, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua pointed out that each country and region has its own laws governing economic development, and it is necessary to guide our work according to economic laws and to uncover the path to sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. He noted that contradictions will emerge if economic development goes beyond the available conditions and foundation. He emphasized the need to control inflation to safeguard social stability. Speaking at the Henan delegation's group discussion, Vice Premier Li Lanqing also expressed deep concern about the impact of reform on commodity prices. He called for using laws and regulations as well as economic and administrative measures to carry out the work of controlling commodity prices within ranges tolerable to the masses. State Councillor Li Tieying took party in the Jilin delegation's discussion. He said: This year is crucial to reform. Reform will inevitably generate new developments and problems. We must follow closely, investigate and study, and earnestly review our experiences. Fundamentally speaking, reform represents the interests of the masses of people. We must trust and rely on the masses, and successfully guide and protect their reform initiatives. Comrade Ding Guangen took part in the Shaanxi delegation's discussion and deliberation. Deputies from the People's Liberation Army delegation indicated: The "Government Work Report" explains the relations among reform, development, and stability in a way that shows our party and government understands more profoundly the laws governing socialist construction, possesses clearer ideas about deepening reform, and will formulate more prudent principles and policies. Jia Qinglin, as a deputy from Fujian, said: The course of reform and opening up in the last decade and more shows that our cause advances whenever relations among reform, development, and stability are handled well, and tumbles or even suffers setbacks when relations are handled incorrectly. Properly grasping the "extent" of reform, development, and stability, and handling their relations well by using a little more dialectics, leadership arts, and by exercising high-standards of leadership, are a major task and severe test facing leaders at various levels in the new situation. Deputies discussed how, on the basis of unified understanding and in light of reality in various regions and departments, to proceed from the general interests of party and state work to maintain a balance and mutual promotion among reform, development, and stability. Xie Fei, as a deputy from Guangdong, said: In practical work, first we must seize the opportunity to deepen reform, open ourselves wider to the outside world, and exert efforts to implement the series of reform measures adopted by the state well. At the same time, we must make full use of Guangdong's advantages to raise the level and increase the scope of opening. Second, we must seize the opportunity to develop the economy, put emphasis on developing high and new technology industries, and maintain a steady growth in agriculture. Third, we must strengthen unity, maintain stability, keep ourselves sober-minded, and carry out our work before problems occur, and promptly remove destabilizing factors. Zhao Zhihao, as a deputy from Shandong, pointed out: The reform measures announced this year will fairly significantly change the interest distribution pattern in society. On top of this, the operation of the new structure requires a link-up and coordination process. As a result, the impact on the entire economic operation will be greater than in past years. By the same token, its effect and demand on social stability are more salient than in the past. This requires us not to set excessively high targets in the pace of development to avoid over-strained relations between various economic sectors, and thereby affect reform and stability. In announcing reform measures, we must pay close attention to timing, intensity, and supportability to avoid affecting the normal operation of the economy and creating shockwaves in society. With respect to social stability, we must emphasize integration between control in accordance with the law and education to resolve all kinds of contradictions and eliminate destabilizing factors. Mao Zhiyong, as a deputy from Hunan, said: To correctly handle relations among reform, develop, and stability, we must grasp four key points in our work: First, we must further emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and use new ideas and measures compatible with the new situation of a socialist market economy to create a new phase in our work. Second, we must enhance our awareness of storming heavily fortified positions in reform and fight a successful battle to build a socialist market economy. Third, we must earnestly seize the development opportunity and promote development through improved economic returns. Four, we must foster both material, and cultural and ideological progress, attaching equal importance to both, and work hard to advance the building of socialist spiritual civilization.
