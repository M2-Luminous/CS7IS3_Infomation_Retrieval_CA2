He said our country has expressed readiness to cooperate with international efforts to resolve the crisis in our country. Those remarks were made during a news conference held by the brother president at noon today. The news conference was attended by correspondents of Arab and international news agencies and print and electronic news media. The brother president explained said that no dialogue is possible with the secessionist elements in the command of the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP], but with YSP unionist elements. He explained that some unionist elements are helpless and controlled by the secessionist elements. As soon as the crisis is over, he explained, those unionist elements will come out and make their stands public. The brother president also noted that the entry of the legitimate forces into Aden will be a political decision. He said this is in order to avoid further material and human losses, preserve human lives in Aden, and for humanitarian reasons. The brother president noted that the future of the genuine Yemeni state will be prosperous and developed, based on the state's institutions, represented by the legislative authority, and on modern and developed laws regulating the activities of the new state, such as the local government law, which gives wide authorities to governorates, thus easing centralization. At the same time, he stressed that promises for applying local government jurisdiction will be honored. This is unlike the behavior of some YSP leaders, who falsely raised the slogan of giving power to local governments and demanded that strict centralization be eased and authorities be granted to local government. The brother president stressed that the local government law will be applied after order is restored and constitutional amendments are held. The brother president explained that the YSP secessionist elements are demanding and appealing for a cease-fire at a time when their warplanes are launching raids on the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy on the entrances of Aden. Their appeals, he said, are only meant to draw the sympathy of foreign public opinion and to portray themselves as being wronged. The brother president indicated that in light of the new world order, our country has welcomed UN Security Council Resolution No. 924. This is despite the fact that this resolution is considered interference in domestic affairs [words indistinct] cease-fire resolution unless [words indistinct] the legitimate forces.
