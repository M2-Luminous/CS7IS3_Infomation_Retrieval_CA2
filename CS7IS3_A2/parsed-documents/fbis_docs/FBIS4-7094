His plan created a stir in the political world, and eventually the political confusion not only seriously damaged Mr. Watanabe's dignity, but his own faction is about to split. Mr. Watanabe, who is eager to make a comeback to the political scene as a key player, recently said: "The proverb says, `If you fall down seven times, get up eight.' But, in my case, I get up 11 times if I fall down 10 times." In this way, Mr. Watanabe, without pausing to feel the heartbreak, is busy trying to maintain his influence. However, the prospect of him regaining influential power is dim. Speaking at a news conference in Utsunomiya City on 23 April, Mr. Watanabe indicated his intention to dissolve the Watanabe faction in the near future, saying: "Factions are unnecessary in the single-seat constituency system. I want to dissolve my faction when the law on districts within constituencies is adopted." He went on to say, "From now on, I want to come to grips with drastic reform within the LDP and, at the same time, study the possibility of changing the name of the party," thus showing his intention to remain in the party and make a fresh start. The recent political turmoil caused by Mr. Watanabe has further deepened conflict within his faction between a group of young members who joined after Mr. Watanabe took over the faction which had been headed by former Prime Minister Nakasone, and senior faction members who joined the faction before Mr. Watanabe took over the faction. In addition, Mr. Koji Kakizawa's secession from the faction must have caused a crack in relations between Mr. Watanabe and his close associates--including Taku Yamazaki, Bunmei Ibuki, and Kabun Muto--who have so far supported Mr. Watanabe. Although a general meeting of the Watanabe faction was held on 22 April, 16 faction members who are upper house members refused to attend the meeting. This was because they were getting tired of interfaction confusion caused by Mr. Watanabe's decision to run for the election, so they decided to hold their own meeting. They expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership of the faction, saying, "We upper house members were not kept well informed of how the situation was proceeding." With such dissatisfaction in the background, some of them say they will leave the faction if the situation requires it. So far, Mr. Watanabe, in his political activities, has placed emphasis on his faction. However, he is now required to review his activities because of the faction's instability and the fact that the next election will be held under a combined electoral system of single-seat and proportional representation constituencies for the House of Representatives election. Within the faction there is a move toward concentrating pro-Watanabe groups through the possible formation of a policy study group like "Onchi-kai," once headed by Mr. Watanabe, or some other study group. However, within the LDP, there are those saying: "Mr. Watanabe has to take responsibility for his decision--which was later withdrawn--to leave the party, because he is leader of his faction. His political career is now at an end" (according to a senior member of the Obuchi faction). In this way, there is a growing frosty atmosphere within the party regarding him. Mr. Watanabe sought a tie-up with Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa, who is notorious in the LDP, even though he knew that such a move would lead to his secession from the LDP. Such an attempt must have accelerated the anti-Watanabe mood in the LDP. Being conscious of such a mood, Mr. Watanabe has recently refrained from approaching Mr. Ozawa. At a meeting with faction members who have been elected three or four times at a Japanese restaurant in Tokyo, Mr. Watanabe reportedly criticized Mr. Ozawa's political methods, saying "he has gone a little too far." Moreover, he has reportedly told a leader of another faction that "we have to watch out for Shinseito's attempt to win our faction members over to their side." Meanwhile, Mr. Ozawa recently said, "I still want to work with him if he leaves the LDP," thus sending a signal to Mr. Watanabe. Although it is reported that Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Watanabe share common policies, including the theory of the nation, and have an affinity for each other, it is extremely uncertain whether relations between Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Watanabe will continue to have an impact on moves toward regrouping political parties.
