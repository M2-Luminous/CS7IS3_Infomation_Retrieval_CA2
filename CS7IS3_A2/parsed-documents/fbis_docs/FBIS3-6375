However, it is the North Korean spy organization that can do us direct harm. President Kim Yong-sam, in a recent meeting with Yi Ki-taek, representative of the opposition Democratic Party, said that North Korea has continued to send its spies to the South. The North Korean spy organization is often called "Office Complex No. 3." Mr. An Myong-chin, former North Korean spy who defected to the South crossing the DMZ last September, disclosed the status of the North Korean spy organization in the April issue of Japanese monthly THIS IS YOMIURI. The North Korean spy training institute has changed its name several times. It was called Kumgang School when its was established in 1945, Kumsong Political and Military School in the mid-sixties, Political School Directly Belonging to the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee in the eighties, and Kim Chong-il Political and Military College in January 1992. The spy training school is located in the Yongsong District in Pyongyang, a mountainous area in the outskirts of Pyongyang. The school is under the WPK Operations Department, which specializes in southward operations. The school site covers an area of a 10 km radius. Kim Hyon-hui, the terrorist who blasted the Korean airliner, was also trained in this school. To become a student of this school, one has to have a clean record and a good background, good health, and a good brain. There are about 400 trainers. After graduation, the students are attached to the Operations Department (headed by O Kuk-yol), Social and Cultural Department (head unknown), the Reunification Front Department (headed by Kang Chu-il), or the External Information Investigation Department--commonly called the Investigation Department--(headed by Kwon Hui-kyong). All these departments are under the WPK. Of these, the Operations, Social and Cultural, and Reunification Front Departments are charged with southward operations. Spies attached to the Operations Department take the role of guiding other spies when they infiltrate the ROK through the DMZ, or sometimes they themselves infiltrate the South. The task of the Social and Cultural Department is to plant long-term permanent spies or intelligence organizations in the ROK. The role of the Reunification Front Department is to conduct open activities, such as the inter-Korean dialogue. The Investigation Department is charged with overseas clandestine operations [haewoe kongjak]. Those from the spy training institute's branch schools are mostly assigned to these operations. Branch schools are called differently in each district, such as Kumgangsan District, Myohyangsan District, Chilbosan District. Kim Hyon-hui received his Investigation Department training in the Myohyangsan District branch school for one year beginning in 1981. The spy training institute, currently called Kim Chong-il Political and Military College, operates a model town -- also under the Social and Cultural Department -- where trainees can accustom themselves to the living environment of the South. The trainees numbered 100 in 1945 when the training institute was first established, 450 in the eighties, and 300 in 1989, showing a considerable change between periods. The training period was one year initially. It was increased to three and four years, and then fixed at five years since 1991 because of the requirement for more sophisticated spy techniques with the passage of time. Spy training, which begins at 0600 and ends at 2200, is harsh and varied, covering areas such as blasting, swimming, diving, parachuting, infiltration, abduction, martial arts, communications, and driving. In the case of shooting, the trainee is trained to shoot at a target from the front, the rear, and while running after it to ensure that the bullet hits the target under any conditions. Trainees learn to use various guns, such as Chinese, Russian, Czech, U.S., and Canadian guns. Trainees sometimes concentrate solely on shooting training for a month, and have to shoot about 25,000 bullets before graduation. Trainees are trained to infiltrate into the ROK; therefore, they have to learn thoroughly about the life in the ROK. For this, there is an 8-km-long miniature model town depicting the ROK landscape. There is a street with a restaurant, coffee shop, supermarket, stationery store, and movie theater. Traffic signals and pedestrian crossings are the same as those in Seoul. There is a subway and a bus terminal. The trainees buy things with South Korean money and see movies here and learn about life in the South. Mr. An, who defected to the South, testified that the subway and the bus terminal in Seoul are exactly the same as those in the model town. Mr. An saw ROK movies and read newspapers in the model town. As for newspapers, CHOSON ILBO and TONG-A ILBO are delivered three days after they are published. Mr. An was assigned to the "715 liaison office" and went through infiltration training twice, going as far as 2 km south of the DMZ and returning to the training base. The training's objective was to check the ROK Army's guard and develop infiltration routes. The training was mainly conducted at night. Mr. An said that he had heard from his trainer that 200 to 300 of the 1,000 North Korean spies have infiltrated South Korea.
