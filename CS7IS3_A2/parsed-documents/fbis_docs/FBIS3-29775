He said: "It is said there are 1,591 items listed, but there is a hitch to it. Deregulation will be implemented on only 231 of these items by the end of fiscal year 1994, and only in 42 cases will regulations be completely abolished." Hashimoto made the remarks during a lecture he gave at a seminar for senior officials of the LDP's Miyazaki Prefectural Chapter. He also criticized the government's attitude. He said: "As such a large figure has been announced, Japan will face difficulties when the rest of the world becomes aware of the fact."
