The newspaper AL-ANBA quoted the minister of state for cabinet affairs as saying that the State of Kuwait "has not and will not agree to this type of maneuvering and trickery, which is undertaken by the Baghdad regime from time to time to create a stir and give the international community the impression that it is seeking to find stability in the region."
