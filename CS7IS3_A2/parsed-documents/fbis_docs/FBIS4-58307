[passage omitted] Deputy 'Abdallah al-Shayiji said that the visit had the support of the National Assembly, which was consulted on the contents and aims of the visit -- this would increase the chances of its success. He said that al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah, the first deputy prime minister and foreign minister would brief the Foreign Affairs Committee at the National Assembly at the end of his tour on the outcome of his talks with officials in the countries he had visited. He added that the anti-coalition countries should not be dealt with in one way due to the variation in their stances from the early days of the Iraqi aggression until the subsequent liberation. These countries should be divided into categories and dealt with separately in a way that suited the amount of damage they have caused to the State of Kuwait. Al-Shayiji said that those countries could be categorized as follows: A category that includes Arab Maghreb countries, a second category that includes Sudan, a third that includes Yemen, and a fourth category that includes the PLO and Jordan. He clarified that the first category was prepared at this stage for an intensive Kuwaiti move at all official, popular, academic, and media levels through delegations that would exchange visits between the two sides. Deputy Dr. 'Abd al-Ridha al-'Asiri said that it was high time Kuwait reformulated the national target of its foreign policy and to look to the future from the nation's interest rather than emotions. He added that the foreign minister's visit was a change in tactics and not in strategy. Dr. al-'Asiri called for a united stance by legislative and executive powers regarding Kuwait's foreign policy through dialogue and consultation between the government and the National Assembly before any step is taken in this regard. Al-'Asir said that the success of the foreign minister's visit would depend on the Arab Maghreb countries support for all UN resolutions against Iraq, including the recognition of the new border demarcation between Iraq and Kuwait, and the return of POWs and detainees held in Iraqi prisons, and the recognition of international legitimacy. Al-Shayiji said that the Foreign Affairs Committee at the Kuwaiti National Assembly was in the process of preparing a working paper on Kuwait's foreign policy for the next period, to be submitted to the National Assembly for discussion.
