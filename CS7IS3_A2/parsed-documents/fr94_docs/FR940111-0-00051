FR940111-0-00051 FR940111-0-00015 Response. Section 110(m) provides that the Administrator ``*␣*␣* may apply any of the sanctions listed in section 179(b) (at any time or at any time after) the Administrator makes a finding. *␣*␣*'' under section 179(a). This language plainly authorizes sanctions without regard to a waiting period after a finding is made. The EPA believes that section 179 is phrased to require sanctions after 18 months not, as the commenters say, to prohibit sanctions before 18 months. Section 179 states ``for any implementation plan or plan revision required under this part (or required in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy as described in section 110(k)(5)), if the Administrator [makes a finding], unless such deficiency has been corrected within 18 months after the finding *␣*␣* one of the sanctions referred to in subparagraph (b) shall apply. *␣*␣*'' This provision mandatorily imposes sanctions at 18 months if the deficiency has not been corrected, but does not prohibit sanctions earlier. Because section 179 does not prohibit the earlier application of sanctions, it does not conflict with section 110(m), which provides that sanctions may be imposed earlier than 18 months. Therefore, there is not a statutory construction issue of whether section 179 needs to prevail over section 110(m). Regarding the request by the IEPA that EPA develop specific criteria for when an early sanction will be imposed, the EPA does not believe such criteria are statutorily required; however, since EPA will provide the public with an opportunity to comment on any sanction action under section 110(m) through notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to imposition of the sanctions, the public will have the opportunity to comment on EPA's rationale for the application of sanctions earlier than 18-months following the finding. Although EPA does not intend to develop specific criteria, Section A(4) of this preamble provides further discussion on application of sanctions earlier than 18-months following a finding. As to IEPA's concern about competitive disadvantage, imposition of sanctions under section 110(m) should benefit sources located in those areas that make timely submittal of plans and plan revisions. Rather than delaying sanctions until 18 months after a finding, under section 110(m) sanctions may be applied much earlier than 18 months. Therefore, delinquent areas may be burdened much sooner than the 18-month period under section 179. Imposition of section 110(m) sanctions should inhibit any advantage achieved through delayed submittal of required plans and revisions. 2. Application of Sanctions Beyond Nonattainment Areas Comment Five commenters believe highway sanctions should not be imposed outside of a nonattainment area. The Texas DOT, New York DOT, Illinois DOT and IEPA are concerned that EPA has not extended the nonattainment limitations of section 179 (a) and (b) to the imposition of sanctions under section 110(m). These commenters indicate that sanctions should apply only to nonattainment areas. The Virginia DOT believes that section 110(m) sanctions should not extend beyond a nonattainment area, except in extreme cases (such as where lack of good faith exists) and after a 24-month correction period has passed. The New York DOT and IEPA believe that EPA's position regarding the geographic applicability of offset and highway sanctions is inconsistent, and that the reasoning that is applied to make the offset sanction applicable to a specific area should benefit the highway sanction as well. The IEPA feels that section 110(m) refers to the section 179(b) sanctions without exempting the Administrator from complying with the geographic limitations specified in section 179(b). The Illinois DOT comments that section 110(m) allows EPA to sanction an area less than a whole nonattainment area if a unit of local government is really to blame. The New York and Illinois DOT also state that since the statute is clear and understandable on its face, no reference to legislative history is required or allowed. The Illinois DOT believes that section 110(m) should be viewed in conjunction with section 179(b)(1), and if Congress had not meant to limit the use of highway funding sanctions to nonattainment areas, it would not have placed that limitation in section 179(b). The Illinois DOT comments that Congressman Anderson had prefaced his remarks as expressing the intent of only four members of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee. The commenter noted that in May 1990 the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent out a version of the Amendments with no limit in section 179(b) on the area for sanctions (see H. Rep. No. 140, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., Part 1). The House Public Works Committee responded with a report of its own at that time amending section 110(m) and repeating almost the same words quoted by EPA in the proposed rulemaking. Congressman Anderson's words may have been on the point then, but they did not agree with the language of section 179(b) the way it was finally passed by Congress.
