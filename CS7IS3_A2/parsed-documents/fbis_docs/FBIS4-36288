In fact military operations have escalated. What is the situation and how do you view it? [Al-'Attas] On my arrival in Cairo I received a report from Aden on a telephone conversation intercepted between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and commanders of the military units, in which he literally says: "The military situation must be settled within 14 hours." So he wants to occupy Aden. And he is currently hitting strategic installations and civilian installations. In contrast, the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] has announced its acceptance of the cease-fire and committed itself to implementing it. So northern forces have exploited the situation and begun to launch their attacks on vital facilities. As is known, they have shelled oil refineries in the south, in addition to the extensive artillery bombardment of residential areas to kill more people and abort the resistance in the DRY. The present military situation is a serious escalation. I openly declare that Sanaa is resorting to evasion even in the statement issued by it. This statement does not offer open and clear acceptance of the Security Council resolution. They are always lying. We believe that this lying to the international community will result in very disastrous consequences. [Abu-Husayn] In your view, can northern forces occupy Aden within 14 hours on orders from the general command of the units on the various fronts? [Al-'Attas] I say this from a position of confidence: Let 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih himself and the world around him be assured that Aden will not fall, nor will he occupy it. Aden fighters will struggle to defend it. I admit that Aden could suffer heavily and be exposed to destruction, but it will not fall into the north's hands. We say to the international community that the DRY has complied and implemented the cease-fire. But the north has exploited the situation and is trying to occupy, and we are now in a position of defense. [Abu-Husayn] Have you requested international forces from the United Nations to protect Aden? [Al-'Attas] Yes, we requested that early on, as we know the intentions of the north. And now the Security Council is responsible for implementing its resolution. We informed the Security Council the day before yesterday of the military escalation by Sanaa. We have also briefed the United States and all the parties exerting efforts to halt the fighting on developments in the situation. [Abu-Husayn] With the arrival of UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi in Yemen, do you expect the fighting to be halted? [Al-'Attas] We hope so, and once Sanaa complies, we will end the state of defense. [Abu-Husayn] Do you have specific demands for Lakhdar Ibrahimi? [Al-'Attas] Our demands are known. They are summed up as follows: First, a halt to the fighting. Second, send international forces to disengage the forces. Then we would continue to implement the Security Council resolution without any reservations or conditions. We are willing to engage in a dialogue, negotiations, and anything else except the imposition of unity by force of arms or the wish to achieve personal interests for a partisan alliance, as is currently happening between the [General People's] Congress and the [Yemeni] Reform Grouping in the north. [Abu-Husayn] How do you view the positions of Britain and France on safeguarding Yemen's unity and nonrecognition of the new state? [Al-'Attas] We have made contacts with them. They support the Security Council resolution, to which all states, including the DRY, have agreed. [Abu-Husayn] Are you thinking of visiting a number of Arab capitals? What about the results of your visits to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Egypt? [Al-'Attas] They were very good. They were designed to exert all efforts and pressures to halt the ongoing war. I also intend to visit a number of Arab capitals. Especially as the military escalation by Sanaa is exposing the region to great dangers. Because the war is currently taking place on the borders of some fraternal countries, as in the northern area in Shabwah. At the least, the result is the emigration of huge numbers of homeless people and victims of war. [Abu-Husayn] Foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] issued a statement tacitly recognizing the DRY. What is your opinion? [Al-'Attas] We welcome the statement issued by the GCC foreign ministers. We consider it a good start for establishing distinct and special relations. We also thank them for their supportive and strong stands aimed at securing a cease-fire. They must be given the credit for their resolution, which is nothing but the voice of reason. Because unity cannot be imposed by force of arms. Besides, reason prompts us all -- including Sanaa -- to respond to the Security Council resolutions in order to safeguard what is left of Yemen and to safeguard the region's security and future. And finally, we must thank all the Gulf states, as well as Egypt, Syria, and Morocco, for their courageous stands regarding safeguarding Yemen's unity and their eagerness to spare it destruction -- something President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has not done. [Abu-Husayn] How do you view the present U.S. position? [Al-'Attas] The U.S. position is similar to ours. It supports the Security Council resolution, a halt to the fighting, and the call for a dialogue. We welcome that. The question of recognition is a formal matter, because we were a state in the past, and all is needed now is restore the situation to its previous status.
