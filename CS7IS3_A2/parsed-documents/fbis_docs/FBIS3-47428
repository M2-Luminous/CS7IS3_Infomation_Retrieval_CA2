The resumption of pollack fishing will relieve the financial difficulties of the fishing companies as a smooth supply is expected. The Russian Government approved a 30,000-ton quota for Korean fishermen in 1992 and a 150,000-ton quota in 1993, but prices were not agreed on at a Korea-Russia private meeting so fishing did not take place. At a Korea-Russia private meeting in December in Moscow, both sides agreed Korean vessels would begin catching pollack on Jan. 10 in order not to miss the season and prices would be set later.
