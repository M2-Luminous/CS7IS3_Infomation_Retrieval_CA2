FBIS4-35029 "drlat124_p_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-124 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 Ecuador Mobilization Decree Counteracts Strike Mobilization Decree Counteracts Strike PA2806021194 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2249 GMT 27 Jun 94 PA2806021194 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] Quito, 27 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Official sources reported today that the Ecuadoran Government will enforce the National Mobilization Decree that has been in effect since last week to counteract a 28 June labor strike declared to express support for Indian protests. Government Minister Marcelo Santos said the government drafted a national plan to confront the work stoppage called by the United Workers Front (FUT). The strike was called to demand the suspension of the decree that established the state of emergency and to express support for the Indians who are demanding the repeal of the new Agrarian Development Law. The strike is taking place one week after President Sixto Duran Ballen issued the mobilization decree following violent demonstrations staged by Indians to protest the Agrarian Law. Santos announced the Army and police will be deployed within the framework of the National Mobilization Decree to maintain public order and to guarantee the Ecuadoran people's security during the strike, the fifth such strike declared by FUT in 22 months since Duran Ballen took office. Meanwhile, FUT President Juan Andrango confirmed the unions will stage a 24-hour strike on 28 June to express solidarity with the Indians and to condemn the government's economic policies. At a news conference, the union leader confirmed the labor union's decision to suspend work, and he outlined the "battle plan" workers will follow on 28 June. The repeal of the National Mobilization Decree and the suspension of the Agrarian Development Law, which has triggered an Indian uprising, are among FUT's demands. FUT also is demanding that the government put a stop to constant rises in fuel prices and reject its "neoliberal" policies, including the privatization of public enterprises. Alfredo Corral, labor and human resources minister, deemed the FUT strike "untimely," because talks between the government and the Indians on a new agrarian law are expected to resume soon. Corral maintained that FUT is very irresponsible because it is organizing a strike at a time when the executive branch's National Mobilization Decree remains in effect. The official added that the strike is not aimed at mitigating labor claims. Instead, he said its political undertones are evident within the pretext of expressing solidarity with peasants and Indians. Minister Corral expressed regret over the union's decision and warned that, under the National Mobilization Decree, the Armed Forces will be in charge of ensuring the country's social order and peace. President Duran-Ballen last week issued the National Mobilization Decree to overcome internal unrest triggered by nine days of Indian protests over the Agrarian Law, which they say is unconstitutional. The Indian demonstrations, including roadblocks, brought business to a standstill in at least six provinces of the inter-Andean and Amazon regions and sparked shortages of food, medicine, and petroleum byproducts in several regions. Leaders of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), the group leading the demonstrations, have reported that at least four people have died, 15 have been wounded, and an undetermined number arrested during confrontations with security forces.
