We favor social justice for workers of the agricultural sector, the issuing of additional benefits which are necessary for the development of the agricultural sector. In this respect, the stance of the president coincides with ours. We came with a package of proposals, said Yefim Fiks, chairman of the Party of Social Guarantees, and the president suggested that edicts be drafted by us on the basis of our proposals. Participants in the meeting spoke of the need to adopt a joint statement of all the political forces of the Republic in support of the president's actions.
