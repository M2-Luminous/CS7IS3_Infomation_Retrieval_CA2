Jarmila Tosecka, our editor, will now highlight for us the atmosphere of the meeting. [Tosecka] Good afternoon, the meeting in Komarno is at present reaching its climax. In the course of the past four hours, a number of mayors of towns and villages took their turns to make lengthier speeches from the platform, in which they appraised the current local government's rights, draft of the territorial-administration reorganization, and the constitutional position of Hungarians in Slovakia. That part of the meeting's agenda passed calmly, despite critical reservations and fundamental proposals on the resolution of the problems. The ensuing debate, however, was marked by passionate words and statements. At the close, the organizers acquainted the participants in the meeting with the content of the open letter they are sending to the Slovak president. Apart from other things, they appeal to the whole Slovak public with these words: Let us seek a path to ourselves but only on the principle of equality. I shall now quote briefly from the final statement adopted by the participants in the national meeting of members of local governments, mayors, and deputies of legislative bodies from southern Slovakia in Komarno. The draft is currently being presented by one of the organizers: The Central European space is characterized by, among other things, unsettled ethnical relations and accumulated tension that could lead to tragic conflicts. We shall do everthing possible in the interest of ensuring that such a conflict does not break out in the Carpathian base. It is, however, necessary to point out that ethnical problems must be tackled also here. For Slovakia, which gained independence in 1993, this means that relations between Slovaks and Hungarians must be built on new foundations. In the interest of this, it is necessary to create a new system of relations between Slovaks and Hungarians, and it is necessary to pass new laws. The steps taken by the government to date have contributed to the worsening of mutual relations. The new system of relations is to strengthen the basic pillars of democracy.
