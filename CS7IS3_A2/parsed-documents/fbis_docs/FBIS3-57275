The chairman of the organization, Boris Kakubava, member of the Georgian parliament; the political secretary, Malkhaz Pataraia; and Abkhazia's military commissar, Vakhtang Vekua, answered journalists' questions. Boris Kakubava blamed the government because for four months, since handing over Abkhazia, it had done nothing for the return to Abkhazia, in the same way as we were evicted from there. They criticized sharply the Geneva talks. We are not against talks, said Kakubava, but we must have a reserve of permanent armed forces and must not allow the Russian troops under the auspices of the UN into Abkhazia. The members of the organization expressed the wish that as of now, representatives of the evicted population of Abkhazia participate in talks on settling the conflict. They protested against the return of refugees in the Gali rayon and justified their protest by the fact that it was being conducted under the jurisdiction of the [Abkhaz] separatists and that the civilians would have no security guarantees. Our only aim is to return to Abkhazia, said Boris Kakubava, and every lost day makes it unlikely.
