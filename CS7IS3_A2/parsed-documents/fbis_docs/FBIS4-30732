[Szekeres] Naturally, we are pleased that our deputies were so successful, for this expresses the trust of the voters and shows that they support not only the general policies of our party but also our candidates. [Reporter] The result expected by the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] -- that they would gain enough votes to counterbalance the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] -- did not come about. [Szekeres] Yes, but I do not think this is an important issue now. Our stance is very clear: We said between the two rounds -- and we are saying it now -- that in Hungary a broad-based coalition government is needed and this does not depend on the percentage of votes obtained by any one party. There is an historic opportunity here for the country. [passage omitted] [Reporter] When will the coalition talks begin? [Szekeres] [passage omitted] Next week a preliminary decisionmaking process will start within the MSZP in light of the election results, which will end at the party's congress on Saturday. We will decide two things: One, we will have to name the parties which we envisage as participants in the coalition talks. Two, we have to name our prime ministerial candidate. After this, the coalition talks between the parties can begin. Our goal is that the country should have a government as soon as possible; by the beginning of July the new government should be composed and voted in by parliament. [Reporter] Would you specifically name some parties which could be counted as coalition partners? [Szekeres] [passage omitted] I think the SZDSZ and the Federation of Young Democrats are the two political parties whose programs are compatible with ours. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Does the MSZP maintain that the winning party should name the prime minister? [Szekeres] I think that logically this is what the situation dictates, and we will name our candidate at the coalition talks. However, the government's program has to be settled first at the talks.
