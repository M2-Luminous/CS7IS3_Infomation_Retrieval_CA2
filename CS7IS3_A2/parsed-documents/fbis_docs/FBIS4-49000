"I've got a busy programme next week as some of you may know so I don't feel particularly neglected," Patten said. But he added: "Even though I'll have a busy schedule next week, as he does, I'll be prepared...to change the schedule at any time if it was convenient to director Lu Ping." According to an opinion poll conducted for EASTERN EXPRESS, more than 70 percent of respondents think Lu should meet the Governor. "I think the people of Hong Kong want to see us cooperating. I think they want to see us getting on with planning for the future. I think they want to see us working in the interest of the livelihood of the whole community," Patten said. "But, I've expressed my point of view, and I am sorry that director Lu Ping's schedule is so busy." He said it was the Hong Kong government and the Executive Council that invited the Bank of China to become a note-issuing bank. He said it illustrated the extremely good financial cooperation between Hong Kong and China, which was an important part of the transitional process. Patten said that, although he was not invited to meet Lu, he hoped those who went to the "important ceremony" celebrating the issue of new notes would have a "smashing time". He denied a report by a British newspaper that his heart was in the United Kingdom and he was hoping to go back to the UK as soon as possible, saying he went to London as frequently as his predecessor. Zhang Jun-sheng, the deputy director of the local New China News Agency (XINHUA) said Lu's refusal to meet the Governor did not violate the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). "The MOU said the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office should meet the Governor, but it did not say when. When there is a meeting between the two, there should be something to tall about," said Zhang. Tsang Yok-sing, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), was disappointed by Lu's refusal to meet Patten. "We hope Lu and Patten can meet as soon as possible. Of course, we do not think one meeting can resolve all the issues. But still we believe meeting with Lu and Patten will be helpful," Tsang said. "We have been all along proposing to both governments that normal and regular meetings between Lu an Patten would be necessary an important for Hong Kong' smooth transition." DAB's vice-chairman, Tar Yiu-chung, believed that the excuse of "having a busy schedule" was "superficial".
