The Implementation of the State Budget for 1993 In 1993, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, the people of all nationalities across the country worked hard as one to implement in an all-round way the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, thus scoring tremendous achievements in all fields of endeavor. The reform of the economic structure continued to deepen, and the national economy grew in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. A bumper harvest was reaped in agriculture; industrial production witnessed rapid growth; the domestic market was brisk, and the people's living standards continued to rise as their income increased; the state of fixed-asset investment improved somewhat, and the construction of infrastructural facilities and basic industries was increased; and as China opened itself wider to the outside world, international economic cooperation and trade contacts increased considerably. The aforementioned situation indicated that reform and opening to the outside world had brought about vitality and potential for developing China's economy, that all economic operations were continuing to move forward in a healthy direction, and that it was entirely necessary and correct for the party Central Committee and the State Council to adopt the measure strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control. On this basis, total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 billion yuan -- (including 69.384 billion yuan in income received from domestic and foreign debts) -- covering 113.1 percent of the budget, a 23.2-percent increase over the previous year. Total state expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan -- (including 33.735 billion yuan spent to pay for the principle and interest on domestic and foreign debts) -- equalled 112.5 percent of the budget, a 21.2- percent increase over the figure for 1992. This resulted in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan, which was not in excess of the budgeted figure. Of this figure, the central finance deficit came to 20.5 billion yuan, which is the same as the budgeted figure. Local revenues and expenditures were balanced. These figures were initially figures taken from the monthly report on the budget's implementation. There will be some changes when the final state accounts are compiled. The state of implementing the state budget for 1993 based on the double-entry system was as follows: Revenues in the regular budget totalled 407.391 billion yuan, or 119.3 percent of the budgeted figures. The main forms of revenue were: 1) Various taxes were 402.805 billion yuan, or 116.3 percent of the budgeted figures. 2) Income from state budget regulatory funds was 10.172 billion yuan, or 86.2 percent of the budgeted figures. 3) Other income was 17.889 billion yuan, or 187.7 percent of the budgeted figures. 4) Subsidies for nonproductive enterprises were 20.527 billion yuan, which was 1.473 billion yuan less than the budgeted figure, and the amount was reversed in the budget entry. Expenditures in the regular budget totalled 334.834 billion yuan, or 111.3 percent of the budgeted figures, accounting for 62.9 percent of total state expenditures. The main items of expenditures were: 1) Capital construction for nonproductive projects totalled 19.519 billion yuan, or 112.4 percent of the budgeted figures. 2) Expenditures for developing various public undertakings and for social security [she hui bao zhang 4357 2585 0202 7140] totalled 129.718 billion yuan, or 112.1 percent. Of this total, expenditures for agriculture, forestry, and water conservation projects totalled 14.214 billion yuan, or 107.5 percent of the budgeted figures; expenditures for cultural, educational, science, and health undertakings were 96.046 billion yuan, or 112.7 percent of the budgeted figures; and pensions for disabled people and families of deceased people and social aid totalled 7.516 billion yuan, or 108.4 percent of the budgeted figures. 3) Expenditures for state political power were 102.406 billion yuan, or 112.2 percent of the budgeted figures. Of this total, expenditures for administration and management were 54.033 billion yuan, or 121.5 percent of the budgeted figures; and expenditures for national defense were 43.248 billion yuan, or 101.8 percent of the budgeted figures. 4) Expenditures for price subsidies were 29.622 billion yuan, or 79.5 percent of the budgeted figures. 5) Other expenditures were 51.719 billion yuan, or 149.7 percent of the budgeted figures. Total revenues were 72.557 billion yuan more than total expenditures in the regular budget, and the balance was shifted to the construction budget. The construction budget revenues (not including income from domestic and foreign debts) totalled 107.264 billion yuan, or 122.5 percent of the budgeted figures. The main sources of revenue were: 1) The amount of the balance in the regular budget shifted to the construction budget was 72.557 billion yuan. 2) Specialized construction revenues (including income from energy, communications, and other key construction projects and taxes for city maintenance) were 48.699 billion yuan, or 96.7 percent of the budgeted figures. 3) The income of various enterprises was 5.433 billion yuan, or 65.1 percent of the budgeted figures. 4) Transfer funds were 1.302 billion yuan, or 26 percent of the budgeted figures. 5) Subsidies to make up for losses by productive enterprises were 20.727 billion yuan, resulting in a balance of 3.877 billion yuan which represents a debit in the budget that has been deducted from the receipts. Construction budget expenditures were 197.148 billion yuan (including expenditures for the repayment of domestic and foreign debts, plus interest), or 114.6 percent of the budgeted figures, accounting for 37.1 percent of the total budgeted expenditures. The main items of construction budget expenditures were: 1) Productive capital construction expenditures were 73.187 billion yuan (including 26 billion yuan by utilizing foreign debts), or 102.8 percent of the budgeted figures. 2) Expenditures for tapping potentials, restructuring existing enterprises, and introducing the trial production of new products were 42.362 billion yuan, or 170.5 percent of the budgeted figures. 3) The additional appropriation of revolving funds for enterprises totalled 1.882 billion yuan, or 134.4 percent of the budgeted figures. 4) Expenditures for geological surveys and prospecting were 5.16 billion yuan, or 105 percent of the budgeted figures. 5) Expenditures for supporting agricultural production were 17.977 billion yuan, or 112.6 percent of the budgeted figures. 6) Expenditures for city maintenance and construction totalled 19.47 billion yuan, or 124.7 percent of the budgeted figures. 7) Expenditures for supporting economic development in less developed areas were 2.226 billion yuan, or 104.6 percent of the budgeted figures. 8) Expenditures for the repayment of domestic and foreign debts plus interest were 33.735 billion yuan, or 96.5 percent of the budgeted figures. The difference between construction budget revenues and construction budget expenditures was 89.884 billion yuan, and the balance was included in the central state budget. Of this total, 38.484 billion yuan were covered by domestic debts and 30.9 billion yuan were covered by foreign debts, and the remaining 20.5 billion yuan were an out-and-out financial deficit which will be covered by borrowing from the People's Bank of China according to the budget approved by the First Session of the Eighth NPC last year. The result of the implementation of the 1993 state budget was that both revenues and expenditures exceeded the budgeted figures by a fairly large margin. According to our preliminary analysis, the overfulfillment of revenues by a large margin was mainly due to three factors: First, the national economy's sustained, rapid growth caused an accompanying increase in revenue. In 1993, the gross domestic product increased 13.4 percent compared to the previous year; industrial value-added production increased by 21.1 percent; and the total volume of retail sales increased by 26.1 percent. The rapid growth of the national economy and the expanded circulation of commodities brought about the overfulfillment of revenues of the main tax categories closely related to economic growth. Revenues from the product tax, value-added tax, and business tax alone were 49.5 billion yuan greater than the budgeted figure. Second, measures to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control yielded positive results and led to a marked drop in revenue losses. As a result of the implementation of measures taken since last year by the party Central Committee and the State Council to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, situations such as reducing or remitting taxes without authorization, refunding tax payments arbitrarily, assigning people to collect fixed amounts of taxes, and other violations of financial and tax laws have been brought under effective control. Meanwhile, cases of reducing or remitting taxes for the time being or because of financial difficulties were no longer examined and approved. As a result, financial revenues increased month by month. According to State General Administration of Taxation statistics, efforts to screen tax reductions and exemptions and to collect tax payments in arrears for previous years brought about a 30 billion yuan increase. Third, in 1994, the central authorities decided to implement the fiscal tax assignment system, under which the central government will return to local governments a certain percentage of their tax revenues based on their 1993 figures. This new system aroused the local governments' enthusiasm for revenue collection, and they took a number of measures to strictly collect taxes, manage revenues, and prevent tax evasion. As a result, revenues increased by a large margin in the fourth quarter. However, some local governments, to inflate the base figure for the central government's reimbursement, resorted to illegitimate means and to fraud by collecting taxes before the due date. We have urged local governments to examine and correct themselves, and we will organize forces to verify and handle cases in accordance with the State Council's requirements. Expenditures exceeded the budgeted figure. This is mainly because local governments may spend more when they have more revenue according to the principle of striking a balance between revenues and expenditure and after turning over what they have to turn over to the higher authorities in light of the contracted financial responsibility system. So, a big increase in local revenues gave rise to a corresponding rise in local expenditures. 1) As far as the categories of increased expenditures were concerned, expenditures related to economic growth increased by a bigger margin. Of these increases, expenditures for domestic capital construction exceeded the budgeted figure by 4.164 billion yuan, expenditures for tapping the potentials of enterprises and their restructuring exceeded the budgeted figure by 16.982 billion yuan, and expenditures for aiding agriculture exceeded the budgeted figure by 3.004 billion yuan. 2) Expenditures needed to develop various undertakings increased by a larger margin. Of these increases, spending on cultural, educational, science, and health projects were 10.816 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Spending on education alone were 6.463 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Spending on urban maintenance and construction were 3.86 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. 3) Spending on wage adjustments for workers and staffers of administrative institutions and units was budgeted at 4 billion yuan. In the course of its implementation, however, because the margin of wage adjustments was higher than the originally estimated figure, in addition to an increase in personnel and changes in jobs and grades throughout the year, the actual spending was almost double the budgeted figure. It should be said that such spending increases are reasonable and necessary for ensuring the development of reform, construction, and various undertakings. At the same time, however, it also should be noted that the scale of construction has expanded in an unplanned way, and that the situation of going after things new and foreign and engaging in extravagance and waste is quite serious in the way that administrative expenses are disbursed. In a few localities, spending was even reported falsely. These are also important reasons for expenditures having exceeded the budgeted figures. Generally speaking, the 1993 budget was implemented well. To ensure the deepening of reforms and to bring about the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, the finance and taxation departments at all levels did a great deal of work under the unified leadership of the party and the government. First, they achieved positive results in collecting revenues, strictly managed revenue collection, and screened cases of tax reductions and exemptions and cases of tax payments which are in arrears. In accordance with the unified arrangements of the State Council, local governments carried out a complete screening of tax reductions and exemptions that they had authorized, as well as of the policies regarding the "two funds" and abolished some improper policies and provisions. In view of changes in sources of revenue, many localities carried out timely readjustments of their emphasis with respect to tax collection, improved their management, and ensured a reasonable growth of revenue. Second, they tried in every possible way to collect funds and thus ensured revenue for major expenditures. Especially while revenue growth was slow in the first half of 1993, the finance departments at all levels managed to reduce less essential expenditures and to rationalize the distribution of funds, and they did their best and ensured funding for essential expenditures. Third, important progress was made in fiscal reform and legislation. The "General Rules for Enterprise Finance" and the "Rules for Enterprise Accounting" were successfully put into effect on 1 July 1993. A great deal of preparations were made last year for a comprehensive reform of the fiscal and tax systems. The "Registered Accountants Law," revised the "Individual Income Tax Law," and the "Accounting Law" have been promulgated and put into effect. The State Council has promulgated some interim taxation regulations, including those concerning the value-added tax, consumption tax, business tax, resource tax, enterprise income tax, and land value appreciation tax. The "Budget Law" will be submitted to this session for deliberation. Special mention should be made of the fact that although treasury bond sales were sluggish for some period last year, party committees and governments at all levels, as well as relevant departments, attached great importance and lent their enthusiastic support to such sales. Financial departments at all levels also devoted massive manpower to providing services aimed at promoting sales, thereby ensuring the completion of the task of issuing treasury bonds. This was of vital importance to the fulfillment of last year's budgetary tasks. Deputies, at present we are in a important period of economic restructuring and rapid economic development. Not only is the contradiction between the supply of funds and the demand for funds very sharp, but management in various sectors urgently needs to be improved. In 1993, all large increases in both revenues and expenditures were attained at the local level, and the central government did not fulfill the budget targets in revenues and expenditures. While local revenues increased by a big margin, the revenue from the turnover tax belonging to the central government was far below the budget target, thus further aggravating the central government's financial difficulties. All these show from different angles the problem of the fiscal and tax systems, especially when some localities could not pay the wages of their workers and staff members in a normal manner even after local revenues increased by a big margin. Governments at all levels should pay great attention to this problem. To solve these problems once and for all, we will comprehensively reform the fiscal and tax systems this year according to the decisions and unified arrangements of the State Council. We will seize this opportunity to further improve fiscal and tax management and gradually establish fiscal and tax operating mechanisms to meet the requirements of the socialist market economy so that fiscal and tax management will be standardized and legally institutionalized, and so the country's financial situation will be improved as quickly as possible. 2. The Draft State Budget for 1994 The year 1994 is a crucual year for implementing in an all-around way the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; realizing reform in establishing a socialist market economic structure; and continuing to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. The deepening of reform and economic development have created many favorable conditions for state finances, but have also brought about difficulties. The current financial situation is still grim. On the one hand, market demands this year will remain brisk due to the reaction of such factors as the increase of investments and the rise in the price of farm products and workers' and staff's wages. On the other hand, after two years of successive rapid growth, China's economy is faced with an expanding "bottleneck" restraint and inflationary pressure. The overall environment for economic growth is by no means easy, and the contradiction in money supply and demand is quite serious. To maintain a basic balance between total demand and total supply and to alleviate the inflationary pressure, it is necessary to follow the principle of tightening budgetary restraint in drawing up the state budget for 1994. On the basis of this understanding, the guiding principles for planning the state budget for 1994 are: Fully implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; ensuring smooth progress in financial, taxation, and other major economic reforms; continuing to tighten and improve macroeconomic regulation and control; actively building up financial sources; paying attention to improving enterprises' efficiency; ensuring that increases in financial revenue match economic development; upholding the principle of acting within one's means; readjusting the expenditure structure; appropriately increasing input in such key sectors as agriculture, education, science and technology, and infrastructure; maintaining needed increases in funds for national defense, public security, and judicial departments; strictly controlling ordinary fixed assets investment and consumptive expenditures; and promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the national economy, as well as overall social progress. In line with the general plan of the party Central Committee and the State Council, we have carried out a major reform of the taxation system, the financial system, and the system of profit distribution in state-owned enterprises this year. After financial and taxation reform, there have been considerable changes in the requirements for drawing up the budget. For example, following the reform of the indirect tax system -- because of the fact that the value-added tax has been universally practiced in production and circulation areas -- the turnover tax levied on wholesalers and retailers and the product tax levied on some products have been converted into value-added tax. As a result, the value-added tax has increased nearly 100 percent while the turnover tax has decreased correspondingly. With the cancellation of the product tax, the levying of a consumption tax on a small number of products has begun. Here is another example: in accordance with the stipulation on the division of central and local tax categories set by the new financial system, fixed central revenue and fixed local revenue are to be listed as central revenue and local revenue. As for tax revenues to be shared by central and local authorities, 75 percent of the value-added tax is to be listed as central revenue. At the same time, tax revenues to be returned to local authorities by the central authorities are to be listed as central subsidy expenditures for local authorities. The amount of central expenditures has increased considerably because the amount of tax revenues to be returned to local authorities is fairly large. As a result of these changes, corresponding readjustments have been made in the draft state budget for 1994. In accordance with the guiding principles for budgetary planning and the changes made in calculations, we have initially planned the 1994 budget as follows: State revenues (excluding income from domestic and foreign debts) total 475.995 billion yuan, a 7.7 percent increase over the previous year, calculated on similar terms. State expenditures (excluding expenses incurred to service domestic and foreign debts) total 542.914 billion yuan, a 15 percent increase over the previous year, calculated on similar terms. This leaves a deficit of 66.919 billion yuan. We also made certain changes from the previous year in the way incomes and expenditures from domestic and foreign debts and budget deficits are calculated. Primarily, in the past, income from debts was included in total revenues, and debt service was included in total expenditures; budget shortages resulting therefrom were regarded as real deficits and were covered by borrowing from the people's bank. Many experts at home and abroad have raised issues concerning this method of calculation. To better reflect how the state's regular revenues and expenditures and debt obligations stand, beginning this year, we will change the way deficits are calculated. Under the new method, receipts from debts will not be included in total budgets, nor will debt service be included in total expenditures; budget shortages will be covered entirely by borrowing. At the same time, domestic and foreign debts due for repayment will be serviced by borrowing. The adjustment only changes the way deficits are calculated and will not affect their actual size. Under the 1994 budget plan, state revenues will increase 7.7 percent over the previous year, which is not high. This is mainly because last year's revenues were substantially above the budgeted amount. The increase in last year's revenues has limited the scope of increase in this year's revenues. At the same time, policy-related factors -- such as exemption from state budget regulating funds and communications and energy construction funds granted to state-owned enterprises this year, the implementation of the "General Financial Rules for Enterprises," and the increase in export tax rebates -- have reduced revenues by about 30 billion yuan. These policy-related revenue-reducing measures are all designed to support enterprises, exports, and reform. Calculated in comparable terms, this year's revenue will actually increase 14.4 percent over the previous year. The current revenue plan, therefore, is positive, and is based on a full consideration of revenue-enhancing factors, such as rapid economic development and improved management. In the area of expenditures, although we appropriately reduced investment in fixed assets, the high expenditure base for 1993 made it necessary to increase expenditures by more than 50 billion yuan to cover such policy-related expenditures as increases in essential expenditures on agriculture, education, science and technology and other key areas; wage increases for employees of administrative departments and public institutions; and increased subsidies following the introduction of a single exchange rate. All this has made it quite difficult to balance the budget and has actually resulted in a considerable increase in deficits from the previous year. The draft state budget compiled according to the dual budget system follows: Revenues in the regular budget total 448.911 billion yuan, a 9.9 percent increase over the previous year. The main receipts are: 1) Tax receipts, 446.123 billion yuan; 2) receipts from state budget regulating funds, 2.8 billion yuan; 3) receipts from other sources, 15.288 billion yuan; and 4) subsidies to make up for losses for nonproductive enterprises, 19.3 billion yuan, which represents a debit in the budget that has already been deducted from projected receipts. The expenditures in the regular budget amount to 392.846 billion yuan, which posts a 17.3 percent increase over the previous year and represents 72.4 percent of total expenditures in the budget. The main expenditures break down as follows: 1) Nonproductive capital construction, 19.486 billion yuan; 2) expenditures for development and operation of certain undertakings and for social insurance, 153.566 billion yuan, including 16.737 billion yuan in expenses for agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, 113.296 billion yuan for culture, education, science, and public health, and 8.386 billion yuan for pensions for the disabled and families of the deceased and social relief payments; 3) expenses for building up the national strength, 119.199 billion yuan, including 61.359 billion yuan for administrative expenses and 52.04 billion yuan for national defense; 4) subsidies to compensate for price rises, 37.342 billion yuan; 5) miscellaneous expenses, 54.353 billion yuan; and 6) central and local reserves, 3.5 billion yuan. When revenues are set against expenditures in the regular budget, there will be a surplus of 56.065 billion yuan, which will be transferred to the construction budget. Revenues in the construction budget total 83.149 billion yuan, a decrease of 22.5 percent from the previous year. The main receipts break down as follows: 1) Regular budget surplus, 56.065 billion yuan; 2) receipts for special construction projects, 43.718 billion yuan, including 4.8 billion yuan from funds collected for construction of key energy and transport projects; and 3) subsidies to make up for losses suffered by productive enterprises, 16.634 billion yuan, which represents a debit in the budget that has already been deducted from the receipts. Expenditures in the construction budget total 150.068 billion yuan, which posts an increase of 9.2 percent over the previous year and represents 27.6 percent of total budgetary expenditures. The breakdown of major items of expenditures follows: 1) Expenses for productive capital construction, 45.756 billion yuan (excluding 14.245 billion yuan arranged from foreign loans); 2) funds for tapping the potential of existing enterprises, upgrading technology, and subsidizing trial manufacture of new products, 38.508 billion yuan; 3) additional working capital for enterprises, 1.882 billion yuan; 4) expenses for geological surveying, 6.198 billion yuan; 5) expenditures for support of agricultural production, 21.063 billion yuan, including 6.685 billion yuan of special funds for agricultural development; 6) expenses for urban construction and maintenance, 21.6 billion yuan; and 7) development funds to aid economically underdeveloped areas, 2.55 billion yuan. Expenditures exceed revenues in the construction budget, leaving a deficit of 66.919 billion yuan, which is to be covered by issuing treasury bonds and borrowing from the bank. Coupled with the principal and interest of domestic and foreign debts in the amount of 48.081 billion yuan, which mature and must be repayed this year, and 14.245 billion yuan's worth of foreign loans used by the state for key construction projects this year, the total amount of debts incurred for 1994 will be 129.245 billion yuan. In the draft state budget for 1994, revenues in the central budget are set at 332.91 billion yuan, a 3.8 percent increase over the previous year. The figure includes revenues of 272.056 billion yuan by the central government and revenues of 60.854 billion yuan turned over by local governments to the central government. Expenditures in the central budget amount to 399.829 billion yuan, an increase of 14 percent over the previous year. The figure includes expenditures of 186.289 billion yuan by the central government and expenditures of 213.54 billion yuan as tax refunds and subsidies to local governments. Expenditures exceed revenues in the central budget, leaving a deficit of 66.919 billion yuan. According to the budget drafted by us for local governments, a total amount of 417.479 billion yuan is arranged as financial revenues for local governments. The figure, including financial revenues of 203.939 billion yuan by local governments and tax refunds and subsidies totaling 213.54 billion yuan by the central government, posts an increase of 6.8 percent over the previous year. Expenditures in the draft local budget come to 417.479 billion yuan, an increase of 6.8 percent over the previous year. The figure includes expenditures of 356.625 billion yuan by local governments and an amount of 60.854 billion yuan to be turned over to the central government. Thus, local revenues and expenditures are balanced. The central budget compiled according to the dual budget system follows: Revenues in the regular central budget total 325.923 billion yuan, a 6-percent increase over the previous year. The main receipts are broken down as follows: 1) Various tax receipts, 264.529 billion yuan; 2) receipts from state budget regulating funds, 1.64 billion yuan; 3) receipts from other sources, 1.49 billion yuan; and 4) receipts turned over to the central government by local governments, 60.854 billion yuan. Expenditures in the regular central budget total 310.667 billion yuan, a 10.7-percent increase over the previous year. The main expenditures are broken down as follows: 1) Expenditures for nonproductive capital construction, 12.046 billion yuan; 2) expenditures for the development of public services and social security, 19.457 billion yuan; 3) expenditures for building up national strength, 62.361 billion yuan; 4) subsidies to compensate for price increases, 13.1 billion yuan; 5) miscellaneous expenses, 9.391 billion yuan; 6) central reserves, 1.5 billion yuan; and 7) subsidies by the central government for regular expenses incurred by local governments, 187.412 billion yuan. When revenues in the regular central budget are offset against expenditures, there is a surplus of 15.256 billion yuan, which will be transferred to the construction budget. Revenues in the central construction budget total 22.243 billion yuan, a 44.3-percent decrease from the previous year. The main receipts are broken down as follows: 1) The surplus from the regular budget, 15.256 billion yuan; 2) receipts for special construction projects, 13.21 billion yuan; 3) subsidies to make up for losses in productive enterprises, 6.223 billion yuan, which represents a debit in the budget that has already been deducted from the receipts. Expenditures in the construction budget total 89.162 billion yuan, a 27.2-percent increase over the previous year. The main expenditures are broken down as follows: 1) Expenditures for productive capital construction, 29.899 billion yuan; 2) Funds for tapping existing enterprises' potential, upgrading technology, and subsidizing the trial manufacturing of new products, 11.998 billion yuan; 3) additional working capital for enterprises, 1.15 billion yuan; 4) expenditures for geological surveying, 6.158 billion yuan; 5) expenditures for aiding agricultural production, 1 billion yuan; 6) development funds for aiding economically underdeveloped areas, 1.385 billion yuan; and 7) subsidies for local construction by the central government, 26.128 billion yuan. Expenditures exceed revenues in the central construction budget, leaving a deficit of 66.919 billion yuan, which will be covered by debt. The total debt volume for 1994 will total 129.245 billion yuan, including 48.081 billion yuan in principal and interest on domestic and foreign debts that will become due this year, and 14.245 billion yuan in foreign loans to be used for key state construction projects. The 1994 state draft budget was drawn up in light of the new situation following financial and tax reforms. During the budgeting process, we gave as much consideration as possible to various factors that may affect budget revenues and expenditures. Nonetheless, the actual situation will inevitably be different. Specifically, it is difficult to estimate with complete accuracy revenues transferred from one tax category to another, changes in enterprises' burdens, and increases or decreases in local revenues following reform of the taxation system. The effects of financial and tax reforms on various economic activities can be seen clearly only after such reforms have been implemented for a considerable period of time. Because the budget was drawn up amid a significant number of uncertain factors, some changes may occur when it is implemented. If the changes are substantial, we will rework the budget and submit the revised version to the National People's Congress Standing Committee for examination and approval. To facilitate examination by fellow deputies, I would like to expound on policy-related issues in compiling the draft state budget: (1) On the question of debts in 1994. Domestic and foreign debts for 1994 are set at 129.245 billion yuan, a 39.361 billion yuan increase; the total debt volume accounts for 3.8 percent of the year's gross domestic product, a slight increase over the previous year. The increase in the debt volume is related to three factors. First of all, to balance regular financial revenues and expenditures, 66.919 billion yuan treasury bonds are to be issued to make up for the increased financial deficit which, from 1994, can only be settled through issuing bonds, not borrowing money from banks; thus increasing the debt volume. Second, treasury bonds are also issued for paying for the principal and interest on domestic and foreign debts due this year, which totals 48.081 billion yuan. Third, to step up major construction, the state's financial input for key construction projects will be 14.245 billion yuan in foreign loans. I would like to explain here the relatively big volume of treasury bonds to be issued this year. Although we have substantively reformed the procedures for issuing and managing bonds in line with the requirements of a market economy, successful fulfillment of the issuance task still needs the undertanding and support of leaders at all levels and people throughout the country. So long as we ensure good publicity, not only can this year's task of issuing bonds be fulfilled, but also their market operations can be better than in the previous year. (2) On the question of promoting rural economic development in an all-around way. The development of agriculture and increase of peasant income is the prerequisite for ensuring a basic balance between the total supply and demand of society and for safeguarding social stability. To this end, expenditures for aiding production and for paying various agriculture-related operating expenses in this year's state budget total 37.8 billion yuan, a 17.4 percent increase over the actual expenses in the previous year. Including other budgetary items used as agricultural expenses, the state's planned financial input in agriculture totals 52.3 billion yuan, a 7 billion yuan increase over the previous year. Meanwhile, to comprehensively implement the central authorities' "Several Policy Measures Regarding the Current Agriculture and Rural Economic Development," the state will adopt additional policy measures, including perfecting the grain reserve system and establishing the central and local grain risk fund systems; appropriately raising the procurement price of grain and the contract price of cotton after new grain and cotton crops appear on the market; and readjusting the state's input into agriculture to ensure stable grain markets and to increase peasant income, thereby promoting rural economic development in an all-around way. (3) On the question of further invigorating large and medium state enterprises. Further invigoration of large and medium state enterprises is crucial for maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, as well as an important foundation for establishing a socialist market economic structure. In line with the central authorities' requirements for transforming the operating mechanisms of enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system, this year's reform of the fiscal and taxation systems will focus on transforming mechanisms and standardizing the taxation system for all enterprises, because this will have a positive impact on building up state enterprises' stamina for development and competitiveness. Meanwhile, the tax reform will abolish the regulatory tax for state enterprises and exempt them from the payment of funds for construction of key energy and transport projects and for state budget regulating funds, thereby increasing their financial resources by over 14 billion yuan. The implementation of the "two sets of rules" will change the computing method for profits and losses of enterprises and enable them to keep their capital intact while reducing their delivery of revenues to the state and increasing their funds for upgrading technology. The impact of the aforesaid reduced revenues has already been taken into account in the draft state budget. (4) The question of increasing input in science and technology, education, and other key areas. In 1993, the actual expenses from state finance on science, technology, and education increased over the previous year; and operating expenses related to culture, education, science, and public health increased more than 20 percent over 1992. On the basis of last year's increase, this year's budget for culture, education, science, and public health expenses is 17 billion yuan, or 18 percent, more than last year. Of this, operating expenses for education will be 66.233 billion yuan; and for science, 7.989 billion yuan; 18.5 percent and 19.8 percent more than the previous year's actual amounts respectively, which are both higher then the increase of the financial revenue. Including other budgetary items used as expenses for education, science, and technology, this year the state's financial input in education will be 81.5 billion yuan; and science and technology, 23.4 billion yuan. In addition, because of price rises, wage reform in the army, and increased living standards, expenditures in national defense are also adjusted accordingly. 3. Deepen Fiscal and Tax Reforms, Vigorously Increase Revenues and Reduce Expenditures, and Strive To Fulfill the 1994 State Budget Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute the overall task for the entire party and nation. The key to complying with and serving this overall task in fiscal and taxation work lies in ensuring smooth progress in fiscal and tax reforms and in fulfilling the state budget for 1994. Leading comrades in all localities and departments must attach great importance to these two aspects and earnestly strengthen leadership. Fiscal and taxation departments at all levels should seize the opportunity, seek truth from facts, change their work style, and work hard to ensure the success of fiscal and tax reforms and the completion of budgetary tasks. We must carry out work in a down-to-earth manner to ensure that fiscal and tax reforms will produce the desired results. The main aspects of this year's fiscal and tax reforms include reforming the current local financial contract system to institute a separate taxation system based on a rational division of power between central and local authorities; reforming the taxation system to establish an indirect tax system based mainly on the value-added tax and to unify enterprises' income tax and personal income tax; and reforming state enterprises' profit distribution system. These reforms are vitally important for our country's efforts to establish a socialist market economic system; to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the national economy; and to ensure long-term national stability. Fiscal and tax reforms are the centerpiece of this year's reform of the economic system, and they cover a wide range of areas and carry significant policy implications. In devising the reform plan, we took account of the need for gradually increasing central financial resources and fully considered local interests and enterprise operations. We also shifted the focus of reform to changing operating mechanisms and did not significantly adjust the income distribution pattern. Judging by the practice of reform in the two months or more since the aforementioned reforms were implemented on 1 January, it is evident that the reform plan is correct and that it has been implemented quite satisfactorily without any major incident. However, we must remain sober-minded and cannot afford to lower our guard. Although we conducted many investigations and studies, listened extensively to the opinions of all quarters, and repeatedly introduced readjustments based on our findings during the course of devising our reform plan, the way the plan was designed will necessarily differ from how it will relate to the actual situation; this will require readjustments and improvements in the course of implementation. Current fiscal and tax reforms affect the vital interests of all sectors and the broad masses, directly affect progress in overall economic reform and social stability, and have a bearing on this year's economic and fiscal situation. We must organize them meticulously and advance them steadily in order to ensure their success. Leading comrades in all localities and departments should earnestly strengthen their leadership over fiscal and tax reforms, step up their efforts to coordinate various reforms, promptly deal with new circumstances and problems that emerge in the course of reform, and pay attention to incipient problems and take preventive measures. Fiscal and taxation departments at all levels should increase investigations and studies, detect new circumstances on a timely basis, sum up new experiences, and solve new problems. In particular, they should properly handle the issue of ensuring policy continuity in shifting from one system to another, and ensure that all reform plans are implemented. Unity in understanding and action holds the key to successful reform. Although we can point out problems, we must take overall interests into account when it comes to implementing reform. We cannot go our own ways, overstep our authority, enact our own rules and regulations, and distort or alter reform plans. If such problems occur and are confirmed after investigations, we should deal with them sternly. (2) Improve and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control to promote sustained, rapid, healthy economic development. The fiscal and taxation departments, as vital departments exercising the state's macroeconomic regulation and control, shoulder the major responsibility for healthy economic development. We must, in line with the requirements of a socialist market economy and the principle of matching construction scale with national strength, effectively improve and strengthen marcoeconomic regulation and control to promote competition among enterprises on an equal footing, coordinate regional economic developments, and strive to increase production and practice economy, and to increase revenues and cut back expenditures. We must, through the allocation of fiscal funds and application of fiscal and taxation policies, strictly control the investment scale of fixed assets; promote the development of agriculture, science and technology, and the basic industries; facilitate the readjustment of the production structure and enhancement of enterprise economic efficiency; and guide enterprises to develop themselves through tapping internal potential. We should do things strictly in accordance with the state budget, and should not allow new items leading to reduced revenues or increased expenditures. The central government should control bond issuance under the state-approved scale; while the local governments should persist in keeping expenditures within the limits of income, striking a balance between revenues and expenditures, and avoiding budgetary deficits. In the course of reforming the price system and changing enterprise operating mechanisms, we should relentlessly help enterprises stop deficits and begin to earn profits; should stop subsidies for operational losses; and should reduce subsidies for losses permitted by policy. We should accelerate the legislation on the fiscal and taxation system, reinforce economic and financial discipline, and codify the financial and tax management as soon as possible. (3) Seize the favorable opportunity for fiscal and tax reform to improve and strengthen the collection and management of revenues. After tax reform is instituted, taxpayers must pay, and tax offices must collect according to the law; tax revenues must be calculated and levied according to the rates prescrived in the tax law, and "contracting for tax payment" and wanton alteration of tax rates are not permitted; and except for reductions and exemptions stipulated in the tax law, no government or department is allowed to set a precedent in granting tax reduction and exemption. We must take the task against tax evasion seriously, closely watching new trends of tax evasion following the introduction of the new tax system. Especially those criminals who forge special vouchers for the value- added tax, or who exploit the use of vouchers to evade taxes must be severely punished without mercy. In keeping with new circumstances arising from the fiscal and taxation reform, we must earnestly improve and strengthen the levying and collection of various revenues to prevent income losses. We must, in accordance with the central authorities' unified arrangements, carry out step-by-step the reorganization of central and local tax offices, properly resolving problems related to division of labor and coordination of work to ensure normal operation of tax collection and management. Meanwhile, efforts must be made to clear payments in arrears for the "two types of funds" and to continue to collect the "two types of funds" from nonstate-owned enterprises and institutions, on which reductions and exemptions should not be granted without authorization. (4) Improve the procedures for issuing state treasury bonds to ensure the accomplishment of targeted sales. The large volume of state treasury bonds to be issued this year has a direct bearing on the success of fiscal and tax reform and the balance between revenues and expenditures. One of the important factors for accomplishing the targeted sales of treasury bonds this year lies in good publicity and coordination. In line with the requirements for developing and perfecting financial markets, we should reform the procedures for issuing treasury bonds, effectively planning contract procurement and marketing of bonds, improving and expanding the system of primary individual operators, and standardizing and developing secondary markets of treasury bonds to increase their circulation and stability. We should also combine bond sales with banks' open market business. Under the unified leadership of local party and government organizations, financial departments at various levels should closely coordinate with banks and other relevant institutions in ensuring priority sales of treasury bonds. Balances of retirement pensions, unemployment insurance, and postal savings deposits should mainly be used in purchasing treasury bonds. We should do everything within our capacity to sell treasury bonds to the masses, and to enable them to buy and cash the bonds conveniently. Meanwhile, we should also give offices, institutions, enterprises, and units access to subscribe to treasury bonds. Financial and banking departments at all levels should accumulate experiences in bond sales and actively explore ways for issuing bonds under the conditions of a market economy. (5) We should control total expenditures and ensure that funds are available for key projects. When making arrangements for financial expenditures, we should stay within our means, ensure that funds are available for key projects, and curb expenditures for ordinary projects. In addition to continuing to increase input in such key sectors as agriculture, education, science and technology, and infrastructure, as well as guaranteeing the necessary increases in outlays for national defense, judicial, procuratorial, and public security departments, this year we should give priority to expenditures incurred in paying wages and building up state grain reserves. We should never permit the diversion of funds, which are earmarked for remunerating staff members and workers, to new projects. Areas that delay the payment of wages to staff and workers should resolutely stop or postpone the construction of projects funded by financial departments. Institutions that delay the payment of wages to staff and workers are not permitted to purchase small vehicles or other expensive, luxurious consumer goods. Financial departments at all levels must attach great importance to this issue. We should strictly control the scale of investment in fixed assets. Except for indispensable projects that have been approved, we should not start new ones. We should resolutely halt or postpone the construction of projects for which no funds are available and whose prospects are uncertain. Currently, the problem of wasting funds is quite serious as money is being spent lavishly to renovate houses and buy equipment. The practices of traveling for meetings and of wining and dining at government expense continue despite repeated efforts to ban them. Specifically, there is a lack of effective control over staffing, and "personnel fees" have eaten up a substantial amount of funds earmarked for developing various undertakings. Therefore, we should curtail expenses for personnel, vehicle purchases, and meetings this year. We should vigorously promote the fine tradition of diligence and thrift, and urge the broad masses of cadres and people to combat extravagance and waste. Moreover, as price reform deepens, we should gradually slash subsidized projects and ensure that total expenditures for such projects will not surpass the budgeted figure. We should deepen reform of fiscal management in institutions, continue to encourage and support such institutions in rationally disposing of their incomes as permitted by policy and law, and exercise overall planned management of total revenues and expenditures. We should resolutely and fully implement provisions regarding the "separation of revenues and expenditures," and exercise unified budgetary control over revenues that should be subject to budgetary management, such as those derived from fees charged for using land and from selling public housing. Fellow deputies: Our fiscal and taxation tasks are rather formidable in 1994. Nevertheless, we can surely surmount various difficulties, achieve the desired results in various reforms, and successfully fulfill the state budgetary tasks for 1994 as long as we fully implement the guidelines of the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, earnestly implement various reform measures, take practical steps to improve and tighten macroeconomic regulation and control, and properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core.
