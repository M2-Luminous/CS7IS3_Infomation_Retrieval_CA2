IG Metall spokesman Michael Knuth said in Ingolstadt today that token strikes would focus on the Audi plant in Ingolstadt as well as further protests in Upper Bavaria [southern Bavaria] and the town of Bamberg [northern Bavaria]. Staff are planning to leave their places of work and, weather permitting, demonstrate on the streets. The union is also planning protest action at BMW on Thursday [10 February].
