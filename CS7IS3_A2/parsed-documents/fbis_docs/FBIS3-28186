Seiji Yoshida, one of the Japanese responsible for the forcible drafting of "comfort women for the army," at a press interview said the then patriotic labor service bureau of great Japan was in charge of the forcible drafting of Koreans and he himself directly commanded the forcible drafting of some 1,000 "comfort women for the army". The Belgian paper SOLIDAIRE said that during World War II the Japanese Army forcibly drafted Korean women and used them as its sexual playthings. After gratifying their carnal desire Japanese soldiers unhesitatingly committed brutal atrocities which would make even beasts blush with shame, such as dismembering and burning them en masse, it said. The Nepalese paper NAYA HANGK said that the drafting of nearly 200,000 Korean women as "comfort women for the army" is the most diabolic of the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists. The Japanese authorities must apologize to mankind for the sexual crimes and compensate to the Korean people, the paper wrote. Ridi Alajandro, general secretary of the new progressive union of the Philippines, said Japan must be brought to justice for drafting a large number of Korean women and forcing them to serve as "comfort women for the army" during the Second World War. The Malaysian paper NEW STRAITS TIMES said that Japan must immediately apologize for the criminal acts it committed against the "comfort women for the army" and pay adequate compensation to the victims. If Japan refuses this, it will face strong denunciation and a stern judgement by the world public, it said.
