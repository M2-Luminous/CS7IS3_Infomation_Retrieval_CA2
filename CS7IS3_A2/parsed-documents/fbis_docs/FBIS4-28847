FBIS4-28847 "dreas114_d_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 South Korea Ambassador to UN Urges Sanctions Ambassador to UN Urges Sanctions SK1406022394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0214 GMT 14 Jun 94 SK1406022394 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] United Nations, June 13 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright said Monday the first draft resolution calling for U.N. sanctions against North Korea might be circulated within 24 hours. Commenting on North Korea's announcement that it would quit the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Albright said that Pyongyang's withdrawal from the agency, if it were true, would be a serious problem and would make the situation worse. Meanwhile, representatives of the 10 non-permanent members of the U.N. Security Council had separate meetings with the South Korean and Japanese ambassadors here Monday to exchange views on sanctions against Pyongyang. South Korean Ambassador Yu Chong-ha said, "Judging from North Korea's attitude at this juncture of the scheduled third round of high-level talks between the United States and North Korea, Pyongyang seems determined to develop nuclear weapons." He then called on the Security Council to adopt sanctions to stop the North's suspected nuclear weapons program. The council's non-standing members are to meet with North Korea's U.N. Ambassador Pak Kil-yon Tuesday on similar matters. The Security Council is expected to hold a closed meeting Tuesday to continue discussion of the North Korean nuclear issue including its withdrawal from the IAEA. The United States has almost completed a draft resolution calling for the step-by-step imposition of sanctions. Upon approval by President Bill Clinton, the draft will be circulated within the Security Council after Korea-U.S. consultations. The draft resolution could be distributed to the council as early as Tuesday, but other U.N. sources predicted it would be determined after former U.S. President Jimmy Carter returns from Pyongyang.
