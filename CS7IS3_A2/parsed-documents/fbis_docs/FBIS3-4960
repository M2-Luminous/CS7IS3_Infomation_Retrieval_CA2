As for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's refusal to accept the U.S. demand for numerical targets to measure the degree of openness of the Japanese market, voiced during a summit meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton last month, 20 percent said the action was only natural, 57 percent said it was unavoidable, and 12 percent said it was not good.
