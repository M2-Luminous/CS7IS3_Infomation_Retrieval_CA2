The Prime Minister's Office sent questionnaires to 3,000 people aged 20 or over in late February, of which 2,153 responded. Thirty-three percent of respondents believe land prices will continue to rise in the foreseeable future, compared with 75 percent who thought so in the previous poll in June 1988. Japan's land prices have taken a downward turn after peaking in fall 1990, after the speculative bubble economy with its inflated land and stock prices burst. The percentage of those who said they believe prices will head up in the coming years fell to 31 percent, sharply down from 75 percent in 1988. The poll showed 66 percent believe present land price levels are still high, with those who live in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya or those who do not own housing particularly saying so. Nearly 60 percent said they favor current falling land prices and hope they decline further, according to the poll. The percentage of those who want to have their own land and homes stood at 84 percent, a 14 point gain from 69 percent in the previous survey, it said. " People are beginning to buy their own houses again as a result of lower land prices recently," an analyst at the Prime Minister's Office said. The poll also found 62 percent think housing property is a more attractive asset in the investment portfolio than savings, deposits and shares.
