The greatest failure of Western policy in Bosnia, however, has not been a military one. It has been an elementary failure of understanding about the very nature of the war itself. So terrible has the slaughter been -- 200,000 people killed, two million driven from their homes, and the hospital wards of Gorazde reduced to a mess of rubble and blood -- that the outside world has simply recoiled in horror, convinced that no rational understanding of such actions can be possible. Starting from the assumption that they could take no view on the political rights and wrongs of the war, the Western governments insisted that they would deal only with its "humanitarian" aspects. Then a UN military involvement was tacked on to the humanitarian aid effort and then the policy of "safe areas" was added on to that, leading eventually to a direct military confrontation with the Serbs. Now Nato has dramatically increased its commitment to defend the safe area of Gorazde, raising the military stakes still higher. But while the nature of our involvement has gradually changed, there has been no change in our fundamental misunderstanding of the war. The basic idea remains that we must treat all parties as equal, with equally valid claims, and bring about "a negotiated settlement" (i.e., a carve-up of Bosnia) in which as many as possible of those conflicting claims are satisfied. Several failures of understanding are involved here. They include these three repeated by British ministers throughout the war: that the Bosnian government is "a warring faction"; that the Serb forces are fighting against "the Muslims"; and that the war is just "a civil war." The Bosnian government is not a faction; it is the elected government of a sovereign state. The independence and sovereignty of Bosnia (which Britain has recognised) were voted for by an absolute majority of Bosnian citizens. The government contains Serbs and Croats, neither it nor its army can be described simply as "the Muslims." And the war itself is not just a civil war, but a war of territorial conquest planned, directed and supplied by Serbia, a neighbouring state. Anyone who understands these matters can see which side of the conflict deserves our political support. It is not necessary to become steeped in Balkan politics, or to fall prey to emotional moralism. It is sufficient to bear in mind the basic political principles which we ourselves value: legality, sovereignty and democracy. We would take offence if American politicians started calling the British Army in Northern Ireland a "warring faction"; Bosnians feel similarly offended when our politicians dismiss their own legal government with that phrase. The Bosnian government has a just cause; but is it, nevertheless, a hopeless one? Here again the facts are shrouded in a fog of misunderstanding. It is simply assumed that the defeat of the Bosnian army is inevitable, and that the Serb forces will always fictate "the facts on the ground." The history of the war suggests otherwise. From the moment the Bosnian government began properly to organise its forces, the Serb advance was largely checked, and in some areas pushed back. Only the UN-imposed arms embargo prevented the Bosnian army from regaining more territory. Though they still enjoy a huge superiority in weapons, the Serb forces suffer now from dwindling numbers and poor morale; recruitment to the Bosnian army continues to rise, and it now outnumbers the Serbs by more than two to one. There is nothing invincible about the Serb army in Bosnia. The defeat of this Serb force is both possible and politically desirable. Yet it does not automatically follow that we should wage war against it ourselves. No British government can be expected to risk the lives of thousands of British troops in a foreign war unless it believes that vital British interests are at stake. Neither the government nor the public believe that about Bosnia, and although we would not be unaffected by the long-term consequences of a Serb victory (further instability in the Balkans, and precedents for aggression elsewhere), it cannot be argued that our national interests are immediately involved. All the more reason, then, why we should rethink our policy now. Instead of becoming more and more involved in a war we do not want to fight, we should step back and stop obstructing the one body which has both the will and the right to fight it: the army of the legitimate Bosnian government. The arms embargo can and should be lifted. Since its legal status is doubtful (it conflicts with the basic right of self-defence, and it was imposed on a state, Yugoslavia, which no longer exists), we need only announce that we will not regard it as applying to Bosnia until a new Security Council resolution specifically says that it does. The deliveries could begin tomorrow. At the same time, we should remove all our own ground troops from Bosnia. They are not sufficient to fight a war, and can only become hostages or targets for reprisals. This does not mean, however, that all aid deliveries would have to cease. Deliveries of every kind could continue through the Croat and Bosnian-held territories, but their security would be the responsibility of the Bosnian government's own forces. Whether we then give the Bosnians support from the air would be a matter for further judgment, both military and political. So long as we could do this at low risk to our pilots, a case could be made for such a limited intervention, not least to redress the imbalance which our own previous intervention (the arms embargo) had created. We might still end up dropping bombs on Serb tanks. But we would be doing so not to reinforce a failed policy -- establishing "safe areas" in a sea of "warring factions" -- but to enable a legitimate government to win a war. The British people might then understand what we were doing, and why.
