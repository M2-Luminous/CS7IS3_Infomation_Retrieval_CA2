Stamps carry a picture of President Kim Il-song looking with a bright smile on his face over fields of golden ears of rice ripe under the rays of the theses and a picture of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il walking through crop fields with farmers. Some stamps depict agricultural working people who are riding Chollima under the banner of the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, and picture socialist cooperative fields where irrigation and electrification have been completed and mechanisation and extensive use of chemicals are being promoted powerfully. There are stamps portraying agricultural working people who are being trained into agronomists and assistant agronomists and many other stamps showing the successful promotion of the ideological, technical and cultural revolutions in the countryside. Postcards and envelopes reflect the validity and vitality of the socialist rural theses.
