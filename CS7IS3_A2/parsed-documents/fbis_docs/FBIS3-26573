At that time, Shiyijie had just "dispensed with using primitive picks to excavate coal and wicker baskets for miners to carry coal by crawling along the tunnel on all fours." With the help of pneumatic drills and electric carts, they had managed to "create" an output of 1.688 tonnes per worker per shift -- a record high across China. The "mechanization" of the Shiyijie coal mine was worthy of representing the Chinese coal industry's level of modernization in the early 1960's. At that time, some developed countries already had begun to adopt comprehensive coal mining technology, which integrates coal drilling, the haulage system, and shaft support in a single, systematic operation. In China, however, only some individual mines were equipped with mechanized coal mining equipment imported from the USSR. To Chinese miners, comprehensive coal mining was, beyond a doubt, a dream that would come true only in the remote future. Shiyijie today serves very well to demonstrate the level of modernization in China's coal mines with its entirely new feature: The degree of mechanization is 100 percent, with comprehensive mining having replaced pneumatic drills. Last year, the Shiyijie coal mine, which has entered the aging period, continued to turn out 4.141 tonnes per worker per shift. Today, modern mines like Shiyijie have spread all over China. By the end of 1992, the degree of mechanization in China's key coal mines had reached 72 percent, of which comprehensive mining equipment accounted for 40 percent, and four mines enjoyed an annual output of more than 2 million tonnes. The highest level of output exceeded 8 tonnes per worker per shift. This showed that the modernization level of China's coal industry was next only to the United States and Australia, and had come to the fore. It is noteworthy that all such comprehensive mining equipment was made in China, and that it has been exported to the United States. Of course, the task is still heavy and the road ahead remains a long one for the modernization of China's coal industry. The degree of modernization in local state-owned mines, which account for 17 percent of China's total coal output, remains at 25 percent as of today, whereas the degree of mechanization of many town and township coal mines, the output of which is equal to that of key state-owned coal mines, has reached the degree of mechanization the Shiyijie coal mine achieved 30 years ago. In 1993, China's coal output was 1.14 billion tonnes; the industry had 7 million workers and staffers; and the efficiency rate was 1.4 tonnes per worker per shift, which was lower than that of Shiyijie 30 years before. Australia, in contrast, turned out 210 million tonnes of crude coal in 1990, the whole industry had only 29,970 workers and staffers, and output was 24 tonnes per worker per shift. The fundamental way to change this 1.4:24 ratio is to achieve mechanization, cut the number of workers, and improve efficiency. The Ministry for Coal Industry recently set out that from now on, the level of mine mechanization must maintain an annual 2-3 percent growth rate, while the work efficiency of all personnel must improve by 5 percent each year.
