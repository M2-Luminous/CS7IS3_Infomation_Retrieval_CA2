[Valencia] First we want to praise the extraordinary election day activities led by Andres Pastrana on Sunday in which more than 3.5 million votes were secured, within the framework of a big partisan movement that has created a balance of power in the nation. The Conservative Party, as you know, is a traditional party, which is permanently in force, has a hierarchy, and obviously participated very actively, very strongly, and with very good results, through a major partisan movement, during Andres Pastrana's presidential campaign. The National Directorate will meet today to assess the electoral results and to highlight the work of the Conservative Party. We want to express our appreciation to all the directors, congressmen, deputies, councilmen, and party leaders, in general, because the party truly had an extraordinary and historical day. Within that order of priorities, we are analyzing the positions the president-elect has been presenting. Obviously, in accordance with that attitude, we are going to make a decision in this regard. For starters, from a democratic point of view, we recognize Ernesto Samper's victory. We wish him success, because what we want is for Colombia to succeed. [Reporter] As president of the National Directorate of the Conservative party, I would like to say that the Conservative Party provided enormous support at the voting tables. Nevertheless, there are those who pose this question: Will the Conservative Party let itself be absorbed by the democratic force represented by Dr. Pastrana and his supraparty ideology, or will the Conservative Party begin reorganizing its followers as an alternative to power? [Valencia] I believe that neither Dr. Pastrana nor we are interested in losing the Conservative Party's historical stance. I want to give an explanation to ensure that the country will understand the structural differences between the Liberal and Conservative Parties. The Liberal presidential candidate and the party leadership became confused, while by national convention, we elected Andres Pastrana as part a large supraparty movement. [Reporter] Dr. Valencia, let me fulfill a commitment we have every day at 0730; we can then continue with this conversation, which is very important because many political sectors are anxiously waiting for it. [Valencia] Of course, Carlos. [Reporter] We were talking with Fabio Valencia, the Conservative Party's National Directorate president. He was answering an important question, which I will repeat to Dr. Valencia. [Reporter] Will the Conservative Party now reassume an alternative-power position or will it continue participating in the New Democratic Force [NFD]? [Valencia] I believe we must make a distinction at this point. The Conservative Party is a permanent and historic party, with its own hierarchy and legal identity. Out of conviction, we took Andres Pastrana as the supraparty candidate, and we participated as part of the NFD. In the case of the Liberal Party, the candidate and the head of the party were the same person. In our case, we chose our president and a supraparty president, whose participation and national leadership were undisputed. The Conservative Party chose a candidate, but the party's leadership remained with its national directorate, and its legal representation [words indistinct]. As I said before, the structures of the parties are different. The Conservative Party is obviously intact, and it has a clear representation in Congress. I reiterate: We are ready to continue working on behalf of the country and promoting the ideas of change advocated by Pastrana during his campaign. [Reporter] Would the Conservative Party collaborate with President Samper instead of the NFD, or, vice versa, would Pastrana's followers and the NFD collaborate with Samper instead of the Conservative Party? [Valencia] There is a very significant circumstance at this point: Andres Pastrana represents half of all Colombians, who chose him for his ideas and leadership. From this angle, no one can deny the significance of the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party, considering the political hierarchy--Pastrana noted it last night--is not in his hands, but in ours, and we are working on this basis. [Reporter] Therefore, that decision is yours and not Pastrana's. Do you believe that the Conservative Party should participate in the government? [Valencia] We, together with all the friends of the Conservative Party, are studying the situation. We will hold consultations with all the parliamentarians and will meet with the National Directorate today. We are waiting to see the attitude of President-elect Samper, because he has the first say on this. The ball is in his court. [Reporter] Consequently, Dr. Valencia, would you be willing to talk to President-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano to define the Conservative Party's possible cooperation, if any, with the next government? [Valencia] Obviously, as president of the National Directorate I have the authority to make these kinds of contacts and, I believe, they are very important for the country. We have a very positive attitude, and, of course, we are also very aware of the situation. However, we really want the country to be able to start on the road toward advancement and development, and, hopefully, we will do this as smoothly as possible. [Reporter] In other words, you do not believe the Colombian Conservative Party should oppose the next government? [Valencia] I believe this depends totally on the attitude assumed by the president. The president has to study what has happened in the country. Andres Pastrana is really a very important national leader. He managed to convince the entire Conservative Party to back his program and political platform, as well as independent and important sectors from the Liberal Party. I believe the president-elect of the Republic, who already has to think like a head of state, will study this new political situation, the breakdown in Congress, and all of the factors a president must consider to have a good government. [Reporter] What is the mood within your party on the possibility of assuming the role of the new opposition? [Valencia] I believe the Conservative Party really cares about Colombia's well-being and is willing to back the good things presented by the government, as well as being willing to criticize the bad things. At this time, however, as I have already stated, it is not up to the Conservative Party to decide whether or not it will participate in the government. This is a privilege of the president-elect. However, we have a positive attitude and the highest level of patriotic will, and, as I told you, we will back the good and criticize the bad. [Reporter] Before I continue asking questions, we have to congratulate you for the extraordinary amount of Conservative votes--specifically, 471,834 votes--obtained in Antioquia. We also want to ask another question regarding the Conservative Party's immediate actions in Congress. What parliamentary actions will the Conservative Party emphasize? [Valencia] First, thank you very much for your compliments on the votes received in Antioquia. We have a great team in the region. All of the Conservative Party members worked hard, and we also know a large number of independent liberals voted in our favor. [words indistinct] Antioquia has had experience in changes. We have been changing for the past five years. We started with the Constituent Assembly, and later we got Juan Gomez elected to the governor's post and Luis Alfredo Ramos to the mayor's post. That is why Andres Pastrana's victory in Antioquia was so overwhelming. Regarding the work to be done in the legislature, we will be calling to a meeting of the Conservative Party bloc. As you know, we have 30 senators and more than 60 representatives. Therefore, we have a very important force in Congress. We are going to work to further the country's best interests. The party has made great advances under Andres Pastrana's leadership within the context of the supraparty movement, and we do not want to squander this great historic opportunity. [Reporter] From Antioquia, Orlando Carames will ask the next question. [Carames] Thank you. Dr. Valencia, gubernatorial and mayoral elections will be held in October. Based on the work done by the multipartisan United Antioquia Movement, Governor Juan Gomez and Medellin Mayor Luis Alfredo Ramos were elected in the previous election. Will this experiment be repeated, or will the party go it alone in the upcoming elections, now that it has an autonomous electoral force of more than 471,000 votes? [Valencia] I believe the situation in Antioquia has to be studied. However, I repeat, I believe Antioquia voted with the supraparty movement because, as you stated, Orlando, the United Antioquia emerged precisely from the convergence of several political forces [words indistinct] liberal and independent sectors, and even from the M/19 [19 April Movement/Democratic Alliance]. This, I believe, gave us very good results. We all want serious, effective leaders who have good management skills. An example of such leaders are Juan Gomez Martinez and Luis Alfredo Ramos. We want the very best for Antioquia.
