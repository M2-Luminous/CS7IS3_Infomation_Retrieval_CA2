The memorandum was published at a time when the revived Japanese militarists are trying to take a military action against the Korean people, gravely jeopardizing peace and security in the Korean peninsula and the rest of Asia. The lengthy memorandum under the title "Japan was directly involved in the war of aggression against Korea" says Japan together with the United States prepared the war of aggression against Korea and served as a logistic base, supply base, repair base and attack base for the U.S. Forces during the Korean war and directly involved itself in germ warfare. "The Japanese militarists directly participated in the war of aggression in Korea started by the U.S. imperialists in the 1950s and committed a hostile military action against the Korean people, but this fact has remained a secret," the memorandum says, adding: "This is why we are opening the materials to the public." Recalling that Japan participated in the U.S.-imposed Korean war in violation of international laws and its "peaceful" constitution and inflicted immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings on the Korean people, the memorandum warns: "If the Japanese reactionaries expect `a shower of gold' again in `a second Korean war', it is a big mistake."
