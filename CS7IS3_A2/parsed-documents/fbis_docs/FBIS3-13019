TISHRIN says: Welcoming any European or international effort to activate the peace process, we reaffirm that peace is a collective interest, and that the conditions and bases of peace must be responded to in a positive and constructive spirit. The paper notes that Europe has come to realize that peace cannot be achieved under the continued Israeli occupation and that partial agreements and separate deals cannot lead to lasting peace. Europe has also come to realize that no peace is possible under the continued Israeli terrorism, massacres, and crimes. TISHRIN says: Undoubtedly, when it denounces all those Israeli anti-peace practices, Europe stresses its demands and calls for the establishment of a just, comprehensive peace. Naturally, these demands and denunciations of Israeli practices should be linked to practical stands and measures leading to an active and effective European role to help Arabs restore their rights and territories and to halt the Israeli massacres. Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN says: Europe should move to assume its political responsibilities toward the situation in the region, including the issue of a just, comprehensive peace, and the enforcement of the resolutions of the international legitimacy, which primarily call for Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.
