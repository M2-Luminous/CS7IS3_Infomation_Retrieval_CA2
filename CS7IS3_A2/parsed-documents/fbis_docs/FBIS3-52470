Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam says that following Israel's agreement with the PLO, Syria informed the U.S. side that it did not agree to resume negotiations because Oslo constituted a deviation from the Madrid formula. However, subsequent contacts were held and an agreement was reached on a meeting between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad in Geneva, he added. Khaddam asserted that Syria's position continues to be clear and the same, that peace must lead to implementing UN resolutions and to a comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. Khaddam criticized the Israeli-Arab meetings under the name of multilaterals and repeated Syria's position on them. He indicated that such issues should not be discussed before the issue of peace and Israeli withdrawal is settled. Khaddam said Syria does not feel that it is weak otherwise it would not have gone to the peace negotiations. This is because the weak would enter negotiations at his expense and at the expense of his land, as he put it. The Syrian vice president criticized the Oslo agreement, stressing the importance of a comprehensive solution on all fronts of struggle and said: Many attempts have been made to reach solutions with Syria for Syrian territory only. Syria rejected all these attempts because it is convinced of the pan-Arab nature of the struggle and the need for a comprehensive solution.
