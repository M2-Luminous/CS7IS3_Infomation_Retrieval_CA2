It was originally called reconnaissance, and this name is still used because the military secret services like to call themselves reconnaissance units. The difference between intelligence [hirszerzes] and reconnaissance [felderites] in the classical sense is that reconnaissance is mainly the visual acquisition of information while intelligence is infiltrating enemy organizations through agents and technical means, said an expert who claims to be close to the secret service but who did not wish to name himself, when we interviewed him on this special activity. [Schmidt] What is the correct term, intelligence or spying? [Expert] This depends on the angle of the view. Throughout the world, every secret service calls its offensive body an intelligence service while the enemy's is a spy organization. When we are doing it, we are gathering information, and when the enemy does it, it is spying. [Schmidt] Do all countries maintain an intelligence service? [Expert] All states that consider themselves worth anything use intelligence agents, because it is a vital interest of all powers to learn about the political, economic, and military secrets of their enemies. However, the medium and small countries only maintain military reconnaissance or intelligence, but the activities of these also extend to civil areas. Naturally, the situation is different in the case of a superpower like the United States. Here, in addition to the CIA, all branches of the military practice active intelligence work. [Schmidt] Does the Hungarian secret service operate in both directions? [Expert] Yes, the two organizations are called the military and the civil information offices. [Schmidt] Can it be expected that, after the new elections, the personnel of the secret service or the direction of reconnaissance will change? [Expert] Fundamental changes will probably not take place after the change of the government, although it cannot be excluded that some of the leaders will be replaced, which is certainly not a sensible thing to do. Intelligence should be treated as a professional, rather than a political, organization. [Schmidt] Was the intelligence service also "decimated" after the change of the regime? [Expert] Some experienced intelligence agents were removed from their positions, but the clear-out was not as big as at the National Security Office. [Schmidt] Have the directions of intelligence work changed? [Expert] Essentially, they have. The former enemy turned into a friend and the former friend has turned into a suspicious country that is to be observed. Therefore, everything has to be done the same way as before, only in different directions. [Schmidt] Do the friends spy on each other? [Expert] Friendship and the hunger for information are two different things. Although we and many other countries have rather good relations with the United States, the CIA, as a global intelligence service, is active in all parts of the world, including Hungary. [Schmidt] Are all military attaches intelligence agents at the same time? [Expert] At any rate, it is the task of all military attaches to learn as much as possible about the army and the military secrets of the receiving country. For this reason, out of politeness, the receiving countries invite them to military exercises where they can learn about the armament, equipment, and certain secrets of the army. This is done on a reciprocal basis. The goal of this can be disinformation. [Schmidt] What does "dark" information gathering mean? [Expert] When for example an intelligence agent "disguised" as a diplomat gets to know some important person in the receiving country and acquires information from him in the course of a conversation, without the person knowing that he is giving information to a spy. [Schmidt] Does the intelligence service recruit its agents through pressure? [Expert] Yes and no. It is best if, for some reason, the chosen candidate voluntarily accepts to cooperate. [Schmidt] How much money is normally given to an agent? [Expert] This depends on the agent. It mainly depends on the financial and work position of the person. If someone earns $100,000 then he cannot be given $5,000. The amount has to be proportionate to the value of the information and the level of risk. [Schmidt] After the change of the regime, did the CIA receive the list of our agents working abroad? [Expert] Naturally, it did not. A single ill-considered step like this could mean the end of the intelligence service. The United States understood this and only asked for the material that we had given to the KGB. We did not fulfill this request, either, because they could have derived the names of the agents on the basis of this. [Schmidt] Did the KGB conduct intelligence work against us? [Expert] I am certain that it did not, because we did not have any secrets from them, all data was officially open to them. To prove that they did not have any agents here, when the Soviet troop withdrawals began from Hungary, we received many indications that they were hastily trying to meet this need. They were trying to enlist people. Probably without much success. [Schmidt] Have you ever been approached? [Expert] I have, a number of times. It was an interesting case when I was trying to enlist a South American diplomat and, during the conversation, it became clear that he had also met me in the very elegant restaurant with the intent of enlisting me....
