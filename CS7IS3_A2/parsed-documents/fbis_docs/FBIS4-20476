Now, scientists from the CAS Beijing Vacuum Physics Laboratory (BVPL), researching a new atomic surface modification technique, have succeeded in room-temperature direct manipulation of Si atoms on a surface with a single-crystal silicon (SCS) atomic arrangement. Average line width for these lines drawn on the SCS surface via the STM probe is 2 nm (3-4 Si atoms). An STM image of some sample lines, shown in the accompanying micrograph, clearly reveals these lines forming the three characters ``Mao Zedong,'' as well as the neatly laid-out Si-atom lattice in the background. These are the world's smallest characters ``written'' on a Si surface to date: average character size is 2 millionths of a cm [i.e., 20 nm].

Finally, these scientists were able to neatly transplant the atoms on the Si surface along a lattice orientation to form a new straight line in a technique they called ``sequenced transplantation.'' These three breakthrough achievements in atomic-scale surface modification and machining represent a major advance in a high technology generally recognized as being of major significance in the coming century, especially in areas such as high-density information storage, nanoscale-device and quantum-well-device development, and new materials synthesis.
