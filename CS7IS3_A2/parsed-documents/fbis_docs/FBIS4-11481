FBIS4-11481 "drlat082_j_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Panama Presidential Candidates Hold Last Debate Presidential Candidates Hold Last Debate PA2804011194 PA2804011194 BFN [Editorial Report] Panama City Television Networks in Spanish at 0100 GMT on 26 April broadcast a live debate by four Panamanian presidential candidates -- Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Revolutionary Democratic party (PRD); Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement; Ruben Dario Carles of the Change '94 coalition; and Eduardo Vallarino of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) -- from the TVN television studios in Panama City. The debate, which is moderated by Rodrigo Eisenmann, president of the Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies (ILDEA), includes panelists Rosa Maria Britton, Octavio del Moral, and Roberto Reichard, who pose questions to the four candidates. The debate is sponsored by ILDEA and the Media Presidential Debate Committee. The debate gets under way with Britton asking Perez Balladares if the development of science and technology is necessary for the nation's modernization, indicating that Panama and Haiti are the only Latin American nations that do not have a state council devoted to science and technology. Britton asks: "What policy would your government adopt for the development of science and technology in our country?" Perez Balladares replies: "We have proposed increased integration between the private sector and the national education system." Britton then asks whether Perez Balladares has taken into consideration the creation of a technology ministry, such as in Costa Rica. To this Perez Balladares replies that this would be a bit overly ambitious, and, instead, he would opt for a science and technological institute closely linked to the private sector, because a ministry would tend to get bogged down in bureaucracy. Commenting on this same topic, Vallarino says he does not agree with the formation of a science and technology institute; rather scientific and technological development should be centered within the universities. Carles comments that there are already too many institutions, and therefore this issue must be analyzed and reviewed. Blades says, "Until the nation defines where it is headed, it will not be possible to integrate any technological knowledge." He adds: "The nation must first define its course, its development, and those areas that will require technicians." Next, Reichard poses a question to Vallarino. Taking into account Panama's limitations, Reichard asks what areas should be stressed to improve the nation's living conditions in the next five years. Vallarino replies, "Considerable improvement can only be achieved by raising Panamanians' income, and, in order to do this, job opportunities must be increased." He continues by pointing out that official statistics indicate that Panamanians' real income has not risen within the past 20 years. Commenting on the same subject, Carles says that if the resources used for education, health, transportation, electrical power, water, communications, public security, and social security were managed more efficiently, they would improve the standard of living. Blades, meanwhile, says: "We must create an opportunity for investments to come and remain in Panama, and these investments should not be concentrated in the Province of Panama." Vallarino also comments on this issue: "Social services are very important for Panamanians with low income." To raise the standard of living, we must provide much better public services. Perez Balladares makes a final comment on this issue: "I share the view that in order to enjoy a good standard of living, one must have a good job." Therefore, he adds, we have taken into account means of generating more jobs. He also says income must be redistributed through state-run investments. However, he notes, none of this is can happen if the nation fails to raise its cultural level. Octavio del Moral asks Carles to outline specific solutions in his program to ease the dreadful conditions of the prison system. Carles responds that the citizens who have been sentenced to jail must pay for their crimes; however, the state should provide the means for inmates to serve their sentences in a decent manner. Historically, Carles says, the Panamanian state has been negligent in creating institutions that serve as rehabilitation and education centers. In further commenting on the poor state of the country's prisons, Carles says the state has failed to provide adequate conditions and training for inmates, despite having built a new prison. He says his administration intends to review the prison system and to relocate prison installations to more adequate places, as well as to try to improve the conditions under which the inmates are currently living. In responding on the same issue, Blades says that in 1973 he visited the Coiba penal colony and was able to ascertain conditions on the island. According to Blades, one of the things that has never existed in Panama is the inclination to confront the problem once and for all. He also notes there has never been any interest in clarifying whether the system is designed to punish or to rehabilitate. Blades adds, "Not only has the situation not changed, but it has deteriorated." According to Blades, the problem not only lies in the prisons, but also in a judicial system that has proved to be ineffective. Perez Balladares says there are three problems with the prison system which must be attacked: 1) insufficient facilities, 2) preventing crimes through programs aimed at educating, and 3) training programs aimed at rehabilitating criminals for the day they will reenter society. He adds that prisons currently serve "more to train inmates for further criminal activities than as deterrent." According to Perez Balladares, one solution to this could be the creation of halfway houses to train inmates on how to reenter society. Vallarino says he believes conditions in Panama's prisons are beyond words, adding that there have been instances when society's attitude against inmates are sometimes more heinous that those of the inmates against society. In response to a question on efforts to encourage education in Panama, Blades says one of the first things that must be done is to increase funds earmarked for education -- funds which today are "outrageously inadequate." Perez Balladares, meanwhile, says that if the nation invests in cultural issues, it will be able to garner more productivity from its human investment. According to Vallarino, if the nation expects to promote education, it must focus on the problem from within the family, because this is where any individual's first experiences originate. One of the main problems that currently prevents promoting education, according to Carles, lies in the numerous state institutions that interfere with one another. There is no coordination between these institutions, which, in turn, has merely created an unwanted bureaucracy. Panelist Roberto Reichard asks how each candidate would confront the problem of limited resources and how to distribute these resources equitably among an ever-increasing population. Perez Balladares says his administration plans to create an urban planning agency to provide basic services to each community in an ordered manner to prevent the demographic chaos that could take place at the end of the century. With respect to disorderly population growth, Perez Balladares says he does not advocate population control campaigns, but instead he supports programs by institutions such as the Family Planning Association. In discussing the population issue, the other three candidates agree that the fundamental problem lies in inadequate information at all levels of society. On the other hand, Blades believes the situation is further complicated by irresponsible fatherhood plus the lack of respect toward women, both of which are cultural problems. Candidate Vallarino is asked whether he plans to amend the Labor Code, and, if so, how. Vallarino replies that the Labor Code is "certainly one of the factors inhibiting investment in Panama." Noting that the Labor Code is obsolete, he adds: "Panama's labor leaders know this perfectly well. I would not amend the Labor Code. I would make the unions, in a joint effort with the private sector, amend the Labor Code." Based on his experience as president of the Labor Foundation, he says it is possible to "reach an understanding without any side having to renounce its interests." He adds: "Negotiation and a consensus are possible, even easy, if goodwill and understanding between the sides exist." Commenting on Vallarino's answer, Carles notes that, while promoting assembly plant activity in the country, he has learned "it is easy to find a consensus between workers and businessmen, and the state should not meddle, play politics, or discriminate in favor of one party or the other." He adds that some laws are hampering the development of new business activities. On the same subject, Blades points to the Stability, Competitiveness, and Employment Pact established in Mexico, which seeks to generate more jobs "without worsening working conditions." He adds: "I believe we can reach such a point through a concerted effort. I believe we must not worsen Panamanian working conditions." Blades says new formulas must be presented in order that both business and labor understand "they are a part of Panamanian society, and that a consensus must be reached without allowing class-related, ideological, or economic interests to prevail." In the opinion of Perez Balladares, the key word on this topic is "competitiveness," and to achieve this, "we must have a Labor Code that allows us to compete with other countries vying with us for investments." He adds, "We must also have efficient private enterprise, because we cannot pin the blame on the workers." He also says, "We must have a state that promotes a consensus and which is, in turn, efficient in providing necessary services." Panelist Britton broaches the topic of the country's health care system, and he asks Carles how he would improve the country's health services. Carles answers that the state earmarks a significant amount of money to this sector, "but we must improve its level of efficiency by having more doctors placed in charge of administration." He adds that public services are not just inefficient because of a lack of funds, but also because of mismanagement. Blades notes that health care is of utmost concern. He feels the system must not be politicized and resources should be better allocated. Perez Balladares, in turn, notes that all major health indicators have dropped in the country, and he says the lack of adequate drinking water is one of the reasons for this. Vallarino says that in this campaign he has had the opportunity to visit many hospitals. He believes that decentralizing health services would enable each community to have a greater say in improving services. Reichard asks Blades what specific actions he would take to stop illegal mass immigration. The Papa Egoro candidate begins by saying a law has to be enacted to define the functions of the police, including the border police. He adds that the government is one of the "chief culprits" in allowing the smuggling of illegal aliens into the country. Reichard then asks Blades to specify what measures can be taken to prevent this. In Blades' opinion, "the corruption generated by this sort of activity" has to be combated. He argues that for many poorly paid public employees, this activity constitutes "almost a survival mechanism." In addition, the opportunity for smuggling illegal aliens exists because "crime generally goes unpunished in the country." He adds, "We have to punish those who break the law," and this will immediately send a signal from the highest level of government to the lowest. Speaking on this same topic, Perez Balladares say some ethnic groups are exploited by being asked to pay huge sums for visas in order to emigrate from their native countries. He says he would take steps to keep these people from being exploited by their own compatriots who are in Panama or by immigration officials. He agrees that police working in border areas need to be professionalized. Vallarino says the Immigration Law needs a complete overhaul, "because Panamanians have not yet decided who we want to come to Panama." Carles agrees on the need to revise the Immigration Law, because this is a problem of corruption "that begins in the consulates, the Public Registry Office, and the Immigration Office." Perez Balladares stresses the need to introduce legislative reforms that will permit expediting judicial cases. He says such cases can be accelerated with the support of the lawyers. Panelist Octavio del Moral notes that Perez Balladares has suggested the next attorney general be selected from a list to be supplied by the Bar Association and the Law School, but notes adds that in the last bar election, 91 percent of its members abstained from voting. This, therefore, would be undemocratic. Perez Balladares says he does not agree with this argument, because the lawyers are being consulted, and if they do not want to participate, then that is their prerogative. Vallarino claims that the fundamental problem in the administration of justice has been the selection of those individuals who impart justice, recalling the cases of the last two attorney generals. Carles notes that the quality of personnel both in the Attorney General's Office and in the judicial system "must be improved." He says he would not rely on the Bar Association and unions, because that is where the worst manipulators have existed for years. He suggests seeking a variety of options to end impunity, deficiencies, and the slow administration of justice. Blades notes that the main problem in this area has been the nonexistence of budgets needed for an expeditious handling of justice. At this point, Britton asks about the Panama Canal, which requires constant maintenance. She says this cannot be achieved if it is administered with the bureaucracy that has prevailed in the government. Vallarino responds: "The Canal needs autonomy, but real autonomy. The National Assembly is already studying constitutional reforms that are directed toward that goal. I and 100 other Panamanians helped prepare those regulations. Our primary concern was to keep the Canal administration from suffering from the vices that occur regularly in the Panamanian Government and -- I do not want to exclude it -- in the U.S. Government. We are not unique in this. So autonomy is definitely a part of the constitutional reform." To the same question, Carles states: "The Canal will efficiently perform its task; that is, transiting ships. Our problems lie in the decisionmaking process. Important decisions have to be made at the administrative level. The Americans have trained thousands of Panamanians for many years. In that respect, the Canal will operate correctly. Let's not have any doubt about that. We need to prepare ourselves for the decisionmaking process. We need to have the appropriate means to make policy decisions on wages, purchases, investments, tolls, and employment." Blades responds: "I would like to say two things. First, the Canal situation should be viewed in terms of the law and the personnel. What worked for 79 years should continue to work the same way with the same efficiency. In other words, things must be done intelligently with the same efficiency and by remaining consistent with our laws, the laws that allowed the Canal to operate efficiently for 79 years, even if they are U.S. laws. We must make them consistent with our laws. "Second, the labor situation in the Canal Zone should not deteriorate. The same circumstances that have made employees happy and led to uninterrupted success -- that is, the successful operation of the Panama Canal for 79 years -- should be maintained." Regarding the Canal, Perez Balladares responds: "There is a Panamanian saying that sums it up quite well. If it isn't broken, don't fix it. I think the Panama Canal has been working perfectly well for many years. We have to make our laws, Panamanian laws, consistent with the system and assimilate the practices, personnel policies, wage administration policies, the merit system, everything that has made the Canal function well. Then there must be a total decentralization." Perez Balladares adds: "We hope that on 31 December 1999, the only ones who will know that there has been a change of administration will be the Panamanians. The rest of the world will see the Canal functioning normally." Vallarino adds, "We have the talent to administer the Canal, perhaps better than it is being administered now." Reichard asks Carles that, if he is elected president, when he ends his term in August 1999, what kind of nation will he bequeath to future generations in the year 2000. Carles responds: "The 8 May elections will be the most important in the country's history, because we must create the institutions that will permit the smooth transition from the present to the future. For instance, if elected, one of the first things I must do is consolidate the monetary system to ensure financial and economic stability." Noting that Panamanians have greater capabilities than many people give them credit for, Carles begins answering a question on whether or not he can, within five years, instill a feeling of hope among the Panamanians. He explains: "This is not a poor country. We just have to manage our resources better. As comptroller I learned how to manage things. As comptroller, I corrected the pattern of waste in public funds evidenced in the videotape" released on national television by President Guillermo Endara. Carles notes that what is required is "a balanced budget, fiscal stability, and disciplined public finances." Ruben Blades, responding to the same question, says it is indeed possible to instill hope in the people within five years. Perez Balladares says his commitment is to the future and to a united Panama. Vallarino says unity is necessary for the sake of the country's future. Carles takes the floor again and notes that it is fine to think about the future, but he warns the past cannot be forgotten. "I wish," he states, "we could engage in a real debate and speak about what the PRD represents for the country's future, especially considering that notions and practices involving statism and interventionism continue to prevail." Panelist Octavio del Moral then asks the candidates whether the Panamanian Constitution has become a shackle inhibiting the establishment of true democracy in the country. Ruben Blades says he favors a Constituent Assembly, but he does not favor simply putting "patches" on the Constitution. Perez Balladares responds to the same question in this way: "Of course the Constitution has to be changed, modified, and made adequate for reaching national objectives. Perhaps this will contribute to securing the reconciliation we so much desire." Vallarino says he favorably views a Constituent Assembly, but he warns this process could impose a six-month delay on Panama's economic and social development. "Such a delay is critical for those who do not have a job and have to resolve basic needs." He adds, "In my opinion, this project is of secondary importance, considering the many social needs of the Panamanian people today." Carles affirms that the current Constitution "is the result of the aberrant and arrogant presence of a military caste and its political expression -- namely, the PRD. This must come to an end." Carles adds that, if elected, on 9 May he will create "a commission that will present proposals on how to reform the Constitution or how to prepare the way for a Constituent Assembly." Ruben Blades then makes his final statement in which he says that he would not hold a Constituent Assembly right away because there are other priorities, but he adds that it is important to hold one. Moderator Rodrigo Eisenmann closes the debate by thanking the candidates, the panelists, and the television viewers.
