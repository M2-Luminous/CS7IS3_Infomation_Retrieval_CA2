As has already been reported, while talking about strong countermeasures and the like at the recent so-called high-ranking policymakers conference and security-related ministers' meeting, the South Korean ruling bunches are perpetrating the extremely provocative [simhi tobalchogin] arms reinforcement maneuvers of introducing Patriot missiles into South Korea in conspiracy with the United States. Not satisfied with turning South Korea into the largest nuclear powderkeg in the Far East, filled with some 1,000 nuclear weapons, and into an exhibition of murderous weapons with various types of up-to-date war equipment, the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean ruling bunches now are attempting to introduce Patriot missiles and other new armed forces into South Korea. Such an act is not only an open threat [kongongyonhan wihyop] against us, but is also a persistent and open provocative act for a northward invasion to ignite a nuclear war by intentionally aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula [chosonbandoui chongserul kouijoguro kinjangsikyo kutkunnae haekchonjaengui pulchibul toturiryonun nogolchogin pukchim tobal haengwi]. I bitterly condemn [chunyolhi kyutan] the reckless arms reinforcement maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean ruling bunches who are introducing Patriot missiles into South Korea, branding them as a flagrant challenge to the entire nation's desire for peace and denuclearization in the Korean peninsula and as an intolerable nation killing act [yongnap motal minjok myolsal haengwi] to provoke a nuclear war by intentionally aggravating the situation. [applause] The deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea by U.S. imperialists and the South Korean ruling bunches despite the protest and condemnation of all the Korean people at home and abroad and the peace-loving people of the world is part of the U.S. maneuvers to make the Korean peninsula the source of a new war in accordance with its policy toward Korea and strategy toward Asia. It is also a direct product of the South Korean puppet clique's insidious political and military attempt to plot to harm and to crush fellow countrymen on the strength of outside forces. Since it pursues aggression, the United States does not welcome the alleviation of the Korean peninsula's situation and the improvement in North-South relations. It has promoted distrust [pulsingamul chosonghago] between the North and the South and has aggravated confrontation and tensions between them by (?agitating) antinational elements [panminjok punjadul] of South Korea in an obsolete way [kutaeuiyonhage]. After reversing the agreement reached at the New York contact between the DPRK and the United States to finally rupture DPRK-U.S. talks, the United States is now expanding steps of military provocation maneuvers to threaten us. This proves that the United States has no intention to resolve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way and that it has only the insidious aim to threaten, isolate, and crush [apsal] us by force. It has been the nature of all successive South Korean colonial puppet regimes to devote themselves to war provocations against fellow countrymen by depending upon outside forces, and this nature has become broader and more vicious under the so-called civilian rule. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: The South Korean authorities have frequently conducted large-scale military exercises against our republic in collusion with outside forces, and they are driving North-South relations to a dangerous phase, talking about military countermeasures, an international cooperation system, and the like under the pretext of our nuclear issue. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has increased funds for maintaining U.S. occupation forces in South Korea since he came into power, and provides over $3 billion to keep the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea. The puppet clique has also placed South Korean harbor facilities at the disposal of the United States according to the Wartime Host Nations Support Agreement signed between the two. It did not hesitate even in committing the flunkyist and nation-selling act of opening the whole rice market to the United States in return for bagging an international cooperation system, in the ambition of harming [mohae] and crushing [apsal] fellow countrymen with the borrowed sword of outside forces. Agitated by the United States, their master, the South Korean puppets are deepening North-South confrontation by engaging in a northward invasion maneuver more frantically then ever. It is the South Korean rulers that stirred up South-North confrontation and the northward invasion mood by paying frequent visits to military units and war exercise grounds at the frontline around the Military Demarcation Line and by talking about strong military countermeasures. It is none other than the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique with its civilian mask that has turned South Korea's entirety into a scene of terrible war with the daily staging of the provocative Team Spirit joint military exercise and other titled and untitled war exercises, including Hwarang, Ssangyong, Ulchi, and Focus-Lens exercises. Voices of warmongers which aggravate North-South confrontation have become harsher during South Korea's freeze of North-South dialogue by the Kim Yong-sam ring. Frantic war commotions are also being kicked up every day. On 22 March, the Kim Yong-sam ring called together the puppet army's bosses to Chongwadae [presidential office] and ordered them to put the puppet armed forces in a state of alert by babbling about the being thoroughly prepared for a northward invasion through the so-called cooperative system with the United States. Also, that same day, the U.S. ambassador to Seoul, the commander of the U.S. forces occupying South Korea, the boss of the puppet Ministry of National Defense, and the boss of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held discussions on the northward invasion and took successive provocative steps against us. Following this, the so-called minister of the South Korean Ministry of National Defense even widely announced a new operational plan 5027, a northward invasion war plan, which was formulated in a joint cooperation with the U.S. imperialists. All these serious moves by the South Korean puppets show that their provocative plots for northward invasion have been now reached a very grave stage [maeu omjunghan tangye]. Because of the arms buildup plot and the indiscriminative northward invasion maneuver by warmongering U.S. imperialists and South Koreans who are kicking up war hysteria, today the situation on the Korean peninsula is being strained at its breaking point in which a nuclear war can suddenly result, even from an accidental mistake [onului pandojongsenun ubalchogin silsue uihaesodo pulsie haekchonjaenguro ponjyojilsu innun ilchokchukpalui wigie chingmyonhada]. The situation on the Korean peninsula, in which the North and South even discussed an exchange of special envoys just some time ago, has rapidly reached the brink of war. This is because the Kim Yong-sam ring have committed an adventurous military provocative plot to crush [apsal] us, their same fellow countrymen by following outside forces. Such a grave situation in which a danger of new war is imminent [sae chonjaeng wihomi nunape paktuhago innun] proves that it is the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique who is the nation-seller of the times, the peace-breaker, and the nation-separator who does not want peace and peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula. Reality clearly shows that without removing the anti-national ring, such as the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique, we cannot improve North-South relations at any moment nor achieve national unity or the reunification of the fatherland, and that the nation cannot avoid nuclear disaster. All fellow countrymen at home and abroad, who oppose war but instead want peace and reunification, must rise up as one to conduct an anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle. The South Korean people from all walks of life must smash the Kim Yong-sam ring's flunkyist and nation-selling plot of relying on outside forces at every step and smash its fascist, nation-separating plots of war in all places. The one who is creating a nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula, aggravating the North-South confrontation, and promoting a war of aggression toward the North is none other than the United States. The South Korean people should resolutely block and rupture the introduction of U.S. destructive weapons, including Patriot missiles, and more vigorously inflame the struggle against America and for independence [panmi chajuhwa tujaeng]. The United States must stop its foolish act of exercising influence over South Korean antinational elements who have been abandoned by the nation and branded as a target to be trampled, and immediately discontinue the introduction of nuclear war equipment and reckless provocation maneuver for a new war. If the United States continues to place Patriot missiles in South Korea, resumes the Team Spirit joint military exercise, and clings to the reckless aggression maneuver against us babbling that pressure on North Korea should be strengthened through real actions [silchi haengdong], it will be totally responsible for the grave consequence [omjunghan huga] thereafter. Our people are not the ones who would be frightened by the military threats by the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets. Our people, who are single-heartedly united around the beloved and respected Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il who has peerless courage, iron-clad will, and ever-victorious wisdom and tactics, are fully prepared to fight against any provocation by the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppet clique. If the enemies dare to challenge us, we will punish [chingbol] them hundreds and thousands times more. [applause] If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula due to the aggression of the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets, what we lose is the Military Demarcation Line, and the only ones that will disappear from this land are invaders and the nation's traitor bunch. All the people in the northern half of the republic should closely watch the enemies' provocation maneuvers of northward aggression with keen alertness. If the enemies challenge us, all the people should firmly hold a rifle in one hand, hammer and sickle in the other, strengthen the might of socialism by effecting a great revolutionary upsurge in all sectors and units, and turn the entire country into an iron-walled fortress so that we could sweep them with a single blow. Along with this, we should vigorously carry out the movement to consider our factories, our farms, and our schools as our outposts, to care about and love the People's Army with family love and to wholeheartedly support the Army. As long as we have the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is an ever-victorious iron-clad courageous general and outstanding military strategist, and as long as we bear the undoubted belief and firm will of the iron truth that we will win without fail, we have nothing to be afraid of, and even if the globe breaks up and the sky falls down, our chuche fatherland will stand aloft as the sanctum of socialism in the world, forever flaunting a socialist banner. [applause] Let us all single-heartedly unite around the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Kim Chong-il, and all the more vigorously fight on to smash [chitpusida] the antirepublic maneuvers of the imperialists and their hunting dogs and to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland and the perfect victory of socialism. [applause]
