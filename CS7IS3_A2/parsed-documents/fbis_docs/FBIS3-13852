In a statement issued today, the General Secretariat cited Security Council Resolution 904, which condemns the massacre, urges measures to guarantee the safety of Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories, calls for international or foreign presence in those areas and the confiscation of the Israeli settlers' weapons, and urges further efforts by the peace conference co-sponsors to revive the peace process. The statement pointed out that the contents of the resolution are guidelines that must be built upon to attain a comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East, particularly as its clauses are similar to some parts of the Arab League Council's resolution of 27 February on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The Arab League General Secretariat appealed to the Security Council to implement its resolution with due speed, demanding that the resolution not be subjected to Israeli procrastination and evasion designed to dilute it. The statement noted that expeditious implementation of the resolution, being in line with existing international agreements, will protect the unarmed Palestinian people from Israeli practices. The Secretariat reiterated its firm position on the Arabness of Jerusalem and the need to abide by UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 252, 338, 425, and 465.
