Korean Students Slam Campus Suppression" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- About 200 students of Chonnam National University of South Korea formed an Emergency Measure Committee to denounce the search of campuses and defend the Kwangju-South Cholla Provincial Federation of General Student Councils (Namchongnyon) on June 19 before launching an all-night sit-in strike, a radio report from Seoul said. The students strongly denounced the puppet authorities for hurling police into their university, walking away students and perpetrating search and confiscation for the mere reason that students in this area went to Seoul to participate in a people's rally to check the "parliamentary endorsement of the Uruguay Round accord" and held protests. The students pointed out that the puppet authorities' suppression is aimed at disuniting the Namchongnyon, and demanded an immediate release of their fellow students.
