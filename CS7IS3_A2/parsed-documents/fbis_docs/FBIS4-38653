He said that the initiative is especially topical in the light of the acute debates in the State Duma around the issue of staging the exercises in the Totskiy grounds in Russia. There is ample reason to change the site, Lukin holds. Russia is living with a feeling of enhanced national self-awareness, responsibility and even "trampled national pride." That is why the nascent partnership with other countries, including the U.S., must be tactful and careful. In this connection Lukin welcomed the initiative of the U.S. legislators who seem to appreciate the complexity of the current situation in Russia.
