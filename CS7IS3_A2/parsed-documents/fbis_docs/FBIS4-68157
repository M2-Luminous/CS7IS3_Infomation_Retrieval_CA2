No one can actually claim that the official Kuwaiti organs are responsible for this behavior or that they know of it. Our brilliant Kuwaiti colleague, Ahmad al-Jarallah, writer for AL-SIYASAH newspaper, wrote an article about this issue, which has been republished by AKHBAR AL-YAWM. He linked the fact that President Mubarak did not visit Kuwait on his journey home from China to the material and propaganda support the terrorist movements are getting from certain religious societies. Perhaps al-Jarallah's analysis is correct, or perhaps it exaggerates. But there is no doubt that he supports his view well by referring to the incident in which a Kuwaiti citizen who has close links with a famous Kuwaiti Islamic society arrived in Cairo with thousands of dollars that he was going to spend in a suspicious way. He claimed that the money was to be used to publish some books. [see item NC3004193394 in 5 May Terrorism Report] [passage omitted] The fact that the security organs found large amounts of foreign currency in some terrorist dens has raised questions about its sources. It was also natural that there is a growing conviction that there is foreign funding to buy weapons, pay agents, and spend set up and carry out terrorist crimes. It is no secret to anyone that in some Arab countries that hide behind the cloak of Islam, the religion of justice, some groups and societies are soliciting funds from their citizens on the pretext of helping Bosnia or Afghanistan, since Islam is a just religion. But these funds are actually being used to support and bolster terrorists directly or indirectly. [passage omitted] As for the heir apparent of Kuwait, Sa'd al-'Abdallah, he spoke with great zeal about the strong fraternal relations between Egypt and Kuwait. When discussion turned to the Kuwaiti citizens' enthusiasm for visiting Egypt, he said in very clear terms that the Kuwaiti Government cannot and will not allow any Kuwaiti citizen to misbehave in Egypt or to commit any act that harms its security and stability. He affirmed that the Kuwaiti Government, which he heads, is ready to take the strictest measures possible against any Kuwaiti citizen who entertains ideas of this kind or violates the law.
