From the statements made by UDMR Executive President Csaba Takacs at the subsequent news conference, our correspondent Teodor Mateescu notes that the sides emphasized their similar viewpoints on the existence and activity of Hungarian institutions and organizations beyond Hungarian borders, aimed at preserving and asserting the Hungarian identity in the national areas where Hungarians are in a minority. The UDMR expressed thanks for the support of both the Hungarian Government and Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, on whose behalf Entz made this visit to Romania, with stopovers in Timisoara, Alba Iulia, Targu Mures, and Cluj-Napoca, to hand over important distinctions of the Hungarian Republic to prominent members of the Hungarian ethnic group. In his speech and answers to journalists' questions, Entz pointed out that his presence in Romania these days also had an official character, given the invitation he received from the UDMR. He added that the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs was informed of the visit through current diplomatic channels. Entz said, among other things, that the Hungarian minority in Romania has solidly structured organizations and institutions which are capable of defending the interests of the community they are representing.
