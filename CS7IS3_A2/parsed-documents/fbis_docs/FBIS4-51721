[Limited], the government's new investment holding company, can be expected to spearhead Malaysian investments in mega and strategic projects overseas. Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim announced yesterday that Khazanah Holding, which will begin operations in early June, would be allowed to make additional or new investments in mega projects that are considered "strategic" to the nation either locally or abroad. Khazanah Holding will also identify several strategic projects, which the private sector is not yet able to undertake, and plan the governnment's investments in them accordingly. It will also be allowed to raise funds in the domestic and international markets by issuing shares, loan stocks, or other types of financial instruments. "This form of financing is much cheaper. It will also enable the government to undertake new investments without resorting to its internal resources," he said. Anwar, who is also finance minister, was speaking to reporters after sending off Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and his delegation at Bilik Bunga Raya, Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Subang. The prime minister, who will be Khazanah Holding chairman, and his delegation left for a five-day official visit to Zimbabwe. Anwar, who will be Khazanah Holding deputy chairman, said the government's existing investment arm, the Minister of Finance Inc. (MoF Inc.), will be the sole shareholder in Khazanah Holding. Khazanah Holding has an authorised capital of RM [Malaysian ringgit] 500 million and a paid-up capital of RM100 million. Anwar said Khazanah would take over the management of the bulk of the government's equity investment currently being overseen by MoF Inc. "The government will identify which assets to be transferred to Khazanah. Not all (of the equity investments) will be placed under the new entity. The assets will be transferred in stages," he said MoF Inc. holds shares in 37 companies worth RM72.5 billion based on the current market value and RM7.59 billion at par value. These include shares in listed companies like Tenaga Nasional Bhd. [electricity company], Telekom Malaysia Bhd., Edaran Otomobil Nasional Bhd. (Proton) as well as in unlisted ones like National Oil Corporation Petronas, Heavy Industries Malaysia Bhd., and Perwaja Steel Industries Sdn. Bhd. [Private Limited]. It is understood that initially about RM40 billion of the investments will be taken over by Khazanah Holding. Anwar said Khazanah Holding will have six directors -- three from the public sector and another three from the private sector. "Khazanah Holding will have a team of professional managers. Its policy, however, will be ascertained by the Board of Directors chaired by the prime minister," he added. Anwar said the government decided to form Khazanah Holding in view of the increasing equity investments in MoF Inc. as the privatisation and corporatisation of government-owned enterprises gained momentum in 1990s. This in turn calls for more professional and systematic management of the assets, he added. Anwar said to protect the government's interests, the company is required to submit its annual statement of accounts to the auditor general. The documents will also be forwarded to Parliament. Anwar also outlined various functions of the new holding company. These include: - Drawing up the medium-and long-term corporate plans for the group' participation in the private sector, especially in new priority areas; - preparing strategies to enhance efficiency, productivity, and profitability of the companies in its stable [as published] so that returns from the investments can be maximised; and - undertaking additional or new investments in mega projects which are "strategic" to the nation either locally or abroad. Anwar said as the companies improved their profitability, Khazanah Holding is expected to receive larger dividends. "Most of the dividends will be channelled to the federal government, being the sole shareholder through the MoF Inc. The revenue will be used for various purposes, particularly to finance development projects."
