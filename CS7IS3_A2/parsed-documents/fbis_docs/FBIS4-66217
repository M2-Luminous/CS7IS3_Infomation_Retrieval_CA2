For reasons of editing, it is slightly abridged in this publication. [passage omitted] Fang Litian [2455 4539 1131], a scholar in the mainland, points out that the regions of "alarming" growth for Christianity include Huaiyin City, Jiangsu (in 1981 the approximate number of Christians was more than 20,000. It increased by 20,000 every year until 1986, and by 1990 it had increased to 140,000); the Wenzhou region of Zhejiang (in 1981 the approximate number of Christians was 200,000. By 1990 it had increased to more than 300,000); and Lai'an County, Anhui (the county only had eleven believers in the early 1950s; by 1976 there were only 77, but by 1990 there were upwards of 1,000 people). Mr. Fang believes that this phenomenon illustrates two points: 1) Since the 1950s, religious believers have increased the fastest in the last ten years. 2) Some regions of China truly have developed a "religion fever." [passage omitted] Although these data alarm people, there is no denying this religious "upsurge." But the majority of people in religious and scholarly circles in the mainland do not want to look upon this as an "ailment." Wang Weifan [3076 4850 5672] of Nanjing University's Institute for the Study of Religion believes that although the growth of Christianity has exceeded that of other religions in recent years, it is essentially normal. It has not reached a "fever" level, and there is no need to be "panic-stricken." According to recent statistics (or estimates) of mainland Christian circles, the approximate number of Christians (Orthodox) currently in China is 6 million to 9 million. And Hong Kong and overseas estimates of the number of mainland Christians vary from 20 million to 50 million. There are more women than men and more old people than young in typical mainland churches.... But estimates of the proportion of young believers have notably increased.... In addition, many rural believers are illiterate, estimated at half or more. The educational level of urban believers is rather high. There even are professors and famous physicians among them.... What was described above, however, is the general situation. The mainland certainly also has many atypical examples. As regards the age structure of believers, there is a report that indicates that in churches in certain areas of Henan and Shanxi, 80 percent of believers are 18 years of age or under. As regards the educational level of believers, in urban churches, the proportion of young intellectuals is constantly rising. In academic circles, there even are quite a few students who are trying to introduce Christian culture. They do not attend church, but are "Christian sympathizers." [passage omitted] People's zeal for Christianity began from the mid-1980s. "Religious fever" or "Christian fever" is by no means a post "June 4" incident phenomenon. In summarizing the reasons for "Christian fever" among mainland students and Christians, they can be divided into the following four aspects: 1. Traditional and historical factors: Most of the regions with rapid growth of Christianity and a concentration of believers have a rather long history of dissemination of Christianity. For example, in such localities as Wenzhou, Zhejiang and Fuqing, Fujian, the share of rural believers could be the highest in the nation, and these regions both have a long history of Christianity. In another respect, family's traditional beliefs also are an important factor bringing young people into the church. Parents give their children religious instruction from when they are small. According to an investigative report, the choir of a certain Shanghai church has more than twenty young people, and "almost all of them are children of believers." 2. Social and economic factors: Concepts of ghost are still widespread, especially among farmers with a rather low level of education. Some think that the more rapid growth of rural Christianity than urban actually is the transfer or ("change of sentiments") regarding ghost concepts. In another respect, Chinese society has always emphasized men and slighted women. Especially in the countryside, women have not been able to be economically independent and they cannot decide for themselves on family issues. They often are dissatisfied with their daily lives. So, they go to church to seek satisfaction, to the point that in some villages the ratio of female believers is as high as 80 percent. For example, in Gaozuo township, Suining county, Jiangsu, there are 1,248 Christians in the whole township and 1,185 are women, making up 92.8 percent of the total. 3. Psychological factors: A number of reports reveal that the majority of believers are believers because of illness. According to a 1985 sample survey at the Puzhou Church in the Longwan district of Wenzhou, 57 percent of believers entered the church because of illness. According to a survey the same year in Anhui's Bangbu, 126 of 160 Christians were believers because of illness. And 1,620 of 2,500 Christians from Guzhen county were believers because of illness. A survey of a village in northern Jiangsu also indicated that 60 percent to 70 percent of believers believed because of illness. In addition, some believers who encountered setbacks in love, marriage, family, school, or careers received spiritual consoling at church, and this was a reason for them to become believers. 4. Other factors: For a long time during the Cultural Revolution period, religion was forbidden. That could be a reason for the "rebound" after the churches reopened in the 1980s. The more believers were repressed the more it brought about regeneration and solidarity, triggering an opposite effect. [passage omitted.] Those in the mainland concerned with "Christian fever" are mainly in three categories: academic circles, Christian circles, and people in party and government departments concerned with religion. Because people in the three categories have different backgrounds and goals, their reactions to "Christian fever" are naturally somewhat diverse. The first "panic-stricken" group probably are some cadres who supervise religion. It is their duty to "normalize" religion and attack "abnormal religious activity." Any religious activity that is not registered with the government can be looked upon as being illegal or abnormal. Those concerned with "Christian fever" naturally also must include people from Christian circles. They play up a lot the evaluation of the positive aspects of religion and its contribution to society and oppose the sweeping "opiate theory." After it was proposed to establish a totally new concept of religion in the mid-1980s, it brought openness to academic research on religion and church circles strived more strongly to implement a policy of "religious freedom," believing that religious freedom included study, discussion, and criticism of religion. Religious people should not be excluded from participating in research on religion (indicating that in the past there was this exclusion). In addition, they also emphasized that a policy of freedom of religious belief should not be a tactic to abolish religion. As regards the reaction of academic circles to "Christian fever," we can probably say that they gradually left the "ultra-leftist" line and made significant breakthroughs in the study of religion. In the past, the orientation of religious studies completely obeyed the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. (For example, the "World Religion Research Institute" was established in Beijing in 1964 because Mao Zedong appointed them to criticize theology.) By the mid-1980s, research on religion no longer was bogged down in philosophical discussions of the nature of religion, but the focus shifted to an investigation of the actual situation and gradually changed to combining "theory" with "practice." This was mainly the study of Christianity. The main content of the investigation was: The growth in the number of believers, the age structure, the sex ratio, the reasons for believing, the family background of believers, and the affect of religious belief on family life and social ethics concepts. Most of these types of survey reports of the actual situation in churches were published in the two biennial journals Religion and Modern Studies on Religion. Between 1987 and 1992, nearly twenty of these survey reports on the current state of Christianity were published. Although some only contributed extremely sketchy data and could by no means be considered rigorous in their research methodology, as regards the Chinese Communist attitude toward religion, this kind of research report was a very great breakthrough. [passage omitted] Regarding the study of religious theory, the "opiate theory" no longer has a dogmatic position. In its place is the renewed development of the early 1950s' "five natures theory" proposed by people such as Zhou Enlai and Li Weihan: That religion is of the masses, democratic, international, long-lasting, and complex. The previous insistence on the argument that religion would very quickly die out in socialism was changed to exploring the possibility of religion becoming the superstructure of socialism, conditions for cooperation between religion and socialism, and the social function of religion. The most difficult to change was the past close affiliation of religious studies with the philosophical sphere. Moreover, ideological issues often extended to political contention. But in recent years, the study of religion has begun to be relatively independent and have broadened to several fields of social science research, including religious phenomenology, the sociology of religion, religious anthropology, and the psychology of religion. In sum, in recent years academic circles' study of religion and evaluation of Christianity have generally become open and positive and people from church circles and religious workers simultaneously participate in research projects. But the general orientation of research and form of reporting still are rather influenced by the party and government climate. The current respected mainland authority on religious issues is Luo Zhufeng [5012 4554 7364], the head of the East China Religious Affairs Office in the 1950s. From the 1980s to the present Mr. Luo has held such positions as vice president and advisor to the China Religion Society, president of the Shanghai Municipal Religion Society, and honorary head of the Institute for the Study of Religion of the Shanghai Social Studies Academy. Religious Issues in China's Socialist Period, of which he is the chief editor can be considered representative of present mainland opinion on religious issues. Mr. Luo is an old cadre administering religious affairs. Obviously research on religion still is essentially led by the party and the government. [passage omitted.] The sudden increase in the number of Christians in recent years obviously caused greater interest and acceptance of Christianity from people in various circles of Chinese society and also helped churches and believers in various localities to strive for their basic rights and freedoms. After churches in the name of "uniting the broad masses of believers" contended in the "democracy movement," the government exerted pressure on Christianity. I am convinced that Christian doctrine and church life can continue to attract the large number of Chinese people who do not have any belief and have lost their ideals. I estimate that in the next few years the number of believers will continue to rise. As regards the clash of Chinese Christianity and Chinese culture, mainland scholars, using Taiwan Christianity as a precedent, believe that it would be difficult for the churches to become a force clashing with Chinese culture. The Christian churches in Taiwan also grew rapidly for a period. Although Taiwan has freedom to spread religion, after several decades of development, Christianity still is an extremely small minority religion, not to mention "Christianization" of the culture. As to Chinese Christianity's being assimilated by the Chinese culture, it also will not happen to a very great extent. In the past, Christianity's development in China was not at all assimilated into the Chinese culture or integrated with native religions like Buddhism. Because Christianity's world view and the world view of the Chinese people clash, China's Christian fever probably will gradually stabilize. Christianity quite probably will be able to maintain its basic characteristics in China and become a bit of a decoration for Chinese culture.
