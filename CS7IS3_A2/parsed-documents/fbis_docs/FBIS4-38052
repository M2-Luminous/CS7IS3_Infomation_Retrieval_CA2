The prime minister's announcement, made public in two Friday afternoon newspapers, came as a surprise and created a new situation. "As a Muslim, 'Arafat, is entitled to visit Jerusalem, just like any other Muslim. If he wishes to pray, that would be his right. There would be a problem of timing and arrangements, but in principle our reply would be positive." That is how Yitzhaq Rabin responded when asked whether he was inviting 'Arafat to visit Jerusalem. The prime minister avoided responding in the negative, and by putting the stress on 'Arafat's right -- "like any other Muslim" -- to worship in a place holy to the Muslims (the al-Aqsa mosque), it could be seen as an invitation. The reservations about timing and arrangements appear to be minor points compared with the positive reply in principle. Is the prime minister so naive as to believe that the PLO leader's appearance at Haram al-Sharif would not be far more than just a religious event? We should not think he is being naive: He does not need too much imagination to foresee how 'Arafat's praying at the al-Aqsa mosque and his visit to the Dome of the Rock would have an impact on the Muslim population. They will be elated by his visit, East Jerusalem will become a PLO bastion, and the Arabs in the territories will regard Israeli permission for the visit -- supposedly meant to honor the Muslim holy places -- as a move toward the Israel Government's agreement to the guest's nationalist- political demands for Palestinian sovereignty in East Jerusalem. That is how Arafat's appearance, under the guise of being a Muslim pilgrim, will be seen in the Arab world as well. Israel's commitment to freedom of access to the holy places of all religions, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, is, of course, known to the prime minister. He is right in saying that "we cannot insist on united Jerusalem being Israel's capital without permitting freedom of access to members of other religions." But expressing a readiness to permit 'Arafat to worship on the Temple Mount at this time does not necessarily evolve from that understanding. Has the prime minister been won over to the opinion of former adviser Jacques Neriya that 'Arafat might be offended if Israel refuses to permit him to pray on Haram al-Sharif, considering the fact that Rabin, in his Strasbourg speech, invited Mu'ammar al- Qadhdhafi to fulfill that religious decree? Did Rabin plan to permit the PLO leader to precede the Hashemite king? In his newspaper interview, Rabin mentioned al-Qadhdhafi, President al- Asad, and the Saudi monarch, and his failure to mention the Jordanian monarch is striking in that context. Can Rabin's willingness to compromise with the PLO leader be explained by his understanding that it is impossible to keep him restricted to Jericho? It is difficult to believe that the prime minister is unaware of the political consequences of 'Arafat's praying at the al-Aqsa mosque. What right does he have to denounce opposition spokesmen who "say that such visits (meaning Nabil Sha'th's visit, which the government prevented) put into question Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem, which is a big mistake." Up to Friday, Rabin thought just like those leaders of the right-wing parties. In view of the possibility that Yasir 'Arafat might be coming to pray at al-Aqsa, the attempts to restrict PLO political activities in East Jerusalem seem impractical. We can insist that "no body with a role in the Palestinian Authority will be located in Jerusalem," but if 'Arafat is permitted to come to Jerusalem's Old City, how will we be able to complain about the activities of Faysal al-Husayni and his friends?
