Baskov, Candidate of Technical Sciences A. Dubovoy and A. Kachekan (experts from the Association of Practitioners of Space Science) under the rubric "Space Science Abroad": "Imaging Reconnaissance"] [Text] The start of systematic imaging reconnaissance from space was laid down abroad with the launch of the Discoverer-13 spacecraft by the United States in 1960. It was to perform the tasks of detecting Soviet ICBMs, determining their quantities, ascertaining their characteristics and degree of vulnerability and mapping the territory of the USSR to determine target coordinates for American missiles. Spacecraft of this type, depending on the degree of detail of the information obtained, were divided into survey reconnaissance (Samos-P) spacecraft, whose operation continued until 1972, and detail reconnaissance (Samos-M) craft, used for a longer period (up to 1977). The first reconnaissance satellites were equipped with a camera. The exposed film was delivered to Earth in a special capsule that was jettisoned from the craft on an assigned stretch of its trajectory. A parachute system was actuated at a certain altitude, and the capsule descended to the ocean surface or was captured in the air by a C-130 aircraft. It should be noted that only 26 of the 38 satellites in the Discoverer experimental series were put into orbit, and only half the capsules were recovered in the air or found in the water. The United States launched the fourth-generation LASP (Low Altitude Surveillance Platform) spacecraft in 1971 to replace the functions of the Samos-P and Samos-M satellites. The set of photographic gear installed on board made it possible to obtain pictures of territories and objects with a resolution of 0.3--0.5 meters at the ground in detail mode and 2.5--3.5 meters in survey mode, with the transmission of information by radio channel. The satellite, which weighed about 14 tons, had fuel reserves that allowed it to change its operating orbital altitude from 150 to 230 kilometers, and to adjust it to provide for an active existence of six--eight months. The LASPs, like the imaging reconnaissance satellites of the prior generations, were launched periodically. A Samos-M detail photo-reconnaissance satellite was launched, as a rule, in the intervals between the end of the functioning of one craft and the launch of the next into orbit. There were 20 LASPs launched in all. The last launch (in April of 1986) was a failure--the launch vehicle blew up in flight. All of the functions for the performance of imaging reconnaissance from space have been performed since that time by the fifth-generation KH-11 satellites, which were developed on a fundamentally new basis. The optical image is formed in them on the surface of the light-sensitive element of a CCD (charge-coupled device), which transforms light signals of varying intensity into electrical ones transmitted in digital form through a relay satellite to the ground station at Fort Belvoir (Virginia). This information then arrives in real time at the National Photographic Interpretation Center in Washington, part of the CIA. The KH-11 satellites were launched by Titan-3D and Titan-34D launch vehicles into heliosynchronous orbits with parameters of inclination 96.2--97.8Â°, altitude at apogee 500--1,000 km and perigee 210--350 km, which allows the satellites to reach the areas being monitored at a time that is optimal in the lighting conditions of the Earth's surface. The special gear of the KH-11 supports a resolution in the visible wavelength spectrum of 0.15--0.18 meters at the ground in a photographing strip of 2.8 x 2.8 km, and 0.5--1.7 meters in a strip of 90 x 120 km. These resolution values are potential, and they can be obtained only under ideal surveillance conditions (illumination of the Earth's surface of more than 950 W/m<sup> 2</sup> and insignificant effects of atmospheric turbulence) and at absolute values of optical contrast. It was unsuited, at the same time, for the receipt of photographs at night. Cloud cover, which made the surveillance of the territory being monitored more difficult, was also an insurmountable obstacle for it. One method of overcoming these drawbacks was tried out in August 1989, when the Columbia space shuttle placed in orbit a spacecraft with gear that functions in the visible and infrared bands. This Advanced KH-11 satellite, which was erroneously called the KH-12, is able to obtain images in day or at night when there are cloud levels of up to four or five. It uses a telescope of the Hubble type with a main mirror diameter of 2.5 meters, light construction with elements of adaptive optics to compensate for atmospheric disturbances, a wave front sensor (shift interferometer), CCD matrices and the like. The special gear is able to transmit images with a resolution at the ground in the visible spectrum of 0.08--0.1 meters in a strip of 2.8 x 2.8 km or 0.5--1.0 meters in a strip of 90 x 120 km, and about 0.6--0.8 meters in the infrared band in a strip of 2.8 x 2.8 km. By operating in the infrared wavelengths, it can distinguish cut leaf cover used as camouflage from living vegetation and determine the status of objects under surveillance. The Advanced KH-11 satellite has the capability to detect the whole inventory of military hardware and armaments of various countries with high probability, and to track their rearming or upgrading. A second Advanced KH-11 satellite was placed in orbit in February 1990 by the Atlantis spacecraft. It quickly became disabled, however. The CIA is planning to bring the number of such satellites in orbit to three, which would make it possible to accomplish the program of photo reconnaissance of the globe to the full extent.
