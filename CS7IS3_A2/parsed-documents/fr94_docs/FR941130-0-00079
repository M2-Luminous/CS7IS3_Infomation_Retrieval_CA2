Federal Perkins Loan Program, Federal Work-Study Programs, and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 229␣/␣Wednesday, November 30, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Parts 674, 675, and 676 RIN 1840 AB71 Federal Perkins Loan Program, Federal Work-Study Programs, and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends the regulations governing the campus-based programs (Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) programs). These amendments are needed to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). These regulations also seek to improve the efficiency of the campus-based programs, to reduce the administrative burden for institutions where possible, and to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations take effect on July 1, 1995 and apply to the 1995&hyph;96 and subsequent award years. However, affected parties do not have to comply with the information collection requirements in §674.34(e) until the Department of Education publishes in the Federal Register the control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to these information collection requirements. Publication of the control numbers notifies the public that OMB has approved these information collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 1.

These regulations implement the provisions of the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;610), enacted November 16, 1990, the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;647), enacted November 29, 1990, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub.

L. 103&hyph;208), enacted December 20, 1993 (Technical Amendments), the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Pub.

On June 22, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register (59 FR 32264&hyph;32287). The NPRM included a discussion of major issues surrounding the proposed changes that will not be repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which a discussion of those issues can be found. Campus-Based Programs The Secretary proposed to amend the definition of ``undergraduate student'' to remove the restriction that did not allow an undergraduate student to receive Federal Perkins Loan or FWS assistance if he or she has already earned a baccalaureate or first professional degree. The proposal provided that a student is not ineligible for assistance under the Federal Perkins Loan or FWS programs because he or she has previously received a baccalaureate or professional degree (page 32264). The Secretary proposed to amend the allocation and reallocation procedures for the campus-based programs to provide that if an institution returns more than 10 percent of its Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, or FSEOG allocation for an award year, the institution will have its allocation for the next fiscal year for that program reduced by the dollar amount returned (pages 32264&hyph;32265).
