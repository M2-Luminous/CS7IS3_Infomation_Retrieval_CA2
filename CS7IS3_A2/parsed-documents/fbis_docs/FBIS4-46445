FBIS4-46445 "jptot024__l94122" JPRS-TOT-94-024-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 17 May 1994 WEST EUROPE TURKEY PKK Militants Cited on Developments PKK Militants Cited on Developments NC0406182894 Istanbul OZGUR ULKE in Turkish 17 May 94 p 4 NC0406182894 Istanbul OZGUR ULKE Turkish BFN [Punctuation as published] [Excerpts] Zele/Brussels, KURDISH NEWS AGENCY--President Suleyman Demirel has recently mentioned several times that the "question of terrorist activities" has been resolved and the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] has been crushed. Demirel's remarks usually came after an argument on the question of the retirement of General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff. However, Demirel has said in the meetings he has held with businessmen and the opening ceremonies of various establishments that he fears what may happen in June. He stressed that a multisided and unpreventable political crisis will emerge if the present situation is allowed to continue in Turkey. [passage omitted] The KURDISH NEWS AGENCY has asked the PKK circles to comment on the matter. Cemil Bayik, head of the Kurdish People's Liberation Army [KPLA] Military Council, and Kani Yilmaz, representative of the Kurdish People's Liberation Front in Europe, conveyed their views to the news agency by telephone. [passage omitted] Bayik said: "If the Turkish Republic's and the Turkish newspapers' propaganda that the PKK has been crushed is true, then why do they maintain their struggle? It is meaningful that Demirel fears what may happen in June. He has already mentioned the possibility of significant political instability. He has begged the businessmen and warned them that the PKK will have achieved its wish and objective if a negative development takes place." Stressing that the PKK has achieved significant success in increasing the number of its militants from 30,000 to 60,000 in 1994, Bayik asserted that the 500,000-strong Turkish military forces have failed to stand against KPLA's guerrilla forces. The State Is Killing Its Own Soldiers Cemil Bayik asserted the following: "The Turkish military units are ambushed every day. They suffer hundreds of casualties. The State of Emergency Governor's Office has claimed that the military units kill 50-100 guerrillas every day and that they have destroyed the PKK. All that is a trite tactic in psychological warfare. We found the remains of 15 soldiers on Kato Mountain yesterday. The traces of burns on their bodies indicated that chemical weapons were used in that area. We monitor their radio communications. The communicators talk in English from time to time. They inform each other that that type of weapon should not be used in this or that place because of the presence of military units." Bayik stressed that the incident on Kato Mountain has indicated that the military forces, which are in a helpless situation, have used chemical arms on their own units. He described that as a development which has unveiled the barbaric nature of the Turkish State. Cemil Bayik also said that the incident clarified the situation to many families who have asked for information on where their sons have been. Bayik stressed that the statements that the PKK has been either crushed or weakened or suppressed are aimed at misleading the international media organs. He said: "They are trying to strengthen their morale and hide their failure by waging psychological warfare. They are convinced that their effort will obstruct recruits from joining the PKK. The daily statements that are issued by the State of Emergency Governor's Office are unfounded. They are aimed at strengthening the morale of the military units." Cemil Bayik also commented on the "package on democracy." He said: "It will provide for an increase in the number of village guards, establishment of tribal political parties, cooperation with Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK] leader Mas'ud Barzani, programs aimed at suppressing the people. In fact, that is why the Turkish officials provoke the clashes in southern Kurdistan [northern Iraq]. Their objective is to create fratricide among the Kurds. However, their effort will fail to yield results. We have been trying to end the clashes in northern Iraq right from the beginning. We have supported the people's just demands." [passage omitted] Bayik stressed that international circles have focused significant attention on the proposals Abdullah Ocalan made in the message he conveyed to the conference the Kurds held in Europe some time ago and noted that they have moved to put pressure on Turkey to force the Turkish officials to agree to them for the solution of the Kurdish problem. [passage omitted] Yilmaz said that the Turkish State established June as its target in the special war it wages against the Kurdish people. He asserted: "The Turkish Republic's move against Kurdistan and the bombing of Kurdistan's territory are linked with its target, which is June. The Turkish officials are aware that a military defeat will worsen the economic crisis and political instability. That will create a chaotic situation in Turkey. That is why the present government has moved to determine how long we should live. However, whether that government will survive until June is debatable." [passage omitted] Yilmaz also commented on how the DPK has been encouraged to attack the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK]. He drew attention to PKK's initiatives to end the fighting and stressed that the DPK is not an organization that acts according to its own free will. In fact, he said that the DPK organized its onslaught against the PUK in cooperation with Turkey. Yilmaz asserted: "Most probably, Germany, France, and Iraq are also involved in that operation. Mas'ud Barzani attacked the PKK together with the Turkish military forces in 1992. He has been encouraged by the Turkish military forces and the Western countries to attack PUK at the present time. The DPK is a collaborationist and treacherous organization, which wishes to create fratricide in Kurdistan. Those who engage in such activities must not be expected to agree to establish peace. They have no will of their own."
