Police told Bao's family that the dissident had "broken the law" and said, without further explanation, that an inquiry had been opened, the relative said by telephone. Bao was detained last Friday, the day before the anniversary of the crushing of the pro-democracy movement in Beijing. The source said several police searched Bao's parents' home late Tuesday, and his mother was called to the police station. But it was not known on Wednesday whether she had been released. The official detention and investigation papers released to the family were dated June 5, two days after the dissident's arrest, the source said. "Detention for the purposes of investigation should only be applied in cases where identity is uncertain, but it is the most widely used method by the police to keep the political opposition locked up for as long as possible," said Robin Munro, the Hong Kong based director of Human Rights Watch/Asia. He added that a measure adopted by the government in 1980, stipulated that detention in such cases should not exceed three months. Police in Shanghai contacted by telephone refused to confirm the reports and a spokesman for the public security bureau here said he was unaware of the incident. Bao, 31, a former teacher of medicine, is one of China's most active dissidents. He was detained after he unveiled a new human rights organisation to mark the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. The group, which was said to have 167 members, is demanding the right to free trade unions, freedom of religion and compensation for the descendants of people killed in the Japanese occupation of China in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as for relatives of protestors slain by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) five years ago. Bao's detention followed interrogations in April and May of the leaders of the Chinese Human Rights Organisation, also based in Shanghai. The group's secretary general, Wang Fucheng, was questioned April 14 and put under house arrest. Li Guotao, the group's president was arrested May 2 and spokesman Yang Zhou, was picked up ten days later. "We haven't heard any news from Wang Fucheng for a month and a half," a member of his family said Wednesday, adding that the dissidents' telephone lines had been cut.
