This was an important confidence-building measure for the region and for security throughout Europe, Kinkel said on Wednesday [9 March] at a joint news conference with his counterparts from Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in Bonn. Germany did not want to take on an "official role as intermediary" between Russia and the Baltics, but it did want to "help mediate." At the same time, Kinkel reaffirmed German support for the efforts of the Baltic states to be accepted gradually into the European Union [EU] and the Atlantic defense alliance. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys expressed the expectation that the negotiations on association with the EU would begin in the second half of 1994 and be concluded at the beginning of next year. On the situation of the Russian minority in the Baltic states, Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik said that even foreign organizations had found no evidence of human rights violations. Problems arose mainly on practical issues concerning the integration of Russian citizens.
