AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Amplified Decision. SUMMARY: On April 14, 1994, the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota issued a memorandum opinion and order that, in part, directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue an amplified decision that more fully explains the conclusions reached in a final decision published in the Federal Register on March 5, 1993. This amplified decision responds to that order and supplements and clarifies the findings and conclusions of the final decision. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John F. Borovies, Chief, Order Formulation Branch, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 720&hyph;6274. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This administrative action is governed by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557 and therefore is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a final rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Each order, as amended, will promote more orderly marketing of milk by producers and regulated handlers. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674) (AMAA), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the AMAA, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The AMAA provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a complaint is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. When the administrative proceeding in this matter was initiated, the Notice of Hearing listed separately the Lubbock-Plainview, Texas (Part 1120); the Texas Panhandle (Part 1132); and Rio Grande Valley (Part 1138) orders. A hearing on a merger of these three orders was held in December 1989. As a result of that hearing, the three orders were merged effective December 1, 1991, under the name of the New Mexico-West Texas order, which is 7 CFR Part 1138. Therefore, all proposed order language in connection with this proceeding is in terms of the merged order. In this and future documents in this proceeding, the New Mexico-West Texas order will replace the three orders named above.
