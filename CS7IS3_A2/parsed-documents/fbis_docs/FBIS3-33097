From a talk with workers at La Catalina UBPC, he learned that they expect to receive over 800 pesos per capita profit at the end of this year, in addition to daily advances for their work. Machado noted the enthusiasm that prevails in La Catalina because of the results obtained by this UBPC in the short time it has been in existence, and emphasized the need to put into practice the profitability schema, which will be able to systematically measure productivity. Machado Ventura also exchanged views with workers and leaders of the Camilo Cienfuegos livestock UPBC in Guane Municipality, where he expressed appreciation for that UBPC's good performance.
