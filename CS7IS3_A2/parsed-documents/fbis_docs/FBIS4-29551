How dangerous is North Korea's nuclear potential? [Shen] We maintain normal diplomatic relations with North Korea, but there is no nuclear cooperation. North Korea has declared on several occasions that it has no intention of developing nuclear arms. [DER SPIEGEL] The United States says that Kim Il-song has enough plutonium to build several nuclear bombs. [Shen] To date, there is no proof of that. [DER SPIEGEL] What would you advise North Korea to do to defuse the situation? [Shen] We advocate a de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and we are against nuclear arms, whether they are in North or South Korea. [DER SPIEGEL] What does this mean in specific political terms? [Shen] North and South Korea must get back to the negotiating table. Also, the United States and the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] must continue their dialogue with the North. [DER SPIEGEL] If, however, the issue of sanctions against North Korea were to be brought before the UN Security Council, how would China decide? [Shen] We are basically opposed to such problems being taken before the Security Council. It would only aggravate the situation and does not get us anywhere. We want talks. [DER SPIEGEL] What guarantees are there to prevent Pyongyang from tinkering with the bomb in the meantime? [Shen] There is no proof that they have any nuclear weapons at all. Sanctions would only make the situation worse. [DER SPIEGEL] Pyongyang has repeatedly threatened war. Is North Korea bluffing, or is this to be taken seriously? [Shen] All parties should show restraint and remain calm at the moment. A war must be prevented; it would not involve any advantages for anyone. [DER SPIEGEL] In 1961, China concluded a military mutual assistance pact. Will you keep it in the event of a war? [Shen] It is a friendship and assistance pact, which is, of course, still valid today. But we should not talk of war so much. I am convinced that there is still enough room for a peaceful solution.
