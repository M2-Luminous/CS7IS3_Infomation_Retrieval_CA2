The wars waged by your country through centuries and the oppression exerted by one of the severest communist dictatorships in the world didn't subdue the legendary resistance of 'The eagle's sons.' You have been looked down upon until recently, but now you are manifesting an unprecedented zeal to integrate into Europe and Western democracies. "Showing our affection towards your country, I decided to accept your invitation and visit your country. "According to my proposal in Berlin a year ago, and with the unanimous approval of all our delegations, Albania became an associate member of our Assembly. In this context I have come to strengthen our relations. We are proud that you are among us. Your so fraternal and warm welcome you are extending to us, confirms once again that there is no doubt that you are part of Europe and you will be fully committed to your so important role. "You showed your loyalty to the international community by giving the warships of NATO and the Western European Union fully access to your waters to supervise the embargo against former Yugoslavia, thus placing the interest of regional stability above your personal interest. We are so indebted to you in this regard. "You showed your solidarity with NATO last month by proposing them to use your air bases in order to apply the measures envisaged by the ultimatum addressed to those who were attacking Sarajevo. You knew well the danger that was threatening you, anyhow you accepted to undertake this act being convinced that only this decision would help accelerate the re establishment of peace in Bosnia. "You offered your cooperation to some of our Alliance members for the realisation of a number of initiatives they had undertaken. Thus, by allowing U.S. aircrafts to come to your country to survey the movements of the military troops in former Yugoslavia, you once more placed the interest of the regional security above the personal interests. I assure you that these acts have been welcome by the governments and parliaments of the NATO member countries. "Your president signed in Brussels some weeks ago, the documents which will allow your country to strengthen its cooperation with our Alliance through Partnership For Peace. We do not forget that Albania has been one of the first countries to reply positively to the offer for Partnership For Peace presented in the extraordinary meeting of NATO on January of this year. This is a testimony to your good will not only to continue but also to have faster rates in your reforms to change your defence structure aiming at harmonising them better with the principles, means and procedures of the NATO. "Accepting Albania as an associate member last year and I hail you on this occasion Mr. Selami who has made a great contribution to this direction, the Assembly of North [as received] aimed at making its contribution to precenting the escalation of war in the zone around you. We hope this act will serve as an encouragement for the leaders of our countries to be more sensitive towards your problems because security in the Balkans is security for Europe as well. "You are right to be worried about the fate of the 2 million Albanians in Kosova. Nonviolent resistance of the Albanians headed by President Rugova deserves the support of the international community. Believe me, I share this worry with you with regard to the Serbian decision for the expulsion of the CSCE observers mission some months ago. Personally I am convinced that our Alliance will do its best for this decision to be reconsidered. We should see the possibility of military and civil deployment of observers in Kosova, as it is being operated in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Our Alliance should use all its influence in support or talks which will lead to the establishment of a status which will observe the fundamental rights of the Albanians in Kosova because without resolving this problem stability in this zone will not last long. "We also know your preoccupation to ensure for the numerous Albanians in Macedonia a full recognition of their civil rights. Your wisdom towards this neighbouring country, which is hardly coming into its full shape, and the political and economic support towards it are a guarantee for the stability in this zone. We also support your efforts for the normalisation of the tensions in the relations between some Albanian and Greek communities. "We know that the losses inflicted to you by the embargo towards former Yugoslavia have to do not only with your security and the determination of the Albanian Government to strictly observe the international sanctions is a full justification for your demands for compensations. International community is rather delayed in studying the possibilities for the creation of a fund of compensation for the new democratic regimes which are greatly affected by the consequences of the embargo in this difficult economic transition period. "Even after a cease-fire, which is a necessary preliminary condition, peace in the Balkans will not be established unless the peoples of this zone have a fair standard of living and the ability to use the assets of their countries and their talent to be more and more prosperous. "Your resolute economic policy despite sacrifices to be made by your people, is now yielding its fruits. I am glad to see that investments in Albania are on the increase. The French, my compatriots, occupy now an important share in these investments, but I am convinced that the traditional relations that link you country with mine, France, need more serious endeavours from these countries. "For nearly fifty years your country was self isolated by the rest of the continent. What a misfortune! The enthusiasm with which you are breaking through this isolation arouses great hopes in you and us. Let me say and you should believe me that we are going to help you in your revival, just as we have faith in the revival of a stable peace because we are a single European and Atlantic family. We are looking forward to seeing independent and solidarist Albania a NATO member, a cradle of a great culture as well an examplary case for the democracies of our great Alliance. I am convinced of this.
