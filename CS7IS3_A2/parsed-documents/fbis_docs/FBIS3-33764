He said: We in the United States are against the policy of boycott in general. It is part of my responsibility during this tour to call for an end to this type of boycott, which has harmed U.S. companies. During my visit, I have sensed many positive signs for now, he added. The U.S. secretary gave several examples of Arab-Israeli cooperation. He noted that he had obtained a promise from Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to refer the issue of ending the boycott to the Arab foreign ministers! The U.S. secretary, as I understand from his important interview with Sunbul, has come to the region to terminate the Arab boycott of Israel. I know he may achieve some progress toward this "termination," but he needs to answer an important question: Do we end the boycott before or after a comprehensive peace? Lifting the boycott before peace is achieved deprives the Arabs of one of the important elements of pressure backing up the Palestinian, Syrian, and Lebanese negotiators. Thus, the U.S. secretary is putting the cart before the horse. I know the decisions of the boycott bureau in Damascus are not honored by most Arab states because they are not based on logical foundations. I also know that some Arab states have turned a blind eye to the boycott of Israel and started making deals, albeit secretly, with it. I know that Israel's exports to the Arab countries are rising and that more Arab delegations have been visiting Israel, both openly and in secret, following the Gaza-Jericho Agreement. But the boycott was one of the weapons used by the Arab negotiators in the battle for peace. I appeal to the Arab League secretary general to restate the Arab League Council's decision that the boycott must not be lifted before a comprehensive peace is achieved. Regarding the Middle East market, the U.S. secretary said that some believe this market is an "Israeli-U.S conspiracy" the purpose of which is to swallow Arab markets. The secretary added: Certainly, the long years of tension and hostility have created mistrust, resulting in several conspiracy theories that have no foundation. He added: The motives of these theories could be understood, but there is no conspiracy! In response to the U.S. secretary's remarks, I repeat what Israel has stated more than once regarding its views on this market: 1. The Suez Canal could be canceled out by building a "competitive" canal from Elat on the Gulf of Aqabah to the Mediterranean. 2. A pipeline could be built to convey Arab oil from its sources in the Gulf to an Israeli port, thus harming both Egypt and Syria [who have similar pipelines]. 3. A phosphate industry in cooperation with Egypt could be established, undermining industry in Jordan. There must be more, Mr. Secretary, that has not been declared! The strange thing about Israel's views on the Middle East market is that they seek to set up alternative industries to those in Arab states, which are of the utmost importance to these countries. For example, Israel is thinking of building an alternative to the Suez Canal, Sumed [Suez-Mediterranean Pipeline], and the Egyptian and Jordanian phosphate industries. Even in space, Israel fought Egypt so that it would have no place [in satellite transmission]. So, Israeli thinking, at least on the Middle East market, is conspiratorial, despite what U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown has stated.
