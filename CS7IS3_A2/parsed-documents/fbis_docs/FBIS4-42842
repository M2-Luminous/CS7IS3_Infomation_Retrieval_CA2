Is the security situation getting out of control and the government unable to keep up with these developments? [Schaeuble] The development of crime is something that the government can only influence in a very limited way. People's belief in values has become much weaker. We concentrate on material values. That is also a consequence of these past decades that have seen such a growth in prosperity. Perhaps it is also a consequence of the fact that we have avoided certain basic questions about the state community. This rigid concentration on increasing material prosperity promotes a tendency for people to concentrate on their own gains to the extent that they only feel that regulations can impose limitations on their conduct if there is a danger of being caught. [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] Does the state not lose the basis of its existence if it can no longer ensure security for its citizens? [Schaeuble] Things go even further than that. The basis of every liberal form of life is that people adhere to certain norms with respect to human coexistence, that they feel bound by respect for the life, property, and basic rights of others. If that can only be sanctioned and implemented by means of state norms, bureaucracy, surveillance, and the police, a basic foundation of freedom is already endangered. [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] The interior minister has advised citizens to care more about their own security. Is that a form of partial capitulation? [Schaeuble] No, the interior minister simply pointed out something that is quite obvious. In a liberal democracy, the state cannot do everything. That does not mean that people should install as many burglar alarms as they can in their homes. It means that one should feel a measure of responsibility for the broader social context, follow what is going on, and overcome the anonymity that probably also has some bearing on the massive increase in crime. [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG] How has the world of politics responded to this development? [Schaeuble] Citizens always expect solutions from politics. There is no patent solution for developments where a variety of factors are involved. That does not mean that politicians do not have to act. The laender, which are responsible for security, must make security a high priority. That the police get bogged down in a mass of paperwork is, of course, an evil that one can change.
