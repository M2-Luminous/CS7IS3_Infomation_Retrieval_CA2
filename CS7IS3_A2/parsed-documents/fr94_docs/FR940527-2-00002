FR940527-2-00002 FR940527-2-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Rural Electrification Administration Rescission of REA Bulletin AGENCY: Rural Electrification Administration, USDA. ACTION: Notice of rescission of REA Bulletin on Joint Use of Facilities. SUMMARY: The Rural Electrification (REA) hereby rescinds REA Bulletin 5&hyph;1, Joint Use of Facilities for Telephone and Electric Service. DATES: This bulletin is rescinded effective May 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sue Arnold, Financial Analyst, Program Support Staff, Rural Electrification Administration, USDA, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;1500. Telephone: 202&hyph;720&hyph;0737. FAX: 202&hyph;720&hyph;4120. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 20, 1993, at 58 FR 44288, in a proposed rule dealing with Long-Range Financial Forcasts of Electric Borrowers, the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) proposed rescission of REA Bulletin 5&hyph;1, Joint Use of Facilities for Electric and Telephone Service. This bulletin, issued in 1954, and last revised in 1972, deals with agreements between REA electric and telephone borrowers for joint use of poles. The information in the bulletin is obsolete, and REA believes guidance from REA in this area is unnecessary in today's technological and regulatory environment. The original comment period on the proposal expired on September 20, 1993. In response to requests from the public for more time to prepare responses to the proposed rule on Long-Range Financial Forecasts, REA published a document in the Federal Register on September 20, 1993, at 58 FR 48800, extending the comment period through October 20, 1993. Only one comment was received on the proposal to rescind Bulletin 5&hyph;1. While agreeing that Bulletin 5&hyph;1 is no longer needed, the commentor asked about REA Bulletin 40&hyph;5, Common Use of Poles for Distribution and Transmission Lines. Bulletin 40&hyph;5 was rescinded in December 1991, and this rescission was noted in the Index of Electric Issuances issued by REA and mailed to all electric borrowers in October 1992. The commentor asked about the provisions in the REA loan mortgage and loan documents concerning joint use. REA has begun a comprehensive project to consider revisions to the form and content of the REA mortgage and loan documents. An advance notice of proposed rulemaking on the subject was published on December 2, 1991, at 56 FR 61201. Issues concerning joint use will be addressed in the rulemaking proceeding to revise the mortgage. Therefore, REA hereby rescinds REA Bulletin 5&hyph;1, Joint Use of Facilities for Electric and Telephone Service. A final rule on Long-Range Financial Forecasts of Electric Borrowers will be published at a later date. Dated: May 20, 1994. Wally Beyer, Admininistrator.
