[Ivanova] Nikolay Vasilyevich, now we have behind us the fierce election campaign which crowned a two-year presidential marathon in Chuvashia. Now you stand one on one facing the urgent problems of the republic. On a purely human level, is it not somewhat frightening to be taking on such an unbelievably heavy load? [Fedorov] Why talk about this now? The choice has been made. By me--prior to entering the presidential marathon. And by the people of the republic--on election day. The president must bear this load proceeding from the fact that the stage of destruction of Russia has long since "passed" historically and it is time to shift over to construction. Secondly, we must not take more people hostage to the political and personal confrontation between these and those people. I have therefore accepted the post of president of Chuvashia and am proposing accord and professional compromise with all movements and social groups in the name of the survival of society. [Ivanova] In your view, where are the greatest "sore points" in Chuvashia? [Fedorov] There are very many of these, as there are throughout Russia. Sociological surveys show, however, that first place is occupied by the problem of crime and citizen safety. Here fate itself commands me--as a legal specialist--to get seriously and fundamentally involved in this business. It is a universal problem which would seem to be outside the realm of economics, but it is precisely here where matters involving corruption and the intricate processes of privatization, for example, come together, and everywhere we must see to it that the law and strict compliance with it stand paramount. We will fight especially hard for the interests of our land's (both Russia and Chuvashia) commodity producers as they face foreign competitors. Chuvashia has traditionally been considered an agrarian republic, but in recent decades we have developed a powerful industry capable of competing on the world market in a number of items. We simply have to assist it appropriately by adjusting federal government policy through our initiatives. Can it be considered normal, for example, that the Cheboksary Industrial Tractor Plant, built some time ago by the entire country, is almost idle due to problems with the marketing of the powerful steel machines, while Russia purchases American tractors, exporting Russian raw materials and obtaining credits from the West? I see my own responsibility in safeguarding from destruction the Cheboksary Tractor Plant, and the chemical sector, and the enterprises of instrument manufacture, electrical engineering, and machine building. This is task number one--and not just for the industry of Chuvashia itself. Protecting the competitiveness of the economy is extremely important for Russia's tomorrow as well, for its might and dignity as a great power. Our plans call for attracting into the Chuvash economy--primarily into its agrarian sector--both Russian and foreign investments, in order to create joint enterprises with competitive technologies which yield swift returns in storing and processing agricultural output, more than half of which is presently being lost. One of the programs coming soon which will help the republic better carry out economic reform and enter the market more quickly is the beginning of construction, jointly with federal organs, of a modern road system and telephone network in the republic. The accomplishment of these tasks will also help us maintain job positions, push unemployment into the background, and hold on to individuals with unique specialties. One additional "categorical imperative" for me is the protection of buildings and culture. We will put our material resources, minimal at present, primarily into the spiritual sphere, into education. And we will pursue this course even at the expense of certain tasks of the moment. I am convinced that these expenditures will tomorrow pay us back a hundredfold. [Ivanova] But is the president able to handle all this? After all, he must act under conditions of a complex system of separation of powers, being guided by the Constitution of Chuvashia and the Russian Constitution. [Fedorov] We will be able to resolve a great many problems if it is not the president governing what we do, but the law. Much depends also on the ability of politicians to view history in perspective, to reach agreement with their partners and avoid turning personal problems into political ones. [Ivanova] Nikolay Vasilyevich, I cannot help but ask a question which was posed to you at meetings with voters during the presidential elections: Will the fact that you voluntarily resigned the post of minister of justice of Russia and seem to have come into conflict with the Russian president not have a negative effect on the Russian attitude towards the republic? [Fedorov] My departure was a protest against illegal methods being used in the resolution of many state issues. And of course, this did not come easy for me. After all, I was completely preoccupied with the reforms, being the most "senior" in tenure, appointed four times in a row as minister of the Russian Government. What can you do? This kind of thing happens in politics too--Boris Nikolayevich and I split over what was permissible in politics and what was not. He and I have always had a frank and equal relationship on the purely human level, and it remains so today. Herein lies the value and worth of our mutual relations. Something else says a great deal, I believe--the fact that he sent me a kind telegram, congratulating me upon having been elected the first president of Chuvashia and expressing the expectation of "constructive work together." So we should not be talking about any confrontation here. And with regard to questions of economic reform, and of strengthening the constitutional system and genuine federation in Russia, Boris Nikolayevich has my steadfast support. [Ivanova] In other words, Chuvashia continues to be an entity of the Federation and has no intention of separating in any way? [Fedorov] There can be no discussion in this regard. He who fights for separation will not resolve a single problem for his people, and will create thousands of new explosive problems instead. We must not turn national into nationalistic. I myself was born in a large Chuvash family and I proudly relate to this everywhere I go. We will continue to support national pride and dignity, continue to develop the culture and traditions of the Chuvash people. But in doing so we will not permit people of other nationalities to feel uncomfortable--this too is the political, legal, and moral responsibility of the president. Chuvashia has a fine national custom: nime (mutual assistance, mutual support). We would like to revive and protect this custom. But I am confident we can only do so along the path of accord. I am convinced that Chuvashia can develop, can truly prosper, only if it is a part of Russia. Just as Russia remains strong by virtue of the power of republics, krays, and oblasts that comprise it, through the unity of their diversity.
