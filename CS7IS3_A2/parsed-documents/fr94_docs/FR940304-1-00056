FR940304-1-00056 FR940304-1-00011 The Agency has determined, based on the generation rate of stabilized filter cake, that approximately eight weeks would be required for BSC to collect sufficient data to verify that a full-scale stabilization process is operating correctly. The proposed initial testing condition, if promulgated, will require BSC to collect a minimum of eight composite samples during the first eight weeks that BSC stabilizes its dewatered filter cake. The Agency believes that proposed initial verification testing is appropriate, because the volume of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake to be generated daily is relatively small, and hazardous constituents in the filter cake become immobile after chemical stabilization. This initial testing condition would ensure that the full-scale treatment system is closely monitored during the start-up period. If the Agency determines that the data collected under this condition reveal that the treatment system is not being operated as described in BSC's petition, the exclusion will not cover the generated stabilized filter cake. If the Agency determines that the data obtained from the initial verification period demonstrates the treatment process is effective, EPA will notify BSC in writing that the testing conditions in (1)(A) may be replaced with the testing conditions in (1)(B). The Agency believes that the concentrations of the constituents of concern in the stabilized filter cake may vary somewhat over time. Based on information BSC provided in its petition, total chromium concentrations in the dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake range from 7.75 percent to 24 percent. To ensure that BSC's stabilization process effectively handles the variation in chromium concentration in the dewatered filter cake, the Agency is proposing a subsequent verification testing condition. In addition to chromium, low leachable concentrations of lead and nickel were found in unstabilized and stabilized filter cake. Thus, the proposed subsequent testing would demonstrate that the stabilization process is operating as described in the petition and that the stabilized filter cake does not exhibit unacceptable levels of key toxic constituents ( i.e. , chromium, lead, and nickel). Therefore, the Agency is proposing to require BSC to analyze monthly composites of the stabilized filter cake as described in Condition (1)(B). (B) Subsequent Verification Testing : Following written notification by EPA, BSC may substitute the testing condition in (1)(B) for (1)(A). BSC must collect and analyze at least one composite representative of the stabilized filter cake generated each month. Monthly composites must be comprised of representative samples collected from all batches that are stabilized in a one-month period. The monthly samples must be analyzed prior to the disposal of the stabilized filter cake for chromium, lead and nickel. BSC may, at its discretion, analyze composite samples more frequently to demonstrate that smaller batches of waste are non-hazardous. The Agency is also proposing to require BSC to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that the characteristics of the petitioned waste remain as originally described. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to require BSC to analyze, on an annual basis, a representative composite sample of the stabilized filter cake for all Toxicity Characteristic (TC) constituents as described in Condition (1)(C). (C) Annual Verification Testing: In order to confirm that the characteristics of the waste do not change significantly over time, BSC must, on an annual basis, analyze a representative composite sample of stabilized filter cake for all TC constituents listed in 40 CFR ยง261.24 using the method specified therein. This composite sample must represent the stabilized filter cake generated over one week.
