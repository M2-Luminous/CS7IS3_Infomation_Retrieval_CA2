FR940725-1-00021 FR940725-1-00005 5. One of the purposes of this proceeding is to examine resale agreements, management contracts, joint marketing agreements, and other similar arrangements for the purpose of determining whether these arrangements should be treated as attributable interests in applying the PCS spectrum aggregation cap, the PCS-cellular cross-ownership restrictions, or a general CMRS spectrum cap. We recognize at the outset that any agreement that confers on a party other than the licensee de facto control over an FCC-licensed facility will be considered an attributable interest. Therefore, commenters should address whether there are relationships, not included in the PCS attribution rules, that do not rise to the level of control, but nonetheless should be considered attributable because these interests may affect the incentive or ability of PCS and other CMRS licensees to compete vigorously in the marketplace, or because they may affect the number of effective competing providers or the independence of pricing decisions by service providers. 6. Management Agreements: We request comment on whether management agreements or similar arrangements that do not confer de facto control on a party other than the licensee should be considered attributable interests. We are concerned, for example, that a management agreement may permit the manager access to market sensitive information (e.g., business plans, customer lists, product and service development, marketing strategies); if the manager is also a licensee offering a competing service, access to this information might enable it to impede vigorous competition. We also seek comment regarding the issue of whether such management agreements, although not amounting to de facto control, may involve levels of integration between the managed licensee and the manager's company which have the effect of reducing competitive choices in the marketplace or of creating a sham or front corporation to take advantage of designated entity provisions. 7. By way of background, we note that we have established several criteria that we have determined to be probative with regard to the issue of whether a licensee, through management agreements or other means, and in contravention of our rules, has relinquished control of and responsibility for its licensed facilities. These criteria, first articulated in Intermountain, include the following questions: •Does the license have unfettered use of all facilities and equipment? If the licensee retains such use, this will support a finding that the licensee has not relinquished control to a third party through a management agreement or other arrangement. •Has the licensee relinquished control of daily operations? Retention of such control by the licensee contributes to a finding that the licensee has not relinquished control over the licensed facilities. •Does the licensee determine and carry out policy decisions, including the preparation and filing of applications with the Commission? If it is demonstrated that the licensee has retained control of policy decisions, this serves as another contributing factor in determining that the licensee has not relinquished control of its licensed facilities to a third party. •Is the licensee is charge of employment, supervision, and dismissal of personnel? Retention of control over such personnel matters would tend to support a conclusion that the licensee has not relinquished control to a third party through a management agreement or other arrangement. •Is the licensee in charge of the payment of financing obligations, including expenses arising out of operation of the licensed facilities? If the licensee has retained responsibility for such expenses, such retention of control will be taken into account in determining whether the licensee has relinquished control of its facilities to a third party. •Does the licensee receive monies and profits derived from operation of the licensed facilities? Again, the role of the licensee with regard to receipt of profits and other monies is one of the determining factors with regard to whether the licensee has relinquished control of its facilities to a third party through a management agreement or other arrangement. In this proceeding our purpose is to examine whether management agreements which do not involve any relinquishment of control under the Intermountain test still should be deemed to confer attributable interests to the managing party under the agreement. We seek comment on this issue. 8. In particular, commenters should address the following questions. First, could management agreements be structured in such a way that the manager's access to the type of information described in the preceding paragraph would not necessarily have any adverse effect on competition? Commenters should address the specific components of such management agreements, and discuss how these components would protect against anti-competitive effects. Commenters also should address whether examination of such management agreements would require an unreasonable expenditure of Commission staff and other resources and whether there are effective alternatives to such a review procedure that would address our concern. 9. Second, should a management agreement be treated as an attributable interest in all cases, including the PCS spectrum aggregation cap, the PCS-cellular cross-ownership restrictions, and any overall CMRS spectrum aggregation cap the Commission may establish in this docket? In addressing this question, commenters should explore any factors and considerations that would support a conclusion that treatment of a management agreement as an attributable interest would be necessary or appropriate in certain of these cases, but not in others. 10. Third, if we conclude that management agreements or similar arrangements should be treated as attributable interests, what administrative rules would be necessary to enforce such a rule? Would reporting requirements be necessary to enable the Commission to record and monitor instances in which CMRS licensees enter into management agreements for the operation of their systems? For example, in the SMR industry, some private radio licensees have entered into agreements that permit a third party manager to use the system's entire capacity. Although we have reclassified interconnected wide area SMRs as CMRS, SMRs licensed as of August 10, 1993 will continue to be regulated as PMRS during the transition period and SMRs that are not interconnected will remain PMRS. We seek comment on how we should treat such arrangements for purposes of attribution.
