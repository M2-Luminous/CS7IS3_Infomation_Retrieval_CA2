FR940523-0-00061 FR940523-0-00014 H. Actions Subject to Appeals Procedures Section 765.22 of the proposed rule provided procedures for appealing the Department's determination concerning the total dry short tons of byproduct material quantity and Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material quantity present at a site. Although proposed §765.22 provided licensees the opportunity to appeal the Department's dry short tons of byproduct material quantity determination, several commenters argued that proposed §765.10(b), which required a licensee to either concur with the Department's determination or waive or exhaust its right of appeal prior to submitting a claim for reimbursement, effectively forced licensees to forego their right of appeal to obtain timely reimbursement. These commenters expressed concern that licensees would be unfairly penalized if denied reimbursement during the potentially lengthy appeals period. The Department agrees with these commenters and has eliminated the requirement that a licensee waive its right of appeal with respect to a quantity determination of dry short tons of byproduct material prior to submitting a claim. However, in order to define the Federal reimbursement ratio that the Department will use to calculate reimbursement, the Department must, prior to providing any reimbursement to a licensee, make a determination concerning the total and Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material quantities present at each site on October 24, 1992. Therefore, although under the final rule a licensee may submit a claim for reimbursement while appealing the Department's dry short tons of byproduct material quantity determination, the appeal must be made within 45 days after receiving notice of such determination. The 45-day limit provides a licensee with the right to appeal without foregoing the right to timely reimbursement and helps ensure that the Department is able to make the determinations necessary for orderly administration of the reimbursement program. Under §765.10(b), the Department's dry short tons of byproduct material quantity determinations will be used to calculate that portion of an approved claim that will be reimbursed. If the licensee's appeal of the Department's initial determination is successful, the difference between the initial quantity determination and that established by the appeals process will be paid to the licensee. Some commenters noted that the proposed rule did not provide a licensee an opportunity to appeal the Department's decision concerning plans for subsequent remedial action, as well as other determinations required by this rule. This omission in the proposed rule was unintentional. Section 765.22 has been revised and streamlined in the final rule to allow appeals of any Department determination required by this rule, including a decision to reject or modify a plan for subsequent remedial action. While the decision to appeal a Department determination associated with this rule lies in the discretion of each eligible licensee, the rule requires that any appeal comply with the appeals process specified in §765.22. I. Miscellaneous Comments Under §765.3 of the proposed rule, the definition of ``offsite disposal'' refers to disposal of byproduct material from the sole existing thorium mill site pursuant to a plan approved by, or written authorization from, the Illinois Department of Nuclear Safety or other appropriate state agency. One commenter urged that the specific reference to the Illinois Department of Nuclear Safety be deleted from the definition in the event of a name change or revision of responsibilities of that agency, and the definition also include approvals and authorizations from the NRC. The Department has determined that the language of Title X does not limit reimbursement for offsite disposal to activities required by a specific state regulatory authority. Therefore, the definition of ``offsite disposal'' in the final rule has been modified to include activities required by the NRC or the State of Illinois. Another commenter suggested that the Department consider making partial provisional advance payments to licensees, subject to an audit of expenditures. The Department does not have the statutory authority to make partial provisional advance payments. A number of commenters suggested that the Department clarify how available funds will be disbursed if there are insufficient funds for full payment of all claims. Language in the proposed rule did not explicitly specify the priority for disbursement of funds among claims submitted by different review submission deadlines established by the Department. The final rule has been revised to specify that, if funds available are insufficient to make full payment in any given review cycle, all outstanding approved claims will be reimbursed on a prorated basis, regardless of when the claims were submitted or approved. This approach is consistent with the requirement of Title X that reimbursements be made to licensees at least annually. Commenters also requested that claims be processed and paid twice a year. Title X requires that licensees be reimbursed at least annually. Therefore, the Department intends to provide payments to the licensees on at least an annual basis, but the Department is not prepared to commit in the rule to a more frequent reimbursement schedule. The Department has modified §765.20(a) and (d) of the proposed rule to clarify that the claim submission deadline(s) for a given year will be announced in the Federal Register shortly after the annual appropriation of funds by the Congress. To ensure an equitable distribution of annual appropriations, DOE will make payments for approved costs of remedial action from the Fund within one year of the claim submission deadline. Some commenters also urged the Department to modify the proposed rule's application of the inflation index adjustment provided in §765.12 for claims approved for reimbursement. Some commenters argued that claims for reimbursement should be adjusted for inflation from the date the costs were incurred until the date of reimbursement. Others thought that an inflation adjustment should be made for the period between the submission or approval of a claim and the date of reimbursement. Section 1001(b)(2)(D) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296(a)(b)(2)(D)) specifies the authority provided to the Department to adjust certain amounts for inflation. While the Secretary is given discretion to determine the appropriate inflation index to apply, this section dictates the amounts that are subject to adjustment for inflation. Congress explicitly and unequivocally limited the application of the inflation index to ``the amounts in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph [section 1001(b)(2) of the Act]'' (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)(D)). The amounts in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph 1001(b)(2) are $5.50, $270,000,000, and $40,000,000, respectively. The Department is not authorized to adjust for inflation any claims for reimbursement. As a result, the approach taken in the proposed rule has been retained in the final rule. In addition to the revisions discussed above, the Department also made minor clarifying or editorial changes to the proposed rule which are not specifically discussed in this preamble.
