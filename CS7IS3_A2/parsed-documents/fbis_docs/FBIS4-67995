The new unit belongs to the Central Command, and in addition to basic Military Police training, its new recruits will be trained at the Israel Police installations in matters such as dispersing rallies and arresting rioters. Although the new unit's establishment orders do not specifically indicate the civilian population that is to be the target of the Military Police unit's operations, knowledgeable defense establishment sources noted that recent developments, the equipment designated for the unit, and its operational methods all indicate that the unit will mainly operate against the violent Jewish sector in the West Bank. These troops' operational methods and equipment will be similar to those used by the Israel Police rally dispersing units. The decision on the establishment of the unit was made by the late Major General Nehemya Tamari, the former Central Command commander. The unit will be officially announced on 8 May.
