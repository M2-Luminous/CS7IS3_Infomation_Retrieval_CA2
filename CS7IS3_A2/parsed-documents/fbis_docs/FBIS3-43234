[passage omitted] The president sent a message of good wishes and congratulations to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who he said has selflessly stood up for the interests of the Somali people, noting the UN Security Council's day and night effort to ensure that the crisis in Somalia is resolved. The president sent a similar message to the UN Operation in Somalia leadership and staff and wished them success. The president further called on the Somali community to make use of the international assistance which is badly needed by many countries in the world who also face crisis. [passage omitted] On the formation of district and regional assemblies and more so the national assembly, the president called on the Somali people to speed up the formation of those assemblies which the world and all peace-loving people see as the only solution of reviving the nationhood of Somalia. The president further highlighted the way the 12 factions are fully involved in the faster formation of those assemblies in order to establish the interim national assembly and further called on our brothers the Somali National Alliance [SNA] and their supporters to be positive and flexible towards the peace calls by their brothers [the 12 factions], and if their [SNA] peace call is genuine, for them to participate in the formation of the assemblies, which is vital. Today we are not in a position of confrontation and blaming each other but we are at the crossroads of reviving the nationhood of the Somali people, the president said. [passage omitted] Finally, President Ali Mahdi Mohamed called on the Somali people wherever they may be to pray to God to bestow success and prosperity on Somalia in this year 1994.
