In fact over 4 million people (2.3 million in the Armed Forces) have been put "under arms" in the country. Besides the Army and Internal Troops, Mobile Troops are being formed. The Ministry for Emergency Situations is planning to form its own navy. Military formations are being recreated within the Federal Counterintelligence Service system and in the Federal Government Communications Service. The president's Security Service is being expanded. Kolesnikov said that Russia "is not in a position to maintain four armies." He stated that the Russian Federation Defense Ministry is ready, "should the government so decide," to transfer the Russian Federation Navy and part of the Airborne Forces to the Border Guard Troops' command in order to form mobile forces." According to Kolesnikov, because of insufficient resources, this is the fourth year that mobilization assemblies have not been carried out and all large-scale exercises have been scrapped (all that is left is command and staff map exercises). Given normal financing, Kolesnikov said, we would be able to reduce the Army to 1.5 million men as early as this year.
