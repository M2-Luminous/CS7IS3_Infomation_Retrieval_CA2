"Watch my program on 11 February," he requested. And he added sadly: "The last `Paragraph' is at hand." That day the chairman of the All-Russian Television and Radio Company, Oleg Poptsov, informed the collective of a reduction and possibly even full cessation of all original broadcasting starting in March. Programs like Berman's "Paragraph," on which budgetary resources are expended, will go off the air. The reason is trivial--the state does not have the money to maintain its own television. At a meeting with managers of state companies, S. Dubinin, acting minister of finance, officially announced a 50-percent reduction in their financing which, accordingly, will also lead to a reduction in the volume of programming by approximately one half. I do not believe that the government does not have the money. Millions of dollars and billions of rubles [R] were found to restore the burned White House. It was ready to find $500 million for the construction of a new parliamentary center. Until recently, various statesmen gave assurances that the money will also be found for television. At the end of December, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin, while presenting the new manager, A. Yakovlev, to the board of directors of Ostankino, recognized the exceptional "significance" of the electronic resources of mass information and declared firmly: "We will support state TV no matter how difficult it might be. We are not really that poor." At that time the prime minister reported on the government's decision to allocate resources from the budget to pay the debts of the television and radio company to the Ministry of Communications. It is February outside, but last year's debts have still not been paid. The communicators are threatening to strike. The companies are feverishly searching for a way out of the situation that has developed, having realized long ago: Saving the drowning is a matter for those who are drowning. There is no big panic in Ostankino--they are developing scenarios there of the kind of economic structure in which no one will come off the loser. Moreover, Ostankino expends budget resources basically to pay for the services of the Ministry of Communications--independent companies conduct a majority of the programs with their own money. The concern of the first channel is only to invest it in its own air time. Very expensive advertising, which is through the roof on the first channel, makes it possible to pay for a few programs of Ostankino itself. Thus, no matter how much you curse the predominant influence of advertising on the screen, without it the number of programs would have been cut a long time ago--there would have been nothing with which to make them. The situation of the second channel, the Russian channel, is far more difficult. Practically since its first days it has existed as a poor relative that is given crumbs from the grand table. The situation with equipment is bad, the accommodations are tight, there is less advertising, its cost is lower than Ostankino's, and you can count the number of independent producers on one hand--the main part of production has to be produced by the company itself. Russian TV [RTV] is filled up to the ears with promises: In almost three years, five government decrees were adopted concerning RTV. Not one of them has been implemented. In the meantime, many RTV workers justly think that they deserve more attentive treatment for themselves on the part of the authorities: It was precisely Russian TV that in the most tense and most tragic moments of the life of the country demonstrated social and civic responsibility, placing the interests of the country and society above all else. This, however, was appraised in a way. I had occasion to attend a meeting of Deputy Prime Minister V. Shumeyko with RTV immediately after the October events of last year. V. Shumeyko, on behalf of the government, thanked everyone for the selfless work on the night of 3-4 October, calling it a great deed. Oleg Poptsov then expressed the fear. He said, you are now thanking us, you promise manna from heaven, but will it not happen that after a month or two we will be forgotten once again? And we will once again come face to face with many of our problems? Shumeyko promised firmly not to forget, and presented the collective of the company a gift from the government--a mantle clock. "It would have been better if he had presented us a couple of extra microphones," remarked Sveta Sorokina, who was sitting next to me. "Now this clock is ticking off the last minutes of the life of many programs that we will have to drop," Anatoliy Lysenko, RTV's general director, joked bitterly, telling me about the impending cut in broadcasting. The RTV collective is agitated: After cutting broadcasting, a cut in personnel is inevitable. Given the total tragedy of the situation for those specific people whose programs will be canceled in the near future, it should be noted for the sake of objectivity: The programs of both channels required creative revision a long time ago. According to data of the Vs. Vilchek Service, the early morning and late night audiences cannot even be measured--there are practically none. It is also reasonable, in the opinion of many specialists, to have a daytime interval--ongoing daytime programs for business people also have a rating close to zero. Consequently, morning, day, and night segments can be cut without pain to the viewers when, really, there is not enough money. Of course, it would be nice if such a "revision" was conducted accurately and professionally--so that viewers' favorite programs would not suffer qualitatively. Although, as is believed by the deputy chairman of the Federal TV and Radio Service of Russia, Valentin Lazutkin, quantitative economy will lead to nothing, and will hit the communicators first and foremost: The entire system of signal transmission devices was created for specific volumes of broadcasting. It is unrealistic, in his opinion, to give the freed capacities to "private owners": There are no strong nonstate broadcasters today who would be able to pay not only for the production of programs but also for their dissemination to cities and villages. In addition to all this, it is unprofitable to the state. What really unites the country? Television and radio. If the system of federal television and radio broadcasting breaks down--the country will also break down. This is what the people making decisions should realize, believes one of the main Russian television chiefs. Is there a way out of the developing situation or a dead end? Have we arrived there? In my opinion, and in the opinion of many specialists, there is a way out. It is time finally for the state to determine--does it need its own television at all? If it is necessary, it should calculate how much television it is able to handle--after all, the problem of survival that the two major national companies have encountered is also facing oblast and regional companies. And they are all over Russia--90 of them! Without exception, all are on hunger rations, they are feeding only on promises, and they do not know what awaits them tomorrow. At the same time, it is always demanded of them to support and explain to people the policy of a government that wishes to order the music but stubbornly refuses to pay. But all the rest of television that cannot be afforded--give it away. Owners will be found. What they will entertain the viewer with is another question. But a lit-up screen, in any case, is better than a blank one. We lived through this once--and there was nearly a complete "stop."
