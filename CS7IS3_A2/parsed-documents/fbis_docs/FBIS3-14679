A special ministerial committee is to discuss ways of modifying a draft law, Information Minister Michel Samahah said at the end of an emergency cabinet meeting on Tuesday. But Beirut newspapers expected the discussions to be drawn out, noting that the draft law had already been shelved for more than two years. The new law "will never authorise private media to broadcast news but instead invite them to collaborate with the official radio and television," the pro-Syrian daily AL-SAFIR. "A majority of cabinet ministers support a definitive ban on private radio and televisions, which were born of the war and must end with the end of the war," it said. Private radio and television stations have been banned from broadcasting news and political programmes since March 23. The government has restricted all news coverage to state-run Tele Liban and Radio Liban. The move came as the authorities launched an investigation into a church bombing last month that killed 10 worshippers and wounded 54 others. The authorities accuse seven members of the Lebanese Forces (LF) Christian militia of involvement in the attack. They have arrested the group's deputy Fu'ad Malik and outlawed the LF, which formed a political party in 1991. The move against the LF, one of the militias widely held responsible for much of the bloodshed and destruction in Lebanon's 1975-1990 war, has divided public opinion. But the ban on broadcasts has led several political and religious leaders as well as ordinary people to express fears it could mean an end to Lebanon's political freedoms, although the government insists it's only temporary. Former MP Butrus Harb charged that the ban was shifting Lebanon "from a democracy to a totalitarian regime." The leader of the Iranian-backed Hizballah movement, Shaykh Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, warned that "the turn of the print media will come, and Lebanon will become like all Arab countries, colourless and insipid." Right-wing Christian Phalange Party leader George Sa'adah joined in to say that "a distinction must be made between security problems and freedom of opinion." State-run Tele Liban, meanwhile, started Wednesday to broadcast hourly news bulletins for the first time since its creation in 1959 to fill the news vacuum in the country. Official Radio Liban, which is picked up on medium wave in the Greater Beirut area only, also began broadcasting news on its FM channel to cover the entire country. Around 50 private radio and television stations sprouted up during the war, most of them illegally. The ban affects around 20 stations which broadcast daily news and political programmes, including Future Television which is owned by billionaire Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.
