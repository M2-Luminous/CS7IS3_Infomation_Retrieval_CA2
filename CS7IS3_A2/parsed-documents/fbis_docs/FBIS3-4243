The move is aimed at accelerating the modernization and internationalization of China's international economic and trade arbitration. Cheng Dejun, vice-chairman and secretary-general of the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC), said here today that the new rules will give better expression to the principle of respecting the will of the parties concerned and will be loser to international practice. The existing rules for CIETAC, which is attached to the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), went into force five years ago. Cheng told a press conference that the amendment will better meet the demand of China's further reform and opening-up and building of a socialist market economy. The new rules are complete in contents and easier to apply. Added to the contents are provisions about jurisdiction, arbitration agreement, withdrawal of arbitrators, evidence, mediation, principles and deadlines for hearing cases, examination and rendering of awards, and making, alteration and addition of rulings, simple procedure, and abandoning of disagreement as well as the working language for the hearing. Cheng said that the new rules are more convenient for parties concerned and conducive to working efficiency and an independent, fair, smooth and prompt settlement of international economic and trade disputes. CIETAC has drawn up a new list of 290 arbitrators including 87 from 22 other countries and regions. During the past few years, CIETAC has accepted over 200 cases annually; last year the figure rose sharply to a record 504, an increase of some 90 percent over the previous year.
