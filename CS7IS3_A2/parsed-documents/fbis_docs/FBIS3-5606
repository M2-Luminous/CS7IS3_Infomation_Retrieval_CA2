Efforts must be made to diversify our international relations activities. The overseas Vietnamese is an important force that can introduce our country to the nations of the world. We must on the one hand, organize overseas Vietnamese and urge them to help propagate our market economy and promote tourism in Vietnam in their country of residence. We must also invite scientists and business management specialists to visit our country (on various occasions and in various forms, including the possibility of joining our state agencies). We must strive to create favorable conditions for overseas Vietnamese to visit their homeland and invest in production and business at home for their benefit and that of the nation. There are some sectors and localities where residents have a large number of relatives living abroad. In this case, efforts should be made to set up a liaison committee or an association of relatives of overseas Vietnamese to keep them well informed about state lines and policies, while conveying their relatives' aspirations to mass organizations or the administration. Efforts must be made to encourage relatives of overseas Vietnamese to further their studies or work abroad. The state should do its best to protect the interest of overseas Vietnamese in accordance with international law, while encouraging them to strengthen unity, help one another, and uphold national prestige. 2. Efforts must be made to broaden democracy while maintaining social discipline. Under our current politico-social system, the party leads, the state manages, and the people are masters. Thus, all powers belong to the people. In exercising their powers, the people are building the state apparatus through general elections. On the other hand, they have the obligation of participating in formulating state laws, monitoring activities of the state, serving the nation, and living and working in accordance with the law. This is the dialectical relationship between representative democracy and direct democracy. This relationship helps broaden democracy, while strengthening social discipline. We must live and work in accordance with the law. However, the law alone cannot resolve all issues in the daily life, which is full of complicated social problems. As a result, while formulating various laws we must develop our social mechanism and promote the people's rights to autonomy in managing the family, ward, village, and community activities to improve their daily life and to settle social issues through social contracts. At the grass-roots level, we should set up a conciliation council to help the chief of the village or ward, the people's committee, and mass organizations to resolve issues. This council should be composed of people with good educational backgrounds and who are trusted by the people. To broaden democracy and strengthen law and discipline, there must be consistent efforts to disseminate state laws widely. Efforts must also be made to attach importance to disseminating the law on civil and human rights so that people will realize their obligations. At the same time, this is to arm the people with the knowledge to fight civil and human rights violations. Essential efforts must be made to clearly specify the authority and responsibility of heads of state agencies in accordance with the principle that the more authority an officer holds, the more responsibility he must bear. We must strive to oppose the usurpation of power and uphold the principle of checks and balances of power and responsibility. We must make more effort to study, perfect, and revise the law on electing and appointing heads of state agencies to overcome negative phenomena such as formalistic democracy, arbitrariness, and disorganized freedom. We may exercise national power by convening a national congress comprising of authorized delegates with a good background, who are trustworthy, and who represent the people's strata, nationalities, and religious groups to discuss the most important national issues. This will be like the Dien Hong Congress under the Tran Dynasty or the special political conference of President Ho Chi Minh during the war against the U.S. 3. Efforts must be made to overcome prejudice, discrimination, and hatred among the people and to look to the future to strengthen national unity and uphold the spirit of mutual trust for the sake of national independence and freedom and happiness of the people. The achievements of our renovation have helped us to effectively implement the market-based multisectorial economy under state management and to diversify our diplomatic activities. It is natural that we must advance further to establish the great national unity bloc in the new situation and tasks to strengthen unity among the masses in a more profound and far-reaching way. It is necessary to say that the Vietnamese nation has a great social structure comprising various strata, nationalities, and religious groups living both at home and abroad. Although they come from different backgrounds, have different levels of education and capabilities, and different tastes and experiences, they originate from Vietnam, a nation with a longstanding and heroic history. The enemy's war of aggression that caused untold misery and loss to Vietnam has imbued in the heart of all Vietnamese the spirit of patriotism and pride in their fatherland. At present, our country is enjoying new opportunities while facing numerous ordeals affecting our national fate and destiny. As Vietnamese, we all want our country to grasp opportunities to overcome difficulties, poverty, and backwardness and develop itself into a prosperous nation with a due position in the world community. None of us want our country to remain underdeveloped forever. Therefore, the above-mentioned goals must be included in the great national unity policy. Let's share similarities and accept differences. Let's try to get rid of prejudices, complexes, and hatred and work toward the goals of building a beautiful country both for the present and future generations. To this end, we must, first of all, promote the spirit of genuine concord, equality, and mutual respect. Let's avoid criticism, disparagement, and harsh treatment and renounce attempts to eliminate one another. It is necessary to respect the people's beliefs and protect their places of worship. It is important to keep the components of the great national unity bloc within the people's mastership system. If there are different political beliefs, let's sit down and talk in a sensible and reasonable way. Let's exercise dictatorship only over those who betray the country or violate the law and let's make sure that their cases are tried according to set court procedures. Leading officials in charge of state agencies, mass societies, and front organizations must be selected through truly democratic elections and must include people who have ethics and talents and who truly represent the masses. 4. It is necessary for the Vietnam Fatherland Front to shift its duty from national liberation to national defense and construction, bearing in mind the need to give priority to socioeconomic development tasks. From 1994 till the end of the 20st century, we must focus on the following four key tasks: -- Motivating all individuals, families, and the entire people to make personal efforts to overcome poverty and backwardness, effect changes for the better, and compete against and cooperate with one another in the spirit of fairness. Steps must be taken to promote the multisectorial economy based on the market mechanism and under state management. It is necessary to effect economic restructuring in the direction of industrialization and modernization and in keeping with efforts to expand, diversify, and multilateralize diplomatic relations. -- Paying due attention to the human resources development, regarding the human factor not only as the target of but also the motive behind the formulation of socioeconomic development programs and public utility projects to benefit the country and people. It is necessary to make due efforts to broaden democracy, implement social justice, and ameliorate the people's intellectual background and living conditions. Steps must be taken to improve the quality of cultural, educational, and public healthcare services. Effective measures must be adopted to implement the population activities and family planning program. -- Creating preliminary conditions and opportunities for everyone to overcome poverty and backwardness and enrich themselves and society. These goals can be reached through the granting of the land use rights to peasants and the application of the share-holding system to workers. It is necessary for the banking system to intensify the mobilization of funds to grant sufficient loans to the people to increase economic activities. Long-term incentive measures must be worked out to make all economic sectors have a sense of security while investing talents and capital in production and business activities. It is important to encourage all individuals and families to enrich themselves and help make the country powerful and bring about justice and civilization in society through the movement to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty. It is necessary to motivate the people to participate in the campaign against corruption, smuggling, the production of fake goods, and other negative phenomenon in society. Greater attention must be paid to charity work, humanitarian activities, and the movement to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty. Vigorous efforts must be made to step up educational activities and improve everyone's cultural and professional knowledge. Regular refresher courses must be conducted to help the people improve their scientific, technological, professional, economic, cultural, and educational backgrounds. It is important to promote the cultural quintessence of the nation and combine this move with efforts to learn from the cultural heritages of mankind. Prompt steps must be worked out to gain access to modern science and technology. Measures must be taken to preserve and restore cultural relics as well as oppose the depletion or pollution of the environment. -- Greater attention must be paid to the consolidation of the all-people national defense network and the people's security system. The above-mentioned tasks have been initiated and directed by party platforms, directives, and resolutions as well as by state laws and regulations. All those legal documents cannot generate practical results unless we take into account the strength of the great national unity bloc. The Vietnam Fatherland Front plays an important role because it solicits the views of the people and incorporate them in the formulation of party policies and lines as well as state laws and regulations. IV. Consolidating and broadening the Vietnam Fatherland Front. The Vietnam Fatherland Front is a political alliance which serves as a venue for mass organizations and representatives of people of all walks of life and different social classes, ethnic groups, and religions to unite action on a voluntary basis. It also serves as the political basis of the people's administration and is directed by the Communist Party of Vietnam. All those components form an overall network of party leadership, state management, and people's mastery under the political system of our regime. They share one thing in common, namely to work toward the goals of national defense and construction. Each component is part and parcel of an overall structure but plays a separate role and generates a different result. 1. In its capacity both as an affiliated organization and a managing organ, the party cannot consolidate the front's structure or develop its role as a genuine mass society unless it observes truly democratic principles governing its leaderhip and refrains itself from impositions or taking over the work of mass organizations. The party exerts its leadership through its platforms and lines and policies as well as through the power of persuasion created by the examplary conduct and vanguard role of party organizations and party members in the front. It is necessary to fully respect the independence and self-rule of the Vietnam Fatherland Front. The party may introduce its platforms and lines and policies to the front or recommend party members to join the front's management but is not supposed to give instructions to the front or have party members joint the front's management without going through democratic elections. It is necessary for cadres and party members to clearly realize the importance of the front-related policies and tasks. Efforts must be made to avoid incorrect views, especially the bad practice of belittling front-related work, and the evils of prejudices and narrow-mindedness. Steps must be taken to overcome the situation in which party officials resort to imposition in assigning cadres to take charge of the front without checking if their qualifications meet work requirements. It is important to formulate proper policies toward cadres in charge of the front. Efforts are needed to overcome shortcomings and weaknesses, thereby improving the party's leadership over the front a step further. 2. It is necessary for state agencies to fully understand and institutionalize the duties and rights of the front, so that it can act as a firm political basis of the people's administration, and most importantly, can participate in the process of forming elected organs, drafting legal documents, managing socioeconomic activities, and overseeing the operations of state organs, elected government officials, and state cadres and employees. It is necessary for state agencies to go out of their way to join hands with front committees at all levels in ensuring strict implementation of the Constitution and laws and regulations. 3. It is important to consolidate the Vietnam Fatherland Front and broaden its organizations and activities. This is for it to serve as an effective venue for rallying people from all walks of life in the great national unity bloc, where everyone can show demomstrate their power and express their aspirations and where members of the affiliated organizations can achieve unanamity of action and help the administration in resolving the internal disputes among people, implementing democracy, making improvements in society, looking after and protecting the legitimate interests of people of all walks of life, and building and safeguarding the administration as well as overseeing its activities. The front is dutybound to take part in socioeconomic management, help with the implementation of socioeconomic development and national security and defense tasks, and motivate mass organizations to participate in the struggle against corruption, smuggling, and other social vices, thereby contributing to strengthening relations between the people and the party and state. The front operates in the spirit of consultation, democracy, equality, sincere cooperation, mutual respect, and unanimity of action with all affiliated organizations under a common action program. Plans must be worked out to consolidate the front committees at all levels, bearing in mind the need to improve the quality of leading cadres. It is important to see to it that more trustworthy and highly-competent individuals representing people from all walks of life and different ethnic groups, religious beliefs, intellectual backgrounds, and business circles join the front and form a highly motivated collective, which is endowed with cultural quintessence, wisdom, talents, and high resolve and which typically stands for the vitality of a country now moving toward progress. The front committees at all levels play a key role in coordinating action among the front's affiliated organizations and administrative organs at the same level and in launching a motivation campaign to win the hearts and minds of senior citizens, notables, intellectuals, industrialists, businessmen, hilltribes, religious leaders, and Vietnamese residents abroad. As far the consolidation and broadening of the front's organizations and activities are concerned, it is necessary to focus on both grass-roots and central level establishments and step up the front's public relations. 4. The relations between the VFF and the party and state are built upon the common goals of making the people rich and the country powerful as well as of bringing about justice and civilization in society. They follow a two-way course of action, namely the leadership and its objects. Moreover, they are based on the principles of equality, consultation, dialogue, and constructive criticism. The endeavors to consolidate the great national unity bloc and the National United Front are strategically important to the overall political system and necessitate the common efforts of all echelons and sectors. It is necessary to first disseminate the contents of this resolution to all party organs, state agencies, front organizations, and mass societies. We are convinced that the Political Bureau's Resolution on Great National Unity and Consolidation of the National United Front will create an atmosphere of concord, mutual trust, enthusiasm, and national pride among people of all walks of life, social classes, ethnic groups, and religious organizations at home as well as among Vietnamese residents abroad, and also a new strength for the goals of making the people rich and the country powerful and of bringing about justice and civilization in society come true.
