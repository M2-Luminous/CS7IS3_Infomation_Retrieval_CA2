A spokesman claimed that the removal of Hamish Cowell was "totally unjustified." At the same time, he tried to defend the feeble excuse for Britain's unilateral action when ordering Vahid Bolurchi to leave last Thursday. The official reason for the expulsion of the Iranian first secretary was said to be because of attempts by embassy staff to distribute "forged documents" about the UK's anti-Muslim policy in Bosnia, which is universally known. The raising of such an excuse shows British sensitivity about its failed policy, which frequently comes under attack from the Bosnian Government itself for the way in which London is attempting to impose a settlement by rewarding the Serb aggressors. The Foreign Office spokesman maintained it wished to keep quiet its initial provocative move against Iran in the hope of limiting publicity, but the real motive may be more associated with trying to hide the embarrassment of a bug being found in the Iranian Embassy. Britain's strained relations with Iran have been dominated by a history of tit-for-tat exchanges that have always proved a fruitless ploy for the UK. At one stage prior to Tehran severing ties in 1989, representation was reduced to only a mission head. The new expulsions cut the current number of diplomats to 14 and indications are in the present climate they may not end there with a number of Iranian parliamentarians already calling for relations with Britain to be reviewed.
