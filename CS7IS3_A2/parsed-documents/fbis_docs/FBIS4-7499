Mihajlovski commentary: "A Group Photograph With the Forest Ranger"] [Text] The United States has taken matters into its own hands. Just like the joke about the partisans and Germans fighting in the forest, when the forest ranger arrives and kicks the latter and the former out of the forest. The United States has been observing the EU countries expressing all their principles, vetos, ministerial councils, rotating presidencies, voting practices, and declarations without displaying the strength to cope with the Greek-Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] dispute, and it finally decided to send its own man to try and finish the job. U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy, New York lawyer Matthew Nimietz, was very clear: "We bear in mind the fact that we have very friendly relations with both sides, but also the fact that this issue is of concern to the region and the world." He was even more plain in Athens: "This is a dispute that endangers peace and stability in the region, therefore it is of concern to the United States." Formally, Niemitz is only helping the interrupted negotiating process begun under the sponsorship of the United Nations. Therefore, the fate of future Macedonian-Greek relations, right now, depends on the skills of Cyrus Vance and Matthew Niemitz -- both New York lawyers. After recognizing Macedonia, the United States halted the establishment of diplomatic relations because of Greece's opposition. However, its clear interest in this region was expressed for the first time last Summer, when 300 U.S. soldiers landed at Skopje Airport and joined the UNPROFOR forces. The inclusion of Niemitz in the mediation process between Greece and FYROM, particularly the arrival of John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff, in Skopje that same week, only added to the belief that the United States is really determined to have a strong influence in this part of the Balkans. Greece, on the other hand, is caught in a very inconvenient position -- on the one side pressed and embarrassed by its partners in the European Union, and on the other side limited in its actions because of public opinion, to which it continually serves up mass national meetings, has also turned to the United States. After discussions with Niemitz, Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papulias stated that he hoped the following weeks would give a positive result. Papulias's optimism becomes more understandable in the context of the announced visit of Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to the United States, scheduled for 22 April. Namely, Niemitz made it clear that Washington would like to see the dispute between the two countries solved before this date. In view of Clinton's posing with Tudjman and Izetbegovic for reporters after setting down on paper their Constitution within two weeks, something the European Union did not succeed in doing in two years, a logical question arises: Will Gligorov and Papandreou have a picture taken together with the "forest ranger" before or after 22 April?
