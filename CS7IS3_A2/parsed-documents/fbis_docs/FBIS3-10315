The military leadership and a parliamentary delegation met on Thursday for three hours to analyze the project observers have called "neither-nor," which stands for neither Army Chief Raoul Cedras, nor deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The military has not yet commented publicly on the plan, which is supported by the U.S. State Department, while some legislators expressed reservations following the meeting local radio stations termed "tumultuous. It is too early to tell what the military will say. We hope they can understand that this is the best solution," Duly Brutus, one of the members of the congressional delegation, stated. A legislator said the military has reacted "with anger and indignation," and has questioned "the parliamentarians' authority to make decisions involving the military without first consulting the military." Aristide, overthrown in September of 1991 in a coup d'etat led by Cedras, does not support the legislators' plan either. Point five of the initiative stipulates Army Chief Gen. Raoul Cedras' retirement, and Point six, the appointment of a new chief of police. Although Point 11 refers to the return of the president, the initiative's supporters say this is a way of indefinitely prolonging his exile because first, the sanctions would be lifted and no date for his return has been set. "The transition to democracy involved concessions from all the parties," Marc Bazin, second de facto prime minister, declared.
