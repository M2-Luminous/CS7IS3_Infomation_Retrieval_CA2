Second, it turns us into a toy in the hands of American plundering murderers who, because of the fact that Islam rules in Iran--and only because of this--are, in addition to their numerous hostilities, overtly preventing the export of advanced technology to this Islamic country and are also threatening and intimidating the other industrial countries to prevent them from doing so. But at the same time they are trying--very magnanimously!--to find a way into our unfortunately weak markets by exporting various brands of American cigarettes, soft drinks, candy, chewing gum, chips, lollipops, and other unnecessary items. Third, the sacred system of the Islamic Republic is considered to be the standard-bearer in the fight against the world hegemonists. And in the full-fledged campaign that has recently been carried out in various parts of the world of Islam against the aggressors headed by America, the deprived and oppressed nations follow the pattern of victorious resistance by the Islamic Iranian nation in their sacred jihad. Thus, the importation of American products only helps to mar this sacred pattern. We believe that, for America, this part of the charade which it has started is more important than the other parts, in the sense that on the one hand it prevents the exporting of advanced technology from the industrial world to Iran, thus slowing down the progress of this Islamic country and, on the other, by exporting chewing gum, cigarettes, candy, lollipops, chips, and other such items, it puts up the false "representational sign" in our Islamic country. But even though this "sign" is false, other nations who have turned their eyes to Islamic Iran in their anti-American struggles are starting to doubt whether they should "tread" the same path that our Muslim people have taken. We believe that the boycotting of American products by the late imam, may his soul be sanctified, was meant, first and foremost, to maintain the dividing line that separates us from America and to state to the world of Islam that the enmity that the great satan has toward Islam, the Muslims, and the deprived people will never be forgotten in history. We can go on and on in discussing this topic. But in this commentary we want to discuss another issue. And that is that in his news conference with domestic and foreign correspondents--the text of which was carried by the Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran--esteemed President Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani stated in answer to a question put to him by a KEYHAN-E HAVA'I correspondent on why some of the esteemed officials of the system are not very keen on being interviewed by domestic correspondents: "This should not be so. All the ministers are ready to give the necessary explanations, each in his own sector." This is very encouraging and will help to clarify the ambiguities spread by our enemies about the policies of the sacred system of the Islamic Republic and of its caring officials in the same way that the esteemed president's news conference played an outstanding and effective role to this effect. But in another part of his news conference, Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani stated in answer to a KEYHAN correspondent that some American goods should be imported for some of the country's industrial needs, such as spare parts for factories and aircraft which have been mostly manufactured in the United States; and then he asked the KEYHAN correspondent: "Are you suggesting that we should stop all this?" And when the KEYHAN correspondent explained that he was speaking metaphorically and referring to products such as Coca Cola, which is a good example of an unnecessary commodity--as a symbol of foreign presence--the esteemed president stated: "In my opinion, that symbolism is somewhat common." In view of the outstanding Islamic and revolutionary personality of the esteemed president, who was one of the backbones of the revolution and one of the closest and most devoted and committed companions of his eminence the imam, may his soul be sanctified, and of the leader of the revolution, we consider it our duty to refer to the question by the KEYHAN correspondent, whose remarks were left incomplete in the recent news conference, and to point out that the reason why Coca Cola was cited as an example of an unnecessary item is that unfortunately without any justification, an extensive advertising campaign is continuing in our markets with posters on city walls for unnecessary items such as American cigarettes and so on. And while we do not believe that looking at American products from this angle is a "common" issue, we firmly believe that had the esteemed president paid closer attention to what our correspondent meant with his question, he would have agreed with our point of view, since in his news conference the topic of vigilance and alertness toward American ploys were clearly visible. Another point is that in view of Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani's remarks in answer to the question put to him by the KEYHAN-E HAVA'I correspondent on the need for the esteemed ministers and officials of the Islamic system to speak with the press in order to clarify ambiguities, it is feared that in justifying their lack of attention to some questions by the correspondents, the esteemed officials will avoid answering by alleging that these questions are "common!"
