We should actually utilize $10 billion in foreign capital and accelerate the transformation of old enterprises and the upgrading of products by using foreign capital. 2. We should continue to focus the utilization of foreign capital on infrastructure, such as the energy industry, communications, and telecommunications; on basic industries, such as the petroleum, chemical, iron and steel, electronic, and auto industries; on the development of agriculture which earns foreign exchange; and on the construction of poverty-stricken mountain areas. 3. Through various kinds of investment-attracting activities, we should attract more internationally well- known big enterprises and financial groups to invest in Guangdong, while continuing to do a good job in cooperating with medium-sized and small overseas enterprises.
