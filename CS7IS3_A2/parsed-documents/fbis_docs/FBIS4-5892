"Indonesia will build two lighthouses in the south and north coastal areas of the island to prevent border violations with PNG usually committed by local fishermen," head of Border Affairs Department of the Jaya provincial administration M.D. Lewar said Thursday. The plan was discussed during the border liaison meeting in 1993 and was agreed in the first round of the meeting in March 21 to 23, 1994 held in Lorengau, capital city of PNG's province of Manus, he said. According to the Lorengau's agreement, the lighthouse in the northern coastal area will be built in the border of Skouw village, Jayapura regency and Wutung village, PNG's province of Sandaun, while the lighthouse in the south will be built in the borders of Irian Jaya's regency of Merauke and western province of PNG. Apart from building lighthouses, Indonesia will also build five guard-houses as support facilities for the lighthouses, especially in th remote areas, he said. Lewar expressed hopes that with the lighthouses, fishermen from Irian Jaya and PNG would better know which water they are fishing.
