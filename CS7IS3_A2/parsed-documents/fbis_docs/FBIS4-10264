This was disclosed after the meeting, when Gen. Cordero chatted with the media, at times in a harsh tone of voice. [Begin recording] [Cordero] You have asked me on several occasions whether or not I think about the matter. The truth is that I do think about it. [Unidentified reporter] No, what I meant is what do you think about Carabineros officers being charged with unlawful association for terrorist purposes? [Cordero] Well, that will be determined by the investigations. [Reporter] Yes, but Judge Milton Juica has sentenced several Carabineros officers for unlawful association for terrorist purposes. [Cordero] Yes. The ruling has not been appealed yet. [end recording] Later on, Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma said that the government is fully satisfied with the solution to this problem. [Begin recording] [Perez] It is a solution. We always maintained we thought it unsuitable that General Stange remained head of the institution while the investigations continued. We believe the right thing has been done, and greatly appreciate Gen. Stange's gesture to request the Supreme Court to appoint a special judge to hear the case. This gives him and the public guarantees. We are fully satisfied. [Reporter] Does this mean that the National Security Council will definitely not be summoned? [Perez] I think so, definitely. [passage omitted] It was not stated how long Gen. Stange will be on leave, but Minister Perez did say he would remain on leave until his legal situation is resolved.
