It is something new in China's mainland, which has been following the principle of "to each according to his work" since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. Today, this guideline for income distribution remains the mainstay in the country. Under Shenzhen's new distribution system, investors shoulder the risks, as well as profits, of their investments. No doubt, the newspaper points out, the new system does not repel the principle of "to each according to his work," since the labour force is still one of the key productive factors among labour, land and funds. With the deepening of the market-oriented reforms, more Chinese people are not only aware that they can increase earnings with more manual and mental work, but also they are entitled to larger profits with more investment. These investments include both money and properties. Migrants According to the Shenzhen Special Zone Daily, local farmers used to have the highest income, followed by immigrant farmers, self-employed businessmen, enterprise employees, government functionaries and temporary migrants. The income gaps among these groups can be mainly traced to their different amount of investments, says the newspaper. In addition to the income earned through farmwork and sideline production, farmers can get interests from bank deposits, rent from let houses and profits from land lease. By contrast, temporary migrants are only paid for manual labour. Shenzhen's experiment is conducive to developing a market economy, says the daily. Under the socialist market economy, the distribution of income is based on a market mechanism instead of the government monopoly; otherwise it would be hard to guarantee the fairness of distribution. During past reforms, Shenzhen has rejected many traditional norms and adapted to new systems practical in a market economy. The new income distribution system is another step forward. Many new companies in Shenzhen are foreign-funded, with the Chinese partners providing the land for workshops. In this way, the Chinese side can profit by investing capital and land. This is a concrete example of the new distribution system and should be encouraged, says the newspaper. It can encourage individuals to invest their surplus funds, land and houses into production, increasing the efficiency of resource allocation, improving productivity, boosting social wealth and creating more job opportunities, says the newspaper. Also the State coffer can benefit. Self-employed businesses in Shenzhen paid taxes of 314 million yuan ($36.1 million) in 1992. Encouraged by the new income distribution system, the region's private economy, as an engine of the local economy, has been advancing robustly. And personal savings soared to a record high of 17.5 billion yuan ($2 billion) last year, the newspaper said. Meanwhile, more and more people lease out their houses and invest in industries such as securities. Fortune Although the new system can avoid egalitarianism, efforts must be paid to fight against smuggling, tax dodging and graft-taking. Policies and regulations must be enforced to guard against social and political chaos triggered by the ever-widening income disparations in the fierce market competition. Since different economic sectors have increased co-operation and infiltration, and people's income comes from various sources, the management of distribution should target controlling the scale of individual income. The sources from which people earn their income should be overlooked. It is important to improve the management of individual income tax, by issuing and seriously enforcing laws on taxation, says the newspaper. The government, aiming to bring universal prosperity to the Chinese, should encourage different economic sectors to boom, as long as they are operated within State regulations and laws, says the newspaper.
