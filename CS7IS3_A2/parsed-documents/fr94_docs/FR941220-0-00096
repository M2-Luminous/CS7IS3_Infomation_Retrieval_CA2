FR941220-0-00096 FR941220-0-00014 l. Conforming regulatory language on violations to the statutory language regarding levels of employer culpability (See § XXXX .805(a).) In the MTINA amendments to the INA, Congress created different culpability standards for the imposition of civil money penalties and debarment for the different violations of the statute; e.g., a violation of the working condition and wage elements of the LCA requires ``willfulness,'' while a violation of the notice element must be ``substantial.'' In the January 13, 1992, Interim Final Rule, which modified the earlier Interim Final Rule to implement the MTINA amendments, the Department inadvertently erred with regard to the culpability standards for two types of violations. In § XXXX .805(a), which lists the various violations with their particular culpability standards, the Department omitted the ``substantial'' failure to specify the number of workers sought, the occupational classification in which the workers will be employed, and the wage rate and conditions under which they will be employed. This violation has been added at § XXXX .805(a)(5). Similarly, in the Interim Final Rule at § XXXX .805(a)(5), which specifies a ``substantial'' failure to make available for public examination the application and necessary documents at the employer's place of business or worksite, the Department identified an incorrect standard of culpability; this provision should have carried a simple failure standard, i.e., a failure to make available the required documents for public examination need not be substantial. Section § XXXX .805(a) has been amended to conform with the statute.
