The braking of the economic ties that have taken shape, the obsolete technical and technological base, the exhaustion of natural resources, and other circumstances -- very important as they are -- are now retreating to second place after mutual nonpayments based on their impact on the decline in industrial production, business activity, hidden and obvious unemployment, delays in paying wages, and, as a consequence, the increase of social tension in society. The mutual indebtedness of economic agents in a market economy is a normal phenomenon caused by the expansion of credit and monetary relationships and one that insures the uninterrupted operation of the economic mechanism; however, the failure of economic agents to fulfill the financial obligations assumed by them automatically leads to their bankruptcy. Under our conditions with the absence of an effective bankruptcy mechanism, the overdue indebtedness of the main economic agents has acquired a mass nature. Whereas the total creditor indebtedness of industrial, construction, transport, and agricultural enterprises and organizations was 48 trillion rubles at the end of 1993, overdue liabilities were 17 trillion rubles, that is, more than 35 percent. Correspondingly, the incurred debt on 1 January 1994 was equal to 47 trillion rubles, including an overdue indebtedness of 18 trillion rubles, i.e., more than 38 percent. Of the total amount of overdue creditor and incurred liabilities, 77 and 79 percent, respectively, fall to industry's share. Of all the incurred and creditor indebtedness items, "Indebtedness of Buyers" and "Indebtedness to Suppliers," which compose approximately 70 percent of the incurred and creditor indebtedness, respectively, have paramount importance for industrial production. Late payment for products received leads not only to a worsening of the enterprises' financial condition but also disrupts the production process and, in a number of cases, leads to its stoppage. Moreover, these types of obligations are transmitted from one enterprise to another over the existing cooperation ties, causing a chain reaction of nonpayments. The state itself is aggravating the situation that has taken shape by delaying payments to enterprises for the products produced in accordance with its orders. The overdue indebtedness of industrial enterprises to their suppliers is less than the indebtedness of buyers to these enterprises by more than 3 trillion rubles. In other words, industry is emerging to a certain degree as a creditor for the other branches of the national economy and the budget. Almost all industrial branches, except for non-ferrous metallurgy and the flour, cereal and animal feed industries, have a positive balance in their mutual debts but the nonpayments of electrical energy buyers exceed this branch's debt to suppliers by more than twofold. The branch structure of overdue indebtedness in industry is described by the following data (without considering debts for deliveries within the framework of intergovernmental agreements). Proportion Proportion Proportion of Ratio of of the of the the branch in overdue buyer branch in branch in overdue indebtedness the overdue indebtedness to overdue industrial liabilities to suppliers indebtedness production to buyers on on 1 January to suppliers volume, % 1 January 1994, % on 1 January 1994, % 1994 Industry 100 100 100 1.35 Power industry 9.19 10.9 10.4 2.15 Fuel industry 17.5 28.1 27.0 1.47 Ferrous 9.0 12.2 10.15 1.76 metallurgy Non-ferrous 8.1 4.4 5.8 0.74 metallurgy Chemical and 7.5 8.7 10.9 1.07 petrochemical industry Machine 20.3 18.3 15.2 1.25 building and metal working Wood, 3.9 3.2 3.6 1.05 wood-working, wood-pulp, and paper industry Construction 3.3 2.0 2.6 1.11 materials industry Light industry 5.2 2.5 2.1 1.6 Food industry 12.4 5.8 6.36 1.1 Flour, cereals 2.1 2.1 3.8 0.8 and animal feed industry More than 28 percent of the overdue indebtedness of buyers falls to the fuel industry. Correspondingly, its debts to suppliers form the largest percentage in the debts of all industry -- 27 percent. In this regard, the percentage of the branch's overdue indebtedness in the overall indebtedness of industry significantly exceeds its percentage in the total production volume, that is, the burden of mutual nonpayments is felt most sharply in the fuel industry. The amount of overdue debt -- both that of buyers and that to suppliers -- in industry during 1993 fell somewhat considering inflation. Thus, the total overdue debt to suppliers increased eightfold and prices grew 9-10-fold during this period. However, the nonpayment burden did not become lighter because of this since the decline in production continued and, correspondingly, the potential capabilities of the enterprises to fulfill their financial obligations narrowed. An analysis of the dynamics of industrial production volume and of the overdue indebtedness growth during 1993 shows that the intensiveness (burden) of mutual nonpayments in industrial enterprises grew. Thus, according to the center's calculations, the ratio of quarterly increases in overdue liabilities to production volume increased more than twofold during the year.

It is in these branches and also in the chemical and petrochemical industry that the "burden" of mutual indebtedness is the highest. The worsening of the enterprises' financial condition owing to the increase in the burden of mutual nonpayments is also confirmed by an analysis of the enterprises' ability to pay. According to the results of the first half of the year, the monetary assets, which enterprises had available, exceeded overdue indebtedness to the suppliers 1.24-fold but these assets covered the mentioned indebtedness by only 57.4 percent by the end of the year. Whereas within the structure of all industry, the power industry, fuel industry, machine building and metal working, and the glass, china and pottery industry had an excess of monetary assets over the overdue indebtedness to suppliers at the end of the first half of 1993, the debts significantly exceeded all existing enterprise financial assets by the end of last year in all branches of industry. This is described by the following data: Monetary assets as a percentage Profitability of of overdue indebtedness to production[.sup]*[/], % suppliers 1 January 1 July 1 January 1993 1993 1994 Industry 79.9 124.6 57.4 37.2 Power industry 154.3 119.9 34.1 24.7 Fuel industry 132.7 225.4 83.3 25.6 Ferrous 31.1 72.1 21.2 64.1 metallurgy Non-ferrous 57.7 71.0 82.9 47.2 metallurgy Chemical and 38.7 54.3 17.1 44.7 petrochemical Machine 69.5 119.3 52.1 48.4 building and metal working Wood, 57.2 70.5 32.1 28.4 woodworking, wood-pulp and paper industry Construction 33.0 55.3 20.8 34.0 materials industry Light industry 68.7 86.5 48.3 38.6 Food industry 281.1 98.9 62.7 26.2 Flour, cereals 69.3 29.5 19.1 11.3 and animal feed industry [.sup]*[/]Profit related to the cost of commodity products, during the first nine months of 1993. The enterprises of ferrous metallurgy, the chemical and petrochemical industry, the construction materials industry, and the flour, cereal and animal fodder industry are in a critical condition based on their ability to pay. It is typical that the low ability of industrial enterprises to pay is frequently accompanied by a high or super-high production profitability in a number of branches. Thus, production profitability in ferrous metallurgy was 64 percent and 45-48 percent in the chemical and petrochemical industry, non-ferrous metallurgy, and machine building and metal working. The liberalization of prices led to substantial pressure on the effective demand for products of a production and technical nature and consumer goods. Enterprises tried to compensate for the reduction in the sales volume of products and the amounts of earned monetary assets, which followed this, not by reducing costs and increasing the quality of products but by an additional increase in prices. As a result, the market is narrowing even more, the demand for products is decreasing, their sales and receipts are again falling, and the way out is seen to be a new price increase. The high degree of monopolization in our domestic industry is exerting a definite influence on the level of prices. The Russian Federation's Government has outlined a series of measures to solve the nonpayments problem, in particular, repaying federal budget debts for 1993, legalizing overdue indebtedness by promissory notes, checking on the condition of inefficient production facilities, increasing the responsibility of banks for timely settlement, launching a mechanism for sanctions and the carrying out of bankruptcies, and other measures. Only the integrated use of these measures and the very active participation of regional management structures, commercial banks and enterprises themselves based on agreements with subcontractors and the consumers of their products will permit the problem of mutual nonpayments to be solved. The implementation of the listed measures will not suffer delays: During January 1994 alone, the total overdue creditor indebtedness in the national economy increased another 3 trillion rubles. The overdue incurred debt increased just as much. Solving the nonpayments problem will contribute to ending the crisis phase and stopping the production decline. At the same time, one cannot permit the elimination of enterprises producing vitally necessary products, whose closing would inflict harm on the country's defense and economic security. However, the state must also consider the interests of the creditors when solving this question and, possibly, itself assuming the repayment of these enterprises' debts.
