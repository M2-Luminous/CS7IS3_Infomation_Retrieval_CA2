But, as our correspondent Veselin Angelov reports, the nuclear plant is operating at reduced capacity at the moment. [Angelov] The reduced operating capacity was made necessary by the fall in electricity consumption throughout the country. In fact, only three of the six generating units are in operation at Kozloduy at the moment: These are Units No. 1 and No. 2, each producing 420 megawatts, and the 1,000-megawatt No. 6 Unit. The remaining reactors are shut down for planned maintenance or for reloading with fresh nuclear fuel. The period of their shutdown is being utilized to introduce some new technical features, connected with improving safety of operation. This is a continuous process, prompted by the constant improvements in international standards and the requirements of the World Association of Nuclear Operators.
