There are too many enterprises being set up but too few actually going into production. This is a fairly common phenomenon in the course of developing FFEs. Often after an enterprise is approved, both the Chinese and the foreign sides cannot come through with the capital funds; sometimes the Chinese side has the money, but the other side does not, or sometimes both sides have part of the money, but the amount falls far short of what is stipulated in the contract, so that the enterprise cannot open as scheduled. Consequently, there are many FFEs that exist in name only or are only "half-baked" companies, and ultimately, they become a burden for both sides. Sometimes the foreign businesses change their minds; they lose confidence in their investments. For example, a certain city approved the setting up of 85 FFEs, but the actual start-up rate was only 17 percent, and only 6 actually put any effort into construction and installation; the rest are still in a semi-suspended state. 2. The contracts count on substantial foreign capital while little is actually available. Today many localities treat their contracted amount of foreign capital as their "precious babies." They brag about them whenever they have a chance. Some even treat them as a great accomplishment and put them in their reports. Little do they know that the success rate of utilizing the contracted foreign capital is actually very low, and sometimes no money will come through at all. For example, in 1990, a certain county signed a contract worth $30 million with a foreign business. Today, only $150,000 have come through. This writer has learned that the foreign business has already cancelled the investment plan. The contracted amount of foreign capital at best only reflects a trend as we make contacts with the outside world. Today most foreign businesses make their investments in the form of equipment purchases on behalf of the Chinese side. The FFEs rarely make direct use of foreign capital. For example, a certain city has been listed as an open city by the State Council back in 1987. Up to the end of November of this year, it had $85 million in foreign capital available on contract, but only $6.4 million have come through so far, and 80 percent of that investment were in the form of equipment purchased by foreign businesses on behalf of the Chinese side. 3. There is ample designed, but little actual, productive capacity. Today's FFEs generally have limited productive capacity. Their output value is usually only around 20 percent of their designed capacity. Most operate only intermittently or are in a trial production stage and cannot engage in batch production. Some cannot begin production because they have brought in substandard equipment. For example, the FFEs in a certain township have a total investment of $350 million. At a 1:2 input-output ratio, their output value should reach $700 million, and even at a 1:1 ratio, they should be able to produce $350 million's worth of goods. But today, their output value is only a little over $50 million. Looking at the 14 enterprises already in operation, all but two are operating at below capacity; some are in a state of "shock." Their profitability is unpredictable: Only one is making a profit, and the rest are barely breaking even. 4. There are too many low-to-intermediate grade projects and too few advanced, delicate, state-of-the-art projects. Looking at the types of projects undertaken by the FFEs, most are light industrial and textile projects or labor-intensive type projects. There are few mechanical, electronic, or delicate chemical industry-type projects, and most of their products are in short supply. For example, up to the end of November of this year, a certain county has set up 15 departments, and the towns and townships have also set up 21 departments, in the FFEs, and there are more than 100 projects of all types, but not one is a technology-intensive, state-of-the-art project. 5. A lot of foreign equipment are being brought in but there are few advanced equipment to help make them work. The success rate of most equipment brought into this country by foreign businesses on our behalf is low; most do not meet contract specifications. Sometimes the parts do not fit--we either have "a horse pulling a wheelbarrow" or "a pony pulling a big trailer," and therefore enterprises cannot go into operation on time. Sometimes the equipment is obsolete, with standards dating back to the 1950's and 1960's by Chinese standards or even the 1940's and 1950's compared to international standards. Some are just "scrap metal" welded together; some are not designed for use around here because of our production methods and therefore cannot function properly. For example, a certain enterprise spent $800,000 and asked a foreign business concern to bring in a set of equipment from somewhere, but according to the Commodities Inspection Administration the equipment had standards dated back to the 1940's. It had no automatic or safety features; it did not even have transmission and required a manually installed gear box. It was appraised to be worth $100,000 at the most. 6. Most enterprises still use the old set of management methods and few have adopted the latest management techniques. Today most FFEs are directly managed by the Chinese side, and even though a handful of them have foreign representatives taking part in management, they are mainly for the purpose of supervising us and tend to overlook, either intentionally or unintentionally, the importance of studying and bringing in foreign advanced management techniques. Most enterprises still continue to use the old piece-work pay system and have not learned the kinds of approach that show concern and care for the staff and workers or try to improve workers' benefit and welfare; but when it comes to other people's seldom-applied method of deducting wages and penalizing and firing workers, we not only have learned but are quick to apply those rules. The above six conditions have serious consequences and are dangerous. They waste resources, render a lot of funds in disuse, dampen the foreign investors' enthusiasm, and undermine the confidence of some units and leaders in doing a good job with the FFEs, and meanwhile, some bad companies have become heavy burdens to the local economies. The main reason for all these lies in our guiding ideology that is too impatient for quick success and produces haphazard--calling every feathered object a duck--behavior. When it comes to selecting equipment, we blindly trust the middlemen, which has resulted in failures in our import endeavors. In utilizing enterprise personnel, we lack a scientific attitude, which has resulted in errors in the enterprise construction and operation processes. With respect to fund utilization, we fail to follow through to the end, so that after a project is started, it often runs into difficulties. Thus, in the future, when we develop FFEs, we should insist on a development route that emphasize both intensive and extensive reproduction. We must revolve around the "three rates and one increase" (raising the foreign capital realization rate, the business start-up rate, and the production completion rate, and increase the total use of foreign capital); we must concentrate on what is important, provide different guidance under different conditions, seize the critical points, and push the FFEs' development onto a higher plane.
