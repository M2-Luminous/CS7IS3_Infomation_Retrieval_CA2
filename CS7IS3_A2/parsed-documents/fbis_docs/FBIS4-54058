Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made the remarks at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. "The cabinet should resign en masse so that an administration can be established that has a more stable foundation and has the confidence of the people needed to solve important problems existing both inside and outside Japan," Murayama said. But he said the resignation should be put off pending passage in the Diet of the fiscal 1994 national budget bill and other related bills. Murayama said that following resignation of the cabinet or after a snap general election, "the SDP would be prepared to sit at the table and make earnest efforts to form the new government." He denied reports of a division of opinion between himself and SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, who recently suggested the prospect of a coalition between the SDP and its former archrival, the LDP, now the largest opposition party. "The SDP's policy direction is that we would not form a coalition with the LDP in the form it has taken over the last 38 years," Murayama said. By the same turn, he said, "the LDP must change significantly or else it will be unable to elicit the trust of the people." Murayama also said the SDP and other parties must similarly change and consider that the best framework should be for formation of a coalition government. He said the SDP is prepared to cooperate with many LDP members who say they value protection of the Constitution and democracy, and who make efforts to prevent corruption. The present coalition is mainly formed by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Japan New Party. The SDP, which was the largest party in the previous cabinet led by Morihiro Hosokawa, quit the coalition late last month in protest against the abrupt formation of a large parliamentary group excluding it.
