A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the South Korean Government deeply regrets that the U.S. Government revives the Super 301 provision through administrative means, at a time when the Uruguay Round of talks is almost bringing about a worldwide free trade system after seven years of negotiations. U.S. President Bill Clinton reinstated Thursday [3 March] the lapsed trade measure that gives Washington the right to impose sanctions if a trading nation with the U.S. fails to meet the U.S. demand on greater market access. South Korea always considers that international trade disputes should not be solved by the domestic law of one country, but through the process decided by the World Trade Organization. The 301 provision was first made in 1974 to impose sanctions on the countries that had unfair trade practice with the U.S. In 1988, the U.S. Government created the Super 301 provision, which strengthened and quickened the imposition process of such sanctions. The U.S. decided to revive Super 301 after U.S.-Japan trade talks broke down.
