The problem lies in Washington's strict demand and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] asking Pyongyang to open the two facilities suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons. The future of the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks depends on the DPRK leaders' attitude toward this problem. Issues related to normalizing the two countries relations should be discussed in the talks. Considering all the facts, it is of most concern that Pyongyang positively resolve the issue for economic reasons. Judging from the result of the past two rounds of talks, the DPRK seems to be well prepared for IAEA inspections of all nuclear facilities. In the talks with the IAEA held in Vienna concerning the dispute of the details of inspections, it was agreed that two important facilities in the DPRK territory would not be taken into account [kaman haji anta]. According to data in possession [kajigo innun charyo], weapon [word indistinct] needed for nuclear warheads could be produced at these facilities. It is worrisome [pulan hada] how Pyongyang will answer Washington and the IAEA. It is clear that the situation in the region would be aggravated if DPRK does not change its attitude on the nuclear issue. This is because Washington, Tokyo, and some other countries insist that a series of sanctions be imposed on the DPRK. They could also bomb [pokkyok halsudo itta] the nuclear facilities in the DPRK. On the other hand, other countries oppose such hard-line measures. Russia insists on the early resolution of the nuclear weapons issue on the Korean peninsula, constructive dialogue between parties concerned, and effective cooperation between the DPRK and the IAEA.
