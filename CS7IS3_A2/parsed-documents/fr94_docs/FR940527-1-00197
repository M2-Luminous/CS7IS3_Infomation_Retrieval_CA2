FR940527-1-00197 FR940527-1-00014 As we explain in Appendix B, we were not able to determine a hospital-specific rate for 24 of the 5,248 hospitals in our data base. Consequently, the payment methodology distribution is based on 5,224 hospitals. This data should be fully representative of the payment methodologies that will be applicable to hospitals. The cross-sectional distribution of hospital by payment methodology is presented by: (1) geographic location, (2) region, and (3) payment classification. This provides an indication of the percentage of hospitals within a particular hospital grouping that will be paid under the fully prospective payment methodology and under the hold-harmless methodology. Table V indicates that 58.3 percent of hospitals are paid under the fully prospective payment methodology. (This figure, unlike the figure of 64 percent for low cost capital hospitals in the previous section, takes account of the effects of redeterminations. In other words, this figure does not include low cost hospitals that, following a hospital-specific rate redetermination, are now paid under the hold-harmless methodology.) As expected, a relatively higher percentage of rural and governmental hospitals (69.9 percent and 73.3 percent, respectively) are being paid under the fully prospective methodology. This is a reflection of their lower than average capital costs per case. In contrast, only 30 percent of proprietary hospitals are being paid under the fully prospective methodology. This is a reflection of their higher than average capital costs per case. (We found at the time of the August 30, 1991 final rule (56 FR 43430) that 62.7 percent of proprietary hospitals had a capital cost per case above the national average cost per case.) D. Cross-Sectional Analysis of Changes in Aggregate Payments We used our FY 1995 actuarial model to estimate the potential impact of our proposed changes for FY 1995 on total capital payments per case, using a universe of 5,224 hospitals. The individual hospital payment parameters are taken from the best available data, including: the January 1, 1994 update to the Provider-Specific file, cost report data, and audit information supplied by intermediaries. Table VI presents a comparison of payments per case for FY 1994 and FY 1995. It also presents the portion of total percentage change in payments that can be attributed to Federal rate changes alone. Federal rate changes include the 6.47 percent decrease in the Federal rate, a 1.5 percent increase in case mix, changes in the adjustments to the Federal rate (for example, the effect of the new hospital wage index on the geographic adjustment factor), and reclassifications by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board. The residual increase over the change attributable to the Federal rate changes can be attributed to the effects of transition changes, which include: the change from 30 percent to 40 percent in the portion of the Federal rate for fully prospective hospitals, the hospital-specific rate update, changes in the proportion of new to total capital for hold-harmless hospitals, changes in old capital (for example, obligated capital put in use), hospital-specific rate redeterminations, and exceptions. The comparisons are provided by: (1) geographic location and (2) payment classification and payment region. The simulation results show that, on average, payments per case can be expected to increase 2.2 percent in FY 1995. The results show that the effect of the Federal rate changes alone is to decrease payments by 1.3 percent. However, the decrease attributable to the Federal rate changes is more than offset by a 3.5 percent increase attributable to the effects of transition changes and budget neutrality. Our comparison by geographic location shows that urban and rural hospitals experience similar rates of increase (2.2 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively). Urban hospitals will lose slightly less than rural hospitals (^1.3 percent compared to ^1.6 percent) from the Federal rate changes. Urban hospitals will also gain slightly less than rural hospitals (3.5 percent compared to 3.9 percent) from the effects of transition changes. By region, rural hospitals of the New England region have the highest rate of increase (12.3 percent, of which ^1.9 percent is due to Federal rate changes and 14.2 percent to the effects of transition changes). Puerto Rico hospitals fare worst: these hospitals will experience a 2.5 percent decline in payments, of which ^3.4 percent is attributable to Federal rate changes and 0.9 percent to the effects of transition changes. By type of ownership, government hospitals are projected to have the highest rate of increase (3.3 percent, of which ^1.5 percent is due to Federal rate changes and 4.8 percent to the effects of transition changes). Payments to proprietary hospitals will decrease 0.2 percent (^1.2 percent due to the Federal rate changes and 1.0 percent attributable to the effects of transition changes) and payments to voluntary hospitals will increase 2.5 percent (^1.3 percent due to Federal rate changes and 3.8 percent to the effects of transition changes). Section 1886(d)(10) of the Act established the Medicare Geographic Review Board (MGCRB). Hospitals may apply for reclassification for the purpose of the wage index, standardized payment amount, or both. Although there is no difference with respect to the Federal capital rate, a hospital's geographic classification for purposes of the operating standardized amount does affect a hospital's capital payments as a result of the large urban adjustment factor and the disproportionate share adjustment for urban hospitals with 100 or more beds. Reclassification for wage index purposes affects the geographic adjustment factor since that factor is constructed from the hospital wage index. To present the effects of the hospitals being reclassified for FY 1995 compared to the FY 1994 effects of reclassification, we show the average payment percentage increase for hospitals reclassified in each fiscal year and in total. For FY 1995 reclassifications, we are indicating those hospitals reclassified for standardized amount purposes only, for wage index purposes only, and for both purposes. The reclassified groups are compared to all other nonreclassified hospitals. These categories are further identified by urban and rural designation. Hospitals reclassified during FY 1995 as a whole are projected to experience a 2.3 percent increase in payments (^1.0 attributable to Federal rate changes and 3.3 percent attributable to the effects of transition changes). Nonreclassified hospitals will gain slightly less (2.2 percent) than reclassified hospitals (2.3 percent) overall. While nonreclassified hospitals will lose slightly more (^1.4 percent compared to ^1.0 percent) than reclassified hospitals from the Federal rate changes, they will gain more (3.6 percent to 3.3 percent) from the effects of transition changes.
