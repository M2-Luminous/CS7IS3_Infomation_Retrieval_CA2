They are now slated for 6 and 20 February. A government communique stated that this decision was made as a result of the "delays observed in carrying out some material tasks, mainly the personalization and distribution of voters' cards." The government also stated that "it took into account French and German electoral experts' views." The text of the communique stressed that this postponement illustrates the "concern" of the head of state, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, and Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh "to help these elections take place under better conditions." This revision of the electoral timetable is in response, observers note, to the wishes of the moderate opposition, who were of the view that the initially fixed dates of 23 January and 6 February would be "technically" impossible to meet, as they would jeopardize the validity of the poll.
