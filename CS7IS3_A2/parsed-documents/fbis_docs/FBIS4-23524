More than 30 members of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, the AWB, which boycotted the April elections, were picked up in connection with the wave of bombings in the last days of the campaign. On the line to Johannesburg, Timothy Ecott asked AWB spokesman Fred Rundle how he reacted to the setting up of the Truth Commission: [Begin recording] [Rundle] Well, that's what they perceive to be abuse. You mustn't forget that Mr. Dullah Omar is a communist, a member of the Communist Party. You must also remember my people will never bow down before any man. They will only bow in front of God. [Ecott] But Mr. Omar is the justice minister and it seems like an attempt by the government to get to the bottom of who may or may not be guilty of human rights abuse in the past and in the present. [Rundle] We offered them our hand in an attempt to bring about peace. We said to them: give amnesty to all right wingers awaiting trial, the same as the De Klerk did to their people and those that have been convicted, and we will suspend our struggle while we are negotiating for a volkstaat [homeland]. He has rejected this by his cut off date in December. We believe, as I say here, no government can blame the flame of freedom burning in the hearts of our people. No government can build enough jails to lock up an entire nation. We will get our volkstaat no matter what the cost. We go on and we also say: what they have now done by their proposed amnesty legislation is to create a huge powder keg which begs to be ignited by all and sundry opposing the authoritarian and antiwhite method of government.
