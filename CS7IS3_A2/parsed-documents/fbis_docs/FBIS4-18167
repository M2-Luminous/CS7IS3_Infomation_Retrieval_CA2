Many Social Democrats have recently visited the United States, including Willy Bergstrom, Mona Sahlin, Allan Larsson, Par Nuder.[.sup]1[/] Anders Sundstrom will also try to squeeze in a trip to the United States before September. He is a local councillor in Pitea and the party's spokesman on economic policy. In a new Social Democratic government he will probably be the economic affairs minister. Anders Sundstrom wants greater centralization and planning in the style of Bill Clinton -- but with a few homespun ideas from Pitea. His plan for economic policy includes sectoral planning, control over research, a technical and scientific council, and an investment bank. [Sundstrom] I do not think it was very clever to close down the National Investment Bank. Ericsson's CEO Lars Ramqvist has reported that the success of the mobile telephone market was due to cofinancing with the Investment Bank. I am not promising to introduce a new investment bank -- we would need money to do that. However, I thought it operated well. I have looked at how it used to work and I am impressed. [von Platen] How important is it for a Social Democratic government to gain the confidence of the markets and major companies so that investments are made in Sweden? [Sundstrom] I believe it will be hard for us to get the bosses of major companies to say that a Social Democratic government is better than a government supported by the Swedish Employers' Confederation. However, I do not believe that anyone will leave Sweden merely because of our rise to power. Companies have not had a great time of it under the right-wing government. [von Platen] Are there limits to what a Social Democratic government can do? [Sundstrom] The main constraint for the state is its economic room for maneuver. We cannot present any proposals that would increase the budget deficit. [von Platen] Why do you consider Swedish membership of the EU [European Union] to be so important? [Sundstrom] Sweden will never be attractive to investors if it remains outside of Europe. [von Platen] What kind of emergency plan have the Social Democrats made if the people say no to EU membership in the referendum? [Sundstrom] The Social Democrats have no ready-made plan of what to do if we do not become members. [von Platen] What have you learned from the financial crisis? [Sundstrom] That inflationary economies lead investors astray. [Sundstrom ends] His economic policy looks something like this. Its objectives are: to make it easier for small companies to get their hands on capital; to investigate the banks' high profit margins; to establish aid for small companies in the private sector that are facing competition; to allow the state and companies to finance several projects jointly. [Sundstrom continues] As economics minister I shall ensure that small companies can make the most of their competitiveness on the capital market. Small companies in Pitea know that they are obliged to use their bank in Pitea. That is not how things should be. I believe that there is weak competition on the banking market. Specialized banks will be set up. Information on them will be available in data bases. It is wrong that small companies should have to pay interest rates between 4 and 5 percent higher than large companies -- despite the fact that small companies are highly solvent. Nowadays, subsidies for enterprise are rather too general. For example, if a hairdresser gets a subsidy to open up his own salon and then drives someone else out of business, then we have not achieved very much. Small companies faced with competition at international level must be given help to grow. A great deal of support is being given to companies, but it is being managed by the wrong people and flowing through the wrong channels. Several hundred million kronor are being lost on the way. For instance, the aid awarded to inventors at national level is less than that awarded by Vasterbotten alone. Cofinanced projects are totally lacking in Sweden. The state must support new companies, helping them to develop new production capacities. However, the state must not take a share unless it does so via guarantees and loans, just as in the United States. I will increase export subsidies for small companies. Today, export credit guarantees work well for large companies, but not so well for the smaller ones. The Social Democratic Party will become more active and develop sectoral programs for areas in which Sweden has unique growth opportunities, both in terms of resources and the climate of innovation. For instance, some German states have sectoral programs to supply venture capital. We have already indicated that in view of its significance for the balance on our current account, forests and the lumber industry comprise a priority branch. As economic minister, I will strengthen Nutek, the industrial authority. There must be a central authority for research and development. Today, there are too many state authorities without any semblance of unity. For instance, it is wrong to take the workers' funds in several independent foundations for research purposes. The shares in Atle and Bure should be in one hand. Aid awarded under the terms of economic policy aid is split. There is no strong single authority. I will facilitate access to venture capital for innovations before they are marketed, and I shall allocate more funds to industrial research. Other countries have resources to develop their inventions. Take Japan. We are net exporters of inventions. Sweden ranks last, together with Turkey and Greece, as far as support for industrial research is concerned. The present government has vacillated, cutting grants for technical attaches. However, we need scouts throughout the world looking out for new inventions. I intend to make universities into centers where ideas can be commercialized. Someone, for example the prime minister himself or someone close to him, will be responsible for resources earmarked for training. Today, these funds are distributed by various departments. Growth-related issues will be grouped together. I have my eye on the United States. President Clinton presides over a technical and scientific council that has the same status as the National Security Council or defense council. At present, training is only being done by major companies. I want to stimulate small companies into offering training, too. This will be based on the same principle as the occupational funds. [von Platen] Which country has the best policy for supporting small companies? [Sundstrom] Germany and northern Italy have developed very well. What fascinates me there is the entrepreneurial spirit. Over there it is a good thing to be an entrepreneur. Here in the town, the inhabitants of Pitea are proud of entrepreneurs. It is important that we, as leaders, call attention to them and say that they are important for our nation and municipality. [Sandtrom ends] Pitea District Councillor Anders Sundstrom is one of the Social Democrats' future stars and one of the candidates most certain to receive a post in the new government. However, he will not enter parliament in the fall, even if the party wins the election. He is not on any list in the parliamentary election. He himself explains this by saying that he prefers to stay home with his sons, who are 10 and 13 years old. However, it is also well known that he is not very popular among all Social Democrats in the north. He is not a candidate on the Norrbotten parliamentary list because Boden threatened to set up its own parliamentary list -- without Anders Sundstrom, because the people living there do not like him. In a compromise between Boden and Lulea, he decided that the new hospital should be located between the two towns. It turned out to cost 100 million kronor more than it would have cost to rebuild the old hospital in Boden. In the course of that conflict he lost some popularity. Anders Sundstrom comes from the small town of Sikras in the district of Kalix. His father's father was a fisherman, farmer, and longshoreman. He founded the transport department and the first Social Democratic association in the district. Sundstrom's father was an electrician who worked for the customs authority and then became a teacher at the vocational school in Pitea. Judgements of Anders Sundstrom vary. He is Ingvar Carlsson's favorite, but weak and sensitive; he is clever, and has created a whole new economic climate in Pitea; he is no visionary, he is fairer than the other Social Democrats, and can take critcism; he has done his homework and asks smart questions in the committees on which he sits. However, when I asked the taxi drivers what Anders Sundstrom is doing for them as self-employed people -- Sundstrom has been voted the most popular district councillor in the business world -- I received only negative answers. The taxi drivers are furious with him: In a public call for tenders to run transportation services for old-age pensioners the "wrong" company won out. One of the owners of the winning taxi company sits alongside Sundstrom in the social committee's working group. Anders Sundstrom became a district councillor in Pitea at age 27 -- Sweden's youngest ever. Now he is 42 years old and still in the same post. He is a member of some 10 boards of directors, including in Alvsbyhus (Sweden's most progressive housing company), in the NAB (technical consultants), and PITEATIDNINGEN (the town's only -- and Social Democratic -- newspaper). Until the change in government, he was also a board member of Doman, LKAB, and Vattenfall. In addition, he is a member of the party's executive committee, and the Social Democratic leader in the Norrbotten district. Footnote 1. Willy Bergstrom is head of the Trade Union Confederation's Institute for Economic Research; Mona Sahlin is party secretary of the Social Democrats; Allan Larsson is a Social Democratic member of parliament; Par Nuder is the economic researcher in the Social Democratic Riksdag group.
