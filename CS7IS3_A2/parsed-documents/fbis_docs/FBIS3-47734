"The operation is aimed at maintaining security in the area and to anticipate the possible visits of Cambodian and Vietnamese boat people who are often found visiting the islands," Indonesian West Fleet Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Sunarto Wibow told AFP by telephone. "Although we do not receive any more reports on piracy in the past 12 months we have to stay alert," he said, adding the operation would end in February. Sunarto said the "Natuna Jaya Operation" involved three frigates and a supporting tanker ship.
