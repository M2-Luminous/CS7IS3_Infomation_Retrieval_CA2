He was received at Prague Castle by President Vaclav Havel. The two statesmen then briefed journalists in detail about their hour-long conversation. Our correspondent David Stahlavsky, who was there, reports: [Stahlavsky] President Vaclav Havel welcomed the possibility to have talks, albeit brief ones, with the chairman of the State Council of this Transcaucasian country. Apart from bilateral Czech-Georgian relations, they also discussed the situation in Georgia itself, which is being troubled by a civil war and wars among various ethnic groups, and about the situation in Russia and in the Euro-Asian region. [passage omitted] Vaclav Havel stressed: [Begin Havel recording] We have promised that, as a nonpermanent member of the Security Council, we would support such resolutions that will promote peace in Georgia and in the entire region and the special development of Georgia as an independent state. [end recording] [Stahlavsky] In this regard, Eduard Shevardnadze admitted that he considered it necessary to explain to the president of the Czech Republic, which is a nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council, Georgia's attitude toward the conflict in Abkhazia and to ask for support for a just solution to the conflict that is now coming to a head. After the talks between Havel and Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader noted that full understanding has been achieved. The chairman of the State Council of Georgia also noted that, without the decisive participation of Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council and the great neighbor of Georgia, peace in his country and in Abkhazia will not be achieved. Shevardnadze and Yeltsin [as heard], however, have found mutual understanding on the question of the Abkhazian conflict. It was for these reasons that Georgia joined the CIS in October 1993. [passage indistinct] The reasons were, as the highest Georgian representative said, the close economic relations with Russia, without which independent Georgia cannot exist. [passage omitted]
