In addition, the 1994 Job Creation Act is to stimulate the labor market, and farmers' wives are to be provided with a social insurance program of their own. The labor minister's most important objective, however, is to have a nursing insurance law passed during the current legislative session. Bluem's draft calls for a new social nursing insurance which initially provides for outpatient nursing services and, as of 1996, financial support for home care as well. Initially, the new nursing insurance will be paid for with a 1-percent payroll tax up to the assessment limits on health insurance, and that tax will be raised to 1.7 percent once the second phase of the program commences. The program would spell relief for the health insurance program, for the government in its expenditures for the care of war victims, and local governments and the laender in their social welfare budgets. The government coalition and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) agree that industry should not be additionally burdened with the contributions for the new nursing care program. Which is why a way is being sought to make the working population pay for the program in its entirety. To make up for employer contributions, the SPD whose support is required in the Bundesrat would like to have Whitsun Monday declared a workday and to shift the Day of Prayer and Repentance from Wednesday to Friday. For its part, the coalition is calling for lower holiday pay which may be compensated for by relinquishing leave time, by additional work or by transforming one holiday during the first phase and a second one during the second phase at the land level. The SPD is opposed to this on the grounds that it represents interference in the right to free collective bargaining guaranteed by the constitution. On 24 February the joint Bundestag-Bundesrat conference committee will try to work out a compromise once more. If it does not succeed, the nursing care project will not come up for a vote during this legislative session. There is lively speculation in Bonn whether Bluem will continue in his post in that case. The 1994 Job Creation Act is part of the action program for economic growth and jobs which the coalition hopes will provide a new stimulus to the labor market in the face of 4 million unemployed and the upcoming elections. Since there is no money in the Bonn treasury for job programs costing billions, the primary focus of the planned measures is on bringing about improvement by licensing private employment agencies, on paying for more job programs with existing funds by lowering wages on the secondary labor market and on increasing the incentive for Job Creation Program employees to look for jobs on the primary labor market. The Labor Ministry has merely provided help in drafting these programs. The political authorship does not rest with Bluem but is claimed by the experts on economics and job market issues of the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] and FDP [Free Democratic Party] parliamentary caucuses. Th new legislation dealing with working hours is designed to replace regulations on working hours established in 1938. Bluem views those regulations as providing for maximum limits on working hours and minimum standards for health and safety. It will be up to business and labor to agree on actual working hours within the limits of the law. Bluem and Guenter Rexrodt (FDP), the economics minister, have long been at odds on what to do about work on Sundays. The draft legislation continues to call for a ban on work on Sundays and holidays but also for a number of exceptions, among other things in the interest of job security. According to Bluem's timetable, final deliberations by the Bundesrat on the new legislation on working hours are to take place on 18 March. Bluem wants the Bundesrat to give its approval to the new omnibus industrial health and safety bill on 20 May. This law is designed to improve health and safety standards at the factory level and to summarize and clarify the numerous existing regulations. For the first time ever, the health and safety bill establishes basic, uniform rules on workplace health and safety standards to be followed by employers and employees in all job groups and activities, including public services. The obsolete trading regulations governing health and safety in the workplace will thus be replaced by a basic health and safety law which conforms to EC standards. Bluem's draft also includes the regulations contained in the existing health and safety law concerning medical advice for employees by factory physicians and experts for workplace safety. The existing health and safety can therefore be revoked. The centerpiece of the agricultural social reform measures which Bluem has prepared in collaboration with Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert (CDU) is a social welfare program for farmers' wives. They are designated as entrepreneurs in the old-age insurance program for farmers. Farmers' wives active prior to the introduction of the reform measures will be able to vote for or against inclusion in a social welfare program of their own. In the political debate vehement criticism was voiced about the fact that farmers' wives will receive taxpayer-funded pensions of their own without contributing to the retirement scheme themselves. Bluem hopes that the agricultural social reform bill which also calls for new rules on contributions will pass the Bundesrat on 29 April.
