This much is clear from the start of confidential negotiations between Moscow and Kiev on the transfer to Russia of 42 Tu-95 MS's and Tu-160 strategic bombers that Ukraine inherited from the USSR. The fact that the talks are under way was yesterday confirmed by an informed source in the Russian Defense Ministry. Unlike Minsk and Alma-Ata [Almaty], however, which voluntarily ceded to Moscow all of their strategic weapons, Kiev intends not only to get rid of unwanted and costly to maintain toys, but also to get something in exchange. Out of Ukraine's 42 strategic bombers, 19 are top-of-the-line Tu-160's (the aircraft was developed in 1975 as a counterbalance to the U.S. B-1B; it is inferior in combat load but superior in speed). The estimated cost of the Tu-160 is $250 million. The remaining 23 aircraft are Tu-95 MS's, second-generation strategic bombers. At present Ukraine's heavy aviation is located at air bases in Priluki, Uzin, and Ukrainsk. The first reports about Ukraine's intention to sell these aircraft to Russia appeared in the Kiev press at the end of March. Among the first to raise this issue was the republic's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, who proposed to sell the Tu-95 MS's and Tu-160's, "but not for money." He backed up his statement by the fact that "Ukraine's air space is too cramped for this class of aircraft." However, the explanation for the "generosity" of Mr. Radetskyy, who for more than two years has been reluctant to part with heavy aviation in spite of the cramped air space, is trivial. In the context of an energy crisis the average annual flying time in the Ukrainian Air Force does not exceed 35 to 40 hours. Meanwhile analogous figures in the U.S., FRG, and Dutch Air Forces are 160-180 hours, and in the USSR they were between 130 and 150 hours. Ukrainian Air Force simulators, on the other hand, do not give the pilots the full sensation of flight. The reason for Kiev's "submission" is the defection of complete combat crews to Russia and the impossibility of maintaining the Tu's in combat readiness. The wish to obtain in exchange "components for front and army aircraft and also fuel," however, as expressed by Mr. Radetskyy, will hardly meet with Moscow's understanding. Just like an alternative proposal to exchange the bombers for Tu-134 and Tu- 154 civil aircraft in a 1:3 proportion. As a source in the Russian Defense Ministry told KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent, Moscow views as the most acceptable "settlement" option the use of the heavy aircraft to cover Kiev's indebtedness on natural gas supplies. Because the talks began only two or three days ago, however, it is too soon to talk about any variant of a deal on strategic aviation. As for the "gas" option, Gazprom has not yet given its consent. Indeed, why would it want strategic bombers? Kiev's aspiration to relieve itself of an unbearable burden is understandable. What is not is why Moscow has engaged in this strange horse trading. After all, the redeployment of Tu-95's and Tu-160's to Russia will call for their subsequent conversion as "non-nuclear" (so that the START II provisions on strategic aviation are observed), which will demand substantial expenses not envisioned in the budget. It would be easy to invite Kiev, "in a brotherly manner," simply to give the planes away for free. Even so, the Russian Defense Ministry has made it clear that so far they are not going to pay for this hardware. Actually, there is nothing to pay with. The Strategic Component of the Russian and U.S. Air Forces Russia (CIS): 52 Tu-95 K aircraft. Capable of carrying up to eight cruise missiles to a distance of up to 12,800 km. 63 Tu-95 MS aircraft. Capable of carrying up to 16 cruise missiles to a distance of up to 18,000 km. Before February 1994, 40 aircraft of this class were located on the territory of Kazakhstan and 23 are still based in Ukraine. 23 to 25 Tu-160 aircraft (exact number unknown). Capable of carrying 12 cruise missiles to a distance of up to 11,000 km; 19 aircraft of this class are based in Priluki. The last such aircraft was manufactured by the Kazan aircraft plant in August 1992. The United States: 95 B-52H Stratofortress aircraft. Capable of carrying up to 20 cruise missiles to a distance of up to 16,000 km. 95 B-1B Lancer aircraft. Capable of carrying up to 16 dumb [svobodnopadayushchiye] bombs to a distance of up to 19,800 km. 20 B-2 Northrop ("Stealth") aircraft. Capable of carrying between eight and 16 cruise missiles to a distance of up to 11,000 km. The first five aircraft of this class were to be adopted by the U.S. Air Force for service in December 1993.
