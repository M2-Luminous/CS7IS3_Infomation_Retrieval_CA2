Kyasova: "KBR Judicial Body Presents Results"] [Text] Last Friday the work results of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] People's Courts during the first half of 1993 were given at an extended meeting of the Ministry of Justice board and the KBR Supreme Court Presidium. The KBR Minister of Justice, A. M. Batyrbekov, who gave a detailed report, noted the particular significance of the activity of the People's Courts under circumstances in which crime issues in the republic are becoming more complex. During the period in question, 7,681 crimes were committed, a significant portion of which were classified as grave offenses. The number of infractions related to narcotic substances increased by 63 percent. Persons convicted of crimes involving the use of firearms and ammunition totaled 132, while convictions for personal property theft grew by 12 percent. Also, 221 juveniles were brought to trial for various illegal acts. These statistics are more than just disconcerting, radical and decisive actions on the part of all law-upholding bodies are needed in order to turn the situation around and stop the rise in crime. How ready are our courts for this? As was explained, there is no simple answer. While giving proper due to the positive results attained in judicial proceedings, the minister of justice noted that the professional training and legal competence of certain judiciaries was cause for doubt. As a consequence there are delays, and dangerous criminals are released without consideration being given to the graveness of the crimes they have committed. A. M Batyrbekov directed the attention of those gathered to shortcomings in the work of the marshalls of the court, and noted the necessity of increasing efforts in the area of legal education. The deputy chairman of the KBR Supreme Court and chairman of the Board for Criminal Proceedings, A. S. Gelyakhov spoke on an analysis of criminal cases based on data from appellate courts and courts with supervisory authority. In his opinion, the Mayskiy People's Court was deserving of the most praise, as it had not even had one judgement reversed; a statement that could not be made about the Nalchik Municipal Court (presided over by V. Vybornov), the rulings of which were cited as "least stable." In the opinion of A. S. Gelyakhov, cases in which citizens are wrongfully convicted, and equally, those in which the guilty are acquitted, do not further judiciaries' authority, but give rise to justified social protest. The acting KBR Supreme Court chairman, Georgiy Alekseyevich Mamilov paused to discuss neglect in how civil cases are being reviewed. According to his information, virtually every third ruling on these types of cases was reversed in appellate proceedings. Viewing this kind of regard for one's work unacceptable, Mamilov spoke in favor of conducting a review and immediately releasing judiciaries noted for neglect. Chairmen of Municipal and Rayon People's Courts S. A. Klyuyeva (city of Prokhladnyy), V. T. Vybornov (city of Nalchik), I. Kh. Topalov (city of Zalukonoazhe), V. M. Khushtov (city of Terek), A. F. Khazhnagoyev (city of Baksan), and several others talked about problems in need of attention, as well as their own views on how to resolve them. The acting chief of the KBR MVD Investigation Directorate, Mukhamed Mussov answered a number of questions that arose during the exchange of opinions that took place, and pointed out the importance of close cooperation between judicial bodies, the militia, and the prosecutor's office. We are all responsible for one thing, stressed KBR Minister of Internal Affairs Kh. A. Shogenov. He called on judiciaries to approach those who break the law and infringe upon the lives, honor and dignity of other men with the utmost strictness. In spite of differences of opinion on how to conduct the fight against crime, KBR Prosecutor R. I. Abazov said, the strategic focus of both judicial and law-upholding bodies is one and the same: to protect the population from criminal acts against them. It is in acknowledging this truth that we must proceed. KBR Vice-President G. S. Gubin, having made a number of serious critical remarks directed at the the republic's courts, suggested the Minister of Justice demonstrate more consistency in selecting personnel and utilize the services of the qualifications commision more fully. In spite of the impartial tone of the discourse, the finale was marked with a pleasant announcement. Gratitude was expressed for the results of the courts' work in 1993 and a monetary bonus was awarded in the sum of 100 thousand rubles by order of the republic minister of justice to the following judiciaries: A. A. Makoyev, L. A. Shapkinaya, V. S. Khashkutovaya, M. I. Olmezov, I. K. Borokov, L. A. Lesnykh, Kh. V. Kudryavtsevaya, V. B. Dogov, L. M. Martynovaya, G. I. Gorislavskaya, I. Kh. Topolov, B. Kh.
