This is what he had to say during the return trip to Havana: "There could not be a Cuban foreign policy and Cuba would not have the voice and vote it has today if it were not thanks to the dedication we have seen in the fields, thanks to the dedication we saw at the biological factories, thanks to the efforts of so many men and women whom we do not have the privilege of personally knowing, and who do this 24 hours a day under conditions much more difficult and complex than those under which I travel the world." Regarding the results of his first year as head of the Foreign Ministry, Robaina said: "It has meant a significant change in my life, not so for the work. I believe the only reason we have to be pleased is that it seems that some people believe that we are doing what needs to be done. I am not comparing whether the work is better or worse than that done before me. I prefer to think that we do today what we do thanks to what was done before. My only interest is for the foreign policy conducted to reflect the times. I believe we have been doing so." Foreign journalists asked Robaina the trite question about his work style as head of the Foreign Ministry. "I insist that when I was given this responsibility I was not given conditions. They simply knew me when they appointed me. The mission I was given was to conduct the country's foreign policy following aspects of the work initiated with the youth dealing with our image abroad. I can say that no one has asked me to change my style. I was given a task and I have assumed it in the manner I think it should be assumed. I also think that style is part of the revolutionary training. I do not think it is just the fruit of an individual's private initiative. I think I have interpreted the revolution in this manner and I am trying to carry it out. ``Concerning contradictions and concerns about this mission, I think there were concerns when I was appointed foreign minister. Concerns and worries will always exist, and there will be favorable and unfavorable opinions about this mission. But I can honestly say that I do not worry about the number of people who might be in favor or against this mission. I do that which I am positively convinced is the best thing to do.''
