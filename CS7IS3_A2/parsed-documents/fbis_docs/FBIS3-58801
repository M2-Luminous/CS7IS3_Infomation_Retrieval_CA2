The two sides fixed this deadline at the first meeting of the EEA Mixed Committee in Brussels yesterday. The issues have to be resolved if the supplementary protocol is to be able to come into force by the beginning of July at the latest. Before it comes into force it has to be ratified by the parliaments of the EU countries and those of the five participating EFTA countries -- something that will take a few months. "If matters are not completed by then the supplementary protocol could be delayed until the beginning of next year -- something that we must avoid at all costs," said the EC Commission's Hans van der Pas, who is the chairman of the Mixed Committee in the first half of 1994. The supplementary protocol contains around 400 EU laws which have come into existence since the negotiations for the EEA agreement were completed. Around 10 questions remain unresolved, but both Van der Pas and the EFTA countries' representative on the Committee, Antti Sauli, believe that it will be possible to resolve them. Yesterday's meeting was devoted chiefly to organizational matters, but a first bone of contention regarding the interpretation of the EEA agreement has already surfaced. Norway and the EU Commission take different views as to whether the Norwegian state alcohol monopoly can be reconciled with the EEA agreement, and the Commission has asked EFTA's oversight body, the ESA [EFTA Surveillance Authority], to look into the matter. Norway wants to retain its wholesale monopoly, but the Commission wants it abolished. With Finland and Sweden the EU has reached agreement regarding their alcohol monopolies in their membership negotiations. The solution was that all monopolies apart from that in the retail sector will be abolished. The ESA is currently beginning its work by going through all legislation regarding the EEA agreement of the five EFTA countries participating in the EEA. This review of Finland's, Norway's, Iceland's, Sweden's, and Austria's legislation will cover laws on alcohol and other monopolies, and also the free movement of people, and the abolition of tax and other obstacles to trade. The ESA will also look at all state support paid out in the five countries. The work is expected to take several months.
