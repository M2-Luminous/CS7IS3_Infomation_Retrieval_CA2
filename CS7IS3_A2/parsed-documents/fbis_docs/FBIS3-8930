Churkin announced the meeting, to be held in the Russian embassy here, after talks Wednesday with officials from Krajina. The first task was to get them to sign a watertight ceasefire agreement to make sure there was no more fighting around Serb-controlled zones under United Nations protection, he said. Such an agreement already existed, but the two sides had for "emotional and political reasons" refused to sign it so far, Churkin said. "People cannot make that final step towards peace, they are so used to war that this final step is psychologically difficult." He told reporters that the announcement had been previously worked out with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman "so it did not come as a surprise to him." He said his talks with both sides had proved difficult as "mistrust is great on both sides." "There are certainly some on both sides who believe that the only way to go is by military means, which I happen to believe very strongly is a catastrophe," he said. [passage omitted]
