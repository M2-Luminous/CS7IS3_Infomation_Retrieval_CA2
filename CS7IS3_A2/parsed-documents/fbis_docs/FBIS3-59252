This is what the Parliament [European Parliament, EP] called for when it adopted the report by French Liberal Jean-Thomas Nordmann, who underlines in particular the importance of the European Union's participation in the Fund, a participation that should facilitate the coordinating role in the world environmental problems facing the Union. Finally, the EP wants the mention "token entry" which is currently indicated in the Community budget for the financing of the Fund to be replaced in future by appropriate amounts. The EP fears that the existence of the Fund itself is in jeopardy after the expiry in June 1994 of the temporary period of its operating. The EP has also adopted the report by Spanish Liberal Gudalupe Ruiz- Gimenez Aguilar on the follow-up by the European Union [EU] of the implementation of "Agenda 21" adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio, requesting in particular that the Commission and member states add to the ECU3 billion promised in Rio additional resources intended for the implementation of "Agenda 21." The Commission is also invited to include in all international trade agreements a clause on the protection of natural resources, and to propose to the Council a Green Paper on trade and the environment. As for member states, they must, according to the Parliament, establish in 1994 committees and national plans for sustainable development accompanied by mechanisms inherent in the formulation of indicators of sustainable development. During the common debate on the two reports, Mr. Nordmann, underlining the Environmental Fund's operating problems, invited the Community to play its coordinating role fully whereas according to him the World Bank should be limited to a role of technical support for projects. Mrs. Ruiz-Gimenez Aguilar insisted in particular on the implementation of conventions on biodiversity and the climatic change and underscored the need to have additional financial means to implement the "calendar 21" adopted at the Earth Summit. The European Union must abide by the commitments entered into at Rio, the MEP [member of European Parliament] said. European Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro shared the view of the MEPs about the need to provide renewed impetus to the implementation of the Rio decisions and believed that the 5th program on environmental matters constituted a strategic framework that should enable bolstering the Union's action in this area.
