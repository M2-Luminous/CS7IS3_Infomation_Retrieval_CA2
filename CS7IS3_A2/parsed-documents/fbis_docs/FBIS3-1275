"South Africa is entering into a period of political crisis never yet before experienced, and it is doing so with no effective ruling political party, and with Parliament being side-lined into irrelevancy," he said in a statement on Wednesday evening. "We are perhaps rapidly approaching a situation in which the Machiavellian dictum that `might is right' is going to dominate over the causes of political fair play and justice itself. "It is critically important that the social pathology in our abnormal society be arrested forthwith, and that the transitionary mechanisms and the transitionary processes launched by the World Trade Centre negotiations not be allowed to destroy this country in the name of the search for democracy and justice." The kwaZulu chief minister earlier on Wednesday said he was not aware of kwaZulu police hit-squads in Natal/kwaZulu, and described claims to this effect as "hideous propaganda". Addressing a press conference in Ulundi, he said he was surprised at the claim in a report submitted to the Transitional Executive Council on Tuesday. "If there have been hit squads, they have not been run by myself or set up at my suggestion. "I would like to have evidence of that because I think it is just hideous propaganda that is being mounted deliberately," Mr Buthelezi said. In his statement later on Wednesday, he said he would seek legal advice "on what recourse I have got through the courts to defend my intergrity and to clear my name". He was reacting to reports he had been personally implicated in violence. On Tuesday the TEC disclosed that a task group investigating hit squads in natal had said there appeared to be evidence linking killer groups to Mr Buthelezi's office. An interim report submitted by the task group accused staff in Mr Buthelezi's office of distributing automatic weapons to certain tribal chiefs. Disclosures about the hit squad prompted the TEC management committee to pass a resolution mandating it to take whatever steps necessary to ensure free and fair elections in Natal. It was suggested the kwaZulu Police be brought under the jurisdiction of the South African Police.
